on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

 

Criminal law -- Appeals -- Powers of court of
appeal --  Error of law -- Miscarriage of justice --  Curative proviso -- 
Whether trial judge erred in refusing to order mistrial where jury was provided
with transcripts containing submissions made in absence of jury -- Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 686(1) .

 








After a trial before a judge and jury, the accused was
convicted of the first degree murder of his wife.  During the course of its
deliberations, the jury requested transcripts of the pathologist’s testimony. 
Approximately six and a half hours after the transcripts were delivered to the
jury, defence counsel discovered that the copy of the transcript given to the
jury inadvertently contained the record of matters discussed in the absence of
the jury during a voir dire.  As such matters should have been expunged,
defence counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis that the proceedings had
become tainted and the trial was unfair.  The defence argued that the jury had
learned that the accused had made comments that were ruled inadmissible.  In
the defence’s view, the jury would speculate as to those comments and would
draw an adverse inference against the accused.  The trial judge denied the
request for a mistrial.  The offending transcripts were retrieved and the jury
was provided with clean copies.  The trial judge cautioned the jury that they
were to rely solely on the evidence that was put before them.  Once the jury
returned a guilty verdict of first degree murder, the trial judge requested
further submissions regarding the possibility of granting a mistrial.  After
submissions by both counsel, the trial judge again declined to declare a
mistrial.  The accused’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 

Per McLachlin C.J.
and L’Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Major, Binnie and Arbour JJ.:  The question
in this case is not whether the giving of the unedited transcripts to the jury
was a miscarriage of justice or a procedural irregularity, but whether the
trial judge made an error of law in refusing to declare a mistrial.

 








Apart from unreasonable verdict cases, most appeals
against conviction are based on errors of law within the meaning of
s. 686(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code .  In some cases, when
the court has concluded that the error alleged was at most an error of mixed
fact and law, it has characterized the issue as falling under s. 686(1) (a)(iii),
that is, a miscarriage of justice.  In such a case, further use of the proviso
in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) is obviously precluded and the appeal must be
allowed.  The appeal in this case is entirely governed by the provisions of
ss. 686(1) (a)(ii) and 686(1) (b)(iii).  There are essentially
two classes of errors that have led to a proper application of the curative
proviso: “harmless errors”, or errors of a minor nature having no impact on the
verdict; and serious errors that would justify a new trial but for the fact
that the evidence was so overwhelming that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice occurred despite the error.  In every case, if the reviewing court concludes
that the error led to a denial of a fair trial, the court may properly
characterize the matter as one where there was a miscarriage of justice, in
which case no remedial provision is available and the appeal must be allowed.

 








This case does not require an assessment of the
overall strength of the Crown’s case at trial.  When asked to declare a 
mistrial, the trial judge was essentially asked whether it was likely that the
exposure by the jury to the tainted transcripts could have affected the jury to
the point that the entire trial was compromised and that no remedy other than a
new trial was available.  Read in full, the offending passage in the
transcripts handed to the jury refers to several matters that were not in
evidence  when the argument took place in the absence of the jury.  A fair
assessment of the impact that the transcript could have had on the jury must be
made on the assumption that the jury read the transcript and understood that
counsel for the accused was concerned that the jury should not find out that
his client had made statements that the court had ruled inadmissible.  This is
how the trial judge approached the issue, and that is why she cautioned the
jury as she did.  She did not identify specifically the impugned passages, so
as not to aggravate the damage, if any, but she clearly instructed the jury to
disregard any references to matters that were not properly in evidence before
them.  The trial judge was obviously concerned with the effect and
consequences  of what had transpired and she took seriously the application for
a mistrial.  However, she made no error when she exercised her discretion to
deny the motion for a mistrial, nor did she err in declining to enter a
mistrial after the jury had returned its verdict.  The trial judge was in a
privileged position to assess the possible impact of the mishap on the jury,
and the effectiveness of the sharp warning that she issued.  There is no basis
upon which it could be said that she was wrong in that judgment call.  The
information before the jury was at most an innuendo.  Taking the case at its
highest from the accused’s point of view, the admonition issued by the trial
judge to the jury was sufficient to remedy any ill effect that the unedited
transcripts might have had on the jury.  As the trial judge did not err in
rejecting the motion for a mistrial, there is no need to turn to the proviso.

 








Per LeBel J.:  The
question before this Court is whether the conviction should be reversed because
either an “error of law” or a “miscarriage of justice” has occurred and, if so,
whether the curative proviso should be applied.  In order for a verdict to be
reversed under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Code, it is not
sufficient to demonstrate that a legal mistake has occurred.  The judgment must
have been based or possibly based on that mistake, so as to prejudice the
accused.  The other situations that may justify the intervention of a court of
appeal fall into a residual category.  Section 686(1)(a)(iii)
refers to miscarriages of justice, which cover irregularities other than the
errors of law mentioned in s. 686(1)(a)(ii) and which may have
rendered the trial unfair or created the appearance of unfairness for the
accused.  Although ss. 686(1)(a)(ii) and 686(1)(a)(iii) are
distinct, they are nevertheless closely related.  Both involve situations where
an irregularity has occurred during the course of the trial.  Whether the
defect at trial appears to have been an error of law or an irregularity falling
within the residual category of  miscarriage of justice, the circumstances must
be considered to see if the error was merely peripheral or could have played a
significant role in the legal validity of the verdict or rendered the trial
unfair, in reality or in appearance.  If the error of law could not have
prejudiced the accused, the conviction will be upheld.  Reaching a conclusion
in that respect will require a balancing taking into account the circumstances
of the case and, more particularly, the nature and impact of the error of law. 
In that regard, the analysis under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) may call upon
similar considerations as under s. 686(1)(a)(iii).

 








An irregularity can be said to constitute  a
miscarriage of justice when the irregularity was severe enough to render the
trial unfair or create the appearance of unfairness.  Contrary to the analysis
under the proviso, the emphasis is not so much on the final verdict and the
overall strength of the evidence against the accused, but rather on the gravity
of the irregularity and the effect it may have had on the fairness, or
appearance of fairness, of the trial.  The gravity of irregularities which may
occur must inevitably be evaluated by courts on a case‑by‑case
basis.  This being said, certain elements can provide reference points in
determining whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  First, one should
ask whether the irregularity pertained to a question that was central to the
case against the accused.  An irregularity that is related to a central point of
the case is more likely to be fatal than one concerning a mere peripheral
point.  Second, the court of appeal should consider the relative gravity of the
irregularity: how much influence it could have had on the verdict; the chances
that the apprehended detrimental effect of the irregularity did in fact occur;
and the likely severity of these detrimental effects on the accused’s case. 
When the court considers the gravity of the error, it should also consider the
possible cumulative effect of several irregularities during the trial.  Third,
one should be mindful of whether the trial was by jury or by a judge sitting
alone.  Sometimes, irregularities can have a more severe impact on the fairness
of the trial when they occur during a trial before a judge and a jury.  Fourth,
one should ask whether the irregularity may have been remedied, in full or in
part, at the trial.  Fifth, the effect of the irregularity on the fairness of
the trial and the appearance of fairness should be considered.  Sixth, the
attitude of defence counsel if and when he was confronted with the irregularity
may have an impact.  If defence counsel had an opportunity to object to the
irregularity and failed to do so, this militates in favour of finding that the
trial was not unfair.  

 

The second stage of the analysis is the applicability
of the curative proviso. In order to invoke s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
successfully, the Crown must demonstrate that any reasonable judge or jury
would have rendered the same verdict.  Even though an important error of law
could have influenced the decision, it would not be appropriate to reverse the
conviction when the evidence is so overwhelming against the accused that it
would inevitably lead to the same result.  Similarly, when the court of appeal
finds that the evidence against the accused would inevitably have led to the
same result, it can uphold a conviction despite having found that a procedural
irregularity not amounting to a miscarriage of justice had occurred. 
Regardless of whether the proviso is used to cure an error of law or a
procedural irregularity not amounting to a miscarriage of justice, it may be
used only when the conviction was inevitable.

 








The leak of the tainted transcript to the jury was
certainly an error or an irregularity.  This mistake does not seem to be in the
nature of an error of law.  The judge did not make a decision on a question of
law that was among the bases of a conviction.  The error was more akin to a
procedural irregularity that happened by accident.  Thus, as this case does not
seem to fall squarely within the error of law category, this becomes a matter
to be examined under the residual category of procedural irregularity.  The
irregularity did not amount to a miscarriage of justice.  First, it did not relate
to a point that was particularly central in law or in fact to the case against
the accused.  Second, the irregularity was not of significant importance.  The
fact that the trial was held before a judge and jury militates in favour of a
finding of unfairness.  However, all doubts concerning the unfairness or
appearance of unfairness of the trial are put to rest when the remedy chosen by
the judge when she realized that the tainted transcripts had been leaked to the
jury is considered.

 

Since no miscarriage of justice occurred, it is
unnecessary to examine whether the conviction could be saved under the curative
proviso.

I.  Introduction

 

1                                  
My colleague Justice LeBel has reviewed the relevant facts in his
reasons.  I only find it necessary to expand slightly on the facts surrounding
the central issue before us in this appeal.

 








2                                  
A few hours after the jury began its deliberations in this murder case,
it requested transcripts of proceedings to review the evidence of certain
witnesses. Neither counsel nor the trial judge realized at that time that the
transcripts in question had not been edited to delete submissions that had been
made in the absence of the jury.  The jury was in possession of these unedited
transcripts for approximately six and a half hours until defence counsel became
aware of the content of the transcripts and informed the court of the problem.

 

3                                  
The jury was provided with a total of approximately 350 pages containing
the evidence of four different witnesses.  In an early portion of the
transcripts, in the course of the direct examination of Dr. MacDonald, defence
counsel indicated that he had certain objections to make and that it should be
dealt with in the absence of the jury.  The record then indicates that the jury
was asked to retire.  Immediately after that entry, the transcript reveals as
follows:

 

THE COURT:  Yes.  Was that your concern?

 

MR. GLAZER:  No.  My concern -- I might as well
deal with it now -- is that I hope my friend isn’t going to ask this witness to
reveal hearsay that he relied on that has not been tendered as evidence in
court because that would be inadmissible.  For example, if certain photographs
are not filed and the witness says he’s basing his opinion on photographs that
haven’t been filed, that is inadmissible.  If he says that he’s basing his
opinion based on temperature he believes was taken, but that temperature was
not filed as an exhibit or tendered as evidence in the trial, then, the jury
has to be told to disregard that.

 

THE COURT: That ultimately -- I mean I don’t know
what is coming from the Crown, but certainly the doctor is entitled to say what
it was that he used to form his opinion and if the underpinnings are not
subsequently proven to support his opinion, that that’s --

 

MR. GLAZER:  I beg to disagree, My Lady.  The law
as I understand it is -- for example, My Lady had ruled that certain
comments by the accused are inadmissible.  If the witness during the course of
his testimony refers to those comments as forming the basis of some of his
opinion, it would be grounds for a mistrial.  He can only refer to what is
before the jury; he can’t refer to evidence that is not before the jury.
[Emphasis added.]

 








4                                  
Immediately after the transcripts were retrieved from the jury, defence
counsel moved for a mistrial.  On that occasion, he did not object in
particular to the portion of the transcript quoted above.  Rather, he referred
to information on the voir dire that made reference to a prior
trial.  Having heard the submissions, the trial judge ruled as follows:

 

Well, at this stage of the proceedings, what I
propose to do, and I appreciate your comments and I share the concern that you
have expressed, but at the same time, we’ve gone to this stage, and what I
propose to do is to bring the jury in and to indicate and not to red flag whose
transcript and not to indicate what areas but simply to say that there were
some matters in the transcripts that were not properly before them and ought
not to form part of their consideration and to caution them on that and to
indicate, again, that only evidence that was properly before them is to be
considered; and, in addition, to indicate that we will keep all of the
transcripts here until we’re in a position to provide them with clean copies of
exactly what was before them.

 

5                                  
After the jury returned a verdict of guilty the trial judge asked the
jury to retire so she could talk to counsel alone.  After the jury left, the
judge indicated that before formally recording the verdict, she wanted to raise
the matter of the transcripts that were sent inadvertently to the jury during
their deliberations.  She said that she was still entertaining the possibility
of declaring a mistrial at this stage and would like to hear the submissions of
counsel on that issue.  In the course of these submissions, defence counsel
referred to the passage quoted above as an indication that the jury could only
have assumed that his client had made a confession “or something of that
nature”.  Having heard the submissions, the trial judge concluded that she was
not certain that she had jurisdiction to declare a mistrial after a verdict had
been rendered by the jury.  Then, she indicated “with some reluctance” that she
would bring the jury back.  At the request of the defence, the jury was polled
and confirmed the verdict.

 








6                                  
The issue before us is to characterize properly this ground of appeal,
within the meaning of s. 686  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
and to decide how it should affect the ultimate disposition of the appeal.

 

7                                  
In my view, if the unedited transcript mistake had not been detected
until after the trial, it might have been possible to view this ground of
appeal as falling under s. 686(1) (a)(iii).  However, this matter was
raised at trial, and the possibility of a mistrial was considered by the trial
judge on two occasions.  A proper characterization of the issue before us, in
my opinion, is whether or not the trial judge made an error of law in refusing
to declare a mistrial either when it was first requested of her, or after the
verdict.  If we find that an error of law was committed, we must then turn to
the remedial proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) and determine whether,
notwithstanding the error, the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

 

8                                  
This method of analysis has been consistently followed by appellate
courts and by this Court in determining the nature of errors that are alleged
to have occurred at trial, and the proper remedial response mandated by the Criminal
Code .  This is also the approach that was followed by the Manitoba Court of
Appeal in the present case.

 

9                                  
In my view, the question in this case is not whether the giving of the
unedited transcripts to the jury was a “miscarriage of justice” or a
“procedural irregularity”.  The question is whether or not the trial judge
erred in law by not declaring a mistrial as a result of that occurrence. As a
preliminary matter, I will therefore set out in more detail why, in my view, s.
686(1) (b)(iv) has no application here. I will then review the guiding
principles in s. 686(1) (a)(ii) and 686(1) (b)(iii). 

 








II.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

10                              
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 

 

686. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand
trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of
appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not
properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted
on another count or part of the indictment,

 

(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any ground
mentioned in paragraph (a),

 

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any
ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred; or

 

(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial
court had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was
convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered
no prejudice thereby;

 

III.  Analysis

 

A.   Section
686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code

 








11                              
Properly interpreted in accordance with the principles set out in Rizzo
& Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, this subsection expands
the remedial powers of courts of appeal by permitting the dismissal of appeals
in case of any procedural irregularity previously perceived as having caused a
loss of jurisdiction at trial, as long as the accused suffers no prejudice and
as long as the trial court maintained its jurisdiction “over the class of
offence[s]”.  I agree with the analysis of the scope of the section provided by
Goodman J.A. in R. v. Cloutier (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35
(Ont. C.A.), and adopted by Gonthier J. in R. v. Bain, [1992] 1
S.C.R. 91 (in dissent, with Iacobucci J. and McLachlin J., as she then was,
concurring).  In Cloutier, Goodman J.A. reviewed the legislative history
of the provision and noted that it was first initiated in the House of Commons
on February 7, 1984, to be eventually enacted and proclaimed into force on
December 4, 1985.  The section was first introduced in the House seven days
after a January 31, 1984 judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R.
v. Fenton (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 109, which deplored the unavailability of
curative provisions in the Code in the case of jurisdictional errors
such as those caused by the accused having been even inadvertently excluded
from small and sometimes uneventful portions of his trial.

 

12                              
Although Goodman J.A. suggested that the section might have been enacted
in response to the line of cases leading to Fenton, supra, it is
not clear to me that the section targeted exclusively the procedural
irregularity caused by the absence of the accused during his trial.  There were
numerous other procedural irregularities  in the criminal process which caused
loss of jurisdiction over the person, if not over the offence with which the
accused was charged. The real focus of the enactment of s. 686(1)(b)(iv)
in 1985 seems to have been to put an end to the jurisprudence holding that 
procedural errors having caused a loss of jurisdiction in the trial courts
could not be cured, even on appeal. 








 

13                              
Indeed, prior to the enactment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , criminal procedure was replete with complex decisions
distinguishing between the various jurisdictional consequences of procedural
errors, pre-trial, at trial and post-conviction.  Such issues included: whether
the expiration of a time limitation within which to prosecute an offence
summarily provided a defence or caused a loss of jurisdiction (R. v.
Karpinski, [1957] S.C.R. 343); issues of territorial jurisdiction (R. v.
Simons (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 162 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Sarazin (1978),
39 C.C.C. (2d) 131 (P.E.I.S.C.)); jurisdictional challenges to the preliminary
inquiry through prerogative writs, as well as challenges to the form of the
information or indictment (R. v. Dwyer, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 481,
rev’g (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 83 (Ont. C.A.)); whether defective indictments
could not or would not be cured on appeal (Brodie v. The King, [1936]
S.C.R. 188); whether informations or indictments “disclos[ing] no offence known
to the law” were curable on appeal (R. v. Vallee, [1969] 3
C.C.C. 293 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 295; R. v. Major, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 826; R. v. Côté,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 8, and Elliott v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 393); and,
whether remedies such as prerogative writs and appeals were available to review
rulings on the alleged improper form of the charge (Kipp v. Attorney-General
for Ontario, [1965] S.C.R. 57.  See also R. v. Sheets, [1971] S.C.R.
614.)

 








14                              
In addition to the cases dealing with the jurisdictional consequences of
violating s. 650  of the Criminal Code , mandating the presence of the
accused at trial (see R. v. Meunier, [1966] S.C.R. 399, and R. v.
Barrow, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694), there were many other procedural
irregularities which were said to be of a jurisdictional nature -- rather than
mere “errors of law” -- and as such raised the question of whether they could
be remedied on appeal by the use of the proviso contained in s. 686(1) (b)(iii). 
(See for instance irregularities in jury selection, R. v. Rowbotham
(1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), or the discussion of the effects of
errors in the procedure by which the accused elected his mode of trial in Korponay
v. Attorney General of Canada, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41.)  The matter was further
complicated by the distinction drawn by the courts between loss of jurisdiction
over the person of the accused, which could be subsequently remedied, and loss
of jurisdiction over the offence, which could not (see Trenholm v.
Attorney-General of Ontario, [1940] S.C.R. 301; Doyle v. The Queen,
[1977] 1 S.C.R. 597; R. v. Krannenburg, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1053). 

 

15                              
This question of incurable loss of jurisdiction was first addressed by
Parliament in 1976 by the enactment of s. 440.1 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, which eventually, after further amendment, became the
present s. 485 .  The original section cured only failures to comply with the Code’s
provisions on adjournments and remands, which were already a great source of
“loss of jurisdiction”. Indeed, prior to the enactment of that provision,
jurisdiction could be lost by remands for more than eight days without the
accused’s consent.  Yet this Court in Krannenburg, supra, at p.
1056, held that the new section still could not cure a “[l]oss of jurisdiction
over the offence”.  In 1985, in the same Bill enacting s. 686(1) (b)(iv),
s. 440.1 was further amended to its present form.  The parallels between s.
686(1) (b)(iv) and s. 485  of the Criminal Code  were highlighted by
Macfarlane J.A. in R. v. Joinson (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (B.C.C.A.),
at p. 548, and by Shaw J. in  Bell (Re), [1988] B.C.J. No.1897 (QL)
(S.C.).  Section 485  now provides that jurisdiction over an offence is not lost
by reason of the failure of the trial court to “act in the exercise of that
jurisdiction at any particular time, or by reason of a failure to comply with
any of the provisions of this Act respecting adjournments or remands”.

 








16                              
In short, s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code was enacted in the
face of a body of case law that was becoming increasingly technical and complex
and which had restricted considerably the possibility for appellate courts to
conclude that an error at trial was not such that it required a setting aside of
the verdict.  This provision is rarely invoked, because procedural
irregularities that result from an error of law, which is most of them, are
properly dealt with under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.  Prior
to the enactment of s. 686(1) (b)(iv) in 1985, some procedural
irregularities, although they amounted to errors of law, had been ruled
“jurisdictional” and courts had decided that they could therefore not be cured
by the proviso since jurisdiction had been lost.  In that context, it is clear
that the new provision was not meant to deal with trivial procedural
irregularities which in any event would have been curable under the proviso as
long as they constituted errors of law.  I agree with Goodman J.A. in Cloutier
that s. 686(1) (b)(iv) was enacted to cure serious procedural
irregularities, otherwise amounting to errors of law, in cases where under the
then existing case law, jurisdiction over the person, but not over the offence,
had been lost.  I also agree with Goodman J.A. that under this new
subparagraph, since the procedural irregularities in issue would have been
serious ones, it is appropriate to infer prejudice without requiring in every
case that the accused demonstrate prejudice.  The inference may of course be
rebutted and the test of prejudice under that subsection should be the same as
the no substantial wrong or  miscarriage of justice, under s. 686(1) (b)(iii),
which has been the subject of extensive pronouncement by this Court.

 








17                              
Finally, in my view, if an issue is raised on appeal that cannot be said
to constitute an error of law, there is no access to the remedial provisions of
s. 686(1) (b).  In such a case, the court must determine whether the
appeal should be allowed “on any ground [that] there was a miscarriage of
justice” under s. 686(1) (a)(iii).  If the error alleged is one of mixed
fact and law, it may have to be dealt with under s. 686(1) (a)(iii)
(see Fanjoy v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233).  If an accused
were to complain on appeal of having been deprived of the effective assistance
of counsel, when the issue had not been raised at trial and therefore the trial
judge had made no ruling on it, it could be said that no error of law is
alleged, but that the appeal should be allowed on the ground that there was a
miscarriage of justice (R. v. B. (L.C.) (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 353
(Ont. C.A.); R. v. Silvini (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 251 (Ont.
C.A.)).  In the same way, if the complaint on appeal was of improper
contact between a juror and the accused discovered after the verdict (see R.
v. Cameron (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)), the ground of appeal
would be based on s. 686(1) (a)(iii).  In such cases, a finding of
miscarriage of justice under s. 686(1) (a)(iii) cannot in my view be
cured under any of the remedial provisions contained in s. 686(1) (b) and
the appeal must be allowed.

 

18                              
In summary, when an error or irregularity of a procedural nature has
occurred at trial, s. 686  provides that:

 

-      If the procedural irregularity amounts to
or is based on an error of law, it falls under ss. 686(1) (a)(ii) and
686(1) (b)(iii).

 

-      If the procedural irregularity was
previously (before 1985) classified as an irregularity causing a loss of
jurisdiction: s. 686(1) (b)(iv) provides that this is no longer fatal to
the conviction, and an analysis of prejudice must be undertaken, in accordance
with the principles set out in s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 








-      If the procedural error did not amount to,
or originate in an error of law, which is rare, s. 686(1) (a)(iii)
applies and the reviewing court must determine whether a miscarriage of justice
occurred.  If so, there are no remedial provisions in s. 686(1) (b) that
can cure such a defect, and the appeal must be allowed and either an acquittal
entered or a new trial ordered. 

 

19                              
There is no suggestion in this case that the handing of the unedited
transcripts to the jury was an irregularity that triggered a loss of
jurisdiction over the person of the accused.  Therefore, in my opinion s.
686(1) (b)(iv) has no application.  Rather, what the appellant alleges is
that the trial judge erred in law in refusing to declare a mistrial.  We must
analyse this argument under the more common route of determining whether that
refusal was an error, and if so, whether it is curable under the proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 

B.  Sections
686(1) (a)(ii) and 686(1) (b)(iii)

 

20                              
I must say at the outset that I disagree, with the greatest respect,
with the interpretation that my colleague LeBel J. gives to s. 686(1)(a)(ii)
which would restrict the concept of error of law to an error on which the
judgment was or could have been based so as to prejudice the accused.  I am not
aware of any authority which has restricted the concept of error of law in that
fashion, and I am not persuaded that it is mandated by the textual reading of
the section either in French or in English.  In fact, in both languages, s.
686(1)(a) distinguishes between “verdict” and “judgment”.  In s. 686(1)(a)(i),
the Code provides that the appeal may been allowed if “the verdict
should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence” (emphasis added).  In French, the word “verdict”
is used in that subparagraph.

 








21                              
In contrast, in s. 686(1)(a)(ii) the Code provides that
the appeal may be allowed if  “the judgment of the trial court should be
set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law” (emphasis
added).  In French the word “jugement” is also used in that section.

 

22                              
In my opinion, even a textual interpretation supports the view that the
judgment based on an error of law need not be linked to the final verdict but
can be any decision, obviously having contributed to the ultimate verdict as
they all do, that was an erroneous interpretation or application of the law.

 

23                              
I see no authority to support the notion that only errors of law
containing an element of unfairness or prejudice would constitute errors of law
in that context.  The determination of whether the error of law was prejudicial
to the accused, and if so to what extent, is an analysis traditionally reserved
for, and rightly so, the remedial proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii), with the
burden then appropriately placed on the Crown to satisfy the reviewing court
that despite the error no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred.

 

24                              
I will only refer briefly to some of the abundant jurisprudence under s.
686 of the Code in order to establish the parameters of the application
both of paras. (a) and (b) of s. 686(1).  Nothing needs to be
said in this case about s. 686(1)(a)(i), which outlines the power of the
court of appeal to allow an appeal on the basis that the verdict is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.             

 








25                              
Apart from unreasonable verdict cases, it is fair to say that most
matters that are brought as grounds of appeal against conviction in criminal
cases are characterized as errors of law within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(ii). 
In some cases, when the court has concluded that the error alleged was not
strictly speaking an error of law, but at most an error of mixed fact and law,
it has characterized the issue as falling under s. 686(1) (a)(iii), that
is, whether it was a miscarriage of justice. In such a case, further use of the
proviso is obviously precluded and the appeal must be allowed. (See Fanjoy,
supra.)  As indicated earlier, I believe that the appeal in this case is
entirely governed by the provisions of ss. 686(1) (a)(ii) and 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code , and that ss. 686(1) (a)(iii) and 686(1) (b)(iv)
are not engaged.

 

26                              
Most of the case law dealing with the nature of the error of law
contemplated by s. 686(1) (a)(ii) arises in the context of the curative
proviso which brings about an assessment of the nature and the seriousness of
the error.  There are essentially two classes of errors which have been
identified by reviewing courts and which have led to a proper application of
the proviso.  The first category is that of so- called “harmless errors”, or
errors of a minor nature having no impact on the verdict.  The second category
encompasses serious errors which would justify a new trial, but for the fact
that the evidence adduced was seen as so overwhelming that the reviewing court
concludes that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

 

27                              
In every case, if the reviewing court concludes that the error, whether
procedural or substantive, led to a denial of a fair trial, the court may
properly characterize the matter as one where there was a miscarriage of
justice.  In that case, no remedial provision is available and the appeal must
be allowed.  I will now examine  these propositions in more detail.

 








28                              
This Court has enunciated on numerous occasions the proper test for the
application of the curative proviso (see Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965]
S.C.R. 739; Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311; R. v. B.
(F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697; R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599).  It
can only be applied where there is no “reasonable possibility that the verdict
would have been different had the error . . . not been made” (Bevan, supra,
at p. 617).

 

29                              
The jurisprudence reveals that the proviso will generally be applied, in
accordance with the above principles, in two types of situations.  A. W. Mewett
has described the two possible approaches in “No Substantial Miscarriage of
Justice”, in A. N. Doob and E. L. Greenspan, eds., Perspectives in Criminal
Law (1985), 81, at p. 94:

 

What we see are again two fundamentally different
views of the application of the proviso.  One view proceeds on the basis of
asking whether, absent the error or wrongly admitted evidence, the rest of the
evidence is so overwhelming as to make the outcome of a retrial a virtual certainty;
the other of asking whether, ignoring the rest of the evidence, the jury might
have been influenced by the error or the wrongly admitted evidence.  

 

On the one
hand, appellate courts will maintain a conviction in spite of the errors of law
where such errors were either minor in themselves or had no effect on the
verdict and caused no prejudice to the accused.  This accords with the original
purpose of the section, as described early on by Taschereau J., writing for the
majority of this Court, in Chibok v. The Queen (1956), 24 C.R. 354, at
p. 359:

 

It would indeed be a shocking impediment to the
proper administration of criminal justice, if criminals were allowed to go free
because of a trivial error in law or of an oversight of no material consequence.
[Emphasis added.]

 








As stated by
Lamer C.J., for the Court, in R. v. Tran, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951, at p.
1008, “[s]ection 686(1)(b)(iii) is designed to avoid the necessity of
setting aside a conviction for minor or ‘harmless’ errors of law where the
Crown can establish that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred.”

 

30                              
The case law is replete with examples of situations where either the
triviality of the error itself, or the lack of prejudice caused by a more
serious error of law, justified the application of the curative proviso (see R.
v. Jolivet, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, 2000 SCC 29; R. v. Stone, [1999] 2
S.C.R. 290; R. v. Ménard, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 109; R. v. Jacquard,
[1997] 1 S.C.R. 314; R. v. Rockey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 829; R. v. MacGillivray,
[1995] 1 S.C.R. 890; R. v. Haughton, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516; United
Nurses of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901; Gunn
v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 273; Chibok, supra; R. v.
Klatt (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 147 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Wong (1992), 12
B.C.A.C. 211).  In all  those cases, the appellate courts were convinced that
the error could have had no effect on the verdict.  Because of the nature of
the errors and of the issues with respect to which they were made, it was
possible to trace their effect on the verdict and ensure that they made no
difference.  Generally, the errors concerned evidence that was insignificant to
the determination of guilt or innocence (Gunn, supra; Wong,
supra; United Nurses, supra; Klatt, supra)
or benefited the accused by imposing a more onerous standard on the Crown (MacGillivray,
supra; Haughton, supra).  Errors in the charge to the jury
respecting a very minor aspect of the case that could not have had any effect
on the outcome or concerning issues that the jury was otherwise necessarily
aware of were also cured by the application of the proviso (Jacquard, supra;
Jolivet, supra; Ménard, supra; Chibok, supra). 
Similarly, in some cases the errors concerned preliminary findings that would
nevertheless, as a matter of law, inevitably have resulted in the same finding
made by the trial judge (Rockey, supra; Stone, supra). 


 








31                              
In addition to cases where only a minor error or an error with minor
effects is committed, there is another class of situations in which s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
may be applied.  This was described in the case of R. v. S. (P.L.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 916, where, after stating the rule that an accused
is entitled to a new trial or an acquittal if errors of law are made, Sopinka
J. wrote:

 

There is, however, an exception to this rule in a case in which the
evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict.  In
such circumstances, depriving the accused of a proper trial is justified on the
ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable result would be
another conviction.

 

Therefore, it
is possible to apply the curative proviso even in cases where errors are not
minor and cannot be said to have had only a minor effect on the trial, but only
if it is clear that the evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused is so
overwhelming that any other verdict but a conviction would be impossible (see R.
v. Nijjar, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 320; Alward v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
559; Ambrose v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 717; Dufresne v. La Reine,
[1988] R.J.Q. 38 (C.A.); R. v. Welch (1980), 5 Sask. R. 175 (C.A.)).

 

C.  Application
to this Case

 

32                              
This case in my view does not require an assessment of the overall
strength of the Crown’s case at trial.  Here, when asked to declare a mistrial,
the trial judge was essentially asked the same question as the one before us,
that is, whether it was likely that the exposure by the jury to the tainted
transcripts could have affected the jury to the point that the entire trial was
compromised and that no remedy other than a new trial was available. 

 








33                              
I think that for the purpose of this appeal, we must assume that the
jury read the transcript that it had in its possession, including the impugned
passage.  It would of course be easy to dismiss the appeal on the assumption
that the jury probably never read the portion that it should not have received.
Such an approach would, in my opinion, be totally unfounded. The jury asked for
some materials, and it received them. They had the transcripts for several
hours. It would be bizarre in my view to assume that having asked for the
transcripts, they did not read them. Moreover, the part that should not have
been given to them stood out in the transcript with the heading: “JURY OUT AT
11:38 A.M.”  That might have attracted their attention.  In any event, as a
matter of law, I cannot see how speculation helps either way.  We must assume
that there was at least a real possibility that the jury was exposed to these
materials and at this stage we cannot probe further as to the consequences. 
The appellant is entitled to advance his case on the basis of the real
possibility of the worst case scenario.

 








34                              
Contrary to my colleague LeBel J., I also think that we cannot speculate
that if the jury read the impugned passage it must have assumed that defence
counsel was merely raising a hypothesis, rather than asserting that his client
had made statements that had been ruled inadmissible.  Although I understand
the interpretation given by my colleague, which emphasises the hypothetical
turn of phrase in the passage in question, I think that read in context it more
likely lends itself to the interpretation that defence counsel was referring to
excluded statements actually made by his client. I would not go as far as
suggesting, as counsel for the appellant does, that the passage inevitably
implies that the appellant made a confession which was excluded. Read in full,
the passage refers to several matters that were not in evidence  when the
argument took place in the absence of the jury.  In my view, a fair assessment
of the impact that the transcript could have had on the jury must be made on
the assumption that they read it and understood that counsel for the appellant
was concerned that the jury should not find out that his client had made
statements that the court had ruled inadmissible; no more, no less.

 

35                              
I also think that this is what the trial judge understood, and that is
why she cautioned the jury exactly as she did.  She did not identify
specifically the passages at issue, so as not to aggravate the damage, if any,
but she clearly instructed the jury to disregard references to all matters that
were not properly in evidence before them.

 

36                              
The trial judge was obviously concerned with the effect and
consequences  of what had transpired and she took seriously the application for
a mistrial. I share that concern.  However, in my view, she made no error when
she exercised her discretion to deny the motion for a mistrial, nor did she err
in declining to enter a mistrial after the jury had returned its verdict.  The
trial judge was in a privileged position to assess the possible impact of the
mishap on the jury and the effectiveness of the sharp warning that she issued. 
There is no basis upon which I could say that she was wrong in that fine
judgment call.  The information before the jury was at most an innuendo. At the
very end of a murder trial, the jury would have come to appreciate the
existence of rules of evidence that govern the relevant materials upon which
they are called to make a decision.  Taking the case at its highest from the
appellant’s point of view, I believe that the admonition issued by the trial
judge to the jury was sufficient to remedy any ill effect that the unedited
transcripts might have had on the jury. 

 

37                              
Therefore, the trial judge did not err in rejecting the motion for a
mistrial, and there is no need to turn to the proviso.  I must add that if I
had concluded that a mistrial should have been declared, I cannot see how such
an error could have been cured by the proviso.  For the same reasons, I do not
think it can be said in this case that there was a miscarriage of justice
within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(iii).








 

38                              
I agree with LeBel J. on the ground of appeal dealing with the jury
selection process.  For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

39                              
LeBel J. -- In this
appeal, we are asked to determine whether a conviction should be reversed on
the grounds that a transcript revealing conversations which occurred during a voir
dire was inadvertently given to the jury during its deliberations.  This
calls upon the interpretation and application of s. 686(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , governing the powers of a court of appeal.  The
main issue in this appeal is to determine whether the remedial provision of s.
686(1) (b) should apply. 

I.  Facts
and Trial Judgment

 

40                              
On February 13, 1998, after a trial before Madam Justice Keyser and a 
jury, the appellant, Mohamed Ameerulla Khan, was convicted of the first degree
murder of his wife, Sureta Khan.  This was his third trial.  Previous
convictions had been set aside by the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

 

41                              
The appellant claimed to have discovered his deceased wife in the
bathtub of their home at 6:55 p.m. on January 4, 1994 and to have then
telephoned 911.  The appellant’s call was transferred to a first responder who
instructed him to leave his wife in the bathtub and drain the water, and that
help would arrive very shortly.  Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful. 

 








42                              
The Crown asserted that the appellant had killed his wife.  Its evidence
was mainly circumstantial.  A pathologist, Dr. John Kelly Martin MacDonald, who
was recognized as an expert in forensic pathology, testified for the Crown as
to the possible circumstances of the death.  The Court of Appeal summarized Dr.
MacDonald’s evidence in the following manner ((1999), 138 Man. R. (2d) 23, at
para. 9):

 

Dr. MacDonald testified positively that the
deceased did not die in the bathtub either by wet or dry drowning.  In his
opinion, she died from asphyxiation, but in an unknown manner.  He estimated
the time of death to be between two and four hours before the first responders
observed her, which would fix the time of death to be between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00
p.m.

 

43                              
Dr. MacDonald's opinion as to the time of death was based on the extent
of rigor mortis found in the deceased's body by the first responders and on her
core body temperature recorded at the hospital shortly after she was
transported there at approximately 8:30 p.m.

 

44                              
Dr. MacDonald’s opinion that the deceased did not die in the bathtub was
based on the absence of “washerwoman changes or syndrome” on her body. 
“Washerwoman syndrome” may be described as changes in the skin condition that
result from being immersed in water.  According to Dr. MacDonald, if the
deceased was in cool water, which would reduce the extent of washerwoman
changes, he would not have expected the extent of rigor which was observed by
the first responders.

 

45                              
Dr. MacDonald further testified that in his opinion asphyxia or oxygen
starvation was the cause of death.  Although the mode of asphyxiation was
unclear, Dr. MacDonald was of the opinion that the death could not be
classified as being of undetermined origin. Dr. MacDonald testified as follows:

 








I think her mode of asphyxia is undetermined.  If she was not
discovered in the bathtub, I think the -- it may very well be an undetermined
death, but given the fact that she was in the bathtub when the information that
would argue that she has been dead at least a couple of hours and she does not
have the washerwoman's changes, that she did not die in the bathtub, so I have
great reluctance having the idea that natural deaths walk, let alone
undetermined deaths walk.  I do not think I could classify this or not argue
with someone who wished to classify this cause of death as undetermined.

 

46                              
The appellant relied on a defence of alibi.  However, he did not testify
during the trial.  Rather, evidence as to the appellant’s whereabouts on the
day in question was provided by an acquaintance, Mr. Marshall Ross, and through
the filing of two exhibits.  Mr. Ross indicated that the appellant arrived at
his home at 3:40 p.m. in order to do some work on his daughter’s car.  He added
that, at 4:01 p.m., the deceased called to speak to the appellant.  Finally,
Mr. Ross stated that the appellant left his home at 5:00 p.m.  His recollection
of the time of departure was an estimate based on the time he sat down for
dinner and the time it would have taken his wife to prepare the meal from the
time the appellant left.  Although Mr. Ross was a witness called by the Crown,
counsel for the Crown, in his closing arguments, suggested that Mr. Ross’
recollection as to the time of departure was incorrect and that, in fact, the
appellant left his residence earlier.  After the appellant left the Ross home,
Mr. Ross heard from him a few minutes prior to 7:00 p.m., when the appellant
called to tell him that his wife was lying in the bathtub and appeared not to
be breathing.  The appellant then requested that Mr. Ross come over.

 

47                              
Also presented into evidence was a receipt from an automated teller
machine that confirms that the appellant received $60 from a machine at 5:33
p.m. on the relevant date.  The machine was located five minutes away from the
appellant’s residence.  Moreover, the appellant produced a receipt from a
pharmacy indicating that a prescription order was received at 5:44 p.m. and
paid for at 6:35 p.m. 








 

48                              
The evidence also established that the deceased was heavily insured and
that the appellant was the beneficiary.  The Crown’s theory was that the
appellant was the only person with access to the house, with a motive and with
the opportunity to kill the deceased.  The theory of the defence was that the
death was unexplained, that the autopsy was inconclusive and that there was
insufficient evidence of foul play.

 

49                              
During the course of its deliberations, the jury requested transcripts
of Dr. MacDonald’s testimony.  Approximately six and a half hours after the
transcripts  were delivered to the jury, it was discovered that the copy of the
transcript given to the jury inadvertently contained the record of matters
discussed by counsel and the Court in the absence of the jury during a voir
dire.  As such matters should have been expunged, defence counsel moved for
a mistrial on the basis that the proceedings had become tainted and the trial
was unfair.  The main objectionable passage reads as follows:

 

MR. GLAZER [Defence counsel]:  I beg to disagree,
My Lady.  The law as I understand it is -- for example, My Lady had ruled that
certain comments by the accused are inadmissible.  If the witness during the
course of his testimony refers to those comments as forming the basis of some
of his opinion, it would be grounds for a mistrial.  He can only refer to what
is before the jury; he can't refer to evidence that is not before the jury. 

 








50                              
The defence argued that the jury had learned that the appellant had made
comments that were ruled inadmissible.  In the defence’s view, the jury would
speculate as to the nature of those comments and would draw an adverse
inference against the appellant.  The trial judge denied the request for a
mistrial.  She ordered, however, that the offending transcripts be retrieved
and that the jury be provided with clean copies.  The trial judge further
cautioned the jury that they were to rely solely on the evidence that was put
before them through witnesses and through the evidence filed.  Once the jury
returned a guilty verdict of first degree murder, the trial judge requested
further submissions regarding the possibility of granting a mistrial.  After
submissions by both counsel, the trial judge again declined to declare a
mistrial.

 

II.  Manitoba
Court of Appeal (1999), 138 Man. R. (2d) 23

 

51                              
By unanimous judgment rendered per curiam, the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appellant’s appeal from his conviction. The Court of Appeal
addressed the issue of whether the jury’s exposure to the tainted transcript
resulted in an unfair trial.  In so doing, it took for granted that the
appropriate provision under which to resolve this question was the curative
proviso contained in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

 

52                              
The Court of Appeal reviewed several appellate court decisions in cases
where evidence had inadvertently made its way into the jury room (see: R. v.
Duke (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 217 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Watson
(1991), 4 B.C.A.C. 253).  The appellant argued that, in accordance with R.
v. Armstrong, [1970] 1 C.C.C. 136 (N.S.C.A.), once mischief was done
in the trial process, it was no longer possible to correct it.  Relying on R.
v. R. (R.) (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), the Court of
Appeal indicated that perhaps such a principle was incorrect and that strong
and repeated instructions to the jury could overcome possible prejudice to an
accused.  The Court of Appeal also held that trial judges have wide discretion
in deciding whether to declare a mistrial.  As a result, appellate courts
should exercise great caution when reviewing the exercise of such discretion
(see Emkeit v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 133, and R. v. Paterson
(1998), 102 B.C.A.C. 200).

 








53                              
In the Court of Appeal’s view, the words which inadvertently found their
way into the jury room did not have a great potential for harm or mischief. 
Even if some prejudice had been caused to the appellant, this was amply
remedied by the cautionary instructions provided by the trial judge.  The court
also added its opinion on the strength of the evidence against the appellant,
in particular in relation to the evidence given by the pathologist, Dr.
MacDonald.  The court stated that it constituted “overwhelming evidence as to
the manner, time and place of death of the deceased” (para. 47).  The court
concluded that, considering the circumstances as a whole “[t]his is an
appropriate case in which the proviso is to be applied” (para. 48).  The conviction
was therefore upheld.  It was appealed to this Court on the question of the
application of the curative provisions of s. 686(1) (b).  An issue
concerning jury selection was also raised.

 

III.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

54                              
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 

 

686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against
a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or
not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that 

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not
properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted
on another count or part of the indictment,








(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any ground
mentioned in paragraph (a),

 

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any
ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred; or

 

(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial
court had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was
convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered
no prejudice thereby;

 

IV.  Analysis

 

55                              
In the case law, the proper meaning of paras. (a) and (b)
of s. 686(1) of the Code has sometimes been misunderstood.  My analysis
will first review their interpretation, before turning to the irregularities
alleged in the case at bar and the application of s. 686 of the Code to
them.

 

56                              
Sections 686(1) (a) and 686(1) (b) have distinct functions. 
On the one hand, the object of para. (a) is to spell out the conditions
pursuant to which an appellate court has the power to reverse a conviction. 
The court of appeal’s intervention is warranted whenever (i) the verdict is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence; (ii) the judgment is based
on a wrong decision on a question of law; or (iii) a “miscarriage of justice”
has occurred. 

 








57                              
On the other hand, para. (b), and in particular subparas. (iii)
and (iv), grant a remedial power to a court of appeal to uphold a conviction
despite having found earlier that its intervention could have been justified
under para. (a)(ii) or (iii), if the evidence is so overwhelming against
the accused that any other reasonable judge or jury would have rendered the
same guilty verdict.  Paragraph (b) is thus referred to as the “curative
proviso”.  Of course, needless to say a verdict which is defective under para.
(a)(i) because it is “unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence” cannot be cured under s. 686(1) (b) on the grounds that any
reasonable judge or jury would have ruled the same way.

 

58                              
Section 686(1) (a)(i) is not at stake in the present appeal. 
Although the appellant argued before the Court of Appeal that the verdict was
unreasonable, this issue was not raised before us.  Therefore, the question
before this Court is whether the conviction should be reversed because either
an “error of law” or a “miscarriage of justice” has occurred, and if so, whether
s. 686(1) (b) should be applied.

 

59                              
My analysis will be divided into four parts.  In the first part, I will
examine the notions of “error of law” and “miscarriage of justice”, and their
relationship to one another in the context of  s. 686(1)(a)(ii) and (iii)
of the Code.  Second, I will look more closely at what may constitute a
“miscarriage of justice” as understood by s. 686(1) (a)(iii). 
Third, I will examine the proper role and application of the curative proviso
contained in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) and (iv).  Finally, I will apply these
findings to the fact situation involved in the case at bar. 

 

A.     The Relationship Between “Errors of Law”
and “Miscarriages of Justice” Under Section 686(1)(a)(ii) and(iii) of the Code

 








60                              
Section 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Code states the possibility
that a conviction may be set aside “on the ground of a wrong decision on a
question of law”.  In that regard, in order for a verdict to be reversed, the
judgment must have been based, or have possibly been based, on an erroneous
legal norm.  It is not sufficient to demonstrate that a legal mistake has
occurred.  It must be found that the judgment was based or could have been
based on that mistake, so as to prejudice the accused.  The French version of
the s. 686(1) (a)(ii) is clearer on this.  It states that the judgment
can be set aside “pour le motif qu’il constitue une décision erronée
sur une question de droit” (underlining added).  Thus, it is not enough to
simply say that an error of law occurred.  The error must have been, or must
possibly have been, significant in the conviction.  It is then appropriate to
state that the judgment could constitute a wrong decision on a question
of law.

 

61                              
The other situations which may justify the intervention of a court of
appeal fall into a residual category.  Section 686(1) (a)(iii) refers to
the notion of “miscarriage of justice”.  This covers irregularities which the Code
attempts to distinguish from the errors of law mentioned in para. (a)(ii)
and which may have rendered the trial unfair for the accused, or have created
the appearance of unfairness.  I must mention that most of them also find their
root in some “error of law”, in the sense that the irregularity would not have
occurred if the appropriate legal norms had been followed.  These errors,
however, are more akin to procedural irregularities.  I should add that it does
not matter whether the irregularity occurred intentionally or not, nor does it
matter whether the error is due to a mistake by the judge, a court official,
one of the parties in the case, or any other person.  What matters most is the
effect of the irregularity on the fairness of the trial.

 








62                              
For instance, irregularities due to improper contact between a third
party and a juror (R. v. Cameron (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 96
(Ont. C.A.)), the abusive exercise of discretion by the trial judge (Fanjoy
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233), or inadequate representation of the
accused by his counsel (R. v. Joanisse (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35
(Ont. C.A.)) may fall into that residual category.  These types of
irregularities, like errors under s. 686(1) (a)(ii), may cause prejudice
to the accused.   When confronted with such an irregularity, the court of
appeal must examine whether it may have had an influence on the verdict or
could be perceived as such.  Such analysis must take into account the whole of
the circumstances.

 

63                              
Although paras. (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) are distinct, they
are nevertheless closely related.   Both paragraphs address situations where
something irregular in law has occurred during the course of the trial.  In
that sense, it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether a case falls
under para. (a)(ii) or (a)(iii).  There may often be a fine line
between what can constitute “a wrong decision on a question of law” and a
“miscarriage of justice”.

 

64                              
For instance, issues pertaining to the law of evidence may often be at
the intersection between an “error of law” and the residual type of
irregularity called “miscarriage of justice”.  When information which would
constitute inadmissible evidence is willingly admitted by the judge, it may be
seen more as an “error of law”, but when the same information is given to the
jury by mistake and the irregularity is discovered afterward, this may seem
more as falling into the residual category.  Yet, the result is the same: the
jury has been exposed to inadmissible evidence.  

 








65                              
All kinds of incidents may happen in the course of a trial, through the
interaction of the several different actors involved, and a degree of
uncertainty may arise as to their proper legal characterization. One example is
where an irregularity allegedly giving rise to a “miscarriage of justice”
occurs during a trial, and the judge makes a mistake when attempting to remedy
this irregularity.  Would the end result be an “error of law” or a “miscarriage
of justice”?  While it is not necessary to answer this question, or to
articulate a fine line between “errors of law” and errors leading to
“miscarriages of justice”, we may safely consider that the two concepts,
although they will often have different origins, may have a similar impact on
the validity of the verdict.   

 

66                              
Since both target the same problem and, as we will see below, both may
be cured under s. 686(1) (b), this difficulty of classification is not
greatly problematic.  Thus, whether the defect at trial appears to have been a
“wrong decision on a question of law”, or an irregularity allegedly falling
within the residual category of  “miscarriage of justice”, the circumstances
must be considered to see if the error could have played a significant role in
the legal validity of the verdict or rendered the trial unfair, in reality or
in appearance, or was merely peripheral. 

 

67                              
Often, it may be that decisions constituting “errors of law” warranting
the intervention of the court of appeal will be more easily identifiable than
“miscarriages of justice”.  Indeed, once the court of appeal concludes that the
proper interpretation of the law has not been followed by the trial judge, the
conclusion may easily show that the accused has not benefited from a fair
trial, or a trial conducted according to the principles of criminal law, and
therefore that the decision constituted an “error of law” within the meaning of
s. 686(1) (a)(ii).  On the other hand, other types of irregularities
which result in unfairness, or appearance of unfairness in the trial, may be
more difficult to classify.  It will therefore be useful to explore in greater
detail the notion of “miscarriage of justice” in  s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of
the Code.  

 








68                              
I note that this analysis of the notion of “miscarriage of justice” can
also be useful in some cases to determine whether an “error of law” warrants
the intervention of the court of appeal under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Code. 
As I mentioned earlier, wrong decisions on a question of law do not always
involve a straightforward conclusion that s. 686(1) (a)(ii) is
implicated, as some errors of law can be trivial or incidental in the context
of particular cases.  For instance, if inadmissible evidence is accepted during
the trial to prove the identification of the accused, but identification is
otherwise proven and is not at issue in the case, the error of law may be
merely incidental.  If the error of law could not have prejudiced the accused,
the conviction will be upheld.  Reaching a conclusion in that respect will
require a balancing taking into account the circumstances of the case and, more
particularly, the nature and impact of the error of law.  In that regard, the
analysis under s. 686(1) (a)(ii) may call at times upon similar
considerations as under s. 686(1) (a)(iii).  I will now turn to those
considerations.  

 

B.  The
Notion of “Miscarriage of Justice” Under Section 686(1)(a)(iii) of the Code

 

69                              
When should an irregularity which occurred during a trial be said to
constitute a “miscarriage of justice” as understood by s. 686(1) (a)(iii)? 
The essential question in that regard is whether the irregularity was severe
enough to render the trial unfair or to create the appearance of unfairness. 
Contrary to the analysis under  s. 686(1) (b), the emphasis here is
not so much on the final verdict and the overall strength of the evidence
against the accused, but rather on the gravity of the irregularity and the
effect it may have had on the fairness of the trial.  

 








70                              
I should mention that this analysis of  “miscarriage of justice”
presupposes that the trial court is competent in relation to the infraction. 
The court’s lack of initial jurisdiction and also its loss of jurisdiction
because of clear and serious violations of fundamental principles of natural
justice can create an automatic “miscarriage of justice”, without it being
necessary to examine whether the trial was unfair or appeared unfair.  For
instance, in a case where there is a reasoned apprehension of bias on the part
of the trial judge, there is an automatic “miscarriage of justice” without
having to take the analysis any further to assess the impact of his bias (see R.
v. Curragh Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537, at paras. 5-7).  

 

71                              
Such a jurisdictional miscarriage of justice cannot be cured under
s. 686(1)(b)(iv), even if the weight of the evidence is
overwhelming against the accused.  As we will see below, s. 686(1)(b)(iv)
is the provision under which alleged “miscarriages of justice” as understood by
para. (a)(iii) may eventually be cured, if they are found to be mere
procedural irregularities not rising to the level of a failure of justice. 
However, s. 686(1)(b)(iv) indicates that a conviction may be saved,
provided that the court “had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which
the appellant was convicted”.  Therefore, the curing option would not apply to
the type of error which is so fundamental to trial fairness that it amounts to
or results in a lack of jurisdiction.

 

72                              
This being said, the other types of irregularities require that the
whole of the circumstances of each case be carefully weighed in determining
whether the trial has been rendered unfair in reality or in appearance.  In so
doing, the court of appeal must bear in mind that the accused is not entitled
to a perfect trial.  He is entitled to a fair trial, but it is inevitable that
minor irregularities will occur from time to time.  The trial cannot be held to
a standard of perfection, provided it remains fair in reality and in
appearance.  See R. v. Find, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, 2001 SCC
32, at para. 28; R. v. Carosella, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, at
para. 74; R. v. G. (S.G.), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716, at para.
101; R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 45.

 








73                              
Whether a “miscarriage of justice” has occurred asks whether the trial
was unfair, or alternatively whether an appearance of unfairness was created. 
See e.g. Cameron, supra, at pp. 101-2; R. v. Hertrich
(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 543.  This last element should be
evaluated in relation to a reasonable and objective observer, by asking if the
irregularity would be such as to taint the administration of justice in his or
her eyes.  The fact that some member of the public may consider the trial to
have been unfair is not sufficient.  We must look at whether a well-informed,
reasonable person considering the whole of the circumstances would have
perceived the trial as being unfair or as appearing to be so.  

 

74                              
Courts should refrain from devising any strict formula in order to
determine whether a “miscarriage of justice” has taken place.  Irregularities
which can occur during a trial may take many unpredictable forms. (See
generally G. D. McKinnon, The Criminal Lawyers’ Guide to Appellate
Court Practice (1997), at pp. 89 ff.; P. Béliveau and M. Vauclair,
Traité général de preuve et de procédure pénales (8th ed. 2001), at pp. 902
ff.; S. A. Cohen, “Controlling the Trial Process: The Judge and the Conduct of
Trial” (1977), 36 C.R.N.S. 15.)  Some may impact the trial in a way which
deprives the accused of a fair defence, while others are less significant,
depending on the circumstances.  The gravity of irregularities which may occur
must inevitably be evaluated by courts on a case-by-case basis.  This being
said, certain elements can provide reference points in determining whether a
miscarriage of justice has occurred. 

 








75                              
First, one should ask whether the irregularity pertained to a question
which was, in law or in fact, central to the case against the accused.  Thus,
an irregularity which is related to a central point of the case is more likely
to be fatal than one concerning a mere peripheral point (see e.g. Olbey v.
The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008, at p. 1029).  Of course, this issue
will not always be absolutely determinative, and it is possible that a serious
irregularity on a peripheral point can have rendered the trial unfair in
reality or in appearance.  Moreover, it is important to realize that some
irregularities will not relate to a particular element in the case, but will
rather create a general apprehension of unfairness on the whole of the case. 
This could occur, for instance, if jurors were led, through some irregularity,
to feel greater sympathy for the Crown’s case in general or greater antipathy
towards the accused.

 

76                              
Second, the court of appeal should consider the relative gravity of the
irregularity.  How much influence could it have had on the verdict?  What are
the chances that the apprehended detrimental effect of the irregularity did in
fact occur?  How severe could these detrimental effects have been for the accused’s
case?  This is important not only in relation to an actual finding of
unfairness, but also in relation to the appearance of unfairness.  A single
irregularity which is unlikely to have had any significant impact would seem to
indicate to the reasonable observer that the trial appeared fair.  

 

77                              
When the court considers the gravity of the error, it should also
consider the possible cumulative effect of several irregularities during the
trial.  Sometimes, a trial in which more than one error has occurred can be
seen as unfair, even if these irregularities standing alone might not have been
fatal on their own.  (In that regard, compare Cathro
v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 101, with the dissenting judgment of Laskin J.A. of the Ontario Court
of Appeal in R. v. Ferguson (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 353,
at pp. 376-77, which was affirmed by this Court, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 281, 2001 SCC
6.)  Conversely, when, apart from one alleged irregularity, the trial was
otherwise error-free, the court may sometimes be justified in forgiving the
error more easily. 

 








78                              
Third, one should be mindful of the type of trial during which the error
has occurred.  Was it a trial by jury or by a judge sitting alone?  Sometimes,
irregularities can have a more severe impact on the fairness of the trial when
they occur during a trial before a judge and a jury. This is especially true
considering that some irregularities can have a psychological effect, which we
presume judges are more apt to overcome than juries.  However, this question is
not absolutely determinative, and some irregularities will render the trial
unfair even if they occurred before a judge sitting alone, while other mistakes
may not be fatal even if they took place before a jury.  Thus, a
well-instructed jury may have the capacity to overcome irregularities.

 

79                              
Fourth, and related, is the possibility that the irregularity may have
been remedied, in full or in part, at the trial.  When the trial judge realizes
that an irregularity has occurred, he or she may consider whether to declare a
mistrial, but when possible, he or she may also attempt to remedy the error.
The decision of whether or not to declare a mistrial falls within the
discretion of the judge, who must assess whether there is a real danger that
trial fairness has been compromised (see Emkeit, supra, at pp.
139-40; R. v. Martineau (1986), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 573 (Que. C.A.), at p.
576; R. v. Lessard (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 552, [1992] R.J.Q.1205 (C.A.),
at pp. 559-63 C.C.C.; R. v. Taillefer (1995), 100 C.C.C.
(3d) 1, 40 C.R. (4th) 287 (Que. C.A.), at p. 54 C.C.C.).  Although that
discretion is not absolute, its exercise must not be routinely second-guessed
by the court of appeal.

 








80                              
A decision on whether an incident has affected trial fairness in a way
which would warrant declaring a mistrial must take into account any corrective
measure which has been brought, or could be brought, by the judge to remedy the
irregularity (see e.g. Lessard, supra, at pp. 559-63
C.C.C.; R. (R.), supra, at p. 197; R. v. Siu
(1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 301 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 327).  Similarly, it is
interesting to note that in decisions involving the possibility of granting a
“stay of proceedings”, an inquiry into the possible alternative solutions
available to remedy an apprehension of unfairness is also relevant (see Canada
(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997]
3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 90; R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R.
411, at para. 75).

 

81                              
Thus, when a trial judge realizes that an error has occurred but decides
not to order a mistrial, the court should consider the remedy selected by the
judge, if any, as one of the elements in its assessment of whether the trial
has been or has appeared unfair.  If the remedy chosen by the judge consisted
of a warning to the jury on what they should or should not consider in reaching
their verdict, the ability of a jury to follow instructions must be recognized,
although this reality is obviously subject to its own limits.  In the case of R.
v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 692-94, Dickson C.J.
stated: 

 

In my view, it would be quite wrong to make too
much of the risk that the jury might use the evidence for an improper
purpose. This line of thinking could seriously undermine the entire jury system.
The very strength of the jury is that the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence
is determined by a group of ordinary citizens who are not legal specialists and
who bring to the legal process a healthy measure of common sense. The jury is,
of course, bound to follow the law as it is explained by the trial judge. Jury
directions are often long and difficult, but the experience of trial judges is
that juries do perform their duty according to the law. . . .
 

 

It is of course, entirely possible to construct an
argument disputing the theory of trial by jury. Juries are capable of egregious
mistakes and they may at times seem to be ill‑adapted to the exigencies
of an increasingly complicated and refined criminal law. But until the paradigm
is altered by Parliament, the Court should not be heard to call into question
the capacity of juries to do the job assigned to them. The ramifications of any
such statement could be enormous. Moreover, the fundamental right to a
jury trial has recently been underscored by s. 11 (f) of the Charter .
If that right is so important, it is logically incoherent to hold that juries
are incapable of following the explicit instructions of a
judge. . . .

 

We should maintain our strong faith in juries which
have, in the words of Sir William Holdsworth, “for some hundreds of years been
constantly bringing the rules of law to the touchstone of contemporary common
sense” (Holdsworth, A History of English Law (7th ed. 1956), vol. I, at
p. 349). [Emphasis in original.]

 








82                              
Thus, we should not presume that jurors are incapable of following
instructions given by the judge.  On the contrary, when the judge issues a
clear and forceful warning about the use of some information, we are entitled
to presume that it diminishes the danger that the jury will misuse this
information when rendering its verdict. 

 

83                              
The Quebec Court of Appeal case of Lessard, supra,
provides an interesting illustration.  Four men were charged with several
murders in relation to alleged biker gang disputes.  During the course of the
jury’s deliberations, one of the jurors revealed to the judge that he had been
bribed to vote in favour of an acquittal.  He also told the judge that he had
revealed this matter to the other jurors.  The judge declined to declare a
mistrial.  He decided to discharge this particular juror, and to continue the
deliberations with eleven jurors, as allowed by s. 644(2) of the Code. 
He took the precaution of warning the remaining jurors to take into
consideration only the evidence that was presented before them, and to not let
what they had learned about the attempted bribe influence their decision.  The
Quebec Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of the trial judge to go on with
the trial and upheld the conviction.  Baudouin J.A. emphasized at p. 563 C.C.C.
the privileged position of the trial judge when choosing the appropriate remedy
when such mistakes happen during a trial:

 

[translation]
The trial judge is the person, much more so than the Court of Appeal judges
several years later, in the best position to assess its true, concrete and
practical impact on the jury, in light of the general atmosphere in which the
trial took place, the specific circumstances of the case, of what he may have
observed during all the stages of the trial and the reaction of the members of
the jury at the time of his comments on the incident.  He is also in the best
position to find a solution which would neutralize the poison distilled in the
minds of the jury.  His decision must therefore be given the greatest respect
and it is only where the evidence shows that he was clearly mistaken and that
he did not properly exercise his discretion that, in my view, a Court of Appeal
can and must intervene.

 








84                              
Fifth, one must keep in mind that what matters most is the effect
of the irregularity on the fairness of the trial and the appearance of
fairness.  Therefore, it will not be a mitigating factor that the irregularity
did not result from a deliberate act by the Crown, the judge, or one of the
court officials.  In some cases, the intentional nature of the irregularity may
be a factor which will contribute to the appearance of unfairness.  However,
one should not invoke the accidental nature of an irregularity to argue that it
is less likely to have triggered a “miscarriage of justice”. 

 

85                              
Sixth, the attitude of defence counsel if and when he was confronted
with the irregularity may have an impact.  Therefore, if defence counsel had an
opportunity to object to the irregularity and failed to do so, this militates
for a finding that the trial was not unfair (see Imrich v. The Queen,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 622, at p. 631; Lewis v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 821,
at p. 840; R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at paras.
36-38).  Of course, this is not absolutely determinative, as a trial can be
declared unfair even if defence counsel failed to object (see e.g. R. v.
Arcangioli, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129).  








86                              
If the accused’s counsel himself saw no unfairness resulting from a
certain irregularity at trial, this would tend to indicate that the trial was
not unfair, in reality or appearance.  Even if an irregularity might seem
prejudicial to the accused, the failure to object may very well be a calculated
tactical decision by defence counsel.  Hence, courts must be careful to avoid
second-guessing such tactical decisions (see e.g. R. v. G.D.B.,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, 2000 SCC 22, at paras. 34-35; R. v. Terceira
(1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 32, aff’d [1999] 3 S.C.R. 866; R.
v. P. (G.) (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 263 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 286).
The inference drawn from counsel’s failure to object may be even stronger when
he expressly gave his consent to the alleged irregularity.  Finally, the more
counsel had time to reflect to bring an objection, the more this criterion will
be determinative, and the more it will be appropriate to infer that the trial
was not unfair (see R. v. Chambers, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293,
at p. 1306).  

 

87                              
I note that none of these factors should be absolutely determinative on
its own.  Rather, they should be considered together in light of the
circumstances of each case in order to assess whether the trial has been
unfair.  Moreover, these criteria are not exhaustive.  Other factors may be
articulated which will inform the analysis under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of
the Code to determine whether a “miscarriage of justice” has occurred. 

 

C.  The
Curative Proviso in Section 686(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the Code

 

88                              
The second stage of the analysis is the applicability of s. 686(1)(b). 
(For an account of the proviso’s legislative history, see R. R. Price and
P. W. Mallea, “‘Not by Words Alone’: Criminal Appeals and the No
Substantial Wrong or Miscarriage of Justice Rule”, in V. M.
Del Buono, ed., Criminal Procedure in Canada (1982), 453, at pp.
457-61.)  Although it was adopted in several stages, it should now be viewed
and construed in its totality.  It evinces a legislative intent to allow courts
of appeal to cure all kinds of procedural irregularities and errors in law,
provided the required conditions for its application are met.  The structure of
these provisions acknowledges that, when an error of law or a procedural
irregularity is established, a presumption is created in favor of allowing the
appeal, unless it is shown that the error or irregularity is curable.  At this
point in its legislative development, the scope of application of the proviso
appears now to have become a broad one.  It calls upon appellate courts to
assess the relevance of legal issues, the fairness of the process and the
prejudice to the accused. 

 








89                              
The proviso is currently governed by s. 686(1)(b)(iii) and (iv)
of the Code.  Paragraph (b)(i) provides that the court of appeal
may dismiss an appeal by substituting a conviction for a lesser included
offence.  This particular provision is of no interest to us in the present
analysis.  Paragraph (b)(ii) instructs the appellate court  to reject
the appeal  if none of the defects presented in para. (a) have been
found.  Thus, by necessary implication, this means that paras. (b)(iii)
and (b)(iv) inevitably address situations where the court of appeal has
first found that one of the grounds of para. (a) has been satisfied in
the first stage of the analysis, but may nevertheless dismiss the appeal at the
second stage.

 

90                              
 Section 686(1)(b)(iii) allows an appellate court to uphold a
conviction despite the fact that it was based on an “error of law”, within the
meaning of para. (a)(ii), provided that “no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred”.  In order to invoke this provision
successfully, the Crown must demonstrate that any reasonable judge or jury
would have rendered the same verdict (see R. v. Brooks,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 237, 2000 SCC 11, at para. 104; R. v. Cleghorn,
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 175, at para. 39; R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2
S.C.R. 599, at pp. 616-17; R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1
S.C.R. 909, at p. 919).  Even though an important error of law could have
influenced the decision, it would not be appropriate to reverse the conviction
when the evidence is so overwhelming against the accused that it would
inevitably lead to the same result.  Since a new trial before a reasonable
judge or jury would inevitably lead to a conviction, to order a new trial would
only result in a waste of time and resources.  Similarly, when the court of
appeal finds that the evidence against the accused would inevitably have led to
the same result, it can uphold a conviction despite having found under
para. (a)(iii) that a procedural irregularity not amounting to a
miscarriage of justice had occurred.  

 








91                              
It is true that this Court, in Fanjoy, supra, at pp.
239-40, refused to consider the application of the proviso in para. (b)(iii)
to cure a conviction which had been tainted by a failure to limit an improper
cross-examination of the accused.  The Court underlined that para. (b)(iii)
was, by its express words, applicable to cure only errors of law under para. (a)(ii). 
However, it is important to stress that para. (b) now contains a fourth
subparagraph which was not in force at the time the Fanjoy case was
heard.  In fact, in July 1985, a few months after Fanjoy was heard by
this Court and shortly before the decision was released, Parliament amended the
Criminal Code  and added s. 686(1) (b)(iv) (see the Criminal 
Law Amendment Act, 1985, R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 145).  This
provision states that a court of appeal may uphold a conviction if 
“notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial court had
jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was convicted and
the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice
thereby”.  

 

92                              
Parliament seems to have attempted to answer a problem in the structure
of s. 686(1) of the Code through this amendment by conferring upon
courts of appeal the power to cure procedural irregularities not amounting to a
miscarriage of justice in the same way as “errors of law” may be cured.  Thus,
it appears now that s. 686(1)(b)(iv) allows a court of appeal to
uphold a conviction despite a procedural irregularity which is alleged to be
miscarriage of justice as understood in para. (a)(iii). 

 








93                              
This solution is the most logical.  Indeed, why should it be possible
under s. 686(1)(b) to cure any important “error of law”, but not another
irregularity allegedly falling within the residual category of “miscarriage of
justice” without actually being such a failure of justice?  The two types of
defects often share the common ground that they may render the trial unfair or
apparently so.  There is no valid reason for allowing only one of the two types
of errors to be cured under para. (b), but not the other.  In the end,
they may have a similar impact on the validity of the trial and the
conviction.  

 

94                              
In Fanjoy, this Court had no other choice but to refuse to apply
the proviso since, at the time, para. (b)(iv) did not exist and para. (b)(iii)’s
wording made it only applicable to cure errors of law under para. (a)(ii),
as it did not view the failure to control abusive cross-examination as such an
error (p. 240, per McIntyre J.).  However, since the legislative
amendment of 1985, it is now appropriate to allow for a procedural error not
amounting to a “miscarriage of justice” under para. (a)(iii) to be cured
under para. (b), when any reasonable judge or jury would inevitably have
reached the same verdict. 

 








95                              
According to some interpretations given to s. 686(1)(b)(iv), the
addition of this provision had been a long-delayed response to a
jurisdictional  problem raised in Meunier v. The Queen (1965), 48 C.R.
14, aff’d [1966] S.C.R. 399.  In that case, the Quebec Queen’s Bench and this
Court held that the provision which is now s. 686(1)(b)(iii) did not
allow a court of appeal to cure a procedural irregularity resulting in the loss
of jurisdiction of the trial court.  A few years after the addition of s.
686(1)(b)(iv), the Ontario Court of Appeal described this provision as a
solution to the Meunier problem in R. v. Cloutier (1988), 43
C.C.C. (3d) 35.  It had been designed to catch procedural errors which caused a
loss of the initial jurisdiction over the matter.  The Court of Appeal drew a
distinction between three different kinds of error.  At page 48 of its reasons,
the Ontario Court of Appeal distinguished errors of substance, which arise when
the trial court has no jurisdiction over the class of offences and which are
not in the nature of procedural irregularities, errors of a relatively minor
nature which do not result in a loss of jurisdiction, and irregularities in
procedure which are so serious in nature that they are deemed to be matters of
substance which result in loss of jurisdiction.

 

96                              
According to the Ontario Court of Appeal in Cloutier, s. 686(1)(b)(iv)
will not cure an absence of jurisdiction.  It will not apply to an irregularity
that could be  cured under s. 686(1)(b)(iii).  It will allow the Court
of Appeal to cure substantial procedural errors triggering a loss of
jurisdiction provided it was of the view that the error caused no prejudice to
the appellant.  

 

97                              
To be sure, s. 686(1)(b)(iv) catches errors that are
jurisdictional in nature in the sense that they cause the loss of a jurisdiction
which already existed (see R. v. Simard (1989), 36 Q.A.C. 74, at para.
25).  It allows a court of appeal to remedy errors that were committed when
there was jurisdiction over the matter but when it was lost by reason of a
substantial procedural error.  With respect to the other views, its application
does not appear limited to procedural errors or  irregularities which caused a
loss of jurisdiction.  The addition of para. (b)(iv) does not appear
only as a late reaction to the Meunier judgment, but was also intended
to cover situations like the one which arose in Fanjoy, supra.
 It is designed to address situations where even serious procedural errors
may be cured, provided it can be shown that they did not cause prejudice to the
accused.  Case comments seem to indicate that the provision may find its
application in cases of substantial procedural error, where the error may or
may not cause a loss of jurisdiction but causes no prejudice.  (See E. G.
Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings & Practice in Canada (2nd ed.
(loose-leaf)), vol. 2, at para. 23: 1080; see Béliveau and Vauclair, supra,
at pp. 833-34; R. v. Fabre (1990), 46 Q.A.C. 133; R. v. Deyardin
(1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 365, [1997] R.J.Q. 2367 (C.A.).)

 








98                              
Section 686(1)(b)(iv) takes its place in a set of provisions
which were gradually added to the Criminal Code .  In the end, these
provisions attempt to prevent the annulment of criminal verdicts or mistrials
for reasons that relate essentially to technicalities of the law, which have no
real bearing on the fundamental legality or fairness of a trial.

 

99                              
Section 686(1)(b) demonstrates an intention to avoid useless
debates and litigation on the proper characterization of an error or
irregularity in the conduct of a criminal trial.  Instead, it allows courts to
go straight to the problem of the existence and applicability of some remedy. 
These curative provisions seek to avoid an unduly formalistic approach to
criminal procedure as Proulx J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal put it in Primeau
v. La Reine, [2000] R.J.Q. 696, at p. 705:

 

[translation]
Shortly after the decision in R. v. C.N., the Supreme Court of Canada
clearly set out, in R. v. Clunas, its approach to criminal procedure,
which deviates fundamentally from the traditional formalistic approach and is
consistent with the philosophy underlying the curative proviso (s. 686(1) (b)(iv)
Cr.C .).  In the opinion of the Supreme Court, which adopted what had been said
by Kelly J. in R. v. Kennedy, a vital objective of criminal procedure is
to ensure that the accused may present a full answer and defence in a manner
that will not prejudice him; accordingly, any procedural deviation that does
not cause any prejudice should not result in the invalidity of the proceedings,
such as the information in this case, which moreover satisfied all of the
procedural requirements of an indictment.  That is the conclusion I have
reached in this case, by refusing to have the appellant benefit from a
technical irregularity which he could have invoked at trial but which his
silence or ignorance cannot now revive to serve as an argument to invalidate a
trial whose fairness is not in issue. 

 

 (See also Taillefer
v. La Reine, [1989] R.J.Q. 2023 (C.A.), at p. 2041.)

 








100                          
Even though many procedural errors fall under s. 686(1) (b)(iii),
the flexible provision of s. 686(1) (b)(iv) may also cover situations
where a serious breach of a rule of procedure has occurred.  In order to apply
s. 686(1) (b)(iv), the court of appeal does not have to inquire whether
or not it resulted in a loss of jurisdiction, or whether it will cause (within
the technical sense of the word) such a loss of jurisdiction or to extend the
meaning of the concept of a loss of jurisdiction in order to cure it.  (See Deyardin,
supra, at pp. 371-72 C.C.C.)  Even if the error is significant, the clause
allows the court of appeal to focus on the core issues of the trial, whether it
took place in conformity with the principles of the criminal law and justice
and in essential fairness to the accused.  On the other hand, it will not
remedy a failure of justice or an error of law which may affect the verdict in
a significant manner or in the absence of jurisdiction.

 

101                          
Attempts at classifying errors arising out of the interplay of several
actors in the criminal trial as errors of law for the purpose of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
fail to catch the complexity of such situations.  Such an approach may try to
bring these cases under s. 686(1) (b)(iii), in a roundabout way by
focussing the analysis entirely on the decision or action the presiding judge
took or failed to take in respect of a particular problem.  A broader and more
flexible application of s. 686(1) (b)(iv) will better reflect the nature
of those situations, as it acknowledges their often complex nature which may
require consideration of the behaviour of other actors in the criminal  trial,
and not only of the judge.  What is at stake in these cases is not only the
legal assessment of the validity of the legal decision of the court, but also
an evaluation of the conduct of all the actors in particular incidents during
the course of a criminal trial.  Section 686(1) (b)(iv) is designed to
safeguard the essential requirements of substantive justice within the criminal
trial system, while at the same time protecting trials and verdicts against the
impact of technical mistakes in the conduct of a trial, such as procedural
irregularities or errors of law which do not result in a miscarriage of
justice, cause no prejudice to the  accused or do not have any significant
impact on the legality of the verdict.

                          









102                          
This interpretation would give a fuller meaning to s. 686(1) (b)(iv),
given that s. 686(1) (b)(ii) already states that the court of appeal may
reject the appeal when none of the grounds mentioned in para. (a) is
satisfied.  Thus, para. (b)(iv) would necessarily have to apply to cure
the defects in either para. (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii). 
Yet it obviously is not designed to apply to “unreasonable verdicts” covered by
para. (a)(i).  And as for “errors of law” in para. (a)(ii), they
are already covered by the traditional proviso in para. (b)(iii).  Thus
the only option left is to apply para. (b)(iv) to cure serious
procedural irregularities falling under para. (a)(iii), which may or may
not cause a loss of jurisdiction.  This is consistent with the reasoning behind
the existence of the proviso, which is to avoid ordering unnecessary new
trials.  

 

103                          
In addition, as we have seen earlier, the fact that the proviso may be
applied to cure both “errors of law” as well as procedural irregularities
diminishes the problem associated with the distinction between the two concepts
and the classification of the two categories of errors.  In many cases, it may
be difficult to decide whether a particular fact situation falls within an
“error of law” or a “procedural error”.  As I indicated earlier, in some cases
the categorization may even appear quite artificial.  However, since the
analysis remains similar, in respect of both categories, and also since s.
686(1) (b) may be applied in the same manner to both, the end result
remains equivalent.    

 

104                          
It is important to realize, however, that whether s. 686(1) (b) is
used to cure an “error of law” or a procedural irregularity not amounting to
miscarriage of justice, the test should remain a very demanding one.  Section
686(1) (b) may be used only when the conviction was “inevitable” (S.
(P.L.), supra, at p. 918).  In Bevan, supra, Major J.,
writing for the majority, summarized the applicable test as follows (at pp.
616-17):








 

The question to be asked in determining whether
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice as a result of a
trial judge's error is whether “the verdict would necessarily have been
the same if such error had not occurred”: see Colpitts v. The
Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, per Cartwright J. (as he then was), at p.
744; Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 328‑29.
This test has also been expressed in terms of whether there is any
possibility that if the error had not been committed, a judge or properly
instructed jury would have acquitted the accused: see Colpitts, per
Spence J., at p. 756; R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R.
909, per Sopinka J., at p. 919; R. v. Broyles,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at p. 620; R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1
S.C.R. 697, per Iacobucci J. at pp. 736‑37. I do not interpret
these two approaches as being intended to convey different meanings. Under
either approach, the task of an appellate court is to determine whether there
is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different
had the error at issue not been made. [Emphasis added.]

 

105                          
Thus, it is not sufficient for the court of appeal to agree with the
first verdict or to think that the same jury would have convicted.  They must
be convinced that any other reasonable judge or jury would necessarily have
convicted.  Courts of appeal must respect the primary role of trial judges and
juries in making factual determinations after having heard and seen the
evidence.  Thus, a finding by a court of appeal that the conviction was
“inevitable” must be reserved only for the most obvious cases.  

 








106                          
In other cases where, although the evidence appears clear, the written
record does not allow the court of appeal to conclude that any other judge or
jury would necessarily have rendered a guilty verdict, the appropriate avenue
is to order a new trial.  This approach must be carefully followed, and courts
of appeal must resist the temptation of applying routinely s. 686(1) (b),
unless they are convinced that a new trial would result in the same verdict.  A
too flexible and broad application of the provision might jeopardize the right
of the accused to the fairness and regularity of the trial process and would
not respect the distinction between the respective roles of trial courts and
appellate courts in that process.  On the basis of these principles, I shall
now turn to the alleged irregularities invoked in the case at bar.

 

D.  The
Alleged Irregularities in the Case at Bar

 

107                          
Under s. 686(1)(a) of the Code, which is the first step of
the analysis, we must first determine which subparagraph of s. 686(1) (a)
will apply.  Before the Court of Appeal, the accused had argued that the
conviction should be quashed because the verdict was unreasonable, pursuant to
para. (a)(i).  The Court of Appeal however rejected this argument and
this issue is not validly before us.  

 

108                          
As indicated above, two issues were raised before this Court.  The first
issue relates to the circumstances surrounding jury selection in this case. 
The second issue relates to the tainted transcripts which were given to the jury
during their deliberations.  In my view, the only truly debatable issue in this
case is the second one.  

1.    The Circumstances Surrounding Jury
Selection

 

109                          
I shall begin by discussing briefly the first issue, which the Court of
Appeal refused to consider, but was raised again before us.  It relates to an
alleged defect in the jury selection process.  The appellant had also been
charged with the murder of his sister, Bibi Khan.  The appellant had originally
been charged and tried on the two counts together, and was convicted.  After a
decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal (R. v. Khan
(1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 108) raising concerns of similar fact evidence set the
convictions aside, the two counts were tried separately.  When the case at bar
was tried, the appellant had already been convicted separately of the murder of
his sister, and his conviction was under appeal.








 

110                          
The alleged problem derives from the fact that prospective jurors waiting
to be selected in this case may have discussed the appellant’s other trial for
the murder of his sister. The appellant submitted that prospective jurors were
not instructed not to  talk about the case or the appellant while awaiting jury
selection.  Despite the fact that the appellant was to benefit from a separate
trial on this indictment, it was revealed by prospective jurors in front of
already-selected jurors during challenges for cause that the sister’s murder
case had been discussed in the jury array.  The appellant argues that the
entire panel should have been rejected as the jurors which had already been
selected were tainted by these comments. It is further argued that this issue
should have been litigated before the trial judge but could not be because
another justice presided over jury selection. 

 

111                          
There was no irregularity in the jury selection process.   The challenge
for cause process is designed to deal with the very issue of juror bias. 
Jurors are not required to be utterly ignorant of pre-trial publicity or media
comment.  They are instead required to swear that they will try the case free
of bias and render a true verdict on the evidence.  Some jurors were indeed
challenged upon the very basis about which the appellant now complains, and
were found to be unbiased.  

 

112                          
The jury selection issue was argued before the presiding justice in the
selection process.  In refusing a motion for a mistrial, the justice noted that
each trier had been found to be unbiased and had sworn to decide the case based
on the evidence.  He warned the jury members to ignore extraneous information
and asked if they had heard anything “today or since you were sworn in which
has affected your ability to arrive at a true verdict based on [the evidence]”.


 








113                          
In my view, the confirmation solicited by the presiding justice that the
jury remained unaffected by anything they heard during the challenge for cause
process removed any appearance of, or actual, unfairness from the jury
selection process.  Further, the hearing of the initial motion for a mistrial
by the presiding justice rather than the trial judge was the fair approach in
my view given that the presiding justice was the one who saw and heard what
occurred.  As well, the trial judge reheard the motion.  The appellant was
given full opportunity to subsequently argue this issue before her, although
without any success.

 

2.    The Issue of the Tainted Transcripts

 

114                          
The only real question before us relates to the jury’s exposure to the
tainted transcripts which contained the voir dire information.  The leak
of the tainted transcript to the jury was certainly an error or an
irregularity.  Obviously, the reason the jury is excluded from the courtroom
when a voir dire is held is that they should not hear what is said in
that context.  Thus, their being given access to the transcripts from the voir
dire during their deliberations defeats the purpose of the rule and has the
potential for rendering the trial unfair, depending on the circumstances.

 








115                          
This mistake does not seem to be in the nature of an “error of law” as
understood by s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Code.  This is not really a
case where the judge made a “decision on a question of law” which was among the
bases of a conviction.  The error was more akin to a procedural irregularity
which happened by accident.  The only legal ruling which the judge issued in
relation to the tainted transcripts was her decision not to order a mistrial. 
As mentioned earlier, this type of decision is discretionary.  Of course, this
discretion cannot be exercised abusively, but an abuse of discretion by the
trial judge is not an “error of law” within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(ii)
of the Code (see Fanjoy, supra, at pp. 239-40). Thus, as
this case does not seem to fall squarely within the “error of law” category,
this becomes a matter to be examined under s. 686(1) (a)(iii), in the
residual category of procedural irregularity.

 

116                          
In the case at bar, did a “miscarriage of justice” occur?  Was the
irregularity fatal in the context of s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of the Code? 
In other words, did the fact that transcripts from the voir dire were
inadvertently given to the jury during their deliberations render the trial
unfair or create an appearance of unfairness?  The question should be answered
in the negative.

 

117                          
First, the irregularity did not relate to a point which was particularly
central in law or in fact to the case against the accused.  The main objects of
contention in the present case were the “washerwoman syndrome” and the
inference which should be drawn from it, as well as the alibi offered by the
appellant.  The tainted transcripts did not contain any information which was
related to these points or to any other major element of the case against the
appellant.  It was rather a general inference that the appellant might have
made some statements which were ruled inadmissible. Thus, while this can still
lead to an unfair trial depending on the circumstances, the fact that it did
not relate to a central issue militates against a finding of unfairness.

 








118                          
Second, was the irregularity in the case at bar of significant
importance?  Although it is quite likely that the jury might not have read the
problematic passages, which were buried among 348 pages of testimony, I will
assume for the sake of the analysis that the jury had read them.  But even if
the jurors read the problematic passage, what could they have understood from
it?  I note that the passage did not contain the declarations of the appellant
themselves, but rather a discussion between defence counsel and the judge,
vaguely suggesting that the appellant might have made some statements which
were ruled inadmissible.  This is not as serious as if the jury had been
exposed to the actual statements, or if it was clear from the passage that some
incriminating statement had been made by the appellant.

 

119                          
In addition, as the respondent has pointed out before this Court, the
main problematic extract is worded in hypothetical terms.  This therefore would
indicate that no negative inference could be drawn against the appellant:

 

MR. GLAZER: I beg to disagree, My Lady.  The law as
understand it is -- for example, My Lady had ruled that certain comments
by the accused are inadmissible.  If the witness during the course of his
testimony refers to those comments as forming the basis of some of his opinion,
it would be grounds for a mistrial.  He can only refer to what is before the
jury; he can’t refer to evidence that is not before the jury.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

120                          
The hypothetical nature of this extract is reinforced by the fact that
other hypothetical references had been made before.  Thus, prior to the above
quoted extract, the transcripts contain the following comment:

 

MR. GLAZER: No.  My concern -- I might as well deal
with it now -- is that I hope my friend isn’t going to ask this witness to
reveal hearsay that he relied on that has not been tendered as evidence in
court because that would be inadmissible.  For example, if certain
photographs are not filed and the witness says he’s basing his opinion on
photographs that haven’t been filed, that is inadmissible.  If he says that
he’s basing his opinion based on temperature he believes was taken, but that
temperature was not filed as an exhibit or tendered as evidence in the trial,
then, the jury has to be told to disregard that.  [Emphasis added.]

 

121                          
Thus, if a juror happened to lay his eyes on these passages, it is
reasonable to infer that he probably would have perceived them as expressing a
hypothesis.  He or she would not have found in them a confirmation that actual
statements were ruled inadmissible.

 








122                          
The third factor, which is whether the trial was held before a judge sitting
alone or before a judge and jury, obviously militates for a finding of
unfairness.  In fact, it is because the trial was before a jury that this
tainted transcript causes a problem.  If the trial had been held before a judge
sitting alone, the fact that the judge would know that some evidence was
excluded would not be problematic, as the judge is allowed to have such
knowledge without creating an appearance of unfairness.

 

123                          
However, we must also consider in that regard the fourth factor, which
is the warnings given by the judge to the jury.  All doubts concerning the
unfairness or appearance of unfairness of the trial are, in my view, put to
rest in the circumstances of this case when we consider the remedy chosen by
the judge when she realized that the tainted transcripts had been leaked to the
jury.  The judge explained to the jury on several occasions that they should
only consider what they had seen or heard during the proceedings.  The judge
even specified that, if they had read anything else in the transcripts which
were given to them, they should not consider it.  After the tainted transcripts
were taken from the jury, the judge warned the jury in strong and clear terms:

 

Members of the jury, it's come to my attention that
among some of the transcripts that you were provided with today that they
contain some matters that took place while you were not in the courtroom and
they are matters that were not properly put before you in evidence.

 

As I indicated to you in my charge to you, the only
things that you are to base your decision on are the exhibits and the evidence
that you heard from the witness box when you were here and on no other
considerations.  I can't strongly caution you enough that your decision is to
be based solely on what was put before you through the witnesses and through
the evidence that was filed. 

 

What I have done is I have taken the transcripts
that were provided to you.  We're in the process of preparing proper
transcripts and those will be given back to you when they're ready.

 








                          Again, please, bear in
mind when you're deliberating that only matters that were put before you in
your presence are to be considered by you and nothing else, and, please, if
there is anything in the transcripts that you have read that wasn’t before you,
I urge you to put it out of your mind completely. 

 

The next day,
she warned them again in the following terms:

 

We’re now in a position to give you clean copies of
all of the transcripts.  And before I do so, I again wish to urge you to
remember the oath you took to render a true verdict based only on the evidence
that was before you.  I'm not certain whether you read anything that was in the
transcripts that wasn't before you properly, but if you did, please put it out
of your mind and look deep into yourself and make sure that you render a
verdict based only on what was properly before you, that is the witness
testimony and the exhibits that were filed in this case. 

 

Finally, the
final charge to the jury contained the following remarks: 

 

You will recall that during the course of my
preliminary remarks to you at the commencement of these proceedings, I advised
you that you are the sole judges of the facts in this case.  You were sworn to
bring in a true verdict according to the evidence.  That means that you should
only consider the testimony and the exhibits which have come before you at this
trial.  You must put out of your minds all prejudice against the accused and
all sympathy for the deceased, which you may have, or anything which you may
have heard or read or seen apart from the actual evidence that was given by the
witnesses under oath in the witness box, exhibits admitted as evidence and
admissions of facts made by counsel.

 








124                          
The appellant before this Court attempted to downplay the importance of
these warnings by pointing out that the jurors were not warned specifically
what extracts they should ignore. Given the possibility that the jurors might
not have read them, telling them which extracts she was referring to would most
likely have done more harm than good.  Thus, it was appropriate not to tell
them more than needed about the contents of these extracts.  If one of the
jurors ever read the problematic passages, then the carefully worded warnings
given by the trial judge were sufficient to ensure that no prejudice was caused
to the appellant and that the trial did not appear unfair.  

 

125                          
I am satisfied that no “miscarriage of justice” within the meaning of
s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of the Code has occurred.  It is therefore
not necessary to examine whether the conviction could be saved under the
curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code. 

 

V.  Order

 

126

The following is the judgment delivered by

 

1                                  
The Court -- This appeal
by the Crown was filed as of right under s. 693(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which provides that:

 

693. (1) Where a judgment of a court of
appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under section 675 or
dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph 676(1)(a), (b) or
(c) or subsection 676(3), the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court of
appeal dissents; . . .

 

2                                  
The respondent did not appear and the Court appointed an amicus
curiae to assist in responding to this Crown appeal.  We are grateful to
the amicus for her submissions.








3                                  
We have considered the proper application of s. 693(1) (a) and,
for the reasons that follow, we are all of the view that we have no
jurisdiction to hear this appeal as the dissent in the Court of Appeal ((2000),
38 C.R. (5th) 130) is not a dissent on a question of law within the meaning of
that section.  Accordingly, the appeal must be quashed.

 

4                                  
The respondent was convicted of driving while disqualified, contrary to
s. 259(4)  of the Criminal Code , and his conviction was set aside by the
Quebec Court of Appeal, Chamberland J.A. dissenting.  The oral judgment of the
trial court was very brief, and led to different interpretations in the Court
of Appeal as to some critical findings of fact made -- or not made -- by the
trial judge.

 

5                                  
Dussault J.A., for the majority, concluded that the trial judge believed
the respondent, or at least had a reasonable doubt, as to whether he knew that
he was disqualified from driving at the relevant time (para. 22).  It is on
that basis that he embarked upon an examination of the issues of mistake of
fact, mistake of law, and officially induced errors.  In his conclusion
Dussault J.A. reiterated that [translation]
“unless he found that the [accused’s] explanation was not credible, the judge
could not base a verdict of guilty on the fact that he failed to carry out
certain research” (para. 25).

 

6                                  
In contrast, Chamberland J.A. stated at the outset, referring to the
reasons of Dussault J.A.:  [translation]
“. . . I do not view the matter in the same way as he does” (para.
32).  Although he appeared to leave open any factual resolution of the issues
at the outset of his reasons, Chamberland J.A. stated later that:  [translation]  “The trial judge’s
reasoning, brief though it is, makes it possible, in my view, to say that he
found that the mental element of the offence, namely knowledge of the
disqualification from driving, was established” (para. 51); [translation] “This finding by the trial
judge was entirely justified” (para. 52).








 

7                                  
Even though the reasons in the Court of Appeal express differences of
opinion of legal issues, the dissent of Chamberland J.A. does not rest on a
question of law alone.  Rather, his dissent is based, at most, on a mixed
question of fact and law and, as such, does not give rise to the application of
s. 693(1) (a).

The appeal is quashed.

on appeal from
the court of appeal for alberta

 

Criminal law – Fresh evidence – Due Diligence – Competence of trial
counsel – General approach to miscarriages of justice based on existence of
fresh evidence – Fresh evidence available at trial but not adduced into
evidence because of tactical decision of trial counsel – Whether due
diligence criterion of test to admit fresh evidence met – Whether trial
counsel was incompetent – Whether failure to use fresh evidence at trial
resulted in miscarriage of justice.

 








The accused was charged with three sexual offences.  At trial, the
complainant, the accused’s adopted daughter, testified that he began touching
her in a sexual manner when she was 12 years old and that the
inappropriate conduct culminated in 1984 when he sexually assaulted her by
having non‑consensual sexual intercourse.  The complainant left home the
day of that incident.  She first complained to the police in 1994.  Because of
a tactical decision of defence counsel, an audio-taped conversation between the
complainant and her mother, in which the complainant denied that she had been
sexually molested by the accused, was not introduced into evidence.  The tape
had been surreptitiously recorded by the mother in 1984, a few days after the
alleged incident.  In cross-examination, the complainant denied having had any
contact with her mother at that time.  In her testimony, the mother
contradicted the complainant’s evidence.  The jury convicted the accused of
sexual assault and indecent assault but acquitted him of sexual assault with
alleged forced sexual intercourse.  On appeal, new counsel sought reversal of
the convictions on the grounds that the accused’s trial counsel was incompetent,
or that the fresh evidence not used at trial on counsel’s advice impacted on
the issue of guilt or innocence, and the failure to use this evidence resulted
in a miscarriage of justice.  The Court of Appeal appointed a commissioner to
conduct an inquiry concerning whether the fresh evidence relating to guilt or
innocence and to the competence of defence counsel was credible.  Informed by
the commissioner’s findings, a majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the
accused’s appeal.

 








Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

The four criteria applicable to an appeal based upon fresh evidence
were stated by this Court in Palmer to be due diligence, relevancy of
the evidence, credibility of the evidence and the expectation that it would
have affected the result.  The due diligence criterion will be met where the
evidence was not led due to the incompetence of counsel.  A finding of
incompetence requires the appellant to establish, first, that counsel’s acts or
omissions constituted incompetence and, second, that a miscarriage of justice
resulted.  Where it is apparent that no prejudice has occurred, it will usually
be undesirable for appellate courts to consider the performance component of
the analysis.  Here, defence counsel satisfied the commissioner and all three
members of the Court of Appeal that his decision was competent and may have
resulted in the accused’s acquittal on the most serious charge.  Defence
counsel had feared that the production of the tape would destroy the
credibility of his main witness, the accused’s spouse, and the destruction of
her credibility would have forced the accused, who counsel considered to be a
poor witness, to testify.  Where, in the course of a trial, counsel makes a
decision in good faith and in the best interests of his client, a court should
not look behind it save only to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  While there
are decisions that defence counsel are ethically bound to discuss with the
client and regarding which they must obtain instructions, on the facts of this
case, counsel had the carriage of the defence and the implied authority to make
tactical decisions in the best interests of his client.  In any event, the
failure to obtain specific instructions did not affect the outcome of the
trial.  In the absence of a miscarriage of justice, the question of the
competence of counsel is usually a matter of professional ethics and is not a
question for the appellate courts to consider.  Since defence counsel had
implied authority to decide not to use the tape, the accused has failed to
satisfy the due diligence criterion. 

 








The due diligence criterion, however, is not an essential requirement
of the fresh evidence test, particularly in criminal cases, and it must yield
in circumstances where its rigid application would result in a miscarriage of
justice.  The accused failed to establish that such a danger exists.  Not only
were the tapes unlikely to adversely affect the credibility of the complainant
but it was reasonable to conclude that using the tape at trial would have
undermined the credibility of the accused’s spouse.  The fact that she chose to
create the tape in 1984 could be seen as an apprehension that criminal conduct
had occurred.  There exists no reasonable possibility that the use of the
“fresh” evidence in this case might have affected the two guilty verdicts
rendered by the jury.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (1999), 133
C.C.C. (3d) 309, 232 A.R. 307, 195 W.A.C. 307, [1999] A.J. No. 342 (QL),
dismissing the accused’s appeal from his conviction for sexual
assault and indecent assault.  Appeal dismissed.

 

Ben R. Plumer, for the appellant.

 

Joshua B. Hawkes, for the respondent.

 

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1                                  
Major J. – The appellant,
G.D.B. was convicted of sexual and indecent assault.  He was sentenced to
concurrent terms of 36 and 20 months’ imprisonment.  He was acquitted on a
count of sexual assault which alleged forced sexual intercourse.  His appeal was
dismissed by a majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal.

 

2                                  
This appeal as of right considers whether a new trial ought to be
ordered on the basis of fresh evidence.

 

3                                  
The evidence sought to be admitted was the taped recording of the
complainant denying misconduct on the part of the appellant.   This evidence
was available at trial but not used because of a tactical decision of trial
counsel.

 

4                                  
The appellant now submits that his trial counsel was incompetent and
that that incompetency satisfies the need to establish that the evidence could
not have been adduced at trial on the exercise of due diligence.

 








5                                  
I conclude, for the reasons that follow, that in the absence of a
miscarriage of justice, the question of the competence of counsel is usually a matter
of professional ethics and is not a question for the appellate courts to
consider.  In the result, the appeal fails.

manner when she was 12 years old.  It happened, she said, on numerous occasions
when he entered her bedroom, either at night, or at other times and in other
locations when they were alone.  She further testified that the inappropriate
conduct culminated in June 1984, when the appellant sexually assaulted her by
having non-consensual sexual intercourse.  The complainant left home that day. 
She first complained to the police about these incidents in 1994, when she was
a mature and married woman and had lived away from home for over a decade.  

 

7                                  
The “fresh” evidence to be considered on this appeal is an audio-taped conversation
between J.W. and her mother, M.B., in which J.W. denied that she had been
sexually molested by the appellant.  The recording was surreptitiously taped by
M.B. in 1984, a few days after J.W.’s departure from home.  Ten years later,
when the complainant brought her story to the police, M.B. gave the tape to the
appellant’s lawyer.  The tape remained in his possession throughout the trial.

 








8                                  
Trial counsel chose not to introduce the tape in evidence.  Instead, he
raised questions about the contents of the tape on cross-examination of the
complainant who was not aware that the tape existed.  The complainant denied
having had any contact with her mother, M.B., until about three months after
she had left home permanently.  She had no specific recollection of the
detailed conversation which was put to her in cross-examination at the trial.  

 

9                                  
The appellant did not testify.  The appellant's spouse M.B. testified
and contradicted the complainant's evidence about the conversation, which she
said occurred shortly after the complainant left home.  She said that the
complainant came with her boyfriend to collect her clothes and that the
conversation occurred at that time.  During the conversation, M.B. attempted to
find out why the complainant had left home.  Although at trial M.B. did not
give a verbatim report of the questions and answers, she stated that she asked
the complainant on several occasions whether the appellant had assaulted or
molested her and, each time, the complainant denied having been assaulted in
any manner.  According to M.B.'s testimony, the only reason the complainant
gave for leaving home was her dislike of the strict rules she was required to
follow.  

 

10                              
The complainant's sister, S.B., also testified.  While she did not
confirm the discussion about a denial of any sexual impropriety, she confirmed
her mother's evidence that the complainant returned home within a few days of
leaving, and had a conversation with her mother in which she indicated that her
reason for leaving was her dislike of the strict house rules.

 

11                              
The jury acquitted the appellant of the most serious charge, sexual
assault, which alleged forced intercourse to have occurred the day the
complainant left home, and convicted the appellant of the other two charges.  

 

II.    Judicial
History

 








12                              
On appeal, new counsel sought reversal of the convictions on grounds:
(1) the appellant's trial counsel was incompetent, or (2) the fresh evidence
not used or called at trial on the advice of counsel, was evidence that
impacted on the issue of guilt or innocence, and the failure to use this
evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

  

13                              
As the affidavits filed on the fresh evidence application raised issues
of credibility and fact which could not be conveniently resolved by the Court
of Appeal, the court appointed the Honourable Roger P. Kerans, as a
commissioner, pursuant to s. 683(1) (e)(ii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  He was to conduct an inquiry on the following
questions: 

 

(1)   Is the first kind of fresh evidence that Mr.
B. wishes this court to consider, that relating to guilt or innocence, credible
in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief?

 

(2)   Is the second kind of fresh evidence that
Mr. B. wishes this court to consider, that relating to the competence of his
trial counsel, credible in the sense that Mr. Kerans believes it? We ask that
he make findings of fact in this regard.

 

((1997), 200 A.R. 184, at p. 187)

 

Commissioner
Kerans held extensive hearings, took evidence from all material parties and
filed a detailed report.  He found the following to be an accurate
transcription of the relevant portion of the tape:

 

M.B.:   So what happened?

 

J.B.:     Well nothing has changed since last time
Mom.

 

M.B.:   J., He hasn't laid a hand on you.  I've
hardly ever left you home and he hasn't touched you that way.  Be honest.

 

J.B.:     I am.

 








M.B.:   Don't hurt me anymore.  Don't lie to me
about that, please.  I mean if you have made up your mind to leave home fine,
but don't do that to me.  Dad hasn't laid a hand on you, has he?

 

J.B.:     Well he still bugs me and stuff.

 

M.B.:   But he hasn't laid a hand on you, has he?

 

J.B.:     Well.

 

M.B.:   Has he?

 

J.B.:     Well not, he isn't as bad as he was but
he still comes up and slaps you and stuff like that.  I tell him to leave me
alone and he just says  I'm not hurting you.  But it bugs me.

 

M.B.:   But he's never molested you, has he?

 

J.B.:     No.

 

M.B.:   He's never put his hand sexually on you
did he?

 

J.B.:     No.

 

M.B.:   So in other words, all he did was tease
you a little bit.  Right?

 

J.B.:     Yes.

 

There were no
other statements inconsistent with the complainant J.B.’s testimony on the
tape.   (J.B. is J.W.’s maiden name.)

 

14                              
Informed by the findings of the Commissioner, a majority of the Court of
Appeal denied the appellant’s appeal:  (1999), 232 A.R. 307.  In their view,
the decision not to use the tape was not incompetence, but was made by defence
counsel for sound tactical reasons.  In addition, they concluded that the
appellant had not satisfied the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence enunciated
by this Court in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. 

 








15                              
In the view of the dissenting justice, although the evidence was
available at the trial, and although counsel’s decision not to use the evidence
was not incompetence, he stated the evidence of the tape was sufficiently
compelling that it might have affected the outcome of the appellant’s trial and
would have ordered a new trial.

 

III.               Analysis

 

A.                General Approach to
Miscarriages of Justice Based on the Existence of Fresh Evidence

 

16                              
This appeal centers on the existence of fresh evidence.  The well-known
criteria applicable to this issue were stated in Palmer, supra,
and reaffirmed recently in R. v. Warsing, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579, at para.
50:

 

(1)   The evidence should generally not be
admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided
that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case
as in civil cases. . . .

 

(2)   The evidence must be relevant in the sense
that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

 

(3)   The evidence must be credible in the sense
that it is reasonably capable of belief, and

 

(4)   It must be such that if believed it could
reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
have affected the result.

 

B.                Due Diligence

 

17                              
The “fresh” evidence was in the continuous possession of the appellant’s
wife since 1984 and available to him and his lawyer at anytime before or during
the trial.  Counsel after taking possession of the tape decided for tactical
reasons not to use it.  The Court of Appeal concluded that the appellant failed
to satisfy the due diligence requirement of the Palmer analysis.

 








18                              
However, the appellant emphasized that the decision not to use the tape
was made unilaterally by his lawyer, and against his express instructions. 
Defence counsel, he claims, failed to inform him of his decision and, as a
result, the appellant was not aware that the tape would not be used until the
completion of the trial.  It was submitted that the appellant, by the
incompetence of his counsel was deprived of any opportunity to exercise due
diligence in ensuring that the recording would be used at his trial to
challenge the credibility of the complainant.

 

19                              
The due diligence criterion exists to ensure finality and order --
values essential to the integrity of the criminal process.  R. v. M. (P.S.) (1992),
77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), per Doherty J.A., at p. 411:

 

The interests of justice referred to in s. 683  of the Criminal Code 
encompass not only an accused's interest in having his or her guilt determined
upon all of the available evidence, but also the integrity of the criminal
process. Finality and order are essential to that integrity.  The criminal
justice system is arranged so that the trial will provide the opportunity to
the parties to present their respective cases and the appeal will provide the
opportunity to challenge the correctness of what happened at the trial. 
Section 683(1)(d) of the Code recognizes that the appellate
function can be expanded in exceptional cases, but it cannot be that the
appellate process should be used routinely to augment the trial record.  Were
it otherwise, the finality of the trial process would be lost and cases would
be retried on appeal whenever more evidence was secured by a party prior to the
hearing of the appeal.  For this reason, the exceptional nature of the
admission of ''fresh'' evidence on appeal has been stressed: McMartin v. The
Queen, supra. . . .

 

However,
jurisprudence pre-dating Palmer has repeatedly recognized that due
diligence is not an essential requirement of the fresh evidence test,
particularly in criminal cases.   That criterion must yield where its rigid
application might lead to a miscarriage of justice.  McMartin v. The Queen,
[1964] S.C.R. 484, per Ritchie J. at p. 491:

 








In all the circumstances, if the evidence is
considered to be of sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the
verdict of the jury, I do not think it should be excluded on the ground that
reasonable diligence was not exercised to obtain it at or before the  trial.

 

In R. v.
Price, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 633, per Sopinka J. at p. 634:

 

. . . we agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the
evidence should be admitted as fresh evidence and the conclusion to direct a
new trial.  While the exercise of due diligence is one of the significant
factors, it is not applied strictly in criminal cases and must be applied in
light of the other relevant factors.  The amount of weight to be given to this
factor depends on the strength of the other factors, in other words, on the
totality of the circumstances.

 

Also Warsing,
supra, at para. 51. The due diligence requirement is one factor to be
considered in the “totality of the circumstances”.  The importance of this
criterion will vary from case to case.

 

20                              
In determining whether or not the due diligence required by Palmer
has been met, an appellate court should determine the reason why the evidence
was not available at the trial.  The reason for the evidence not being
available at first instance is usually one of fact.  In this appeal the
evidence was available.  The reason it was not used, placed in its most
favourable light for the appellant, was the unilateral decision of his counsel
that the tape would be more prejudicial than helpful in the trial.

 

21                              
It was submitted by the appellant’s new counsel that the decision not to
use the tape was incompetent, and that the appellant’s obligation to exercise
due diligence was met by this alleged incompetence.  The argument concluded
that the test of due diligence was therefore met, the tape as new evidence
should be admitted, and a new trial ordered.  

 








22                              
In the absence of a miscarriage of justice, that submission fails.

 

C.                Effective Assistance of
Counsel

 

(1)   Introduction

 

23                              
While the early history of the common law shows that society had little
interest in permitting anyone charged with a felony the assistance of counsel,
times have changed.  

 

24                              
Today the right to effective assistance of counsel extends to all
accused persons.  In Canada that right is seen as a principle of fundamental
justice.  It is derived from the evolution of the common law, s. 650(3)  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada and ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .

 

25                              
The value of effective assistance of counsel is apparent, but was fully
explained by Doherty J.A. in R. v. Joanisse (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35
(Ont. C.A.), at p. 57:

 








The importance of effective assistance of counsel
at trial is obvious.  We place our trust in the adversarial process to
determine the truth of criminal allegations.  The adversarial process operates
on the premise that the truth of a criminal allegation is best determined by
“partisan advocacy on both sides of the case”:  U.S. v. Cronic, 104 S.
Ct. 2039 (1984), per Stevens J. at p. 2045.  Effective representation by
counsel makes the product of the adversarial process more reliable by providing
an accused with the assistance of a professional trained in the skills needed
during the combat of trial.  The skilled advocate can test the case advanced by
the prosecution, as well as marshal and advance the case on behalf of the
defence.  We further rely on a variety of procedural safeguards to maintain the
requisite level of adjudicative fairness in that adversarial process. 
Effective assistance by counsel also enhances the adjudicative fairness of the
process in that it provides to an accused a champion who has the same skills as
the prosecutor and who can use those skills to ensure that the accused receives
the full benefit of the panoply of procedural protections available to an
accused.  

 

Where counsel fails to provide effective
representation, the fairness of the trial, measured both by reference to the
reliability of the verdict and the adjudicative fairness of the process used to
arrive at the verdict, suffers.  In some cases the result will be a miscarriage
of justice.  

 

(2)   General Approach to the Issue

 

26                              
The approach to an ineffectiveness claim is explained in Strickland
v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), per O’Connor J.  The reasons
contain a performance component and a prejudice component.  For an appeal to
succeed, it must be established, first, that counsel’s acts or omissions
constituted incompetence and second, that a miscarriage of justice resulted.  

 

27                              
Incompetence is determined by a reasonableness standard.  The analysis
proceeds upon a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide
range of reasonable professional assistance.  The onus is on the appellant to
establish the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been
the result of reasonable professional judgment.  The wisdom of hindsight has no
place in this assessment.

 

28                              
Miscarriages of justice may take many forms in this context.  In some
instances, counsel’s performance may have resulted in procedural unfairness. 
In others, the reliability of the trial’s result may have been compromised.

 








29                              
In those cases where it is apparent that no prejudice has occurred, it
will usually be undesirable for appellate courts to consider the performance
component of the analysis.  The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to
grade counsel’s performance or professional conduct.  The latter is left to the
profession’s self-governing body.   If it is appropriate to dispose of an
ineffectiveness claim on the ground of no prejudice having occurred, that is
the course to follow (Strickland, supra, at p. 697).  

 

(3)   Application to the Facts of this Case

 

30                              
Two questions arise.  Did the decision not to use the tape lie
exclusively with defence counsel?  If not, what was the consequence of the
appellant being excluded from the decision?

 

31                              
The question of whether or not to use the tape was important.  Defence
counsel satisfied the Commissioner and all three members of the Court of Appeal
that his decision was competent.  In fact, they concluded that it may have
resulted in the appellant’s acquittal on the most serious charge of forced
sexual intercourse.

 

32                              
The Commissioner concluded that while counsel was evasive in
communicating his decision to the appellant, his reasons for not using the tape
were sound.  Primarily, he feared that the production of the tape would destroy
the credibility of his main witness, the appellant’s spouse M.B.  The leading
nature of the questions she asked her daughter and the fact that she felt it
necessary to surreptitiously record their conversation revealed that she was
more interested in obtaining a taped denial for the purposes of future
litigation than in obtaining an accurate account of events.  The destruction of
M.B.’s credibility would have forced the appellant, who counsel considered to
be a poor witness, to testify.

 








33                              
The appellant submitted that even if counsel’s decision was sound, he
was obligated to inform the appellant of this decision and accord him the
opportunity to participate in it.  In my opinion, it is for the Law Society of
Alberta to consider whether defence counsel’s conduct in the circumstances
complied with the standards of the profession in that province.  The issue is
dealt with expressly by such guidelines as Rule 12 of Chapter 9 of the Alberta
Code of Professional Conduct (loose-leaf).  That question of professional
ethics is different from those addressed here.

 

34                              
Where, in the course of a trial, counsel makes a decision in good faith
and in the best interests of his client, a court should not look behind it save
only to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  While it is not the case that
defence lawyers must always obtain express approval for each and every decision
made by them in relation to the conduct of the defence, there are decisions
such as whether or not to plead guilty, or whether or not to testify that
defence counsel are ethically bound to discuss with the client and regarding
which they must obtain instructions.  The failure to do so may in some
circumstances raise questions of procedural fairness and the reliability of the
result leading to a miscarriage of justice.

 

35                              
On the facts of this case, I conclude that counsel had the carriage of
the defence and the implied authority to make tactical decisions, as the ones
made here, in the best interests of his client.  In any event, the failure to
obtain specific instructions did not affect the outcome of the trial.  There
was no miscarriage of justice.

 

(4)   Conclusion                                                                 

 

36                              
In light of my conclusion that defence counsel had implied authority to
decide not to use the tape, the appellant has failed to satisfy the due
diligence requirement of the Palmer analysis.

 

D.                Was the Reliability of the
Trial’s Result Compromised?








37                              
As noted above, the due diligence criterion is not essential to a
successful appeal based on fresh evidence.  This factor must yield in
circumstances where its rigid application would result in a miscarriage of
justice.  In my view, the appellant has failed to establish that such a danger
exists.

 

38                              
The contents of the recorded conversation were relevant to the central
issue at trial, namely the credibility of the complainant.  In response to M.B.’s
leading questions, J.W. is heard to deny that the appellant molested her or put
his hand on her sexually.

 

39                              
With respect to the credibility of the “fresh” evidence, Commissioner
Kerans found that it was of little probative value and would likely have had a
prejudicial effect on the credibility of M.B.:

 

First, the passage in question, along with many
similar passages, and the mere fact of recording would lead to serious doubt on
the part of a trier about the reliability of the evidence of [M.B.] that she
had made a careful and open-minded inquiry into  events in 1984, when she
heard, or fancied she heard, a complaint. . . .

 

Counsel for the accused accepts that [M.B.]
“conducted an interview in a ‘say it ain’t so’ manner.” Counsel for the Crown
in turn described her as “coercive and emotional” in dealing with a child who
is “captive and tricked”.  Suffice it to say that [M.B.] on the tape is, in my
respectful opinion, much more anxious to get a denial than she is to let [J.W.]
tell her story, and much more anxious to offer reproach than to reach out with compassion. 
That is true of the entire tape, where eventually [J.W.] becomes monosyllabic
and finally lapses into silence while the mother reproaches her repeatedly for
the wrong done the mother by the girl leaving....

 

I am, moreover, of the view that a trier likely
would infer from this that the conversation in 1982 was similar in tone, as
indeed [J.W.] testified.  That being the case, a trier likely would accept as
credible the evidence of [J.W.] that she would likely never would have told
[M.B.] the particulars of a complaint, because her mother had set her mind not
to believe it.

 








Commissioner
Kerans expressed doubt as to whether the evidence was in any way helpful to the
appellant’s defence against the two charges for which he was convicted:

 

It is another matter entirely if one considers this
tape evidence in terms of the incidents for which the accused has been found
guilty, these being the events of 1982 and before.  There is no denial of the
truth of that allegation in this recording.  On the contrary, in the passage
above [J.W.] repeats that claim:  “Well, nothing has changed since last time
Mom”. And she is so understood by her mother: “[J.W.] He hasn’t laid a hand on
you.”  In my respectful view, that is reasonably capable of being considered by
a trier [of fact] as a repetition of the original complaint.  Moreover, the
trier, noting no immediate denial by [M.B.] of the accuracy of that claim, may
reasonably infer that she then knew at the very least that it had never been
withdrawn, contrary to her trial evidence.

 

In this light, the evidence in question may be of
no use to the defence in respect of counts 2 and 3 but may indeed have been of
value to the Crown in that regard.

 

A review of
the transcript of the recorded conversation confirms the good sense of the
findings of the Commissioner.  The statements made by the complainant lacked
conviction.  They were out-of-court statements made at a time of vulnerability
for the complainant.  Most important, the complainant’s statements were in
response to leading questions by M.B. who was clearly determined to obtain a
taped denial in preference to an accurate account of events.

 

40                              
Not only were the tapes unlikely to adversely affect the credibility of
the complainant but it was reasonable to conclude that using the tape at trial
would have undermined the credibility of the appellant’s spouse, the main
defence witness. The fact that she chose to create the tape in 1984 could be
seen as an apprehension that criminal conduct had occurred.  In my view, there
exists no reasonable possibility that the use of the “fresh” evidence in this
case might have affected the two guilty verdicts rendered by the jury.

                            









41                              
Although there is no indication that the appellant expressed a desire to
testify at his trial, he submits that defence counsel’s failure to inform him
of his decision not to use the tape deprived him of his ability to make an
informed decision in this regard.  The Commissioner made the following findings
relevant to this submission (as summarized by the Court of Appeal):

 

a.  Trial Counsel’s opinion, before and during trial, was that the
appellant might damage his defence by testifying because he might give
inappropriate answers in cross-examination.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

c.  Trial counsel believed that the appellant could say little more
than to give a blanket denial.  This opinion was born out by the appellant’s
testimony in the inquiry.

 

d.  The appellant knew before trial that his counsel had no intention
of calling him to testify.  He agreed with that decision.  There was no
misunderstanding between himself and trial counsel.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

l.     As to whether trial counsel clearly advised
his client before trial that he would not use the tape, trial counsel testified
that each time the matter came up he expressed no great enthusiasm for the
evidence, but that it may well be that he had, at the opening of the trial,
never quite said explicitly that he would not introduce it.

(232 A.R. 307, at pp. 313-14)

 

Given these
findings, I am satisfied that the appellant has failed to establish that the
results of his trial might have been different had he been expressly informed
of his counsel’s decision not to use the tape.

 

IV.              Disposition

 

42                              
I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Mandatory minimum
sentences -- Robbery -- Criminal Code providing for mandatory minimum sentence
of four years where firearm used in commission of robbery -- Whether sentencing
judge may reduce minimum sentence to take into account pre-sentencing custody
-- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 344 (a), 719(3) .

 

The accused pleaded guilty to one count of robbery
while using a firearm. At the time of his sentencing, he had been in custody
since his arrest almost three months earlier. Pursuant to s. 719(3)  of the
Criminal Code , the sentencing judge gave the accused credit for time
served and sentenced him to three and one-half years’ imprisonment. On appeal,
the Court of Appeal imposed the minimum sentence of four years’ imprisonment
required by s. 344(a) of the Code.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

For the reasons given in R. v. Wust, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18, a sentencing judge may give credit for time served in
pre‑sentencing custody, even if that credit results in a sentence below
the mandatory minimum, since mandatory minimum sentences must be interpreted
and administered in a manner consistent with the criminal justice system's
overall sentencing regime.

I.  Introduction

This appeal was heard at the same time as two other cases, R. v. Wust,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 455,  2000 SCC 18, and R. v. Arthurs, [2000] 1 S.C.R.
481, 2000 SCC 19, which are released concurrently with this decision.  The
issue is whether, when Parliament has imposed a mandatory minimum sentence, the
court may deduct from that sentence the time spent by the offender in custody
while awaiting trial and sentence, if this has the effect of reducing the
sentence pronounced by the court to less than the minimum provided by law.  For
the reasons I set out in Wust, s. 719(3) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which provides judges with the discretion to count
pre-sentencing custody in fixing the length of the sentence, may be applied to
the mandatory minimum sentence of four years’ imprisonment for robbery while
using a firearm under s. 344(a) of the Code.  I determined in Wust
that a sentencing judge may give credit for time served in pre-sentencing
custody, even if that credit results in a sentence below the mandatory minimum,
since this reflects the intention of Parliament that all sentences be
administered consistently within the context of the criminal justice system’s
sentencing regime.

 

II.  Factual
Background and Judicial History

 

A.  Factual
Background

 

2                                  
A brief review of the facts is necessary to dispose of this appeal.  On
January 15, 1997, the appellant robbed a gas station in Vancouver, British
Columbia.  He pointed a loaded shotgun at the attendant, holding the barrel
about five inches from the attendant’s chest and demanded money and
cigarettes.  He obtained both before driving away in a van, with which an
accomplice had been waiting.  A few moments later, the van was stopped by the
police and the appellant was apprehended after a short chase on foot.  

 

3                                  
The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of robbery while using a
firearm.  He was a 21-year-old drug addict with a record of 19 convictions
since April 1990.  He was remanded in custody for almost three months, pending
sentencing.

 

 

B.  British
Columbia Provincial Court








4                                  
Relying on the decision of Grist J. in R. v. Wust (1997), 43
C.R.R. (2d) 320 (B.C.S.C.), Bendrodt Prov. Ct. J. found that s. 721(3)  of the Criminal
Code  (now s. 719(3) ) could be applied to a mandatory minimum sentence in
the circumstances of this case.  The appellant was credited with six months for
the three months spent in pre-sentencing custody, resulting in the imposition
of a sentence of three years and six months’ imprisonment. 

 

C.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 43

 

5                                  
The appellant appealed his sentence, challenging the constitutionality
of the mandatory minimum punishment of s. 344 (a) as a violation of his
s. 12  Charter  right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment and
should the provision be upheld, seeking to defend the credit given for time
served.  The appeal was heard and decided at the same time as four other
sentencing appeals, all under s. 344 (a).  As previously noted, two of
those appeals were also heard in this Court together with the present case: Wust,
supra, and Arthurs, supra.

 

6                                  
McEachern C.J.B.C., writing for a unanimous court, upheld the
constitutionality of s. 344 (a) under s. 12  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and also held that the correct interpretation
of s. 344 (a) mandated the imposition of a sentence of at least four
years. Because s. 719(1) provides that a sentence begins when it is imposed,
McEachern C.J.B.C. held that it was not possible to reduce a sentence to
account for time served while awaiting sentence, if such a discount results in
a sentence of less than the required minimum.  Thus, in the appellant’s case,
the court dismissed his appeal and allowed the Crown’s appeal, increasing the
appellant’s sentence to the four-year minimum.

 








III.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

7                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

344.  Every person who commits robbery is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable 

 

(a)  where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence,
to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term
of four years; and

 

(b)  in any other case, to imprisonment for life.

 

719. . . .

 

(3)  In determining the sentence to be imposed on a
person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in
custody by the person as a result of the offence.

 

IV.  Conclusion and Disposition

 

8                                  
The only issue before this Court is whether the Court of Appeal erred in
reversing the trial judge’s decision to apply s. 719(3) to give credit for the
time the appellant had already served in custody awaiting sentencing.  For the
reasons given in Wust, supra, I find that the Court of
Appeal did err in so doing.

 








9                                  
This case, like Arthurs, supra, illustrates again
the unfairness that results from an interpretation of the Criminal Code 
that precludes granting credit for time served prior to sentence.  The
appellant was detained following his guilty plea, but while awaiting sentence. 
It would be unfair if this period of time, which after a guilty plea is
undoubtedly part of the punishment, were to be added to the minimum required by
law, rather than computed as part of it.  For these reasons and the reasons
given in Wust, supra, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
judgment of the Court of Appeal  and reinstate the sentence
imposed on the appellant by Bendrodt Prov. Ct. J.

Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Mandatory minimum
sentences -- Robbery -- Criminal Code providing for mandatory minimum sentence
of four years where firearm used in commission of robbery -- Whether sentencing
judge may reduce minimum sentence to take into account pre-sentencing custody
-- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 344 (a), 719(3) .

 

The accused pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm. 
At the time of his sentencing, he had been in custody since his arrest
approximately four months earlier.  The sentencing judge imposed the minimum
sentence of four years’ imprisonment required by s. 344 (a) of the Criminal
Code  and declined to apply s. 719(3) of the Code to take
pre-sentencing custody into account.  The accused’s appeal against sentence was
dismissed.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be allowed.

 

For the reasons given in R. v. Wust, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18, a sentencing judge may give credit for time served in
pre‑sentencing custody, even if that credit results in a sentence below
the mandatory minimum, since mandatory minimum sentences must be interpreted
and administered in a manner consistent with the criminal justice system's
overall sentencing regime.

I.  Introduction

 








1                                  
This appeal was heard at the same time as two other cases, R. v. Wust,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18, and R. v. Arrance, [2000] 1 S.C.R.
488, 2000 SCC 20, which are released concurrently with this decision.  The
issue is whether, when Parliament has imposed a mandatory minimum sentence, the
court may deduct from that sentence the time spent by the offender in custody
while awaiting trial and sentence, if this has the effect of reducing the
sentence pronounced by the court to less than the minimum provided by law.  For
the reasons I set out in Wust, s. 719(3) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which provides judges with the discretion to count
pre-sentencing custody in fixing the length of the sentence, may be applied to
the mandatory minimum sentence of four years’ imprisonment for robbery while
using a firearm under s. 344(a) of the Code.  I determined in Wust
that a sentencing judge may give credit for time served in pre-sentencing
custody, even if that credit results in a sentence below the mandatory minimum,
since this reflects the intention of Parliament that all sentences be
administered consistently within the context of the criminal justice system’s
sentencing regime.

 

II.  Factual
Background and Judicial History

 

A.  Factual
Background

 

2                                  
A brief review of the facts is necessary to dispose of this appeal.  On
March 19, 1996, the appellant robbed a store in Victoria, British Columbia.  He
was armed with an unloaded, sawed-off shotgun.  He pointed the gun at the clerk
and demanded money.  After receiving about $500, the appellant fled.  

 

3                                  
Six days later, on March 25, 1996, the appellant, carrying the same
sawed-off shotgun, attempted to rob a convenience store.  The appellant
struggled with an employee of the store, knocking him down, and hitting him
four times with the gun.  The appellant fled the store without obtaining any
money and was apprehended a short distance away.  

 








4                                  
The appellant was arrested and provided a warned statement to the police
admitting both offences.  He was 28 years old at the time with no previous
convictions,  although he had received a conditional discharge for possession
of a prohibited weapon, a broken switch blade knife.  The appellant entered a
guilty plea.  At the time of his sentencing, the appellant had been in custody
for about four months. 

 

B.  British
Columbia Provincial Court

 

5                                  
In deciding whether to apply s. 721(3)  of the Criminal Code  (now
s. 719(3) ), to credit the four months that the appellant had spent in
pre-sentencing custody to reduce the four-year minimum sentence he was facing
under s. 344 (a), Ehrcke Prov. Ct. J. relied on R. v. Brown (1976),
36 C.R.N.S. 246 (Ont. Co. Ct.), for the proposition that a general statutory
provision yields to an express provision.  Thus, Ehrcke Prov. Ct. J. held that
s. 721(3)  could not be applied to a s. 344 (a) mandatory minimum sentence
and the appellant was given no credit for the four months he spent in custody
prior to sentencing.

 

6                                  
Ehrcke Prov. Ct. J. imposed the minimum sentence of four years for the
robbery, as well as a sentence of three years concurrent for the attempted
robbery, and a 10-year prohibition against possession of firearms on each
count. 

 

C.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 43

 

7                                  
The appellant appealed his sentences, challenging the constitutionality
of the mandatory minimum punishment of s. 344 (a) as a violation of his
s. 12  Charter  right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment
or treatment and the refusal of the sentencing judge to make a deduction for
time served.  The appeal was heard and decided at the same time as four other
sentencing appeals, all under s. 344 (a).  As previously noted, two of
those appeals were also heard in this Court together with the present case:  Wust,
supra, and Arrance, supra.  

 








8                                  
McEachern C.J.B.C., writing for a unanimous court, upheld the
constitutionality of s. 344 (a) under s. 12  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and also held that the correct interpretation
of s. 344 (a) mandated the imposition of a sentence of at least four
years. Because s. 719(1) of the Criminal Code  (formerly s. 721(1) )
provides that a sentence begins when it is imposed, McEachern C.J.B.C. held
that it was not possible to reduce a sentence to account for time served while
awaiting sentence, if such a discount results in a sentence of less than the
required minimum.  Thus, in the appellant’s case there was no variation in the
sentence imposed by the sentencing judge and his appeal was dismissed.

 

III.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

9                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

344.  Every person who commits robbery is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable 

 

(a)  where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence,
to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term
of four years; and

719. . . .

 

(3)  In determining the sentence to be imposed on a

IV.  Conclusion and Disposition

 








10                              
The only issue before this Court is whether the sentencing judge should
have applied s. 719(3) to consider whether the appellant’s sentence should be
reduced to give credit for the time he had already served in custody in
relation to these offences, and if so, by how much.  For the reasons given in Wust,
supra, I conclude that she should have done so.

 

11                              
This case, like Arrance, supra, illustrates again the
absurdity and the unfairness that results from an interpretation of the Criminal
Code  that precludes granting credit for time served prior to sentencing. 
The appellant was detained following his guilty plea, but while awaiting
sentence.  Such delay is often necessary to permit the court to make a better
informed decision about the appropriate sentence by obtaining input from a
pre-sentence report, or otherwise through materials collected by the parties. 
This is particularly important in the case of a first-time offender about whom
little may be known.  It would be grossly unfair if this period of time, which
after a guilty plea is undoubtedly part of the punishment, were to be added to
the minimum required by law, rather than computed as part of it.

 

12                              
For these reasons and the reasons given in Wust, supra, I
would allow the  appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal.  I
would remit the matter to the sentencing judge for consideration of how much
credit should be given to the appellant for the time served in pre-sentencing
custody.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 








Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Mandatory minimum
sentences -- Robbery -- Criminal Code providing for mandatory minimum sentence
of four years where firearm used in commission of robbery -- Whether sentencing
judge may reduce minimum sentence to take into account pre-sentencing custody
-- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 344 (a), 719(3) .

 

The accused pleaded guilty to charges of robbery with
a firearm and possession of a restricted weapon.  At the time of his
sentencing, he had been in custody since his arrest approximately seven and a
half months earlier.  He was sentenced to four and a half years’ imprisonment,
with a concurrent one-year term for possession of a restricted weapon, and was
credited one year for his pre-sentencing custody.  The resulting sentence was
three and a half years.  The Crown appealed the sentence, seeking to have it
increased to seven or eight years and to have the credit for pre-sentencing
custody set aside.  The Court of Appeal varied the sentence, reducing it to
four years and refusing credit for time served prior to sentencing.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 








Mandatory minimum sentences must be interpreted in a
manner consistent with the full context of the sentencing scheme, including
statutory remission.  A rigid interpretation of the interaction between
ss. 344 (a) and 719(3)  of the Criminal Code  suggests that
time served before sentence cannot be credited to reduce a minimum sentence
because it would offend the requirement that nothing short of the minimum be
served.  Such an interpretation, however, does not accord with the general
management of minimum sentences which are, in every other respect, “reduced”
like all others, even to below the minimum.  Pre‑sentencing custody is
time actually served in detention, and often in harsher circumstances than the
punishment will ultimately call for.  Credit for such custody is arguably less
offensive to the concept of a minimum period of incarceration than the granting
of statutory remission or parole.  Section 719(3)  ensures that the well‑established
practice of sentencing judges to give credit for time served when computing a
sentence remains available, even if it appears to reduce a sentence below the
minimum provided by law.  

 

Parliament did not exempt the s. 344 (a)
minimum sentence from the application of s. 719(3) .  Indeed, unjust
sentences would result if the s. 719(3)  discretion were not applicable to
the mandatory s. 344 (a) sentence.  Discrepancies in sentencing
between least and worst offenders would increase, because the worst offender,
whose sentence exceeded the minimum would benefit from pre‑sentencing
credit, while the first-time offender, whose sentence would be set at the
minimum, would not receive credit for his or her pre‑sentencing
detention.  These sections are to be interpreted harmoniously and consistently
within the overall context of the criminal justice system’s sentencing regime.

 

The well‑entrenched judicial discretion provided
in s. 719(3)  should not be compromised by a mechanical formula for
crediting pre‑sentencing custody.  The goal of sentencing is to impose a
just and fit sentence, responsive to the facts of the individual offender and
the particular circumstances of the commission of the offence.  In the past,
many judges have given more or less two months’ credit for each month spent in
pre‑sentencing detention.  This ratio reflects not only the harshness of
the detention owing to the absence of programs, but also the fact that none of
the remission mechanisms apply to that period of detention.  The credit cannot
and need not be determined by a rigid formula and is thus best left to the
sentencing judge.

I.  Introduction

 








1                                  
This appeal raises a legal issue of deceptive simplicity, which has
generated a number of contrary decisions in several courts of appeal.  The
issue is whether, when Parliament has imposed a mandatory minimum sentence, the
courts may deduct from that sentence the time spent by the accused in custody
while awaiting trial and sentence, if this has the effect of reducing the
sentence pronounced by the court to less than the minimum provided by law.  

 

 

2                                  
More specifically, in this appeal from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal we must determine whether a judge may exercise the
discretion provided for in s. 719(3)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , to credit time spent in pre-sentencing custody when
calculating the appropriate sentence for robbery while using a firearm under s.
344(a) of the Code.  Section 344 (a) prescribes a
mandatory minimum punishment of four years’ imprisonment. 

 

3                                  
Section 344 (a) is one of several amendments to the Code
prescribing mandatory minimum punishments for firearms-related offences, arising
from the enactment of the Firearms Act, S.C. 1995, c. 39 .  The Firearms
Act  amendments to the Code did not provide for any changes to the
sentencing provisions in s. 719 of the Code, which are of general application. 
In particular, s. 719(3)  provides that in determining the sentence to be
imposed, the court may take into account any time  spent in custody in relation
to the offence for which a person has been convicted.  The question of
whether this can be done in relation to mandatory minimum sentences has created
a problem of statutory interpretation which the courts of British Columbia,
Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia have variously addressed during the four years
since the amendments have been in force, reaching different conclusions
regarding the interaction between the two sections. 

 








4                                  
The Quebec Court of Appeal has held that it is not appropriate for the
trial judge to consider pre-sentencing custody in cases where such a
consideration would result in a sentence falling below the mandatory minimum: R.
v. Alain (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 177, and R. v. Lapierre (1998), 123
C.C.C. (3d) 332.  Proulx J.A. in Lapierre held (at p. 344) that the
punishment in s. 344 (a) required a sentence of four years’ imprisonment,
since a sentence commences from the day it is imposed, pursuant to
s. 719(1) of the Code.  However, Proulx J.A. also recognized (at
pp. 345-46) that removing the discretion to take account of the time spent in
custody created some difficulty, since the crediting of pre-trial custody is
based on fairness and the need to avoid injustice in the individual case. 

 

5                                  
Other courts have followed Lapierre and Alain in
determining that pre-trial custody may not be applied to mandatory minimum
punishments.  For example, Langdon J., in R. v. Sanko, [1998] O.J. No.
1026 (QL) (Gen. Div.), and Bateman J.A. of the Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal, in R. v. Morrisey (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 38, have both
held that it is not open to a trial judge to apply the discretion provided for
in s. 719(3) , where to do so would result in a sentence below the mandatory
minimum.  

 








6                                  
The reasoning of the Quebec Court of Appeal was also followed by the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in this case.  The appellant was one of five
persons who appealed their sentences, challenging the constitutionality of s.
344 (a) under s. 12  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and requesting that s. 719(3)  be interpreted to permit a reduction of the
mandatory minimum punishment set out in s. 344 (a) to take into
account pre-sentencing custody.  McEachern C.J.B.C., writing for a unanimous
Court of Appeal, upheld the constitutionality of s. 344 (a):  R. v.
Wust (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 43, at p. 59.  McEachern C.J.B.C. also
reasoned that, since a sentence commences upon its imposition under s. 719(1) ,
the mandatory language of s. 344 (a) precludes the judicial discretion
permitted by s. 719(3) , where such discretion would result in a sentence
of less than the required minimum of four years.  Otherwise, the mandatory
sentence prescribed by s. 344 (a) would be reduced impermissibly:  Wust,
at p. 60.

 

7                                  
At approximately the same time as the British Columbia Court of Appeal
was deciding Wust, the Ontario Court of Appeal was considering the same
issue in R. v. McDonald (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 57.  Rosenberg J.A.,
writing for a unanimous court, declined to follow the reasons of Proulx J.A. in
Lapierre, supra, and held that s. 719(3)  could be applied to s.
344 (a).  Following a thorough analysis of both s. 344 (a) and
s. 719(3) , based on principles of statutory interpretation and with reference
to Charter  values, Rosenberg J.A. held that pre-sentencing custody could
be considered even if such credit resulted in reducing the sentence imposed on
conviction below four years, since the total punishment would still equal the
mandatory minimum of four years.  Concurring with Rosenberg J.A. was Borins
J.A., who took the unusual opportunity to overrule his own earlier decision in R.
v. Brown (1976), 36 C.R.N.S. 246 (Ont. Co. Ct.), regarding the
inapplicability of s. 649(2.1)  (now s. 719(3) ) to the mandatory minimum
sentence set out in s. 5(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
N-1. 

 

8                                  
In another interesting turn of events, a five-judge panel of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, in R. v. Mills (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 451,
overturned its decision in the present case, adopting the reasons of Rosenberg
J.A. in McDonald.  The court in Mills held at pp. 458-59 that 

 

[i]ncarceration, whether before or after disposition, is a serious
deprivation of liberty, and being forced to ignore it as part of sentencing is
inherently unjust.  Moreover, not taking time in custody into account
can lead to unjust discrepancies between similarly situated offenders. . . .

 








9                                  
The task before this Court is to settle the controversy regarding
whether or not s. 719(3)  may be applied to sentences imposed under s. 344 (a),
and, by implication, to mandatory minimum sentences in general.  For the
reasons that follow, I find Rosenberg J.A.’s analysis in McDonald
compelling.  The McDonald decision makes it clear that this Court can
uphold both Parliament’s intention that offenders under s. 344 (a)
receive a minimum punishment of four years imprisonment and Parliament’s
equally important intention to preserve the judicial discretion to consider
pre-sentencing custody under s. 719(3)  and ensure that justice is done in the
individual case.

 

II.  Factual
Background and Judicial History

 

A.  Factual Background                                                                     

 

10                              
On July 5, 1996, the appellant and two accomplices robbed a gas station,
their faces covered with bandanas.  Two of them, including the appellant, were
armed.  The appellant pointed a loaded nine millimetre, semi-automatic pistol
into the cashier’s face, showed him that the gun was loaded and demanded money.
The cashier handed him $780 and the appellant struck him several times on the
head with his fist, and threatened to kill him if he gave the police his
description.

 

11                              
The appellant was arrested shortly thereafter and charged with both
robbery and possession of a restricted weapon.  He was 22 years old at the time
of the offence and had an extensive criminal record in both youth and adult
courts, with 30 convictions dating back to July 1990, including violent
offences.  A prohibition against possessing firearms was in force against him
at the time of the robbery.  He was detained pending trial and sentencing for a
period of seven and a half months.

 

B.  British
Columbia Supreme Court (1997), 43 C.R.R. (2d) 320

 








12                              
At trial in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Grist J. held that
the discretion allowed by s. 721(3) (now s. 719(3) ) of the Code is
applicable to sentences imposed under s. 344 (a), since to do otherwise,
and fail to give credit for time served would risk violation of s. 12  of the Charter . 
Grist J. determined that the appropriate sentence in this case was four and a
half years, with a concurrent sentence of one year for possession of a
restricted weapon.  The appellant was credited one year for his pre-sentencing
custody of seven and a half months, reducing his sentence, under s. 344 (a), 
to three and a half years. 

 

C.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 43

 

13                              
The Crown appealed that sentence to the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, seeking to have it increased from three and a half years to seven or
eight years on the basis of the accused’s lengthy criminal record.  The Crown
also sought to have the credit for pre-sentencing custody set aside.  The
appellant cross-appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the mandatory
minimum punishment of s. 344 (a) as a violation of his s. 12  Charter  right
to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. 

 

14                              
McEachern C.J.B.C., writing for a unanimous court, upheld the
constitutionality of s. 344 (a) under s. 12  of the Charter , and
also held that the correct interpretation of s. 344 (a) mandated the
imposition of a sentence of at least four years. Because s. 719(1) provides
that a sentence begins when it is imposed, McEachern C.J.B.C. held that it was
not possible to reduce a sentence to account for time served while awaiting
trial, if such a discount results in a sentence of less than the required
minimum.  However, if the credit does not result in a sentence of less than
four years, s. 719(3)  may be applied: Wust, at p. 60. 

 








15                              
McEachern C.J.B.C. also considered the Crown appeal against the 
sentence and concluded that, in the circumstances, the four and one-half years
imposed by the trial judge was not unfit.  He also found that the trial judge
did not commit an error in giving credit for time served prior to sentencing;
however, McEachern C.J.B.C. varied the sentence to allow a credit only to the
extent of reaching the minimum sentence of four years: Wust, at p. 61.

 

16                              
The appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal in this case was
heard and decided at the same time as four other sentencing appeals, all under
s. 344 (a).  Two of those appeals were also heard in this Court together
with the present case:  R. v. Arthurs, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 481, 2000
SCC 19, and R. v. Arrance, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 488, 2000 SCC 20,
released concurrently and to which these reasons apply as well.  

 

III.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

17                              
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

344.  Every person who commits robbery is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable 

 

(a)  where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence,
to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term
of four years; and

 

(b)   in any other case, to imprisonment for life.

 

718.1  A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2  A court that imposes a
sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(b)  a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on
similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; 

 








                                                                   .
. . 

 

718.3 (1)  Where an enactment prescribes
different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the
punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the
enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits
the offence.

 

(2)  Where an enactment prescribes a punishment in
respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the
limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that
convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum
punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.

 

.
. . 

 

719. (1)  A sentence commences when it is
imposed, except where a relevant enactment otherwise provides. 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(3)  In determining the sentence to be imposed on a
person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in
custody by the person as a result of the offence.

 

(4)  Notwithstanding subsection (1), a term of
imprisonment, whether imposed by a trial court or the court appealed to,
commences or shall be deemed to be resumed, as the case may be, on the day on
which the convicted person is arrested and taken into custody under the
sentence.

 

IV.  Analysis

 

A.  Mandatory Minimum Sentences and General Sentencing Principles

 

18                              
Mandatory minimum sentences are not the norm in this country, and they
depart from the general principles of sentencing expressed in the Code,
in the case law, and in the literature on sentencing.  In particular, they
often detract from what Parliament has expressed as the fundamental principle
of sentencing in s. 718.1 of the Code:  the principle of
proportionality.  Several mandatory minimum sentences have been
challenged under s. 12  of the Charter , as constituting cruel and unusual
punishment:  see, for example, R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, R.
v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, and Morrisey, supra.








 

19                              
On some occasions, a mandatory minimum sentence has been struck down
under s. 12 , on the basis that the minimum prescribed by law was, or could be,
on a reasonable hypothetical basis, grossly disproportionate to what the
circumstances called for.  See, for example, Smith, striking down s.
5(2) of the Narcotic Control Act; R. v. Bill (1998), 13 C.R.
(5th) 125  (B.C.S.C.), striking down the four-year minimum sentence for
manslaughter with a firearm under s. 236(a) of the Code; R. v.
Leimanis, [1992] B.C.J. No. 2280 (QL) (Prov. Ct.), in which the s. 88(1)(c)
minimum sentence of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act for driving under a s.
85(a) prohibition was invalidated; and R. v. Pasacreta, [1995] B.C.J.
No. 2823 (QL) (Prov. Ct.), where the same penalty as in Leimanis for
driving under a s. 84 prohibition was also struck down.

 

20                              
In other cases, courts have fashioned the remedy of a constitutional
exemption from a mandatory minimum sentence, thereby upholding the enactment as
valid while exempting the accused from its application: see R. v. Chief
(1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 265 (Y.T.C.A.), and R. v. McGillivary (1991), 62
C.C.C. (3d) 407 (Sask. C.A.).  Finally, in some of the cases where the courts
have upheld a minimum sentence as constitutionally valid, it has been noted
that the mandatory minimum sentence was demonstrably unfit or harsh in the case
before the court.  See, for example, McDonald, supra, at p. 85, per
Rosenberg J.A., and R. v. Hainnu, [1998] N.W.T.J. No. 101 (QL) (S.C.),
at para. 71.  

 








21                              
Even if it can be argued that harsh, unfit sentences may prove to be a
powerful deterrent, and therefore still serve a valid purpose, it seems to me
that sentences that are unjustly severe are more likely to inspire contempt and
resentment than to foster compliance with the law.  It is a well-established
principle of the criminal justice system that judges must strive to impose a
sentence tailored to the individual case: R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1
S.C.R. 500, at para. 92, per Lamer C.J.; R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1
S.C.R. 688, at para. 93, per Cory and Iacobucci JJ. 

 

22                              
Consequently, it is important to interpret legislation which deals,
directly and indirectly, with mandatory minimum sentences, in a manner that is
consistent with general principles of sentencing, and that does not offend the
integrity of the criminal justice system.  This is entirely possible in this
case, and, in my view, such an approach reflects the intention of Parliament
that all sentences be administered consistently, except to the limited extent
required to give effect to a mandatory minimum.        








23                              
In accordance with the umbrella principle of statutory interpretation
expressed by this Court in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1
S.C.R. 27, at paras. 20-23,  mandatory minimum sentences must be understood in
the full context of the sentencing scheme, including the management of
sentences provided for in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act,
S.C. 1992, c. 20 .  Several provisions of the Code, and of other
federal statutes, provide for various forms of punishment upon conviction for
an offence.  Most enactments providing for the possibility of imprisonment do
so by establishing a maximum term of imprisonment.  In deciding on the
appropriate sentence, the court is directed by Part XXIII of the Code to
consider various purposes and principles of sentencing, such as denunciation,
general and specific deterrence, public safety, rehabilitation, restoration,
proportionality, disparity, totality and restraint, and to take into account
both aggravating and mitigating factors.  The case law provides additional
guidelines, often in illustrating what an appropriate range of sentence might
be in the circumstances of a particular case.  In arriving at a fit sentence,
the court must also be alive to some computing rules, for example, the rule
that sentences cannot normally be back- or post-dated: s. 719(1) of the Code;
see also R. v. Patterson (1946), 87 C.C.C. 86 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 87, per
Robertson C.J., and R. v. Sloan (1947), 87 C.C.C. 198 (Ont. C.A.), at
pp. 198-99, per Roach J.A., cited with approval by Rosenberg J.A., in McDonald,
supra, at p. 71. 

 

24                              
Rarely is the sentencing court concerned with what happens after the
sentence is imposed, that is, in the administration of the sentence.  Sometimes
it is required to do so by addressing, by way of recommendation, or in 
mandatory terms, a particular form of treatment for the offender.  For instance
in murder cases, the sentencing court will determine a fixed term of parole
ineligibility:  s. 745.4 of the Code.  However, for the most part, after
a sentence of imprisonment is imposed, the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act  comes into play to administer that sentence, with the almost
invariable effect of reducing the amount of time actually served in detention. 
Under this Act, the offender earns statutory remission, that is, time that will
be automatically deducted from the sentence imposed.  Furthermore, he or she
will become eligible for escorted and unescorted temporary absences,
work releases, day parole and full parole, and statutory release.  In short, it
is quite possible, indeed, it is most likely, that the person sentenced will
not be incarcerated for the full period of time imposed in the sentence
pronounced by the court.

 

25                              
The Corrections and Conditional Release Act , in effect,
“deems” the time spent lawfully at large by the offender who is released on
parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence as a continuation
of the sentence until its expiration:  s. 128(1) .  This provision applies to
all sentences, even where the term of imprisonment imposed is a statutory
mandatory minimum.  

 








26                              
The Firearms Act  addressed the issue of the administration of
mandatory minimum sentences, but in a very minimal way by amending one section
of Schedule I of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act .  Schedule
I sets out the offences for which the sentencing court has power to delay
eligibility for full parole to the lesser of one-half of the sentence or
ten years, rather than the standard time for full parole eligibility of the
lesser of one-third of the sentence or seven years: s. 120(1)  of the Corrections
and Conditional Release Act , referring to, among other sections, s. 743.6
of the Code.  In s. 165, the Firearms Act  amends Schedule
I to include using an imitation firearm in the commission of an offence, as
prohibited by s. 85(2) of the Code. 

 

27                              
This slight amendment of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
by the Firearms Act  suggests that while Parliament turned its mind to
the administration of sentences when it was introducing the firearms-related
minimum sentences, it did not see fit to alter the general administration of
sentences in a way that would distinguish the new mandatory minimums from other
sentences.  It therefore follows that a rigid interpretation of s. 719(3) ,
which suggests that time served before sentence cannot be credited to reduce a
minimum sentence because it would offend the requirement that nothing short of
the minimum be served, does not accord with the general management of minimum
sentences, which are in every other respect “reduced” like all others, even to
below the minimum.  

 

28                              
In addition, and in contrast to statutory remission or parole,
pre-sentence custody is time actually served in detention, and often in harsher
circumstances than the punishment will ultimately call for.  In R. v. Rezaie
(1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), to which several lower courts have
referred in their consideration of pre-sentencing custody, Laskin J.A.
succinctly summarizes the particular features of pre-trial custody that result
in its frequent characterization as “dead time” at p. 104:

 








. . . in two respects, pre-trial custody is even more onerous than
post-sentencing custody.  First, other than for a sentence of life
imprisonment, legislative provisions for parole eligibility and statutory
release do not take into account time spent in custody before trial (or before
sentencing).  Second, local detention centres ordinarily do not provide
educational, retraining or rehabilitation programs to an accused in custody
waiting trial.  

 

29                              
As this quotation from Rezaie demonstrates, pre-sentencing
custody, pre-trial custody, pre-disposition custody and “dead time” are all
used to refer to the time spent by an accused person in detention prior to
conviction and sentencing.  For the purposes of this decision, I consider all
these terms to refer to the same thing; however, I prefer “pre-sentencing
custody” as it most accurately captures all the time an offender may have spent
in custody prior to the imposition of sentence. 

 

30                              
Several years ago, Professor Martin L. Friedland published an important
study of pre-sentencing custody in which he referred to Professor Caleb Foote’s
Comment on the New York Bail Study project, noting that “accused persons . . .
are confined pending trial under conditions which are more oppressive and
restrictive than those applied to convicted and sentenced felons”: Detention
Before Trial: A Study of Criminal Cases Tried in the Toronto Magistrates’
Courts (1965), at p. 104.  As Rosenberg J.A. noted in McDonald, supra, 
at p. 72:  “There has been little change in the conditions under which remand
prisoners are held in this province in the almost forty years since Professor
Friedland did his study”.  Considering the severe nature of pre-sentencing
custody, and that the accused person is in fact deprived of his or her liberty,
credit for pre-sentencing custody is arguably less offensive to the concept of
a minimum period of incarceration than would be the granting of statutory
remission or parole.  It is therefore ironic that the applicability of s. 719(3) 
has encountered such difficulties in the case of minimum sentences, simply
because the “interference” with the minimum is at the initial sentence
determination stage and thus more readily apparent.

 








31                              
As was pointed out by Rosenberg J.A. in McDonald at p. 73,
Parliament enacted the forerunner to s. 719(3)  of the Criminal Code  as
part of the Bail Reform Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2, for
the very specific purpose of ensuring that the well-established practice of
sentencing judges to give credit for time served while computing a sentence
would be available even to reduce a sentence below the minimum fixed by law. 
During the second reading of what was then Bill C-218, An Act to amend the
provisions of the Criminal Code relating to the release from custody of accused
persons before trial or pending appeal, Justice Minister John Turner
described Parliament’s intention regarding what is now s. 719(3) :

 

Generally speaking, the courts in deciding what
sentence to impose on a person convicted of an offence take into account the
time he has spent in custody awaiting trial.  However, under the present
Criminal Code , a sentence commences only when it is imposed, and the court’s
hands are tied in those cases where a minimum term of imprisonment must be
imposed.  In such cases, therefore, the court is bound to impose not less than
the minimum sentence even though the convicted person may have been in custody
awaiting trial for a period in excess of the minimum sentence.  The new version
of the bill would permit the court, in a proper case, to take this time into
account in imposing sentence.

 

(House of Commons Debates, 3rd Sess., 28th Parl., Vol. 3,
February 5, 1971, at p. 3118.)

 








32                              
Counsel for the respondent has directed this Court’s attention to the
remarks of then Justice Minister Allan Rock concerning Bill C-68, An Act
respecting firearms and other weapons, during the House of Commons debates
and before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.  On these
occasions, the Justice Minister articulated Parliament’s intention that the new
mandatory minimum sentences for firearms-related offences act as a strong
deterrent to the use of guns in crime.  See House of Commons Debates,
Vol. 133, No. 154, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., February 16, 1995, at pp. 9706 et
seq.; House of Commons, Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Evidence,
April 24, 1995, Meeting No. 105, and May 19, 1995, Meeting No. 147.  However,
when Parliament enacted s. 344 (a) as part of the Firearms Act  in
1995, Parliament did not also modify s. 719(3) , to exempt this new minimum
sentence from its application, any more than it modified the applicability of
the provisions of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act  to
mandatory minimum sentences.  For the courts to exempt s. 344 (a) from
the application of s. 719(3) , enacted specifically to apply to mandatory
minimum sentences, would therefore defeat the intention of Parliament.

 

33                              
All of the above suggests that if indeed s. 719(3)  had to be interpreted
such as to prevent credit being given for time served in detention prior
to sentencing under a mandatory minimum offence, the result would be offensive
both to rationality and to justice.  Fortunately, as was admirably explained by
Rosenberg J.A. in McDonald, supra, this result is avoided through
the application of sound principles of statutory interpretation.

 

34                              
In his judgment, Rosenberg J.A. employed several well-established rules
of statutory interpretation to conclude as he did, at p. 69, that s. 719(3) 
provides sentencing judges with a “substantive power to count pre-sentence
custody in fixing the length of the sentence”.  I agree with his analysis.  In
particular, I approve of his reference to the principle that provisions in
penal statutes, when ambiguous, should be interpreted in a manner favourable to
the accused (see R. v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at para.
29, per Lamer C.J.); to the need to interpret legislation so as to avoid
conflict between its internal provisions, to avoid absurd results by searching
for internal coherence and consistency in the statute; and finally, where a
provision is capable of more than one interpretation, to choose the
interpretation which is consistent with the Charter : Slaight
Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1078, per Lamer
J. (as he then was).  Without repeating Rosenberg J.A.’s analysis here, I wish
to make a few observations.








 

B. The
Distinction Between Punishment and Sentence

 

35                              
Rosenberg J.A. relied on the distinction between the meaning of the
words “punishment” and “sentence”, the former being used in s. 344 (a)
and the latter in s. 719(3) .  I set out the relevant provisions again, for ease
of reference:

 

344.  Every person who commits robbery is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable 

 

(a)  where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence,
to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for
a term of four years;

 

719.   . . .

 

(3)  In determining the sentence to be
imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any
time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence. [Emphasis
added.]

 








36                              
The distinction between “sentence” and “punishment” was developed by the
Canadian Sentencing Commission in its 1987 report, Sentencing Reform: A
Canadian Approach, at pp. 110 et seq.  In summary, Rosenberg J.A.
emphasized at pp. 76-78 that “sentencing” is a judicial determination of a
legal sanction, in contrast to “punishment” which is the actual infliction of
the legal sanction.  While this distinction is helpful, I do not think that it
is fundamental to sustain the conclusion that s. 719(3)  may be applied to s.
344 (a).  The French version does not employ a similar distinction
in the language of the two sections.  In French, the expression “la peine”
is used interchangeably for “punishment” (s. 344 (a)), for “sentencing”
(marginal note to s. 718.2) and for “sentence” (i.e., ss. 718.2 and 719). 
However, the expression “punishment” which is used twice in s. 718.3(1),
is referred to in French first as “de peine” and the second time, in the
same sentence, as “la punition”.  What is fundamental is less the words
chosen, in the French or English version, but the concepts that they carry. 
Again, for ease of reference, I set out some of these provisions:

 

344.  Quiconque commet un vol qualifié est
coupable d'un acte criminel passible:

 

a) s'il y a usage d'une arme à feu lors de la perpétration de
l'infraction, de l'emprisonnement à perpétuité, la peine minimale étant
de quatre ans . . .

 

718.3 (1)  Lorsqu'une disposition prescrit
différents degrés ou genres de peine à l'égard d'une infraction, la
punition à infliger est, sous réserve des restrictions contenues dans la
disposition, à la discrétion du tribunal qui condamne l'auteur de l'infraction.

 

719.  . . .

 

(3)  Pour fixer la peine à infliger à une
personne déclarée coupable d'une infraction, le tribunal peut prendre en compte
toute période que la personne a passée sous garde par suite de l'infraction.  [Emphasis added.]

 

37                              
Overall, both versions lead to the same conclusion, since the French
phrase in s. 719(3) , “[p]our fixer la peine” places the emphasis on the
sentencing judge’s role of calculating the appropriate sentence, and in doing
so, provides the discretion for considering the amount of time already spent in
custody by the convicted offender in relation to the offence.  Since these
sections refer to “la peine”, it seems logical to conclude that in
determining “la peine minimale” it is acceptable to apply s. 719(3) ,
since “la peine minimale” is merely a subset of “la peine”
generally, and has not been excluded expressly from the operation of s. 719(3) . 
No violence is done to the language of the Code when the sections are
read together, in French or in English, and are understood to mean, as
Parliament intended, that an offender will receive a minimum sentence of four
years, to commence when it is imposed, and calculated with credit given for
time served. 

 

C. The
Effect of Pre-sentencing Custody on the Legally Detained Accused

 








38                              
I have already commented on the usually harsh nature of pre-sentencing
custody and referred to the frequent characterization of this detention as
“dead time”.  Some further comments are required.  

 

39                              
Counsel for the respondent urged this Court to consider the apparent
fallacy of recognizing pre-sentencing custody as punishment, since it is
commonly recognized that Canadian law does not punish innocent citizens. 
Rosenberg J.A. in McDonald, supra, at p. 77, noted that “accused
persons are not denied bail to punish them before their guilt has been
determined”.  He referred to this Court’s decision in R. v. Pearson,
[1992] 3 S.C.R. 665, at pp. 687-88, where Lamer C.J. held that the presumption
of innocence as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter  has “no
application at the bail stage of the criminal process, where the guilt or
innocence of the accused is not determined and where punishment is not
imposed”.  

 

40                              
Counsel for the respondent also referred to this passage from Pearson
to support the contention that pre-trial custody may not be considered as part
of the offender’s punishment.  With respect, it is important to consider the
broader context of Lamer C.J.’s comments.  At that point in the Pearson
judgment (at pp. 687-88), Lamer C.J. was elaborating on the specific
understanding of the s. 11 (d) presumption of innocence in the trial
context:

 

Thus the effect of s. 11 (d) is to create a procedural and
evidentiary rule at trial that the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  This procedural and evidentiary rule has no application at
the bail stage of the criminal process, where the guilt or innocence of the
accused is not determined and where punishment is not imposed.  Accordingly,
s. 515(6)(d) does not violate s. 11 (d). [Emphasis added.]

 








Looking at
this larger context, one cannot conclude that Lamer C.J. was proposing that
pre-sentencing custody could never be viewed as punishment or that it could not
retroactively be treated as part of the punishment, as provided for by s.
719(3) .

 

41                              
To maintain that pre-sentencing custody can never be deemed
punishment following conviction because the legal system does not punish
innocent people is an exercise in semantics that does not acknowledge the
reality of pre-sentencing custody so carefully delineated by Laskin J.A., in Rezaie,
supra, and by Gary Trotter in his text, The Law of Bail in Canada (2nd
ed. 1999), at p. 37:

 

Remand prisoners, as they are sometimes called, often spend their time
awaiting trial in detention centres or local jails that are ill-suited to
lengthy stays.  As the Ouimet Report stressed, such institutions may restrict
liberty more than many institutions which house the convicted.  Due to
overcrowding, inmate turnover and the problems of effectively implementing
programs and recreation activities, serving time in such institutions can be
quite onerous.

 

Therefore,
while pre-trial detention is not intended as punishment when it is imposed, it
is, in effect, deemed part of the punishment following the offender’s
conviction, by the operation of s. 719(3) .  The effect of deeming such
detention punishment is not unlike the determination, discussed earlier in
these reasons, that time spent lawfully at large while on parole is considered
nonetheless a continuation of the offender’s sentence of incarceration. 

 








42                              
If this Court were to conclude that the discretion provided by s. 719(3) 
to consider pre-sentencing custody was not applicable to the mandatory
minimum sentence of s. 344 (a), it is certain that unjust sentences would
result.  First, courts  would be placed in the difficult situation of delivering
unequal treatment to similarly situated offenders: for examples, see McDonald,
supra, at pp. 80-81.  Secondly, because of the gravity of the offence
and the concern for public safety, many persons charged under s. 344 (a),
even first time offenders, would often be remanded in custody while awaiting
trial.  Consequently, discrepancies in sentencing between least and worst
offenders would  increase, since the worst offender, whose sentence exceeded
the minimum would benefit from pre-sentencing credit, while the first time
offender whose sentence would be set at the minimum, would not receive credit
for his or her pre-sentencing detention.  An interpretation of s. 719(3)  and s.
344 (a) that would reward the worst offender and penalize the least
offender is surely to be avoided.

 

43                              
These examples of the absurd results we could expect from an exclusion
of the application of s. 719(3)  to mandatory minimum sentences, such as that
provided by s. 344 (a), are further indication that Parliament intended
these two sections to be interpreted harmoniously and consistently within the
overall context of the criminal justice system’s sentencing regime.     

 

D. Calculating
the Amount of Credit for Pre-sentence Custody

 

44                              
I see no advantage in detracting from the well-entrenched judicial
discretion provided in s. 719(3)  by endorsing a mechanical formula for
crediting pre-sentencing custody.  As we have re-affirmed in this decision, the
goal of sentencing is to impose a just and fit sentence, responsive to the
facts of the individual offender and the particular circumstances of the
commission of the offence.  I adopt the reasoning of Laskin J.A., supra,
in Rezaie, supra, at p. 105, where he noted that:

 








. . . provincial appellate courts have rejected a mathematical formula
for crediting pre-trial custody, instead insisting that the amount of time to
be credited should be determined on a case by case basis. . . .   Although a
fixed multiplier may be unwise, absent justification, sentencing judges should
give some credit for time spent in custody before trial (and before
sentencing). [Citations omitted.]

 

45                              
In the past, many judges have given more or less two months credit for
each month spent in pre-sentencing detention.  This is entirely appropriate
even though a different ratio could also be applied, for example if the accused
has been detained prior to trial in an institution where he or she has had full
access to educational, vocational and rehabilitation programs.  The often
applied ratio of 2:1 reflects not only the harshness of the detention due to
the absence of programs, which may be more severe in some cases than in others,
but reflects also the fact that none of the remission mechanisms contained in
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act  apply to that period of detention. 
“Dead time” is “real” time.  The credit cannot and need not be determined by a
rigid formula and is thus best left to the sentencing judge, who remains in the
best position to carefully weigh all the factors which go toward the
determination of the appropriate sentence, including the decision to credit the
offender for any time spent in pre-sentencing custody.  

V.  Disposition
of the Appeal

 

46                              
I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal.  I would reinstate the sentence imposed on the appellant by Grist J.,
who granted the appellant one year’s credit for his seven months of
pre-sentencing custody, and sentenced him under s. 344 (a) to three and
one-half years’ imprisonment.  The concurrent sentence of one year for possession
of a restricted weapon would remain unaffected by these reasons. 

 

Appeal allowed.

The accused was charged with one count of sexual interference and one
count of sexual assault.  The complainant, his niece, was between 6 and 8 years
old at the time of the incidents and 16 years old when she testified at the
accused’s trial.  She said that on three separate occasions the accused touched
and rubbed her vagina while she was fully clothed.  The first two incidents
occurred on a red couch in the basement of the accused’s house, and the third
occurred in the den in the complainant’s house.  The accused denied the
charges.  He testified that the red couch was not in the basement at any time
during the period stated in the information because renovations were then
taking place in the house. He also testified that he had not been alone with
the complainant in the absence of another adult.  His wife, however, testified
that it was possible that he had been alone with the complainant and one or
more of the other children.  The trial judge convicted the accused of sexual
assault and acquitted him of sexual interference.  The majority of the Court of
Appeal dismissed the accused’s appeal against conviction.  The dissenting judge
would have quashed the verdict as unreasonable.

 








Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

Per Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache, Binnie and Arbour JJ.:  The
applicable legal principles and the proper test to apply in assessing the
reasonableness of a verdict were set out in full in R. v. Biniaris,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, 2000 SCC 15.

 

As set out in Biniaris, it is insufficient for the court of
appeal to refer to a vague unease, or a lingering or lurking doubt based on its
own review of the evidence.  While a “lurking doubt” may be a powerful trigger
for thorough appellate scrutiny of the evidence, it is not, without further
articulation of the basis for such doubt, a proper basis upon which to
interfere with the findings of a jury.  The comments in Biniaris were
made in the context of the review of the verdict of a jury, but they apply
equally to the judgment of a trial judge sitting alone.  Where a judge gives
detailed reasons for judgment and when, as in this case, the reasons reveal
that he or she was alive to the recurrent problems in the relevant field of
adjudication, the court of appeal brings no special insight to the assessment
of the evidence.  The fact that an appeal court judge would have had a doubt
when the trial judge did not is insufficient to justify the conclusion that the
trial judgment was unreasonable.  

 

Here, the verdict was reasonable and supported by the evidence.  The
trial judge was entitled to believe the uncorroborated evidence of the
complainant in this case as in any other case, and he did.  If it were
unreasonable for him to do so, it would be impossible to convict in the many similar
cases where there is a long delay in the disclosure of the uncorroborated
allegations of a complainant.

 








Per L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  The majority’s
analysis and application of s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code 
are agreed with.  The justification for the law as it stands today is the need
to affirm the principles of equality and human dignity in our criminal law by
addressing the problem of myths and stereotypes about complainants in sexual
assault cases.

L’Heureux-Dubé J. -- I
concur with Arbour J.’s analysis and application of s. 686(1) (a)(i) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,  in dismissing this appeal,
thereby upholding the trial judge’s verdict as affirmed by the majority in the
Court of Appeal ((1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 30).  Regarding the comments made in
dissent in the Court of Appeal, reproduced at paras. 23, 24 and 28 of Arbour
J.’s reasons, I think it is important to add that the justification for the law
as it stands today is the need to affirm the principles of equality and human
dignity in our criminal law by addressing the problem of myths and stereotypes
about complainants in sexual assault cases.  

 








2                               
This Court has repeatedly held that myths and stereotypes have no place
in a rational and just system of law, as they jeopardize the courts’
truth-finding function.  (See R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at
pp. 604 and 630, per McLachlin J., and at p. 651, per L’Heureux-Dubé
J. dissenting in part; R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 670, per
Cory J.; R. v. Esau, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 777, at para. 82, per McLachlin

S.C.R. 597, at para. 29,  per L’Heureux-Dubé J.)  

 

3                               
Our Court has rejected the notion that complainants in sexual assault
cases have a higher tendency than other complainants to fabricate stories based
on “ulterior motives” and are therefore less worthy of belief.  Neither the
law, nor judicial experience, nor social science research supports this
generalization.  (See  Seaboyer, supra, at pp. 652 and 690, per
L’Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting in part; R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R.
122, at p. 134; R. v. François, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 827; W. (G.),
supra; A. McGillivray, “R. v. Bauder: Seductive Children,
Safe Rapists, and Other Justice Tales” (1998), 25 Man. L.J. 359, at p. 381;
M. Burt, “Rape Myths and Acquaintance Rape”, in A. Parrot and L. Bechhofer,
eds., Acquaintance Rape: The Hidden Crime (1991), 26, at p. 28; L.
Holmstrom and A. Burgess, The Victim of Rape: Institutional Reactions
(1983), at pp. 174-79.)  

 

4                               
Similarly, it is not the law that violations of sexual integrity of the
type at issue in this case may be properly characterized as “horseplay”.  (See
s. 271 of the Criminal Code  as it has been interpreted, for example, in R.
v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, at p. 302; and R. v. V. (K.B.)
(1992), 13 C.R. (4th) 87 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d [1993] 2 S.C.R. 857.) 

 

5                               
On the basis of Arbour J.’s analysis, and in light of the above
considerations, I therefore agree that nothing in the dissenting reasons in the
Court of Appeal demonstrated an appreciation of the facts that would make the
trial judge’s  conclusions unreasonable.

I.  Introduction

 








6                               
This appeal was heard together with R. v. Biniaris, [2000]
1 S.C.R. 381, 2000 SCC 15, and R. v. Molodowic, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 420,
2000 SCC 16.  In this trilogy, the Court was asked to reconsider its decision
in R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, and, in particular, to
decide two issues of general application.  First, whether the reasonableness of
a verdict involves a question of law, within the meaning of ss. 691  and 693  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , so as to permit a further
appeal to this Court from a decision by a provincial appellate court, and,
second, what standard of review must be applied by the reviewing court in
examining the reasonableness of a verdict.  I concluded in Biniaris that
Yebes should be reaffirmed.  A dissent on the issue of whether the
verdict was reasonable is a dissent on a question of law, whether the dissent
is based on the articulation of the applicable test or on its actual
application to the particular circumstances of the case.  The proper test is
“whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially,
could reasonably have rendered” (Yebes, supra, at p. 185).  In
embarking on the exercise mandated by s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code , the reviewing court must engage in a thorough re-examination of the
evidence and bring to bear the weight of its judicial experience to decide
whether, on all the evidence, the verdict was a reasonable one.  Inevitably the
verdict will be one that was open to the jury, in the sense that it was not an
error of law for the trial judge to leave it to the jury for consideration. 
Moreover, it is not sufficient for the reviewing judge to simply take a
different view of the evidence than the jury did.  The appeal court, if it is
to overturn the verdict, must articulate the basis upon which it concludes that
the verdict is inconsistent with the requirements of a judicial appreciation of
the evidence.  This is what must now be done in this case.

 

II.  Factual
Background

 

7                               
The appellant was convicted of having sexually assaulted his young
niece, who was then between six and eight years old, between December 1986 and
March 1988.  The complainant did not disclose the incidents which led to the
charges until 1993 or 1994, when she confided in a school friend named Nancy. 
However, it was not until 1995 that she told her mother, who then revealed the
matter to the authorities.

 

8                               
The complainant was 16 years old when she testified.  She said that on
three separate occasions in the period of time alleged, the appellant touched
and rubbed her vagina on the outside of her clothing while she was seated.  She
testified that all three incidents occurred during family visits.  The first
two incidents occurred on a red couch in the basement of the appellant’s
house.  On the second occasion, she said that the appellant asked her whether
the rubbing “felt good”.  According to her evidence, the third incident
occurred in the den in the complainant’s home.

 

9                               
The complainant was asked to explain the circumstances which led to the
late disclosure of these assaults.  She explained that she had not told anyone
about the appellant’s actions prior to telling her friend Nancy because she
felt confused and did not understand what had happened to her.  On
cross-examination, she further explained that she and Nancy had shared their
experiences, the other girl having told the complainant about being raped by a
cousin’s husband.  








 

10                           
In July of 1995, in the course of a conversation, the complainant’s
mother told her that the appellant did not approve of her friend Nancy and
thought that she was a “bad influence” on her.  Her mother also told her that
there were rumours about the appellant having acted improperly toward other
girls.  She instructed her not to let the appellant into their home if she or
the complainant’s father were not present.  The complainant testified that she
was prompted to disclose the alleged assaults to her mother by her fear and
concern that her failure to do so earlier had exposed other girls to harm. 

 

11                           
The complainant was taken by her mother to see their family doctor who
recommended that the complainant see a psychiatrist and contacted the
Children’s Aid Society.  The Children’s Aid Society in turn referred the matter
to the police.

 

III.  Proceedings
and Judgments Below

 

A.  Ontario
Court (Provincial Division), [1996] O.J. No. 4981 (QL)

 

12                           
The appellant was arrested and charged with one count of sexual
interference and one count of sexual assault contrary, respectively, to ss. 151 
and 271  of the Criminal Code .  He was tried before Flaherty Prov. J. 

 








13                           
The complainant and her mother gave evidence for the Crown, as
summarized above.  The appellant denied the charges.  He testified that the red
couch had not been in his basement at any time during the period stated in the
information because renovations were then taking place in the house.  Further,
he said that he had never been in a room in his house or in the complainant’s
house with her, in the absence of another adult.  His wife, on the other hand,
admitted in cross-examination that it was possible that there were occasions
when her husband might have been alone with the complainant and one or more of
the other children. 

 

14                           
Defence counsel suggested, pointing to the circumstances in which the
complainant disclosed the allegations to her mother, that the complainant had a
motive to lie and fabricate her evidence.  Specifically, defence counsel argued
that the complainant wanted revenge against the appellant for his comments to
her mother about her friend Nancy. 

 

15                           
The trial judge convicted the appellant of sexual assault, and acquitted
him of sexual interference because the conviction on the former count
“preclude[d] a finding of guilt for sexual interference based on the same
conduct” (para. 29).  The appellant was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment
and three years’ probation.  

 

16                           
Flaherty Prov. J. was alive to the problems which arise in so-called
oath-against-oath trials.  He also acknowledged the problems faced by a
defendant who is confronted with allegations of sexual impropriety relating to
his alleged conduct seven or eight years prior to the trial.  He noted that it
was not incumbent upon the appellant to establish either that the complainant’s
evidence had been or could be fabricated.   Bearing all this in mind, the trial
judge embarked on a detailed review of the evidence, and addressed the various
submissions of the defence pointing to the reasons why the complainant should
not be believed.  In the end, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that the appellant had sexually assaulted the complainant.

 








17                           
The trial judge rejected any suggestion of improper motive or
fabrication.  He noted, for example, that the complainant’s delay in disclosing
the alleged assaults could be explained by the combination of her young age and
the authoritative position that the appellant occupied in her life.  Further,
he found the complainant to be a credible witness and accepted her testimony
that she had not reacted strongly or in a highly emotional manner to the
appellant’s suggestion that her friend Nancy was a “bad influence”.  

 

18                           
The trial judge did not believe that the contradictory testimony in
relation to the red couch was significant because it “relate[d] to the where of
the offence as recounted by a six or seven-year-old as opposed to the what and
the who, the who did-it and what-was-done to her by him” (para. 26).  He stated
that he was considering the evidence in relation to the red couch in accordance
with the “common sense approach” to children’s evidence prescribed by this
Court in R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57. 

 

19                           
Finally, Flaherty Prov. J. rejected the appellant’s claim that he had
never been with the complainant in the absence of another adult as “unlikely”
(para. 27).  He found that the dynamics of the family visits presented
sufficient opportunity for the commission of the alleged assaults. 

 

B.  Court
of Appeal for Ontario (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 30

 

(i)   Labrosse J.A. (Borins J.A. concurring)

 

20                           
Labrosse J.A. dismissed the appeal against conviction but set aside the
sentence imposed by Flaherty Prov. J.  and substituted a conditional sentence
of five months pursuant to s. 742.1  of the Criminal Code . 

 








21                           
Labrosse J.A. agreed with defence counsel’s concession that, applying
the test articulated by this Court in Corbett v. The Queen, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 275, and clarified in Yebes, supra, the verdict was
reasonable.  Approaching the evidence before him with deference to the trial
judge’s findings of credibility, he was of the opinion that there was no
manifest reason to doubt the reliability of the complainant’s testimony.  The
complainant had not made allegations of a bizarre nature and it had not been
shown that her testimony lacked internal consistency.  Further, Labrosse J.A.
placed little significance on the contradictory testimony regarding the
location of the red couch.  In so doing, he stated that he was relying on the
comments of this Court in R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, concerning
the significance which is properly attributed to inconsistencies in relation to
peripheral matters, such as time and location, when assessing the
reasonableness of a verdict founded on the testimony of children.

 

22                           
In concluding his analysis of the reasonableness of the verdict,
Labrosse J.A. noted his disagreement with Finlayson J.A.’s reasons for holding
that the verdict was unreasonable and rejected the position that recent
amendments to s. 271  of the Criminal Code , which permit the Crown
to prosecute sexual assault offences by way of summary conviction, and/or the
other factors identified by Finlayson J.A. justify an expanded standard of
appellate review.  

 

(ii) Finlayson J.A., dissenting

 

23                           
While suggesting that he was not attempting to expand the definition of
“unreasonable” within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code , Finlayson J.A. stated that he was “entitled to take a subjective view
of the evidence and ask myself if I am satisfied that the verdict is safe” (p.
41).  He stated that he was not satisfied.  There were three bases for this
conclusion.

 








24                           
First, Finlayson J.A. identified aspects of the evidence which he
believed should have caused the trial judge to approach the complainant’s
evidence with skepticism.  He wrote (at pp. 41-42):

 

There is not the remotest of supporting evidence that
any sexual acts took place.  Indeed the only objective evidence, that of the
location of the red couch, contradicts the complainant.  The sexual acts are
highly ambiguous coming as they do from an uncle and “godfather” to the young
girl.  Any form of “horseplay” could explain them.  Giving the most generous
interpretation to the acts as described by the complainant, they are hardly
consistent with intent to commit a sexual assault.  Even the trial judge noted
that at the time of their occurrence, the complainant did not know what the
touchings meant.  The evidence is very much open to the construction that the
[accused] could have had some incidental contact with the girl that was
entirely innocent.

 

There is no pattern of abuse here. 
The [accused] must have had more than three opportunities to abuse the girl if
he was of a mind to.  No explanation is offered for the fact that the assaults
simply ceased. 

 

25                           
Secondly, relying on a decade’s worth of experience with sexual abuse
cases, he expressed concern that the case before him “fit a pattern of
allegations of sexual abuse that are initiated by ulterior motives” (p. 42). 
He labeled cases fitting this pattern  “historical sexual abuse cases”, noting
that they commonly involve allegations that are stale-dated and of a vague and
unsubstantiated nature with the result that “it is impossible for the person
accused to give a detailed rebuttal to them without arousing suspicion as to
why his memory is so precise” (p. 42).  Finlayson J.A. noted (at p. 42):

 

On the darker side, the evidence is not inconsistent with the
[accused’s] contention that the complainant had a motive to fabricate, given
the [accused’s] concerns regarding her friendship with Nancy.

 

Further, he
was of the opinion that an ulterior motive for the allegations made against the
appellant could also be traced to the complainant’s mother’s dislike for the
appellant.  According to Finlayson J.A., it was the complainant’s mother who
was responsible for “orchestrat[ing] the prosecution” (p. 41).  








26                           
Finally, Finlayson J.A. expressed concern that the erosion and abolition
of many traditional protections accorded to the accused in sexual assault cases
threaten to render the concept of reasonable doubt a “hollow invocation, rather
than the shield against injustice” (p. 43).  For example, he pointed to the
unavailability of a preliminary inquiry where the Crown elects to proceed by
way of summary conviction under s. 271(1)(b) of the Code and
Crown counsels’ failure, in an era of “zero tolerance”, to exercise
prosecutorial discretion in “weak cases”.  According to Finlayson J.A., it is
incumbent upon the trial judge to act as the criminal courts’ new gatekeeper,
safeguarding the principle of reasonable doubt.  It was his opinion that
Flaherty Prov. J. had failed to do so.  At p. 43 he wrote:

 

The trial judge was prepared to convict the [accused] on the flimsiest
of evidence.  This complaint should not have gone to trial, much less have led
to a conviction.  I do not require any expanded version of “unreasonable” to
justify interference with this verdict.  Where the trial judge convicts on
evidence such as this record displays, the Court of Appeal has more than the
right, it has the duty to interfere and, in the interests of justice, quash the
verdict as unreasonable.

 

IV.  Analysis
and Application to this Appeal

 

27                           
The principles governing the disposition of this appeal are set
out in the reasons given in Biniaris, supra, and need not be
repeated here.  Further, given my agreement with the reasons
of Labrosse J.A. for concluding that the verdict is reasonable and supported by
the evidence, I do not believe that it is necessary to repeat his review of the
applicable legal principles or his examination of the evidence that was before
Flaherty Prov. J.  However, the dissenting reasons of Finlayson J.A. need to be
addressed, particularly with respect to the role and limits of judicial
experience in the exercise of appellate review under s. 686(1) (a)(i).  

 








28                           
In his submissions before us, counsel for the appellant conceded that if
the test applied by the majority of the Court of Appeal to determine the
reasonableness of the conviction was the correct one, he could not succeed. 
The appellant urged us to effect an “incremental” change in the law by
endorsing a “broader” standard of appellate review, and enabling appellate
courts to overturn conviction when they are left with a lurking doubt as to
guilt. I can only repeat here what I said in Biniaris on that issue, at
para. 38:

 

It is insufficient for the court of appeal to refer to a vague unease,
or a lingering or lurking doubt based on its own review of the evidence.  This
“lurking doubt” may be a powerful trigger for thorough appellate
scrutiny of the evidence, but it is not, without further articulation of the
basis for such doubt, a proper basis upon which to interfere with the findings
of a jury.  In other words, if, after reviewing the evidence at the end of an
error-free trial which led to a conviction, the appeal court judge is left with
a lurking doubt or feeling of unease, that doubt, which is not in itself
sufficient to justify interfering with the conviction, may be a useful signal
that the verdict was indeed reached in a non-judicial manner. In that case, the
court of appeal must proceed further with its analysis.

 








29                           
These comments were made in the context of the review of the
verdict of a jury, but they apply equally to the judgment of a trial judge
sitting alone.  However, where a judge gives detailed reasons for judgment and
when, as in this case, the reasons reveal that he or she was alive to the
recurrent problems in this field of adjudication, the court of appeal brings no
special insight to the assessment of the evidence.  As this Court’s s. 686(1) (a)(i)
jurisprudence makes very clear, the fact that an appeal
court judge would have had a doubt when the trial judge did not is insufficient
to justify the conclusion that the trial judgment was unreasonable. 
See, e.g., Corbett, supra, at p. 282; Yebes, supra,
at p. 186; W. (R.), supra, at p. 130; R. v. François,
[1994] 2 S.C.R. 827, at p. 835; R. v. Burke, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at
para. 3.  With respect, and while acknowledging that a reviewing judge is
entitled to express his or her misgivings about the result of the trial, I can
find nothing in the reasons of Finlayson J.A. that demonstrates that his
different appreciation of the facts make the trial judge’s conclusion
unreasonable. 

 

30                           
In the case at bar, Finlayson J.A. located his unease with the verdict
entered by Flaherty Prov. J. in “the advantage of reading the transcripts of
many of what are termed ‘historical sexual abuse cases’ that have come before
this court over the last decade” (p. 42).  He wrote (at p. 42):

 

. . . I am concerned that this case does fit a pattern of allegations
of sexual abuse that are initiated by ulterior motives.  The complaints are
usually of this vague and unsubstantiated nature.  They are so stale dated and
amorphous that it is impossible for the person accused to give a detailed
rebuttal to them without arousing suspicion as to why his memory is so precise.

 

The defence also reveals a pattern.  Faced with
attempting to recall what must have been a non-event to any normal person, the
accused seized upon a material discrepancy in the complainant’s evidence and
demonstrated objectively that the complainant’s story cannot be true in a
significant particular.  In this case it was the red couch.

 

I appreciate
Finlayson J.A.’s unease in the face of what the trial judge termed the “well
known difficulties” associated with the features of these types of cases, with
which he was also very familiar.  Having been exposed, like many in the
criminal courts, to several such cases, the trial judge was aware of the need
for caution in preserving the integrity of the presumption of innocence.  He
was entitled to believe the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant in this
case as in any other case, and he did.  If it were unreasonable for him to do
so, it would be impossible to convict in the many similar cases where there is
a long delay in the disclosure of the uncorroborated allegations of a
complainant in a sexual assault case.  This is not the law.

 

31                           
I would therefore dismiss the appeal. 

 








V. Conclusion and Disposition

 

32                           
For these reasons, and those given by Labrosse J.A., the verdict is not
unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.  The appeal is therefore
dismissed.

The accused suffers from a severe mental disorder, which was diagnosed
as paranoid schizophrenia.  After shooting and killing his grandfather, the
accused drove to a friend’s house and told her father that he had just shot his
grandfather and that the police should be called.  The accused was arrested
and, after being properly informed of his rights, he gave a statement to the
police.  He was tried before a judge and jury on a charge of second degree
murder.  The accused relied primarily on the defence of mental disorder.  Prior
to trial, he had undergone two psychiatric assessments and both doctors
testified that the accused’s act of shooting his grandfather was consistent
with his mental disorder having caused him to believe that only in so doing
could he save himself from further torment.  Further, the doctors agreed that
the accused did not have the capacity to appreciate that his actions were
morally wrong at the relevant time.  The Crown did not call a rebuttal expert
to contradict their testimony but on cross-examination challenged the expert
evidence and was successful in eliciting a number of admissions and
concessions.  The accused was convicted of second degree murder.  The majority
of the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.  The only issue in this appeal was
whether the verdict was unreasonable with respect to the effects of the
accused’s illness on his criminal responsibility.








Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

The applicable legal principles and the proper test to apply in
assessing the reasonableness of a verdict were set out in R. v. Biniaris,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, 2000 SCC 15.

 

Judicial experience with the effects of mental disorder on criminal
responsibility, with the type of evidence that is available to demonstrate it,
and with the unjustified skepticism that may be directed at an accused relying
on the defence of mental disorder, should have given the Court of Appeal cause
for concern that the verdict reached by the jury in the present case was
unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.  Careful and thorough scrutiny
of the record confirms that concern was warranted.  Apart from the psychiatric
evidence, the statements made by the accused to the police, and, prior to that,
to the father of his friend, whom he informed of the killing and whom he asked
to inform the police, are not inconsistent with the conclusions reached by the
experts, nor is the accused’s conduct surrounding the commission of the offence. 
It is not necessarily easy for a jury to accept that, in lay person’s terms, an
accused who knows what he is doing and knows that it is a crime could still
genuinely believe that he would not be morally condemned by reasonable members
of society for his conduct.  The defence proved this to be the case and, on the
evidence tendered at this trial, it was unreasonable to conclude otherwise.

I.  Introduction

 








1                                  
This appeal was heard together with R. v. Biniaris, [2000]
1 S.C.R. 381, 2000 SCC 15, and R. v. A.G., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439,
2000 SCC 17.  In this trilogy, the Court was asked to
reconsider its decision in R.  v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168,
and, in particular, to decide two issues of general application.  First,
whether the reasonableness of a verdict involves a question of law, within the
meaning of ss. 691  and 693  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
so as to permit a further appeal to this Court from a decision by a provincial
appellate court, and, second, what standard of review must be applied by the
reviewing court in examining the reasonableness of a verdict.  I concluded in Biniaris
that Yebes should be reaffirmed.  A dissent on the issue of whether the
verdict was reasonable is a dissent on a question of law, whether the dissent
is based on the articulation of the applicable test or on its actual
application to the particular circumstances of the case. The proper test is
“whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially,
could reasonably have rendered” (Yebes, supra, at p. 185).  In
embarking on the exercise mandated by s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code , the reviewing court must engage in a thorough re-examination of the
evidence and bring to bear the weight of its judicial experience to decide
whether, on all the evidence, the verdict was a reasonable one.  Inevitably the
verdict will be one that was open to the jury, in the sense that it was not an
error of law for the trial judge to leave it to the jury for consideration. 
Moreover, it is not sufficient for the reviewing judge to simply take a
different view of the evidence than the jury did.  The appeal court, if it is
to overturn the verdict, must articulate the basis upon which it concludes that
the verdict is inconsistent with the requirements of a judicial appreciation of
the evidence.  This is what must now be done in this case.

 

II. Factual
Background

 

2                                  
The facts are not in dispute.  On August 29, 1995, the appellant
Molodowic killed his grandfather.  In the middle of the night, he drove from
his home in MacGregor, Manitoba, to his grandfather’s farm eight miles away. 
On the way, he parked and loaded his semi-automatic 7.62 caliber carbine.  When
he arrived, he aimed directly at his grandfather and fired two bullets into his
chest.  He then drove back to  MacGregor, went to a friend’s house and told her
father that he had just shot his grandfather and that the police should be
called.  Within an hour of the killing, the appellant was arrested and, after
being properly informed of his rights, he gave a statement to the police.

 








3                                  
The appellant suffers from a serious mental disorder.  On the night of
the killing, he had been drinking.  The appellant was tried on a charge of
second degree murder before Menzies J. and a jury.  He argued, relying on the
expert evidence of two psychiatrists, that he was not criminally responsible by
reason of mental disorder.  In the alternative, he relied on the defence of
drunkenness.  

 

4                                  
In his charge, Menzies J. instructed the jurors that they were entitled
to accept or reject all or part of the expert evidence.  The appellant was
convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without
eligibility for parole for 10 years.  The Court of Appeal, Huband J.A.
dissenting, dismissed the appeal.  The only issue considered by the Court of
Appeal, and the only issue before this Court, was whether the verdict was
unreasonable with respect to the effects of the appellant’s illness on his
criminal responsibility.  

 

III.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

5                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

   16.  (1)  No person is criminally
responsible for an act committed or an omission made while suffering from a
mental disorder that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature
and quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.         

 

   (2) Every person is presumed not to suffer from a mental disorder so
as to be exempt from criminal responsibility by virtue of subsection (1), until
the contrary is proved on the balance of probabilities.

 

   (3) The burden of proof that an accused was suffering from a mental
disorder so as to be exempt from criminal responsibility is on the party that
raises the issue.

 

.
. .

 

   686. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or
against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally
responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 








(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

IV.  General
Principles

 

6                                  
At trial, it was conceded that the appellant appreciated both the nature
and quality of his acts, in the sense that he understood that he was causing
the death of his grandfather, and that he knew that it was against the law to
do so.  However, under the terms of s. 16  of the Criminal Code , the
appellant was entitled to be found not criminally responsible for the killing
if he could prove, on a balance of probabilities, that, by reason of his mental
disorder, he was incapable of knowing that his act was morally wrong.  Defence
counsel relied on the testimony of two psychiatrists, Drs. Harold Shane and
Stanley Yaren, for the purpose of establishing that when he killed his
grandfather, the appellant did not know that his act was morally wrong.  This
was the narrow issue confronting the jury.  

 








7                                  
In R. v. Ratti, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 68, at p. 80, this Court
held that an act or omission is “wrong”, within the meaning of s. 16 , where
that act or omission “in the particular circumstances would have been morally
condemned by reasonable members of society” (emphasis in original).  In
deciding whether or not an accused appreciated that his actions were morally
wrong, a jury is not “bound by the expert psychiatric testimony and . . . its
probative value [is] to be assessed in the same manner as any other testimony”
(Ratti, supra, at p.  81).  Further, in weighing expert evidence
a jury is entitled to examine the factual foundations of the opinion and is
entitled to accord less weight to that opinion where it is not based on facts
proved at trial and/or where it is based upon factual assumptions with which
they disagree.  See R. v.
Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, at pp. 896-97, and Ratti, supra,
at p. 81.   

 

8                                  
The jury may therefore reject the opinion of experts, even when the
experts called are unanimous and uncontradicted by other experts.  For example,
in R. v. Mailloux (1985), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 171, the Ontario Court of
Appeal was faced with a verdict rejecting purportedly uncontradicted expert evidence. 
Lacourcière J.A., speaking for the court, stated at p. 177: 

 

   This Court is not at liberty to come to its own conclusion on the
issue of insanity and thereby disregard the verdict pronounced by a jury. 
Having regard to the statutory presumption of sanity, this Court ought not to
interfere with the verdict of a jury unless on consideration of all the
evidence, we are satisfied that it was one which no jury acting judicially and
properly instructed could have reached. . . .

 

However, there
has to be a rational foundation, in the evidence, for the jury to reasonably
reject the opinion of the experts.  In Mailloux, two eminent forensic
psychiatrists had expressed the opinion that the appellant suffered from a
paranoid personality disorder dating back to a period well before the
shooting.  Lacourcière J.A. summarized more precisely the purport of their
evidence at p. 173: 

 

    Both psychiatrists testified that the [accused] at the material
time, by reason of psychotic delusions, was incapable of appreciating the
nature and quality of his acts and of knowing that his acts were wrong.  They
also agreed that the [accused] was incapable of forming the specific intent
necessary to commit murder.  However, the opinions expressed in their
evidence-in-chief were substantially qualified and diluted by the evidence
which they gave during cross-examination, which was obviously accepted by the
jury, to the effect that the [accused] knew that pulling the trigger would
cause the gun to fire and that he was able to appreciate the nature and quality
of the act and to understand the immediate physical consequence which would
flow from it, i.e., that someone would be killed.  In particular, Dr.
Orchard admitted in cross-examination that first the [accused] was capable of
knowing that the act was wrong and was also capable of forming the specific
intent to kill. 

 








9                                  
The appellant had submitted that the verdict of murder was unreasonable

in light of
the uncontradicted psychiatric opinions coupled with the evidence of drug
abuse, the absence of motive and the bizarre nature of the accused’s conduct
before and after the shooting.  The Court of Appeal did not accept that
argument and concluded at p. 177:

 

    Dealing first with our power to substitute a verdict under s.
613(1)(d), there certainly was ample evidence upon which the jury could
properly return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  However, we are
satisfied that the evidence was also capable of reasonably supporting the
jury’s conclusion, according to the view which they took of it, that the
defence of insanity had not been proved by the accused on the balance of
probabilities.

 

Mailloux,
supra, was affirmed by this Court (see R. v. Mailloux, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 1029).  Lamer J. (as he then was) stated at p. 1044:

 

Stated in technical terms, the finding by the jury was that the accused
had not rebutted by a preponderance of evidence the presumption of sanity. 
After reviewing the evidence, I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal’s
finding that there was evidence supportive of the jury’s conclusion and that
the verdict, in that regard, was not unreasonable.

 








10                              
A proper understanding and weighing of expert opinion often plays
a central role in the determination of whether or not an accused should be
found not guilty by reason of mental disorder.  The absence of a Crown rebuttal
expert to contradict an accused’s psychiatric evidence is not in itself
sufficient to conclude that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable if that
conclusion remained reasonably open to the jury on the totality of the
evidence.  However, it may be unreasonable for a jury to disregard the expert
evidence put before it, particularly where all the experts called were in
agreement with each other, when their evidence was “uncontradicted and not
seriously challenged” (R. v. Kelly (1971), 6 C.C.C. (2d)
186 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 186), and when there was nothing
in the “conduct of the commission of the crime which would raise any serious
question as to the validity of the psychiatrists’ conclusion” (Kelly, at
p. 186).  Furthermore, appellate review of the reasonableness of the jury’s
findings must be undertaken in light of the standard articulated in Biniaris,
supra.

 

V.  Analysis and Application to this Appeal

 

11                              
As indicated earlier, it is common ground that the issue presents itself
on a very narrow footing.  The appellant clearly suffers from a severe mental
disorder, which was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia.  When he killed his
grandfather, by his own admission, and consistent with the opinion of the
experts, he did appreciate that what he was doing was legally wrong and that he
would be punished for it.  The only live issue for the jury, and the one on
which the Court of Appeal was divided, was whether the jury could reasonably
conclude, on all the evidence, that the appellant also understood that what he
did was morally wrong, so as to fully engage his criminal responsibility.  This
falls to be determined in large part, but not exclusively, on the basis of the
expert evidence of the two psychiatrists who testified at trial.  

 

12                              
The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that they were not
required to accept that evidence, but that they had to assess it in light of
the totality of the evidence tendered, and that they were entitled to reach
their own conclusion even if it conflicted with that of the experts.  A
majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that it was not unreasonable for the
jury to convict in that “it was within the right of the jury to reach the
verdict  it did” ((1998), 126 Man. R. (2d) 241, at p. 244), whether one agreed
with that verdict or not.  Huband J.A., dissenting, reviewed all the evidence
bearing on the central question of whether the appellant knew that killing his
grandfather was morally wrong.  He approved of the trial judge’s instructions
to the jury that they were not bound to accept the unchallenged opinion of the
experts but said (at p. 252):








 

    The trial judge[’s] . . .  instruction needs to be considered in the
context of the case presented to the jury. The expert opinions of Dr. Yaren and
Dr. Shane need not be accepted if there is some reason to reject them, because
of some discernible flaw in their reasoning or because the opinion was
formulated on too fragile a factual basis or because the opinion conflicts with
inferences one might logically draw from other evidence.

 

    One might have legitimate reservations about the opinion of Dr.
Shane, standing alone.  But I do not see any rational basis for rejecting the
opinion of Dr. Yaren.  Dr. Yaren starts with the credibility of a truly
independent witness.  He has substantial experience in this field.  He has the
benefit of a staff of skilled associates to assist him in reaching his
diagnosis and formulating his opinion as to the culpability of the accused. 
His opinion is entirely consistent with the evidence as to the accused’s
conduct in the months and weeks leading up to the shooting.  It also accords
with the conduct of the accused on the night of the killing, as described by
others and through the accused’s own statement to the police.

 

    To reject all of this evidence was, in my view, unreasonable and
invites appellate intervention.  I would set aside the verdict on the ground
that it is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence, and I would
substitute a verdict that the accused is not criminally responsible by reason
of mental disorder.

 

I agree with
the foregoing conclusions and need expand only briefly on the reasons of Huband
J.A.

 








13                              
This, in my view, is a case in which the weight of judicial experience
must be brought to bear on the assessment of the reasonableness, as a matter of
law, of the conclusion reached by the jury.  There is a real danger, which
manifested itself here, that a jury will be unduly skeptical of a “defence”
that is often perceived as easy to fabricate and difficult to rebut.  This is
particularly so when the actions of the accused present a large component of
rationality, as they do in a case such as this where it is conceded that the
appellant knew what he was doing and realized that his actions were prohibited
by law.  More dangerous still, the statements of the appellant made shortly
after the killing, and in particular his answers to the questions of the
police, presented him in a most unfavourable light.  The endless flow of
obscenities that they contain makes it difficult to overcome an impression of
the accused as a cold-hearted, callous and remorseless killer.  Further, they
confirm that the appellant understood that the killing of his grandfather was
legally wrong.  They can also be viewed as indicating that he felt a deep
hatred for his grandfather, and as providing a sane and rational explanation as
to why he would want to kill this man that he describes as his tormentor. 
However, the statements also reveal a very disturbed mind.  Huband J.A. puts it
this way (at pp. 245-46):

 

    It is only a slight exaggeration to say that every second word in
the accused’s statement is the “f”  word or some other expletive. . . . But if
one can see beyond the torrent of obscenities, the statement reveals a deeply
disturbed person.  At the outset, he was belligerent - interrupting the police
officer with obscenities while the officer was attempting to extend to him Charter
rights.  But when told of his right to counsel, he dissolves into tears and
asks that his sister be contacted.  The police assure him that they are
endeavoring to do so.

 

The question is put to the accused:

 

“Q.      Can you tell us what happened this
morning?

 

A.  I went fucking ended my fucking torment so I went and shot him.

 

Q.        Shot who?

 

A.  No one can tell me anything anyway, so I went and shot my
grandfather.  Made fucking life a torment anyway, the fucking son of a bitch. 
He’d have to be fucking alive to tell you.  He’s not alive, so you’re not going
to hear nothing, so that’s it.  I mean, what the fuck are you going to tell?”

 








14                              
After describing how he shot and killed his grandfather, the appellant
explained that the rifle he used had been given by his grandfather to his
brother, who had committed suicide about a year before.  This could also have
been viewed as providing a rational motive for the killing, but again, as
pointed out by Huband J.A., apart from the statements of the appellant accusing
his grandfather of tormenting him, nothing in the evidence suggests that this
tormenting was anything but a fictional product of the appellant’s
imagination.  When asked directly by the police why he detested his grandfather
so much, the accused gave a rather incoherent answer: “[H]e doesn’t really
aggravate me.  He fucking says stuff, you know what I mean.  Like it’s just
fucking,  I don’t know”.

 

15                              
The appreciation of the import of expert psychiatric evidence must be a
realistic and reasonable one.  Expert evidence, be it in the field of
psychiatry or some other field, does not always provide a dispositive answer to
questions of fact raised in an adjudicative legal context.  In Addington v.
Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979), in rejecting the “beyond a reasonable doubt”
standard as inappropriate in civil commitment proceedings, the United States
Supreme Court said (at p. 430):

 

The subtleties and nuances of psychiatric diagnosis
render certainties virtually beyond reach in most situations.  The
reasonable-doubt standard of criminal law functions in its realm because there
the standard is addressed to specific, knowable facts.  Psychiatric diagnosis,
in contrast, is to a large extent based on medical “impressions” drawn from
subjective analysis and filtered through the experience of the diagnostician. 
This process often makes it very difficult for the expert physician to offer
definite conclusions about any particular patient.

 

See Re
Robinson and Hislop (1980), 114 D.L.R. (3d) 620 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 629; Re
Hoskins and Hislop (1981), 121 D.L.R. (3d) 337 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 342; R.
v. Carleton (1981), 32 A.R. 181 (C.A.), at p. 199.  The nature and limits
of psychiatric expertise must be kept in mind in assessing whether the
appellant discharged his burden to establish the defence of mental disorder on
a balance of probabilities essentially through expert evidence.

 








16                              
The appellant underwent two psychiatric assessments.  Eleven days after
the killing, Dr. Shane, a private psychiatrist hired by defence counsel,
interviewed the appellant for three to five hours.  Approximately nine months
later, the appellant was admitted to the care of Dr. Yaren, the Director of
Forensic Services Unit at the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre, on an indefinite
basis for the purposes of a court ordered assessment.  It was Dr. Shane’s
opinion, based primarily on his interview with the appellant, background
information provided by the appellant’s family documenting his behavior in the
months before the shooting and the appellant’s statement to the police, that
the appellant had been suffering from psychotic delusional disorder, referred
to as the “persecutory type”, for at least two months prior to the killing.  In
his view, it was possible, but highly unlikely, that the appellant possessed
the capacity to appreciate the moral quality of his actions when he killed his
grandfather.  

 

17                              
Similarly, Dr. Yaren was of the opinion that it was “highly probable”
that the appellant did not have the capacity to appreciate that his actions
were wrong.  Relying on his interviews with the appellant, the results of
formal psychological testing conducted at the Health Sciences Centre, records
from the appellant’s three-day stay at the Brandon Mental Health Centre in
August 1995, interviews with the appellant’s family and the appellant’s
statement to the police, he diagnosed the appellant as having developed
full-blown paranoid schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder, roughly two months
prior to the shooting.  While Drs. Shane and Yaren differed in their precise
diagnoses, both agreed that they were quite consistent.  The diagnosed mental
illnesses shared key symptoms, including visual and auditory hallucinations and
persecutory delusions which together severely impair the sufferer’s contact
with or grasp of reality.  Further, both doctors were of the opinion that the
appellant’s act of shooting his grandfather was consistent with his mental
disorder having caused him to believe that only in so doing could he save
himself from further torment.  

 








18                              
The Crown did not call a rebuttal expert to contradict the testimony of
Drs.  Shane and Yaren.  However, on cross-examination the Crown challenged the
expert evidence and was successful in eliciting a number of admissions and
concessions.  The majority of the Court of Appeal relied heavily on those as a
foundation for the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict.  In my view, this
emphasis was misplaced.  Before assessing the weight, including the credibility,
of expert evidence, it is important to characterize the gist of that evidence
correctly.

 

19                              
Dr. Shane’s evidence was particularly problematic and, in isolation,
might not have persuaded a reasonable jury, properly instructed, on a balance
of probabilities, that the appellant did not know at the relevant time that
killing his grandfather was wrong.  Dr. Shane acknowledged that since the
appellant had little or no recollection of the incident, it was very difficult
to assess his state of mind at that time.  He also spoke of the relationship
between the appellant’s psychotic disorder and the fact that he was intoxicated
around the time he shot his grandfather in somewhat confusing terms, suggesting
that the consumption of alcohol may have “disinhibited him . . .
accentuat[ing] certain parts of [his] psychosis” and that it may have
“precipitated” his paranoid perception of his grandfather “and the release of
disturbing and destructive homicidal impulses”.  More importantly, in the eyes
of the majority of the Court of Appeal (at p. 243),

 

    Dr. Shane testified that the accused knew that the killing was
morally wrong during the interview on September 9, 1995.  He described this as
“an island of lucidity” and acknowledged that islands of lucidity “could also
have existed on August 29th, August 30th, 31st and so on as they did . . . on
September 9th”. 

 








Dr. Shane also
admitted that a traumatic event could trigger a psychotic deterioration. 
However, all these concessions and admissions are consistent with the fact,
also obviously acknowledged by the experts in this case, that they could not
state with 100 percent  certainty what the mental state of the appellant
actually was at the time of the offence.  More importantly, the various
possibilities, highlighted by both the Crown and the majority of the Court of
Appeal, did not cause the doctors to depart from their overall, professional
conclusion that the appellant lacked the moral appreciation, at the relevant
time, necessary to trigger his criminal responsibility.  This is particularly
true in the case of Dr. Yaren who candidly acknowledged that his opinion had
evolved over time but unequivocally asserted a professional opinion supportive
of the absence of moral judgment. 

 

20                              
In my view, the Court of Appeal misapprehended the significance of the
evidence dealing with the possibility that the appellant might have killed his
grandfather while experiencing a moment or period of lucidity by interpreting
“islands of lucidity”, the concept used by Dr. Shane, as referring to moments or periods of psychiatric normalcy experienced by
otherwise psychotic individuals.  Dr. Yaren, on cross-examination,
explained why this interpretation is not correct:

 

A . . . I know I’ve referred to it as “fluctuating
states of psychosis.”  Dr.  Shane uses another term, “islands of lucidity” or
periods of lucid thinking.  It’s quite typical for me to interview someone who
is floridly psychotic, who is telling me about, I don’t know, demons inhabiting
their abdomen and creatures coming out of the walls, who then will turn to the
social worker who may also be in the room and say, By the way, could you go to
my apartment at such and such an address and pick up my welfare cheque which is
due on Monday?  You know, in the same sentence, and so that’s not uncommon.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Q . . . I’m going to suggest to you that on August
the 29th of 1995 it’s quite possible that Aaron was, if he was
suffering from a mental disorder, experiencing periods of lucidity.

 

A  Yeah, I guess I’m not as taken by the term
“periods of lucidity” because it suggests that there are periods of completely
normal thinking.  I think a better way to think about it is that there are
aspects of one’s thinking that can be normal or near normal while one is
floridly psychotic, so as an example I gave, at the same time that one is
thinking that there are sort of delusions going on one can also think clearly
about a matter of fact issue in one’s life.  So it’s not to suggest that one’s
thinking turns completely to normal.  Although that’s possible, too, it’s less
likely.

 








Q . . . And so I’m suggesting to you that in that
context he could very well have understood during a period of lucidity on
August 29th, 1995, that it was wrong to kill his grandfather, prior
to actually doing so or even at the time, but that he was carrying out some
other longstanding hatred towards his grandfather.

 

A  For me that’s quite a stretch and I will
certainly agree that from moment to moment he could be in touch with the
reality of the fact that that was a morally wrong thing to do, before, after
and during, but it isn’t consistent with him actually carrying out the behaviour,
in my mind.  I don’t think anyone can ever tell with certainty exactly what his
state of mind was at the very moment that he pulled the trigger, which is
really what you’re getting at.  I really don’t think that can be known.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Q . . . I think you’re asking me to believe then
that four hours later when he gave his statement he really might not have, he
might have had the understanding at that point but he might not have at the
time he shot his grandfather.

 

A  Exactly right.

 

Q  Isn’t that asking me to take a big jump and a
leap of logic?

 

A  To enter into the realm of the thinking of a
psychotic person is to take a big leap in logic.

 

Q  All right.  It involves a lot of guesswork and
assumptions.

 

A  It involves some guesswork and
assumption; it also involves considerable experience in working with psychotic
individuals and coming to an understanding of how their thought processes work,
but yes, sometimes there is an element of guessing.   [Emphasis added.]

 

21                              
I agree with Huband J.A. that the evidence, particularly the testimony
of Dr. Yaren, does not reasonably support the conclusion that the appellant was
lucid to the point of knowing that his acts were morally wrong at the time of
the shooting.  In my view, the totality of the psychiatric evidence did not
give rise to the reasonable possibility that the appellant, who laboured under
the effects of a severe mental disorder at the time he committed a homicide,
and whose moral judgment was impaired as a result, would have had a momentary
reprieve from the effects of his disorder, at the critical time, sufficient to
provide him with the moral insight necessary to engage his criminal
responsibility.

 








22                              
Apart from the psychiatric evidence, the statements made by the
appellant to the police, and, prior to that, to the father of his friend, whom
he informed of the killing and whom he asked to inform the police, are not
inconsistent with the conclusions reached by the experts, nor is the
appellant’s conduct surrounding the commission of the offence.

 

VI.  Conclusion
and Disposition

 

23                              
In my respectful view, judicial experience with the effects of mental
disorder on criminal responsibility, with the type of evidence that is
available to demonstrate it, and with the unjustified skepticism that may be
directed at an accused relying on the defence of mental disorder, should have
given the Court of Appeal cause for concern that the verdict reached by the
jury in the present case was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 
Careful and thorough scrutiny of the record confirms that concern was
warranted.  It is not necessarily easy for a jury to accept that, in lay
person’s terms, an accused who knows what he is doing and knows that it is a
crime, could still genuinely believe that he would not be morally condemned by
reasonable members of society for his conduct.  In my view, the defence proved
this  to be the case and, on the evidence tendered at this trial, it was
unreasonable to conclude otherwise. 

 

24                              
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of
the Court of Appeal and enter a verdict of not criminally responsible by reason
of mental disorder in substitution for the verdict entered at trial. I would
remit the matter to the trial court for a disposition hearing pursuant to s.
672.45  of the Criminal Code .

The accused was charged with second degree murder. 
The accused and S, a young offender, participated in a senseless and violent
beating which left a man dead.  S threw the deceased against a plate glass
window, then propelled him to the ground, causing the deceased to strike the
back of his head on the pavement.  Once the deceased was on the ground, S
straddled the deceased’s thighs and began to punch the deceased in the
stomach.  The accused entered into the fray, ran up to the deceased and stomped
on his forehead a number of times with sufficient force to leave tread marks
from his shoes on the deceased’s forehead.  The Crown’s expert testified that
the fatal injuries to the deceased’s brain resulted from the accused’s
actions.  The defence expert was of the opinion that the deceased had sustained
lethal brain injuries when S caused him to strike his head on the pavement,
fracturing the thickest bone in the skull.  During the course of the trial,
after consulting with the defence expert and another expert, the Crown’s expert
also came to share the view that the fatal injuries were attributable to the
actions of S.  The Crown’s expert was recalled and testified to this effect. 
In its closing submissions to the jury, the Crown maintained its original theory
and invited the jury to rely on its common sense and to convict the accused of
second degree murder as the perpetrator of the fatal injuries, notwithstanding
the medical evidence to the contrary.  The Crown also suggested to the jury
that it could find the accused guilty of second degree murder as S’s co‑perpetrator
or accomplice.  The trial judge charged the jury that they should proceed
carefully before rejecting the ultimately unanimous expert evidence regarding
causation.  The accused was convicted of second degree murder.  The majority of
the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused’s appeal but substituted a conviction
for manslaughter on the basis that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and
unsupported by the evidence.  The dissenting judge concluded that it was not
unreasonable for the jury to convict the accused of second degree murder.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 








While the language of s. 686(1) (b)(i) and
(3)  of the Criminal Code  does not contain an explicit direction to a
court of appeal to set aside a conviction, when a court of appeal dismisses the
accused’s appeal from the original conviction by substituting a verdict on
another count or part of the indictment, the court of appeal implicitly sets
aside the conviction by the trial court and also implicitly affirms the new
conviction on the included offence. Thus, there are co‑existing rights of
appeal for both the accused, under s. 691 , and the Crown, under
s. 693 , to this Court from a court of appeal order for a substituted verdict. 


 

This Court, in Yebes, decided unequivocally
that the reasonableness of a verdict, within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code , involves a decision on a question of law, and as
such gives rise to a further appeal to this Court.  Whether a conviction can be
said to be unreasonable, or not supported by the evidence, imports in every
case the application of a legal standard.  As a jurisdictional issue of
appellate access, the application of that legal standard is enough to make the
question a question of law.  The conclusion that a finding by an appeal court
that a verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence raises a
question of law is in harmony with the overall intent and spirit of the two‑tier
criminal appeal structure in the Criminal Code , even if there are some
statutory constructions that may lend support to a different conclusion.  

 








The test set out in Yebes continues to be the
binding test that appellate courts must apply in determining whether the
verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. A
dissent on the issue of whether the verdict was reasonable is a dissent on a
question of law, whether the dissent is based on the articulation of the
applicable test or on its actual application to the particular circumstances of
the case.  The proper test is “whether the verdict is one that a properly
instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered”.  In
embarking on the exercise mandated by s. 686(1) (a)(i), the
reviewing court must engage in a thorough re‑examination of the evidence
and bring to bear the weight of its judicial experience to decide whether, on
all the evidence, the verdict was a reasonable one.  It is not sufficient for
the reviewing court to simply take a different view of the evidence than the
trier of fact.  Nor is it sufficient for the court of appeal to refer to a
vague unease, or a lingering or lurking doubt based on its own review of the
evidence.  While a “lurking doubt” may be a powerful trigger for thorough
appellate scrutiny of the evidence, it is not, without further articulation of
the basis for such doubt, a proper basis upon which to interfere with the
findings of the trier of fact.  Rather, the appeal court, if it is to overturn
the verdict, must articulate the basis upon which it concludes that the verdict
is inconsistent with the requirements of a judicial appreciation of the
evidence. 

 








In the present case, the “real question to be faced by
the jury” was whether the accused intended to cause the victim’s death or to
cause bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless as
to whether death ensued or not.  The reasons of the majority of the Court of
Appeal focused principally on the issue of causation and did not contain a
thorough review and re‑examination of the evidence as it relates to
intent.  The determination of the intent or foresight of a person at the time
of his participation in a homicide is often a difficult question of fact. The
trial judge thoroughly canvassed all the evidence adduced on the issue of
intent in her charge to the jury.  There is nothing in the compendium of
accumulated judicial experience that should cause concern that the jury went
astray in its review and assessment of the evidence.  Even though it might have
been reasonable for the jury to conclude otherwise, it was perfectly reasonable
for the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had
acted with the requisite intent for murder.  In light of his responsibility as
a party, the fact that the specific blows inflicted by the accused were not the
ones which were the immediate cause of death was of no significance.  In
overturning the verdict of the jury as unreasonable, the majority of the Court
of Appeal was also concerned about the change in the Crown’s theory of the case
and the jury’s ability to appreciate the nuances of all of this, as well as
about the fact that the case was “highly emotional by reason of these
outrageous assaults”.  The concerns of the majority of the Court of Appeal were
insufficient to set aside the verdict of the jury as unreasonable.  They were
more than adequately addressed by the trial judge, whose charge to the jury was
instructive and fair.  The verdict was one that this properly instructed jury,
acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered, and it should be restored.

I.  Introduction

 

1                                  
This appeal was heard together with R. v. Molodowic, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 420, 2000 SCC 16, and R. v. A.G., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439, 2000 SCC
17.  In this trilogy, the Court was asked to reconsider its decision in R.
v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, and, in particular, to decide two
issues of general application.  First, whether the reasonableness of a verdict
involves a question of law, within the meaning of ss. 691  and 693  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , so as to permit a further appeal to this Court
from a decision by a provincial appellate court, and, second, what standard of
review must be applied by the reviewing court in examining the reasonableness
of a verdict.  Each case involved, of course, an application of that standard
to the facts of that case. 

 

II.  Factual
Background

 








2                                  
The respondent John Biniaris was 15 years old at the time of the events
that gave rise to his conviction for second degree murder.  He was tried in
adult court, separately from his co-perpetrator, Stephen Stark, who was tried
first and also convicted of second degree murder. The two had been involved in
a brutal assault on the victim, Graham Niven, whom they had encountered by
chance in the early morning hours of August 13, 1994.

 

3                                  
Graham Niven was coming out of a Coquitlam, B.C., convenience store 
with 14-year-old  Kaven Valin, when they came across a group of four youths,
which included the respondent Biniaris and Stephen Stark.  The events that
followed were described at trial by Kaven Valin, and by Peter Lehtonen, one of
the two other boys who were with Biniaris and Stark that night.  While Niven
and Valin were waiting for a taxi, Niven became involved in a conversation with
the boys, and the subject of drugs came up. 

 








4                                  
Niven asked if anyone “did heroin”.  Stark stood up and responded that
he did. Niven said not to do heroin because “it fucked up your head”.  Stark
became angry and tensions mounted as Stark and Niven stood facing each other
near the entrance to the store.  According to Kaven Valin, shortly after the
initial exchange between Stark and Niven, the respondent Biniaris, who was now
standing beside Niven, told him to “make a move”.  Stark threatened Niven,
saying things such as “I’ll fuckin cut a hole in your head” and “Go in.  Save
yourself”.  At that point, Stark and Niven grabbed each other.  The events
which followed lasted only 20 to 30 seconds.  According to Kaven Valin, Stark
threw Niven into the store’s plate glass window, causing Niven to hit his head
against the window.  Stark then spun Niven around quickly and forcefully pushed
him to the ground, causing Niven to strike the back of his head on the
pavement.  Once Niven was on the ground, Stark straddled Niven’s thighs and
started punching him in the stomach with a closed right fist while holding down
Niven’s right arm with his left hand.  At this point, and for the next five to
ten seconds, the respondent Biniaris entered the fray.  Peter Lehtonen
testified that he thought he saw the respondent inflict a “medium strength”
kick to the middle of Niven’s back just as he was attempting to raise his head
and upper body off the ground by holding onto Stark’s jacket sleeves.  He said
the kick startled Niven and caused him to fall back to the ground.  Lehtonen
also testified that he thought he saw the respondent kick Niven on the top part
of the head with “medium” force.  Kaven Valin did not testify to any kicks.  He
saw the respondent run toward Niven and jump “hard” on the latter’s forehead
roughly five times using his right foot, taking two or three steps back and
forth in between jumps.  The respondent stomped or jumped with sufficient force
to leave tread marks from his shoes on Niven’s forehead.  Lehtonen saw only two
stationary up and down stomps, but he left the scene prior to the end of the
attack.   After the attack, the respondent Biniaris and Stark fled together.  

 

5                                  
Niven was deeply unconscious when emergency personnel arrived at the
convenience store.  He was brain dead at the time of his arrival at Royal
Columbian Hospital and was pronounced dead some 10 hours later.  Biniaris and
Stark were arrested shortly before 11:00 p.m. on August 13, 1994.  The
arresting officers testified that the respondent expressed surprise when
informed that he was under arrest for second degree murder.

 








6                                  
The respondent’s trial before Boyd J. and a jury took an unusual
course.  The Crown’s theory was that the respondent Biniaris had caused Niven’s
death and was guilty of second degree murder as a principal.  As a result, much
of the focus at trial was on the issue of causation.  In turn, that issue
rested largely on the medical evidence, which was both lengthy and complex, as
it dealt with the causes of fatal brain injuries.  Dr. Sheila Carlyle, the
pathologist who performed the autopsy on the deceased, was called by the
Crown.  She and the pathologist called by the defence, Dr.  Jennifer Rice,
agreed on a number of points.  For example, they agreed that there was medical
evidence of only five head injuries -- three stomps to the face, a glancing
blow or kick near the left eye and a fracture to the back of the skull -- and
that to the extent that there may have been additional blows, they were not of
sufficient force to produce bruising or broken bones.  Further, they agreed
that two of the three stomps were attributable to the shoes worn by the
respondent.  The source of the third stomp could not be identified while the
source of the glancing blow or kick was not explained by either Dr. Carlyle or
Dr. Rice.  

 

7                                  
However, the doctors disagreed about whether the fatal injuries suffered
by Niven resulted from the fall or from the stomping.  Dr. Carlyle testified
that the respondent’s actions had caused Niven’s death.  Dr. Rice was of the
opinion that Niven’s fatal brain injuries were attributable to the actions of
Stark, although she could not exclude the unlikely possibility that the
stomping aggravated the already injured brain.  Specifically, she was of
the opinion that Niven had sustained lethal brain injuries when Stark caused
him to strike his head on the pavement, fracturing the thickest bone in the
skull.  

 

8                                  
Dr. Carlyle maintained her position on causation throughout her
testimony in chief and under cross-examination.  However, during the course of
the trial, after consulting with Dr. Rice and with Dr. Charles Hirsch, an
eminent American pathologist, she came to share Dr. Rice’s opinion.  Dr.
Carlyle was recalled and testified to this effect, conceding that the
respondent’s stomping was distinctly unlikely to have caused Niven’s fatal
injuries and that while she could not exclude the possibility that the stomping
had enhanced the pre-existing brain injuries suffered by Niven as a result of
Stark’s actions, this latter opinion was not something she felt “comfortable
advancing with any scientific basis”.  

 








9                                  
Despite this dramatic change in the evidence, at the close of the trial
the Crown maintained its original theory and suggested that, notwithstanding
the consensus in the medical evidence, it was still open to the jury, as a
matter of common sense, to conclude that the respondent had caused Niven’s
death and that, if they found that he had the intent necessary for murder, then
he was guilty of second degree murder as a principal.  However, the jury was
also offered two alternative routes to a conviction for second degree murder,
each of which, like the primary route urged by the Crown, required proof of an
intent to cause bodily harm that the respondent knew was likely to cause death
and was reckless as to whether death ensued or not.  First, even if the
respondent had not caused Niven’s death, the Crown argued that the respondent
was guilty as a co-perpetrator, having acted in concert with Stark with the
necessary intent to sustain a conviction for murder.  Second, it was suggested
that the respondent could be found guilty of murder because he aided or abetted
Stark and did so with the knowledge and intent for murder.  In her charge, the
trial judge warned the jury to be slow to reject the ultimately unanimous
expert evidence regarding causation in favour of common sense.  

 

10                              
The respondent was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced by
Boyd J. to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for five
years.

IV.  Judgments
Below

 

British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 58 

 

(i)  Hall J.A., Braidwood J.A. concurring

 

12                              
Hall J.A. held that the respondent’s conviction for second degree murder
was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.  Relying on s. 686(1) (b)(i)
of the Criminal Code , he dismissed the appeal but substituted a verdict
of manslaughter and remanded the matter to the trial court for sentencing.  The
conclusions of Hall J.A. are summarized in his reasons as follows (at p. 73):

 








By the end of the evidence, the case for a murder conviction against
this accused was frankly a thin case.  This case was also highly emotional by
reason of these outrageous assaults.  If one analyzes the activities of the two
assailants, it seems to me to be an inescapable conclusion that the assaultive
activity attributed to this [accused] all occurred after the infliction of the
fatal harm and in circumstances where Biniaris’ intention to assist in a murder
is unclear.  Nor, as I observed, is this a joint venture case of the sort where
one or more of the parties may possess a deadly weapon like a gun or a knife. 
Biniaris very briefly participated as a party in an affray that had a fatal
consequence.  To found a conviction for murder against this [accused], I
believe that the trier of fact would be required to find that Biniaris aided or
abetted Stark with a murderous intent of the sort set out in s. 229(a)(ii);
R. v. Kirkness, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 74, 60 C.C.C. (3d) 97.  On the facts
here that was perhaps an open verdict one that was but very thinly supported by
the evidence.  The case for murder was sufficiently tenuous against Biniaris
that I believe the murder verdict returned by the jury against this [accused]
was not supported by the evidence.

 

13                              
Hall J.A. was very concerned about the shift in the
underlying theory of culpability and, in particular, about the fact the Crown
maintained its original position that the respondent Biniaris was the principal
offender when, in Hall J.A.’s view, there was no longer any evidentiary basis
to treat him as such. 

 

(ii)  Ryan J.A., dissenting

 

14                              
Ryan J.A. was of the opinion that the jury was entitled to conclude that
the  attack on Niven was a joint endeavor carried out by the respondent and
Stark, and that the nature of the combined attack manifested the requisite
intent to support a conviction for murder.  She noted that the respondent had
been the first to verbally challenge Niven and that he had entered the fray
almost immediately after Stark had thrown Niven to the ground and begun
punching him in the stomach.  While there was evidence which could have been
accepted by the jury as supporting the respondent’s position that he lacked the
necessary intent, Ryan J.A. was of the opinion that “[a]ll of these facts were
for the jury to assess” (p. 77).  In this light, she concluded that it was not
unreasonable for the jury to convict the respondent of second degree murder. 
She would have dismissed the appeal. 

 

V. Analysis  








A.  Rights
of Appeal from a Substituted Verdict

 

15                              
Shortly before the hearing of this appeal, the Court invited the parties
and the interveners to address a preliminary legal issue, which is unique to
this appeal.  Of the three cases before us, Biniaris is the only one
where the appeal is by the Crown, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
dismissing an appeal by the accused from his conviction for murder, but
substituting a conviction for manslaughter.  The question arises, therefore, as
to whether a substituted verdict gives rise to a right of appeal by the Crown,
whether with leave, or as of right on the strength of a dissent in the Court of
Appeal, within the language of s. 693(1)  of the Criminal Code .

 

16                              
In this case, the Court of Appeal, acting under s. 686(1) (b)(i)
and (3) , dismissed the accused’s appeal of his second degree murder conviction
and substituted a conviction for manslaughter.  This was clearly the correct
procedure to follow in the case of a substituted verdict.  See R. v. Nantais,
[1966] 2 O.R. 246 (C.A.).  The issue was raised by this Court as to whether in
substituting a verdict, a court of appeal “sets aside a conviction”, and
consequently provides the Crown with a right of appeal under s. 693(1) , or
whether, in substituting a verdict, a court of appeal “affirms a conviction” so
as to give the accused an appeal from the conviction on the substituted offence
under s. 691(1) , or, possibly, both.

 








17                              
In R. v. McGloan, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 842, at p. 848, Ritchie J.,
writing for the majority, considered the argument that the Crown had no right
of appeal under s. 621(1) (now s. 693(1) ), on the grounds that a substituted
verdict did not set aside a conviction.  Ritchie J. rejected this argument,
pointing to the order of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Appellate Division),
which clearly stated that the original conviction was quashed and a new
conviction substituted.  It is frequently the practice of courts of appeal, in
similar cases, to state in their orders that the original conviction is set
aside and a new conviction is substituted. 

 

18                              
While the language of s. 686(1) (b)(i) and (3)  does not contain an
explicit direction to a court of appeal to set aside a conviction, when a court
of appeal dismisses the accused’s appeal from the original conviction by
substituting a verdict on another count or part of the indictment, the court of
appeal implicitly sets aside the conviction by the trial court and also
implicitly affirms the new conviction on the included offence.  Thus, there are
co-existing rights of appeal for both the accused, under s. 691 , and the Crown,
under s. 693 ,  to this Court from a court of appeal order for a substituted
verdict.

 

B.  Whether
the Reasonableness of a Verdict Is a Question of Law

 

19                              
This Court, in Yebes, supra, decided unequivocally that
the reasonableness of a verdict, within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code , involves a decision on a question of law,
and as such gives rise to a further appeal to this Court. McIntyre J., speaking
for a unanimous six-member panel of the Court, indicated that although the
respondent Crown had raised that jurisdictional issue, it was not “strongly
pressed” at the hearing of the appeal (p. 181).  McIntyre J. recognized that
although the proper qualification of the issue as either one of law, fact, or
mixed fact and law was far from self-evident, there was no reason to treat it
differently from the similar issue of whether a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had occurred, within the meaning of s. 686(1) (b)(iii). 
That having been interpreted as a question of law in Mahoney v. The Queen,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, McIntyre J. concluded that whether a verdict was
unreasonable or not supportable by the evidence also amounted to a question of
law. 

 








20                              
The revisiting of this issue in the current trilogy is based, in part,
on an argument that the decision in Yebes was an unjustified departure
from the previous state of the law, and that it has not been consistently
followed by this Court since. 

 

21                              
The terminology “question of fact”, “question of law”, “question of
mixed fact and law”, “question of law alone”, as used in the Criminal Code 
and in the case law in relation to rights of appeal has created serious
difficulties of interpretation that are best resolved by a broad, purposive
interpretative approach, adopted by Iacobucci J. in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes
Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21 (quoting E. Driedger, Construction
of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87):

 

Today there is only one principle or approach [to
statutory interpretation], namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their
entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with
the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.

 

22                              
The sole purpose of the exercise here, in identifying the reasonableness
of a verdict as a question of fact, law or both, is to determine access to
appellate review.   One can plausibly maintain, on close scrutiny of any
decision under review, that the conclusion that a verdict was unreasonable was
reached sometimes mostly as a matter of law, in other cases predominantly as a
matter of factual assessment.  But when that exercise is undertaken as a
jurisdictional threshold exercise, little is gained by embarking on such a
case-by-case analysis.  Rather, it is vastly preferable to look at the overall
nature of these kinds of decisions, and of their implications.  Ideally,
threshold jurisdictional issues should be as straightforward and free of
ambiguity as possible.  Otherwise, as these and many similar cases illustrate,
courts spend an inordinate amount of time and effort attempting to ascertain
their jurisdiction, while their resources would be better employed dealing with
the issues on their merits.

 








23                              
Whether a conviction can be said to be unreasonable, or not supported by
the evidence, imports in every case the application of a legal standard.  The
process by which this standard is applied inevitably entails a review of the
facts of the case. I will say more about the review process below.  As a
jurisdictional issue of appellate access, the application of that legal
standard is enough to make the question a question of law.  It is of no import
to suggest that it is not a “pure question of law”, or that it is not a
“question of law alone”.

 

24                              
Triers of fact, whether juries or judges, have considerable leeway in
their appreciation of the evidence and the proper inferences to be drawn
therefrom, in their assessment of the credibility of witnesses, and in their
ultimate assessment of whether the Crown’s case is made out, overall, beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Any judicial system must tolerate reasonable differences of
opinion on factual issues.  Consequently, all factual findings are open to the
trier of fact, except unreasonable ones embodied in a legally binding
conviction.  Although reasonable people may disagree about their appreciation
of the facts, a conviction, which conveys legality, authority and finality, is
not something about which reasonable people may disagree.  A conviction cannot
be unreasonable, except as a matter of law, in which case it must be
overturned.  

 








25                              
Very little additional insight is gained by elaborate exercises in
statutory interpretation.  The intention of Parliament is better ascertained in
broad terms than by microscopic examination of the relevant provisions of the Criminal
Code .  Although the cases before us today come as of right, on the basis of
a dissent in the Court of Appeal, I think that the fact that they are appeals
as of right obscures the true nature of the debate on the question of
reviewability of alleged unreasonable convictions.  Access to the Supreme Court
is generally reserved for important cases that have legal significance. 
Inevitably, not all appeals as of right have great legal importance, although
the assumption is that, as a category, they do.  As with all other questions of
law, not all dissents in an appeal court on the issue of unreasonable verdict
rest on a question of great importance.  However, if the reasonableness of a
conviction is not a question of law, no right of appeal will exist from a
decision on that issue, not even with leave of the Court.  This result would,
in my view, be incompatible with the intention of Parliament expressed, overall,
in the totality of the scheme for appellate review.

 

26                              
Criminal appeals on questions of law are based in part on the desire to
ensure that criminal convictions are the product of error-free trials. 
Error-free trials are desirable as such, but even more so as a safeguard
against wrongful convictions. It is inconceivable that Parliament would have
permitted access, by leave or as of right, to this Court, in the case of trials
or appeals affected by legal error, but would have granted no access whatsoever
in the case of possibly the gravest error of all: an unreasonable conviction,
or one that cannot be supported by the evidence.

 

27                              
The conclusion that a finding by an appeal court that a verdict is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence raises a question of law is
in harmony with the overall intent and spirit of the two-tier criminal appeal
structure in the Criminal Code , even if there are some statutory
constructions that may lend support to a different conclusion. Several of these
constructions were advanced, none of which, in my view, is conclusive. 

 

(i)    Sections 686(1) (a)(i) and 686(1) (a)(ii)

 








28                              
For instance, the contrast between s. 686(1) (a)(i) and s. 686(1) (a)(ii)
has been relied upon to suggest that the opinion of a court of appeal that the
verdict is unreasonable is merely an opinion on a question of fact.  For
convenience, I will set these subsections out again:

 

686. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand
trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of
appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law. . . .

 

29                              
The reasoning is that if it were a question of law, there would be no
need for both s. 686(1) (a)(i) and s. 686(1) (a)(ii).  See Sunbeam
Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 221, at pp. 237-38; Lampard
v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 373, at pp. 380-81.  This inference from the
wording of the two subsections is far from inescapable.  True, the remedial
power contained in s. 686(1) (a)(i) may be linked to the jurisdiction of
the court of appeal to entertain, with leave, questions of mixed fact and law
or indeed questions of fact (see s. 675(1) (a)(ii)).  However, it may
also be viewed as a question of law that needed to be specifically identified
as a basis for appellate intervention, since it would not fit well under the
terminology used in s. 686(1) (a)(ii): an unreasonable verdict is not a
“wrong decision on a question of law”.  It is also arguable that the two
subsections may coexist without creating a redundancy or in any way doing
violence to the idea that an unreasonable verdict is a question of law, by
contrasting the word “verdict” in s. 686(1) (a)(i) with the phrase
“judgment of the trial court” in s. 686(1) (a)(ii).  The “verdict” could
be seen as referring to the wrong legal conclusion of the trial judge or the
jury on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence, as opposed to the wrong legal
conclusions of the trial judge on a myriad of issues of substantive law,
procedure and evidence. 








 

(ii)  “Question of Law Alone” and Unreasonable Acquittals

 

30                              
Various arguments have been advanced, based on the implications that
should flow from the use of the expression “question of law alone” in s.
676(1) (a), which provides for appeals by the Crown to the court of
appeal.  These arguments are of little assistance or consequence in determining
the scope of access to this Court under ss. 691  or 693 .  The use of that
expression can be taken to mean either that the Crown has a right of appeal
from an acquittal only on a question of law, or that there is such a thing as a
“question of law alone”, which is distinct from a “question of law”.  I think
it means the former.  It is used in contrast to the right of the accused to
appeal both on questions of law, questions of fact, and questions of mixed fact
and law (see s. 675(1) (a)(i) and (ii)), and it is of no assistance in
further defining the scope of the expression “question of law” in ss. 691  and
693 .

 

31                              
The fact that a “question of law alone” is nothing different than a
“question of law”, and that the reasonableness of a verdict is a “question of
law” within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(i), raises the question of
whether the Crown will have a right of appeal against an “unreasonable
acquittal”.  Although this question does not squarely arise on the facts of any
of the three cases before us, it arises unavoidably since the interpretation
given to “question of law” in s. 693(1)  must equally apply to the phrase
“question of law alone” in ss. 675(1)  and 676(1) .  The  conclusion that the
reasonableness of a verdict always raises a question of law has a single,
inevitable, consequence for these two sections: an accused person does not
require leave to appeal under s. 675(1)  where he or she challenges the
reasonableness of the verdict.  On the other hand, it will not affect the Crown’s
rights of appeal from an acquittal in any way.  

 








32                              
In their written submissions, both the Attorney General for Ontario and
the Attorney General of Manitoba (who participated in the companion cases)
recognized that the law, as it stood at the time of the appeal, is clear that
the Crown has no right of appeal from an acquittal on the ground that it was
unreasonable, because the reasonableness of a verdict is a question of fact (or
one of mixed fact and law).  See, e.g., Sunbeam, supra, at p.
233; Lampard, supra, at pp. 380-81; Ciglen v. The Queen,
[1970] S.C.R. 804, at pp. 814-15, per Cartwright C.J., dissenting; R.
v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at pp. 70-71; R. v. H. (D.S.) and N.
(J.D.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 392, rev’g (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 564 (B.C.C.A.); R.
v. Blundon (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 249 (Nfld. C.A.), at  pp. 279-80.  There
can be no suggestion that the Crown’s right of appeal at first instance is
being enlarged or expanded to include “unreasonable acquittals” as a result of
the determination that the reasonableness of a verdict is a “question of law”
as well as a “question of law alone”.  As before, the Crown is barred from
appealing an acquittal on the sole basis that it is unreasonable, without
asserting any other error of law leading to it.

 








33                              
There is no anomaly in this result.  The powers of the court of appeal
in the case of Crown appeals on a question of law are contained in s. 686(4) of
the Code.  There is no reference in that section to an unreasonable
verdict.  This is consistent with the limited rights of appeal conferred on the
Crown by s. 676(1) .  The absence of language granting a remedial power
corresponding to s. 686(1) (a)(i), suggests that Parliament did not
intend “unreasonable acquittals” to be appealable by the Crown at first
instance.  Further, and more importantly, as a matter of law, the concept of 
“unreasonable acquittal” is incompatible with the presumption of innocence and
the burden which rests on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable
doubt.  See Lampard, supra, at pp. 380-81; Schuldt v. The
Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, at p. 610; B. (G.), supra, at pp.
70-71.  Since, different policy considerations apply in providing the Crown
with a right of appeal against acquittals, it seems to me that there is no
principle of parity of appellate access in the criminal process that must
inform our interpretation of this issue. 

 

(iii)  Redundancy

 

34                              
Finally, there is little merit in the argument, which is more one of
policy than of statutory interpretation, that a second level of assessment of
the reasonableness of a verdict is unnecessary since this Court is in no better
position than courts of appeal to arrive at a correct answer, and that the
exercise is merely repetitious.  The review by the Supreme Court of a decision
by a court of appeal that a verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by
the evidence is in reality the first level of appellate review of that
conclusion.  The court of appeal, in examining the issue, obviously does not
have the benefit of the analysis of the question by the trial court, as it
would, or should, on legal issues such as the admissibility of evidence or the
availability of a defence. The determination of the reasonableness of the
verdict is therefore an original decision by the court of appeal, and there is
no reason to bar the possibility of a review of that important decision.  

 








35                              
In the end, there is no statutory interpretation principle that
precludes the conclusion reached in Yebes, which is in accordance with
the overriding principle expressed in Rizzo Shoes, supra.  To the
extent that decisions subsequent to Yebes may have suggested that the
reasonableness of a verdict does not raise a question of law so as to give rise
to a right of appeal, either as of right or by leave, under ss. 691  or 693  of
the Criminal Code , these decisions in my view are in error, and Yebes
must be reaffirmed.  Three cases were brought to our attention which are said
to cast doubt on whether the reasonableness of a verdict involves a question of
law.  In all three cases, two of which were appeals by the Crown and one by the
defence, this Court quashed the appeal which was launched as of right on the
basis of a dissent in the court of appeal on the question of whether the
verdict was reasonable.  See R. v. Jensen (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 430
(Ont. C.A.), appeal quashed, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 304; R. v. Osvath (1996),
87 O.A.C. 274 (C.A.), appeal quashed, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 7; R. v. Hamilton,
[1997] Q.J. No. 67 (QL) (C.A.), appeal quashed June 2, 1997, [1997] S.C.C.A.
No. 105 (QL).  The quashing of these appeals, which implies an absence of
jurisdiction rather than a disposition of the appeal on the merits, could be
viewed as a proper application of Yebes.  Arguably, Yebes left
open the possibility that some dissents in appellate courts on the
unreasonableness of a verdict may not amount to dissents on a question of law. 
After referring to the difficulty in drawing a clear line between a question of
fact and one of law, and in response to the argument advanced by the Crown in
that case that there was no point of law dividing the majority and the dissenting
judge in the Court of Appeal, McIntyre J. said, at p. 181:

 

Therefore, whether or not an appeal raises a question of law can only
be determined after an examination of both the statements of law and the
application of the law to the facts in the courts below.

 








This may be
taken to suggest that some, but not all differences of opinion about the
reasonableness of a verdict will give rise to a question of law.  Others,
presumably, would at best involve a mixed question of fact and law, or a simple
disagreement on the facts.  With respect, I do not agree that such a
distinction was intended by Yebes.  It is both unsound and undesirable.
When a conviction is said to be unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence,
it is that conclusion itself that raises a question of law, not merely the
process by which the conclusion was reached.  Therefore, there is no need to
determine whether that conclusion was arrived at by the application of the
wrong legal test, or otherwise tainted by a legal irregularity, since even when
it applies the right test, in an error-free process, the court of appeal must
be right, as a matter of law, on the legal appreciation of the verdict as a
reasonable one.  This approach is also consistent with the need for clarity in jurisdictional
matters.  There certainly would be little judicial economy in embarking upon a
characterization of the appellate exercise as one of fact, rather than law, as
a threshold determination of jurisdiction.  Rather than streamlining or
reducing appeals, it would add to their litigiousness, but on the wrong
question. 

 

C.  Whether
the Standard of Review Under Section 686(1)(a)(i) Should Be Modified

 

36                              
The test for an appellate court determining
whether the verdict of a jury or the judgment of a trial judge is unreasonable
or cannot be supported by the evidence has been unequivocally expressed in Yebes
as follows:

 

[C]urial review is invited whenever a jury goes beyond
a reasonable standard. . . . [T]he test is ‘whether the verdict
is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have
rendered’.

 

(Yebes, supra, at p. 185 (quoting Corbett
v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275, at p. 282, per Pigeon J.).) 

 

That formulation of the test imports both an objective assessment
and, to some extent, a subjective one.  It requires the appeal court to
determine what verdict a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could judicially
have arrived at, and, in doing so, to review, analyse and, within the limits of
appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence.  This latter process is usually
understood as referring to a subjective exercise, requiring the appeal court to
examine the weight of the evidence, rather than its bare sufficiency.   The
test is therefore mixed, and it is more helpful to articulate what the
application of that test entails, than to characterize it as either an
objective or a subjective test.  

 








37                              
The Yebes test is expressed in terms of a verdict reached by a
jury.  It is, however, equally applicable to the judgment of a judge sitting at
trial without a jury. 








The review for
unreasonableness on appeal is different, however, and somewhat easier when the
judgment under attack is that of a single judge, at least when reasons for
judgment of some substance are provided.  In those cases, the reviewing
appellate court may be able to identify a flaw in the evaluation of the
evidence, or in the analysis, that will serve to explain the unreasonable
conclusion reached, and justify the reversal.  For example, in R. v. Burke,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, this Court was in a position to identify the deficiencies
in the trial judge’s analysis of the evidence which led to her unreasonable
conclusions in respect of the three counts of indecent assault facing the
accused.  In that case, Sopinka J. found that the trial judge had ignored the
possibility of collusion or corroboration between witnesses before accepting
their “strikingly similar” evidence, had not been alive to circumstances (i.e.,
the absence of physical traces of an alleged indecent assault which, if true,
should have left observable marks) which caused great concern about the
reliability of evidence adduced in support of allegations of a bizarre nature,
and had relied uncritically on unorthodox identification evidence.  Similarly,
in R. v. Reitsma, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 769, rev’g (1997), 97 B.C.A.C. 303,
this Court agreed with Rowles J.A., dissenting, that the trial judge had failed
to advert to deficiencies in the pre-trial identification procedure and the
shortcoming of “in-dock” identification.  Finally, in R. v. O’Connor
(1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 487 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 492-93 and 518-20, the trial
judge accepted the accused’s evidence that he was not present at the place
where the offence was alleged to have been committed, and yet convicted the
accused.  This logical inconsistency was relied upon by the Court of Appeal to
explain the unreasonableness of the verdict.  These examples demonstrate that
in trials by judge alone, the court of appeal often can and should identify the
defects in the analysis that led the trier of fact to an unreasonable
conclusion.  The court of appeal will therefore be justified to intervene and
set aside a verdict as unreasonable when the reasons of the trial judge reveal
that he or she was not alive to an applicable legal principle, or entered a
verdict inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached.  These discernable
defects are themselves sometimes akin to a separate error of law, and therefore
easily sustain the conclusion that the unreasonable verdict which rests upon
them also raises a question of law. 

 

38                              
The exercise of appellate review is considerably more difficult when the
court of appeal is required to determine the alleged unreasonableness of a verdict
reached by a jury.  If there are no errors in the charge, as must be assumed,
there is no way of determining the basis upon which the jury reached its
conclusion. But this does not dispense the reviewing court from the need to
articulate the basis upon which it finds that the conclusion reached by the
jury was unreasonable. It is insufficient for the court of appeal to refer to a
vague unease, or a lingering or lurking doubt based on its own review of the
evidence.  This “lurking doubt” may be a powerful trigger for thorough appellate
scrutiny of the evidence, but it is not, without further articulation of the
basis for such doubt, a proper basis upon which to interfere with the findings
of a jury.  In other words, if, after reviewing the evidence at the end of an
error-free trial which led to a conviction, the appeal court judge is left with
a lurking doubt or feeling of unease, that doubt, which is not in itself
sufficient to justify interfering with the conviction, may be a useful signal
that the verdict was indeed reached in a non-judicial manner. In that case, the
court of appeal must proceed further with its analysis.  

 








39                              
When a jury which was admittedly properly instructed returns what the
appeal court perceives to be an unreasonable conviction, the only rational
inference, if the test in Yebes is followed, is that the jury, in
arriving at that guilty verdict, was not acting judicially.  This conclusion
does not imply an impeachment of the integrity of the jury.  It may be that the
jury reached its verdict pursuant to an analytical flaw similar to the errors
occasionally incurred in the analysis of trial judges and revealed in their
reasons for judgment.  Such error would of course not be apparent on the face
of the verdict by a jury.  But the unreasonableness itself of the verdict would
be apparent to the legally trained reviewer when, in all the circumstances of a
given case, judicial fact-finding precludes the conclusion reached by the
jury.  Judicial appreciation of the evidence is governed by rules that dictate
the required content of the charge to the jury.  These rules are sometimes
expressed in terms of warnings,  mandatory or discretionary sets of
instructions by which a trial judge will convey the product of accumulated
judicial experience to the jury, who, by definition, is new to the exercise. 
For instance, a judge may need to warn the jury about the frailties of
eye-witness identification evidence.  Similarly, years of judicial experience
has revealed the possible need for special caution in evaluating the evidence
of certain witnesses, such as accomplices, who may, to the uninitiated, seem
particularly knowledgeable and therefore credible.  Finally, judicial warnings
may be required when the jury has heard about the criminal record of the
accused, or about similar fact evidence. But these rules of caution cannot be
exhaustive, they cannot capture every situation, and cannot be formulated in
every case as a requirement of the charge.  Rather, after the jury has been
adequately charged as to the applicable law, and warned, if necessary, about
drawing possibly unwarranted conclusions, it remains that in some cases, the
totality of the evidence and the peculiar factual circumstances of a given case
will lead an experienced jurist to conclude that the fact-finding exercise
applied at trial was flawed  in light of the unreasonable result that it
produced.

 








40                              
When an appellate court arrives at that conclusion, it does not act as a
“thirteenth juror”, nor is it “usurping the function of the jury”.  In
concluding that no properly instructed jury acting judicially could have
convicted, the reviewing court inevitably is concluding that these particular
jurors who convicted must not have been acting judicially. In that context, acting
judicially means not only acting dispassionately, applying the law and
adjudicating on the basis of the record and nothing else.  It means, in
addition, arriving at a conclusion that does not conflict with the bulk of
judicial experience.  This, in my view, is the assessment that must be made by
the reviewing court. It requires not merely asking whether twelve properly
instructed jurors, acting judicially, could reasonably have come to the same
result, but doing so through the lens of judicial experience which serves as an
additional protection against an unwarranted conviction. 

 








41                              
It is not particularly significant to describe this judicial
oversight as either objective or subjective.  It is exercised by an appeal
court and therefore it will invariably draw on a collection of judicial
experiences.  Because of its judicial character, and because it purports to
identify features of a case that will give experienced jurists cause for
concern, it is imperative that the reviewing court articulate as precisely as
possible what features of the case suggest that the verdict reached by the jury
was unreasonable, despite the fact that it was not tainted by any erroneous
instructions as to the applicable law.  In some cases, the articulation of the
grounds upon which an appellate court concludes that a conviction was
unreasonable may elucidate previously unidentified dangers in evidence and 
give rise to additional warnings to the jury in subsequent cases.  Most of the
time, it will simply point to a case that presented itself with several causes
for concern, none of which, in isolation, might have required that the jury be
warned in any particular way.  There are many illustrations from the case law
of verdicts having been found unreasonable essentially on the strength of
accumulated judicial experience.  Concerns about various aspects of the frailty
of identification evidence have been a recurrent basis, by itself or together
with other considerations, for overturning verdicts as unreasonable.  See,
e.g., Burke, supra; Reitsma, supra; R. v. Keeper
(1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 156 (C.A.); R. v.  Malcolm (1993), 81 C.C.C.
(3d) 196 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.);
R. v. N.D., [1993] O.J. No. 2139 (QL) (C.A.).  Judicial experience has
also been relied upon to question the reasonableness of verdicts in cases of
sexual misconduct presenting troubling features such as allegations of sexual
touching of a bizarre nature (see, e.g., Burke, supra; R. v.
C.V., [1993] O.J. No. 1512 (QL) (C.A.); R. v. L. (J.H.H.P.) (1992),
75 C.C.C. (3d) 165 (Man. C.A.)), or the possibility of collusion between
witnesses (see, e.g., Burke, supra).  Finally, the experience of
the courts has occasionally been brought to bear, although not always
explicitly, on the assessment of verdicts rejecting a  defence with respect to
which there may be unjustified skepticism or even prejudice because those relying
on such justifications or excuses may be viewed as simply trying to avoid
responsibility for their actions.  See, e.g., R. v. Vaillancourt
(1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 530 (Que. C.A.); Molodowic, supra.  

 

42                              
It follows from the above that the test in Yebes continues to be
the binding test that appellate courts must apply in determining whether the
verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.  To
the extent that it has a subjective component, it is the subjective assessment
of an assessor with judicial training and experience that must be brought to
bear on the exercise of reviewing the evidence upon which an allegedly
unreasonable conviction rests.  That, in turn, requires the reviewing judge to
import his or her knowledge of the law and the expertise of the courts, gained
through the judicial process over the years, not simply his or her own personal
experience and insight.  It also requires that the reviewing court articulate
as explicitly and as precisely as possible the grounds for its intervention.  I
wish to stress the importance of explicitness in the articulation of the
reasons that support a finding that a verdict is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence.  Particularly since this amounts to a question of law
that may give rise to an appeal, either as of right or by leave, the judicial
process requires clarity and transparency as well as accessibility to the legal
reasoning of the court of appeal.   When there is a dissent in the court of
appeal on the issue of the reasonableness of the verdict, both the spirit and
the letter of s. 677  of the Criminal Code  should be complied with.  This
Court should be supplied with the grounds upon which the verdict was found to
be, or not to be, unreasonable.  








 

D.  Application
to this Appeal

 

43                              
The appellant raised three issues before this Court:

 

1.    Did the majority of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal err in law in failing to consider that the verdict was
reasonable and supported by the evidence on the basis of co-perpetrator
liability as outlined in Regina v. McMaster, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 740?  

 

2.    Did the majority of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal err in law by applying the wrong test to determine whether the
verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence?  

 

3.    Did the majority of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal err in law in failing to review, and to some extent re-examine
and re-weigh, all of the evidence in the instant case when it concluded that
the verdict was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence?

 








44                              
These three issues can conveniently be addressed together.  At the
outset of the respondent Biniaris’ trial and until the change in  Dr. Carlyle’s
opinion, the Crown’s position was that Biniaris alone had caused the fatal
injuries suffered by Niven and was guilty of second degree murder as a
principal.  The shift in Dr. Carlyle’s evidence led Crown counsel, at the end
of the trial, to advance a modified, three-part theory of liability --
liability as a principal, liability as a co-perpetrator or liability as an
aider or abettor.  Boyd J. dealt adequately with the implications of the
reversal of Dr. Carlyle’s position and the Crown’s modified theory in her
charge to the jury.  The trial judge explained the Crown’s position that it was
open to the jury to reject the medical evidence offered by Drs. Rice and
Carlyle on the issue of causation in favour of their own common sense and, if
they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Biniaris had acted with the
requisite intent, to conclude that Biniaris was guilty of second degree murder
as the perpetrator of Niven’s fatal injuries.  However, Boyd J. quite properly
urged the jury to be very careful, characterizing the choice to ignore the
unanimous expert evidence on causation as a “dangerous venture”.  The trial
judge then explained the circumstances under which it was open to the jury,
applying the relevant principles of party liability set out in s. 21(1)  of the Criminal
Code , to convict the accused of second degree murder:

 

The matter now to consider is under what
circumstances one or more persons can be responsible for the death of the
deceased and one actus reus.

 

                                                                     .
. .

 

[I]f you should find after a consideration of all of the evidence that
it has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Mr.  Biniaris,
together with Mr. Stark, participated in a chain of events which were all
interrelated and interconnected from the time the altercation began until they
left the scene, then you will have concluded that the actus reus has been
committed.

 

.
. .

 

Assuming  . . . that you conclude there was such a
chain of events, if you should find beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Biniaris, during the course of that chain of events, struck Mr. Niven in the
manner which has been described in the evidence, and if you find again beyond a
reasonable doubt that these blows were delivered by Mr. Biniaris either with
the intent to cause his death or with the intent to cause Mr. Niven bodily harm
which he knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death
ensued or not, then he is guilty of second degree murder [as a co-perpetrator]
no matter which of the blows during that series of events, including the
initial fall to the ground, caused Mr. Niven’s death.

 

Assuming again that you conclude there was a chain
of events, an interrelated chain of events constituting the actus reus, if you
find it was Mr. Stark who intended to kill Mr. Niven and that Mr. Biniaris,
knowing of Stark’s intention to cause bodily harm to Niven that was likely to
cause death, aided or abetted Stark by either encouraging Niven to fight or by
actually participating in the beating in order to carry out that purpose, then
you will have found that Mr. Biniaris was an accomplice and is a party to the
offence of second degree murder and is equally guilty regardless of whether or
not Mr. Biniaris’ actions, the stomping, the kicking, regardless [of] whether
any of that actually caused Mr. Niven’s death.  

 

What I am really saying to you is there are two
routes to a second degree murder conviction.  One is if you find that Mr.
Biniaris was the principal offender, and that other is if you find that Mr. Biniaris
was a party [either as a co-perpetrator or as an accomplice] to a single
transaction, an interrelated series of events that led to and ultimately
resulted in Mr. Niven’s death.

 








45                              
The unusual course of the respondent’s trial caused grave concern to the
majority of the Court of Appeal and ultimately, in my respectful view, led Hall
J.A.’s reasonableness analysis astray.  Despite the availability of two
alternative routes to a second degree murder conviction, neither of which was
dependent on proof that the respondent actually caused Niven’s fatal injuries,
Hall J.A.’s reasons for judgment indicate that he remained unduly concerned
about causation.  In light of the state of the medical evidence at the end of
the trial, Hall J.A. correctly concluded that, “the only safe route for a
conviction of the appellant Biniaris for murder lay through the application of
s. 21  of the Criminal Code ” (p. 71).  This was also clearly the view of
the trial judge who directed the jury accordingly.  However, Hall J.A.’s
analysis remained focused on the issue of causation, despite its minor
significance to the respondent’s liability as a party.  He wrote (at pp.
71-73):

 

At the outset, the jury had, in the Crown opening, been advised of the
theory that the fatal injuries were caused by actions of the [accused]
Biniaris.  By the end of the case there had been a complete reversal of this
theory.  He was now said to be liable to be found culpable of murder on the
ground of being a party to the activity of Stark.  It must be observed that the
activity of Stark causative of the injuries had terminated almost entirely by
the time Biniaris became involved in the affray.  Blows struck by Stark after
Niven was on the pavement were to his abdomen area and if, as was less than
clear from the evidence, Stark did, near the termination of the incident,
direct a kick at the chin of Niven, that again seems unlikely to have had any
causal relationship to the serious brain injury.  Thus in this case, we have
the situation that anything done by Biniaris, the [accused], by his stomping
activity, while no doubt manifesting an intention to assist Stark in his
general assault of Niven, seems most unlikely to have been causative of the
fatal brain injuries suffered by Niven.  The nature of the brain injuries
testified to by the experts makes the temporal sequence of events important
here.  This [accused] came into the fray at a point in time when, as I
interpret the medical testimony, the damage to the brain of the deceased was
irreversible.  

 

                                                                     .
. .

 

If one analyzes the activities of the two assailants, it seems to me to
be an inescapable conclusion that the assaultive activity attributed to the [accused]
all occurred after the infliction of the fatal harm and in circumstances where
Biniaris’ intention to assist in a murder is unclear.

 








46                              
In my opinion, Hall J.A. properly identified mens rea as a
critical issue but erred in interfering with the conclusion reached by the jury
on that question, which was fully open to them on the evidence. He said (at pp.
72-73):

 

In order to be found guilty of murder as a party,
the jury would have to conclude that the [accused] had the same intent as the
killer [i.e., the intent to cause death or the intention to cause bodily harm
that he knew was likely to cause death, being reckless whether death ensued or
not] and was carrying out these acts of stomping for the purpose of aiding and
abetting in the murder of the deceased.  The intention is probably less easy to
attribute in the case of a sudden affray of this sort than might be the case
where a deadly weapon is anticipated to be used.

 

I see the position of the [accused] in this case as
rather different from that of Stark.  Stark, the initial aggressor outside the
store, decided to attack Niven and carried out that attack with great violence
and with disastrous results.  Biniaris was by no means the prime mover in the
event.

 

                                                                     .
. .

 

Nor, as I observed, is this a joint venture case of the sort where one
or more  of the parties may possess a deadly weapon like a gun or a knife. 

 

Whether Stark
was the initial aggressor, the degree and the intensity of the respondent’s
participation in the attack and his intention or foresight at the time of his
participation in the attack were all matters raised by the evidence and
commented upon by the parties and by the trial judge.  Although a conviction
for manslaughter was a given, as was conceded by the respondent before this
Court, and although reasonable people may disagree about whether they would
have found, on the evidence, that the respondent had the requisite intent for
murder, there is nothing to qualify that conclusion, which is really the only
one in issue in this case, as an unreasonable one.

 








47                              
On the evidence adduced by the Crown, it was reasonable for the jury to
conclude that the respondent and Stark had aided and abetted one another in a
joint attack on Niven.  There was evidence on the basis of which the jury could
reasonably find that the respondent was no less a “prime mover” or “initial
aggressor” than Stark.  The evidence establishes that Biniaris stood up and
moved close to Niven soon after the initial exchange of words between Stark and
Niven, suggesting, not unreasonably, that the respondent was readying himself
for a fight.  The evidence also suggests that the respondent, as Ryan J.A.
noted, “was the first to verbally challenge Niven to a fight” (p. 75) and that he
entered the fray moments after Stark began to punch Niven, at a point where
Niven was trying to raise himself, holding onto Stark’s jacket sleeves. 
Finally, the evidence establishes that the respondent and Stark fled the scene
together. It was clearly reasonable for the jury to conclude that the
respondent had, through words and actions which encouraged and assisted Stark,
participated in an interrelated chain of events which ultimately led to Niven’s
death.  The respondent does not dispute the reasonableness of this conclusion
as is reflected in his submission that he was properly convicted of
manslaughter. 

 








48                              
Both Boyd J., in her instructions to the jury, and Hall J.A. recognized
that intent, namely whether Biniaris intended to cause Niven’s death or to
cause bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless as
to whether death ensued or not, was the “real question to be faced by the jury”
(p. 72).  However, Hall J.A.’s reasons do not contain a thorough review and
re-examination of the evidence as it relates to intent.  In light of the
respondent’s brief involvement in the sudden affray, Hall J.A. opined that the
respondent’s “intention to assist in a murder [was] unclear” (p.  73).  In
contrast, Boyd J. thoroughly canvassed all the evidence adduced on the issue of
intent in her charge to the jury, including the evidence of Valin and Lehtonen
in relation to the number and strength of the kicks and stomps allegedly
administered by the respondent, the evidence of these same witnesses regarding
the short duration of the attack on Niven and of the respondent’s participation
therein, the evidence of Dr. Rice which, defence counsel suggested,
contradicted Kaven Valin’s testimony that the stomps administered by the
respondent involved a substantial amount of force, the evidence of Dr. Carlyle
that the effects of “lividity” enhanced and emphasized the tread mark patterns
and related bruising on Niven’s forehead, and the testimony of the arresting
officers concerning the respondent’s surprised reaction upon being informed
that he was being charged with second degree murder.

 

49                              
I agree with Ryan J.A.’s conclusion that “[a]ll of these facts
were for the jury to assess” (p. 77).  There is nothing in the compendium of
accumulated judicial experience that should cause concern that the jury went
astray in its review and assessment of the evidence.  Even though it might have
been reasonable for the jury to conclude otherwise, it was perfectly reasonable
for the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Biniaris had acted
with the requisite intent for murder.  There was evidence upon
which the jury could reasonably find that the respondent had administered one
or more kicks to Niven, including the glancing blow to the face; and to accept
the Crown’s contention that the respondent had “changed gears” when he moved
from kicking to stomping and that, in so doing, he “obviously intended deadly
harm”.  In the same way, it was not unreasonable for the jury to conclude that
in deciding to stomp, not once but twice, on Niven’s head, the respondent’s
purposive, deliberate and intentional conduct, which involved the repeated use
of violence against a defenceless man, established that he intended to cause
Niven bodily harm which he must have known was likely to cause death, being
reckless as to whether or not death ensued.  As
indicated earlier, in light of his responsibility as a party, the fact that the
specific blows inflicted by the respondent were not the ones which were the
immediate cause of death was of no significance.

 








50                              
In overturning the verdict of the jury as unreasonable, Hall J.A.
was troubled by the unusual course of the trial, resulting from Dr. Carlyle’s
abandonment of the opinion upon which the Crown’s case had originally been
cast.  He viewed this as a “dramatic” change in the
composition of the Crown’s case and was concerned that “the nuances of all this
might not have been that easy for a jury to appreciate” (p. 72).  Moreover,
Hall J.A. considered this case to have been “highly emotional by reason of
these outrageous assaults” (p. 73).  These concerns, in my respectful opinion,
were insufficient to set aside the verdict of the jury as unreasonable.  They
were more than adequately addressed by the trial judge, whose charge to the
jury was instructive and fair.

 

51                              
The determination of the intent or foresight of a person at the time of
his participation in a homicide is often a difficult question of fact.  It
certainly was so in this case where a very young man was involved in a brief,
senseless and violent beating which left an innocent man dead.  Despite the
unusual turn of events at trial, and the fact that many similar incidents in
the past have led to convictions for manslaughter only, the law required this
jury to answer this difficult question on the facts of this case, and it did. 
In my view, the verdict was one that this properly instructed jury, acting
judicially, could reasonably have rendered, and it should be restored. 

 

VI. Conclusion
and Disposition

 

52                              
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of
the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction for second degree murder and the
sentence imposed by Boyd J.

Criminal law -- Charge to jury -- Evidence of

two jailhouse informants introduced by Crown at trial -- Accused convicted of
first degree murder -- Whether Court of Appeal erred in concluding that trial
judge failed to adequately instruct jury about unreliability with respect to

Criminal law  Evidence -- Jailhouse informants --
Testimonies of two jailhouse informants introduced by Crown at trial -- Accused
convicted of first degree murder -- Whether evidence supported implied finding
at trial that informants were trustworthy.

 

Criminal law -- Verdicts -- Testimonies of two

A 19‑month‑old child was found murdered in
her crib wrapped in a green comforter.  Only the accused and the child’s mother
had access to her on the night of the murder.  The child had blood and vomit on
her face, a swollen left eye, bruises on her head, and bruising and redness on
her genital area.  The cause of death was acute brain injury.  Trace amounts of
semen were found on vaginal and anal swabs but DNA testing of sperm proved
inconclusive, likely due to contamination of the sample.  The Crown’s expert
could neither include nor exclude the accused as the possible source of the
sperm.  There had been intense sexual activity in the apartment in the period
preceding the murder.  Sperm, including sperm from the child’s natural father,
was found throughout the apartment including on a toy in the crib, on the
child’s pyjama top, on the crib sheets and in two places on the green
comforter.  However, the child had been bathed just before the night of the
murder and this, combined with the bacterial environment of a child in diapers,
would quickly degrade sperm.  The accused’s grey track pants were found in the
apartment stained with semen, blood of the same type as the child’s, and a
juice substance similar to that in her bottle.  On the way to the hospital the
following morning, the accused whispered to the mother three times that he was
sorry.  The accused made other inculpatory statements.

 








There was no direct evidence establishing that the
accused had struck the fatal blows.  There was evidence of previous physical
abuse committed against the child.  One month prior to the murder, the accused
had thrown the child approximately one metre into the wooden frame of a couch. 
An injury to the child’s right buttock had appeared on a day on which the
accused had exclusive care of the child.  The mother had also been seen
striking the child on several occasions.

 

The Crown led evidence from two jailhouse informants
who testified that the accused, while incarcerated, had admitted that he had
killed the child to stop her crying.  Their testimony did not include a
suggestion that the killing was committed during the commission of a sexual
assault.  Both informants had lengthy criminal records of dishonesty.  One
unsuccessfully sought a lighter sentence in return for his testimony and had
testified as an informant in a prior trial.  The other had a history of
substance abuse and a psychiatric history highlighted by suicide attempts,
paranoia, deep depression and a belief in clairvoyant ability.  Both had
histories of offering to testify in criminal trials. 

 

In closing argument, defence counsel ridiculed both
informants and invited the jury to reject their testimonies.  Crown counsel’s
jury address noted their criminal records and that one had previously appeared
as a Crown witness and had attempted to make a deal.  The trial judge’s jury
charge did not provide a Vetrovec warning to the jury about the danger
of relying on the informants’ testimonies.  Neither counsel requested a warning
nor objected to the lack of a warning.  The accused was convicted of first
degree murder.  The Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial.

 








Held (Iacobucci, Major and Arbour JJ. dissenting):  The
appeal should be allowed.

 

Per Gonthier, McLachlin
and Bastarache JJ.:  There was no error of law on the part of the trial judge
in failing to provide a Vetrovec warning.  It was within the discretion
of the trial judge whether to give a warning and there was a foundation for his
exercise of discretion.

 

Trial judges must not pigeon-hole witnesses into
categories and should examine all factors that might impair the worth of a
witness.  No Vetrovec warning is necessary if the trial judge believes
the witness can be trusted even if the witness is a jailhouse informant.  The
facts raised preliminary doubts as to the credibility of the informants but not
cogent reasons to overrule the trial judge’s implicit finding that they were
sufficiently trustworthy not to mandate a caution.  An informant’s prior
psychiatric history has no relevance and does not make the informant of
unsavoury character.  The informants’ testimonies were supported by other
evidence and no evidence was adduced that either had lied or acquired their
information elsewhere.  The verdict did not turn on their testimonies because
other evidence sustained the conviction.  Defence counsel neither requested a
warning nor objected to the absence of a warning.  Counsel’s opinion is
relevant where there may be tactical reasons for not requesting a warning.  The
trial judge directed the jury on credibility.  The Court of Appeal had
insufficient reason to interfere.   A Vetrovec warning was not required.

 

Per Binnie J.: The trial judge erred in law in
failing to give a Vetrovec warning but the appeal should nevertheless be
allowed because there is no reasonable possibility on the particular facts of
this case that the verdict would have been different if the warning had been
given.








The trigger for a Vetrovec warning is the
extent to which underlying sources of potential unreliability are present.  The
testimony of the informants here exhibited some of the worst characteristics of
purveyors of jailhouse confessions.  It is not sufficient for the trial judge
to conclude that in his view these particular informants were reasonably
capable of belief.  The trial judge must provide the proper framework within which
the jury can determine for itself the issue of credibility.  The testimony of
these jailhouse informants was important to the Crown’s case and justified an
inference of untrustworthiness.  This was sufficient to require a Vetrovec
warning.  The trial judge erred in law in the exercise of his discretion in
deciding otherwise.

 

The accused was not entitled to a trial that excluded
the evidence of the informants, only to having the testimony accompanied by a
warning.  Other direct evidence untainted by the error of law implicated the
accused, including his other inculpatory statements, evidence of sexual assault
and evidence of a prior pattern of violence.  The jury accepted circumstantial
evidence of sexual assault by the accused contemporaneously with the murder
that was in no way dependent upon the informants’ testimony.  A Vetrovec
warning would have been accompanied by a review of corroborative evidence
unhelpful to the accused.  In the circumstances, the verdict should be upheld
under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

 

Per Iacobucci, Major
and Arbour JJ. (dissenting):  The trial judge ought to have given a Vetrovec
warning.  The charge was not adequate and it cannot be said that the verdict
would necessarily have been the same.

 








A Vetrovec warning is a matter of a trial
judge’s discretion and is not required in all cases of unsavoury witnesses. 
Trial judges should consider all factors but should focus on a witness’s
credibility and the importance of his or her testimony to the Crown’s case.  A
failure to give a required caution is an error of law and the prejudice
occasioned by the error can be assessed under s. 686 (l)(b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code .   The credibility of the informants was inherently
suspect and their testimonies of sufficient importance to require a Vetrovec
warning.  The jury charge, however, did not contain the essential values of
a Vetrovec warning.  It did not focus the jury’s attention specifically
on the inherent unreliability of these informants.  Defence counsel’s summation
to the jury was not a substitute.  The absence of a request from defence
counsel for a caution is not determinative.  There is a serious question of whether
a sexual assault occurred.  The conviction for first degree murder cannot be
sustained if there was no sexual assault.  Other evidence had the potential to
raise a reasonable doubt.  It is difficult to preclude a different result.

1                                  
Bastarache J. – I
have read the reasons of my colleague Justice Major.  I agree with him that
failure to give a Vetrovec warning when required amounts to an error of
law (Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811).  I am, however, of the
view that this appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored, there
being no error of law on the part of the trial judge in failing to provide a
“clear and sharp” Vetrovec warning in the circumstances of this case. 
Rather, it is my opinion that the decision not to give a Vetrovec
warning was within the discretion of the trial judge and that the exercise of
this discretion should not have been interfered with on appeal.  I have reached
this conclusion for the reasons I set out below.

 

2                                  
In Vetrovec, Dickson J. (as he then was) held that a trial judge
has the discretion, and not the duty, to give a clear and sharp warning to the
jury with respect to the testimony of certain “unsavoury” witnesses.  Dickson
J. followed what he referred to as the “common sense” approach, moving away from
“blind and empty formalism” and “ritualistic incantations” (at p. 823):

 

Rather than attempting to pigeon‑hole a witness into a category
and then recite a ritualistic incantation, the trial judge might better
direct his mind to the facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all the
factors which might impair the worth of a particular witness.  If, in his
judgment, the credit of the witness is such that the jury should be cautioned,
then he may instruct accordingly.  If, on the other hand, he
believes the witness to be trustworthy, then, regardless of whether the witness
is technically an “accomplice” no warning is necessary.  [Emphasis added.]

 








3                                  
Therefore, this Court in Vetrovec deliberately chose not to
formulate a fixed and invariable rule where “clear and sharp” warnings would be
required as a matter of course regarding the testimony of certain categories of
witnesses.  Rather, where a witness occupies a central position in the
determination of guilt and, yet, may be suspect because of a disreputable or
untrustworthy character, a clear and sharp warning may be appropriate to alert
the jury to the risks of adopting the evidence “without more”.  It is therefore
within the trial judge’s discretion to give a Vetrovec caution.  This
discretionary approach was confirmed by this Court in R. v. Potvin,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, at p. 557, wherein Wilson J. states:

 

Vetrovec, in my view, represents a rejection of formalistic and a
priori categories concerning the trustworthiness of evidence both with
regard to warnings and corroboration.  In every case it is for the trial
judge on the basis of his or her appreciation of all the circumstances and, may
I add, on the basis of the application of sound common sense, to decide whether
a warning is required.  [Emphasis added.]

 








4                                  
In exercising his or her discretion to warn the jury regarding
certain evidence, the trial judge may consider, inter alia, the
credibility of the witness and the importance of the evidence to the Crown’s
case.  These factors affect whether the Vetrovec warning is required. 
In other words, the greater the concern over the credibility of the witness and
the more important the evidence, the more likely the Vetrovec caution
will be mandatory.  Where the evidence of so called “unsavoury witnesses”
represents the whole of the evidence against the accused, a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
warning may be warranted.  Where, however, there is strong evidence to support
the conviction in the absence of the potentially “unsavoury” evidence, and less
reason to doubt the witness’s credibility, the Vetrovec warning would
not be required, and a lesser instruction would be justified.  The trial judge’s instruction with respect to the evidence of
jailhouse informants must therefore be commensurate with the particular
circumstances of the case.  For example, the trial judge is not required to
give a “clear and sharp” warning on the dangers of convicting on the impugned
evidence where, in the circumstances, the trial judge believes that there is no
such danger.  Similarly, the trial judge may properly decline to give a warning
if the warning may prejudice the accused’s case rather than assist it. 
Provided there is a foundation for the trial judge’s exercise of discretion,
appellate courts should not interfere.  Here that foundation is established
having regard to the credibility of the witnesses, the importance of their
evidence and the failure to request a warning.

 

Credibility of the Witnesses

 

5                                  
In assessing the credibility of a witness to determine whether to give a
Vetrovec warning, trial judges must avoid pigeon-holing witnesses into
particular categories such as “jailhouse informants”.  Rather, the trial judge
should “direct his mind to the facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all
the factors which might impair the worth of a particular witness” (Vetrovec,
at p. 823).  If the trial judge believes the witness can be trusted, then,
regardless of whether he or she is an accomplice or a jailhouse informant, no Vetrovec
warning is necessary.

 

6                                  
Appellate courts should show great deference to the findings of
credibility made at trial and the importance of taking into consideration the
special position of the trier of fact in judging credibility and of having the
advantage, denied to the appellate court, of directly observing the testimonies
of the witnesses (R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 131).

 








7                                  
Clearly each of King and Balogh falls within the definition of a
“jailhouse informant” as an “inmate, usually awaiting trial or sentencing, who
claims to have heard another prisoner make an admission about his case”; see C.
Sherrin, “Jailhouse Informants, Part I:  Problems with their Use” (1998), 40 C.L.Q.
106, at p. 107.  There is no doubt that the criminal records of King and
Balogh, and King’s admissions that he sought to avoid incarceration in exchange
for his testimony and that he had previously testified in exchange for a deal
to avoid incarceration, raise preliminary doubts as to their credibility.  I
believe, however, that such doubts alone do not mandate a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
warning in this case.

 

8                                  
In assessing the credibility of King and Balogh, the majority of the
Court of Appeal took into consideration their lengthy criminal records, their
motivation to lie and Balogh’s psychiatric history.  On that basis alone, the
Court of Appeal concluded that there were cogent reasons to suspect their
credibility and hence overruled the trial judge’s implicit finding that the witnesses
were sufficiently trustworthy not to mandate the giving of a Vetrovec caution.

 

9                                  
The Court of Appeal held that Balogh’s credibility was suspect based on
his long psychiatric history and his motivation to lie.  With respect, a
witness’s prior psychiatric history has no relevance to the giving of a Vetrovec
warning.  While a witness’s psychiatric profile may be a factor to consider in
assessing the credibility of the witness, it does not make the witness a person
of “unsavoury character”.  The trial judge highlighted Balogh’s psychiatric
history in his charge to the jury and it was for the jury to judge Balogh’s
credibility in this respect.  No special Vetrovec warning is required
each time a witness who has attempted suicide in the past, spent time in a
psychiatric institution, or consumed drugs testifies.  If there were
contradictions in Balogh’s testimony or between his testimony and other facts
in evidence, perhaps there would be a basis to doubt his credibility.  The
record demonstrates, to the contrary, that Balogh’s testimony was consistent,
accurate and supported by other evidence.

 








10                              
Moreover, no facts were adduced by defence counsel to demonstrate that
Balogh had been motivated to lie or that he had sought some benefit for his
testimony and no contradictions were brought out by defence counsel on
cross-examination.  In fact, no evidence was adduced by defence counsel that
either King or Balogh had lied or that they had acquired this information
elsewhere.  On the contrary, ample evidence was adduced which confirmed the
accounts of King and Balogh, as described by the appellant, at p. 36 of its
factum:

 

There was a richness of detail concerning the
circumstances of the event as opposed to a simple allegation or a bald admission
by the accused.  King and Balogh’s evidence contained details as to the
location of the injuries, the prior hitting of Samantha by the Respondent, the
detail that the mother had also hit the child on occasion to discipline her,
that Samantha was always crying and that she was crying on the night she died
and that she choked.

 

Many of the facts in the accused’s admissions to
King and Balogh were confirmed by independent evidence.  The fact that the
baby’s mother’s name was Norma, that she was the Respondent’s girlfriend, that
they lived in the apartment building near the Centre, and that the mother was
going to testify against the Respondent were all accurate.  The evidence
that the Respondent told King and Balogh that he had struck . . .
Samantha repeatedly in the head was consistent with the medical and forensic
evidence as to the location of the injuries.  The fact that Samantha choked was
confirmed by the vomit on . . . her face.  The fact that the
[Respondent] would hit Samantha when she cried was confirmed by the evidence of
witnesses at the trial.  The fact that Samantha was crying on the night she was
killed was confirmed by the mother.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The fact that
King had sought to avoid incarceration by testifying, while certainly a factor
which may undermine credibility, is not in itself sufficient to mandate
a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec caution.  An appellate court should show
greater deference to the trial judge rather than to impose its view after the
fact based on an abstract category of witness without having heard the
testimonies directly.

 

The
Importance of the Impugned Evidence

 








11                              
In R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, Major J. described the
untrustworthy evidence as “crucial to the Crown’s case” (p.
615).  In Vetrovec, Dickson J. spoke of the need for helpful
direction of the jury where “guilt or innocence might, and probably will turn
on the acceptance or rejection, belief or disbelief, of the evidence of one or
more witnesses” (pp. 831-32).  The trial judge must
therefore examine the importance of the impugned evidence.  Indeed, as M.
Rosenberg (now Rosenberg J.A.) states in “Developments in the Law of Evidence: 
The 1992-93 Term” (1994), 5 S.C.L.R. (2d) 421, at p. 463:

 

. . . the trial judge must assess the importance of the
witness to the Crown’s case.  If the witness plays a relatively minor role in
the proof of guilt it is probably unnecessary to burden the jury with a special
caution and then review the confirmatory evidence.  However, the more important
the witness the greater the duty on the judge to give the caution.  At some
point, as where the witness plays a central role in the proof of guilt, the
warning is mandatory.

 

12                              
In the circumstances of this case, guilt or innocence did not
turn on the acceptance of the evidence of King and Balogh. 
Rather, upon reviewing the record, it is my opinion that there was sufficient
evidence which would sustain the conviction even if the jury had completely
rejected the evidence of King and Balogh.

 

13                              
The jury was properly instructed by the trial judge on the elements that
had to be proved to find the respondent guilty of first degree murder.  A
competent jury convicted the respondent, concluding that he had caused the
death of Samantha Johnings while committing a sexual assault against her.  The
evidence of King and Balogh made no reference to sexual assault.  The jury had
sufficient evidence to convict based solely on the forensic evidence, the
mother’s testimony and the inconsistency in the respondent’s statements.  The
physical and forensic evidence in this case, namely the track pants, the
genital injuries and the semen in Samantha’s anus and vagina coupled with the
fact that the respondent was the sole male present and that he had earlier
bathed Samantha, is conclusive.

 








14                              
It cannot be ignored that the whole of the evidence implicating the
respondent in this case, absent the evidence of King and Balogh, is far more
compelling than the evidence against the accused in Vetrovec and Bevan
absent the impugned evidence in those cases.  The evidence of King and Balogh
may have been important but it was not determinative, and, where the evidence
of a witness merely provides further support for a jury’s finding, appellate
courts should more likely find that the decision to give a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
warning is within the trial judge’s discretion.

 

Failure to
Request a Warning

 

15                              
A further problem with making the “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
warning mandatory is that it may have the unintended effect of causing greater
prejudice to the accused either by calling attention to the impugned evidence
or to evidence corroborating the impugned evidence.

 

16                              
While this Court has established in Bevan that the trial judge
need not necessarily point to corroborating evidence each time a Vetrovec
warning is given, it is usually a corollary of the Vetrovec warning that
the trial judge refer to evidence supporting the impugned evidence of the
“unsavoury” witness.  Therefore, if the trial judge had given a “clear and
sharp” Vetrovec warning in this case, it would have been open to him to
highlight for the jury the ample evidence which confirmed the evidence of King
and Balogh.  In requesting a Vetrovec warning, defence counsel therefore
risks bolstering the credibility of the “unsavoury” witness by highlighting the
inculpatory evidence against the accused.  In this regard, Vetrovec
warnings may, in certain circumstances, be counter-productive by actually
strengthening the case against the accused.

 








17                              
Defence counsel in this case neither requested a Vetrovec warning
nor objected when one was not provided.  This may well have been the result of
a tactical decision on the part of defence counsel to avoid the risk of causing
greater prejudice to the accused.  Defence counsel chose to concentrate on
attacking the Crown’s circumstantial and physical evidence in this case rather
than to draw attention to the evidence of King and Balogh.  Indeed, defence
counsel, in his address at trial, referred to the evidence of King as “comic
relief”, stating that King and Balogh had concocted stories that “didn’t make
sense” and that nothing further needed to be said about them.  It is at least
implicit from the defence’s references to the evidence of King and Balogh that
the defence felt that there was no striking need for a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
caution, that the evidence of King and Balogh was insignificant, and that the
jury was fully capable of assessing the credibility of these witnesses on its
own.  Had defence counsel requested a Vetrovec warning, however, the
evidence of King and Balogh would have been singled out for the jury’s
attention and possibly emphasized by the trial judge.

 

18                              
The cases of R. v. Cain (1996), 90 O.A.C. 156 (C.A.), and R.
v. Glasgow (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 57 (Ont. C.A.), support the position
that, absent a request for a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec warning, the
trial judge should only be required to give a warning where the circumstances
of the case clearly demand one.  While it is true that counsel’s opinion with
respect to the Vetrovec warning is not determinative, it is nevertheless
relevant and worthy of greater consideration where circumstances point to the
fact that there may be tactical reasons for not requesting a warning.  In
Glasgow, at pp. 60-61, Doherty J.A. addressed the effect of a failure on
the part of counsel to request a Vetrovec warning as follows:

 








The trial judge alerted the jury to the importance of the assessment of
the credibility of these two witnesses and spent some time detailing the manner
in which that assessment should be made.  He was not asked to give,
and did not give a “Vetrovec” warning.  It is well established
that a trial judge has a discretion as to whether to give a “Vetrovec”
warning.  An appellate court must show deference when reviewing the
exercise of that discretion.  If a trial judge was not asked to
give the warning, it is difficult to understand how the trial judge can be said
to have erred in the exercise of her or his discretion.

 

A full “Vetrovec” instruction, even as
modified in R. v. Bevan . . ., can benefit both the Crown and the
defence.  Where counsel for the accused is satisfied that issues
pertaining to a witness’s credibility have been fully and fairly put to the
jury without resort to a “Vetrovec” instruction, I would hold that the
failure to give the “Vetrovec” warning resulted in reversible error only
if satisfied that the instruction was essential to a fair trial.  In other
words, I would place the onus on the appellant to show that the circumstances
at trial so compelled a “Vetrovec” warning that the trial judge
effectively had no discretion and was compelled to give the “Vetrovec”
warning.  As I am not satisfied that this was such a case, I would
not give effect to this ground of appeal.  [Emphasis added.]

 

19                              
In my view, the defence had a clear tactical advantage in not requesting
a Vetrovec warning in this case.  To hold that the Vetrovec
warning is mandatory in such circumstances would deny future counsel this
tactical decision.  As professed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Gravino, [1995] O.J. No. 3109 (QL), at para. 10:

 

The fact that very experienced and competent counsel at trial
. . . neither asked for a Vetrovec caution nor objected when
one was not given must be taken to reflect the atmosphere at the trial that
Ireland’s evidence had been subjected to very careful scrutiny.  In these
circumstances we are unable to conclude that it was an error on the part of the
trial judge to decline to give a Vetrovec caution.

 

20                              
In the present case, the trial judge exercised his discretion not to
give a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec warning.  Rather, in instructing the
jury, the trial judge focussed on the credibility of King and Balogh, their
criminal records, and King’s motivation to lie.  In essence, the trial judge
directed the jury on credibility, at the very beginning of his instruction,
specifically focussing on the criminal records of King and Balogh:

 








We have also had in this trial witnesses who have a
criminal record.  You will recall the testimony of Mr. Balogh and Mr. King. 
Both of these witnesses admitted that they had a record and once again you may
take their record into account when considering the credibility and weight of
their evidence.  It is for you to decide what significance, if any, you will
attach to their records when you size them up as witnesses.

 

Credibility and weight of the evidence are entirely
for you.  If you have a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the evidence or
the weight to be given to such evidence, you must give the benefit of that
doubt to the accused and not to the Crown.  This is an important part of a
criminal trial and I repeat this for you.  Credibility and weight of evidence
are entirely for you, the Jury.

 

 

21                              
Later, in his charge to the jury, while reviewing the individual
evidence of each of the witnesses, the trial judge once again referred to King
and Balogh’s criminal records.  He then proceeded to highlight Balogh’s
psychiatric troubles.  The trial judge also referred to King’s motivation to
lie, emphasizing the fact that King “tried to get a lighter sentence”, and that
King had admitted that “he was a rat”.  In the circumstances of this case, the
exercise of the discretion not to give a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
warning but to direct the jury on credibility as was done was in conformity
with the spirit of Vetrovec.

 

22                              
For the above reasons, I am of the opinion that the majority of the
Court of Appeal had insufficient reason to interfere with the trial judge’s
exercise of his discretion to instruct the jury as he did.  Although there may
have been some reason to doubt the credibility of King and Balogh at the
outset, based on their criminal records as well as King’s motivation to lie,
these factors were highlighted by the trial judge in instructing the jury and,
in isolation, do not automatically require a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
warning.  It is my view that the role of the evidence of King and Balogh in
relation to the totality of evidence adduced by the Crown in this case
justified the trial judge’s discretion not to provide a Vetrovec
caution.

 








23                              
Considering that the impugned evidence was not essential to the
determination of guilt or innocence, and that there were insufficient reasons
to doubt the credibility of King and Balogh, a Vetrovec warning was not
required in the circumstances.  The Court of Appeal, therefore, erred in
reversing the decision of the trial judge to instruct the jury as he did.

 

Conclusion

 

24                              
To find that the trial judge’s failure to provide a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec
warning in the circumstances of this case amounts to an error of law runs counter to the spirit of Vetrovec, which affirmed a
judicial discretion to provide warnings only in appropriate circumstances. 
Provided there is a foundation for the judge’s exercise of discretion,
appellate courts should not interfere.  Here that foundation existed.

 

25                              
For these reasons, I am unable to conclude that the failure of
the trial judge to give a “clear and sharp” Vetrovec warning amounted to an error of law.  I
would allow the appeal accordingly and restore the conviction entered by the
trial judge.

 

The reasons of Iacobucci, Major and Arbour JJ. were
delivered by

 

26                              
Major J. (dissenting) --
Stephen David Balogh and Albert Edward King were jailhouse informants and men
of unsavoury character.  The trial judge permitted their evidence to go to the
jury without the caution of a Vetrovec warning.

 








27                              
The respondent, Frederick Alexander Brooks, was convicted of first
degree murder in the death of Samantha Johnings.  He was sentenced to life
imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years.  The Ontario Court of
Appeal, by a majority, ordered a new trial.

 

28                              
This appeal as of right was on a point of law raised in the dissent;
that is, whether a clear, sharp warning in accordance with Vetrovec v. The
Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, ought to have been included in the trial
judge’s charge to the jury on the evidence of the two disreputable Crown
witnesses.

 

29                              
In the absence of a Vetrovec warning, was the charge to the jury
sufficient to overcome that failure?

 

30                              
If the answer is no, then in the circumstances should the curative provision
of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
be engaged and if so, would the verdict have necessarily been the same.

 

31                              
In my opinion, the trial judge ought to have given a Vetrovec
warning.  In its absence the charge was not the equivalent nor was it
adequate.  In the result it cannot be said that the verdict would necessarily
have been the same and accordingly the appeal should be dismissed.

 

I.   Facts

 








32                              
Around 10:30 p.m. on December 13, 1992, 19‑month‑old
Samantha Johnings stirred in her sleep when her aunt checked on her before
leaving the apartment.  The next day at 11:00  a.m., Samantha’s mother Norma
Jean Johnings found her dead in her crib.  She had been murdered.  Rigor mortis
was setting in.  There was blood and vomit on her face.  Her left eye was
swollen shut and she had three bruises on her head caused by blunt force
trauma.  The body was wrapped in a green comforter.  Her mother attempted in
vain to revive her.  She then called 911.

 

33                              
Only two persons had access to Samantha on the night of her murder -‑
her mother and the respondent. The respondent had been living in the apartment
with Norma Jean since the previous October.  He was not the father of Samantha,
nor of her newborn brother, Anthony.

 

34                              
At autopsy, it was noted that Samantha’s genital area had a
well-demarcated area of bruising and redness, which was inconsistent with a
diaper rash but consistent with a rubbing action, or the use of a blunt
object.  Trace amounts of semen were found on vaginal and anal swabs taken from
her body.  The cause of death was acute brain injury.  The head injuries could
have but did not necessarily precede the injuries to the vagina and anus.  A
healing lesion of one centimetre in diameter was also noted on the right
buttock.

 

35                              
DNA testing of the sperm proved inconclusive, likely due to
contamination of the sample.  No one could be included or excluded as the
source.

 

36                              
The respondent’s grey track pants were found in the apartment and seized
on January 27, 1993.  Those pants contained blood stains of the same blood type
as Samantha’s.  An expert witness for the Crown testified that the blood’s DNA
signature matched Samantha’s and that the frequency of that profile in
Caucasians is one in 80 million.  The track pants had semen on them, as well as
a juice substance, similar to what was found in Samantha’s bottle. The
respondent was charged with murder.

 








37                              
At the respondent’s trial, Norma Jean testified that in the early
morning of December 14, her newborn, Anthony, had developed gas and began to
cry continuously. She repeatedly walked up and down the apartment’s hallway
with Anthony in an unsuccessful effort to soothe him.  At 2:00 a.m. she saw the
respondent in Samantha’s room, wrapping her in a green comforter.  She did not
check on Samantha at that time.  She testified that by the time she went to bed
at  4:00 a.m. the respondent had changed from his grey sweat pants into black
sweat pants.  On the way to the hospital the next morning, the respondent whispered
to her three times that he was sorry.

 

38                              
The respondent testified at the trial and denied the charge.  He denied 
checking on Samantha at 2:00 a.m. or wrapping her in the comforter.  On
cross-examination he stated that although he had told the police that he had
wrapped Samantha in a comforter at around 2:00 a.m., this had been a “slip
up”.  Instead, he testified that that comforter had been on Norma Jean’s bed
and he believed that she had put it on Samantha.

 

39                              
The respondent also testified that on December 14, the morning that
Samantha’s death was discovered, he had been wearing the grey track pants, and
that the blood must have gotten onto them while he was attempting to revive
her.  He said the police had permitted him to change into a pair of black sweat
pants before being taken to the police station.  Constable Bennett contradicted
this evidence and said the respondent never asked to change his sweat pants and
that he was taken to the police station in the same sweat pants he was wearing
when the police arrived.

 








40                              
Other witnesses testified that the respondent’s relationship with
Samantha had been characterized by violence.  Testimony from Samantha’s
grandfather, Robert Johnings, and 10-year-old Hayley Arkell, indicated that
about one month prior to the murder, the respondent had thrown Samantha
approximately one meter into the wooden frame of a couch.

 

41                              
Four relatives confirmed that the injury to Samantha’s right buttock had
appeared on December 5, 1992, a day on which the respondent had exclusive care
of Samantha while Norma Jean was giving birth to Anthony.  The respondent had
suggested that the injury occurred when Samantha fell on a small funnel bath
toy. A pathologist’s expert opinion was that the injury was inconsistent with a
funnel but consistent with a cigarette burn.

 

42                              
Much of the testimony of the Crown’s forensic experts focussed on the
sperm found in Samantha’s body.  Six sperm were noted on a vaginal swab and
approximately five on an anal swab.  The amounts were insufficient for any
conventional groupings.  The Crown’s pathologist Dr. Rao testified that
although the sperm count in male ejaculate usually runs in the millions, the
child had been brought into the emergency ward with a soiled diaper and the
swabs were taken only after the faeces had been removed.  As well, the fact
that there was no penetration, only  surface contact, could account for the
sparse yield of sperm.

 








43                              
The defence suggested that the sperm may have been several days old,
and, therefore, deposited at a time before the respondent’s access to
Samantha.  A forensic biologist for the Crown acknowledged that studies had
shown that semen can survive up to five or six days in an adult female’s
vaginal sample and two to three days in an anal sample, but she was not aware
of any comparable studies for infants.  However, Norma Jean testified that she
had bathed Samantha between 10:00 and 11:00  p.m. on December 12 and again the
next morning.  The respondent testified that when he changed Samantha’s diaper
on December 12, he did not notice any marks around her vaginal area.  The
respondent was the only male with access to Samantha during the day of December
13 and overnight.

 

44                              
The defence also postulated that the sperm may have been deposited upon
Samantha from a semen stain, such as the one found on the green comforter. 
Doctor  Rao discounted this theory as improbable.  In her opinion, while semen
can sometimes be detected on the skin surface of a child placed in contact with
a fresh and wet semen stain, it is unlikely that semen would pass to the
child’s vaginal orifice from simple contact with a stain.  The defence claimed
that the sperm may have been deposited internally as the result of self‑exploration
of her vagina by Samantha.  Doctor Rao’s opinion was that a 19-month-old child
was too young for that activity.

 

45                              
Doctor  Newall, the Crown's DNA expert, initially excluded the
respondent as the source of the sperm found on Samantha, but later concluded
that as the sample had been contaminated it was impossible for her to conclude
anything about the possible origin of the sperm in the sample.  She could
neither include nor exclude the respondent as the source.

 

46                              
There was evidence from some of Samantha’s relatives that Norma Jean had
been seen striking Samantha on numerous occasions.  Samantha’s and Anthony’s
natural father testified that Norma Jean had on other occasions lost her temper
and  thrown punches at men.

 








47                              
Samantha’s family doctor, Dr. Ambis, testified that Norma Jean lacked
experience as a parent and exhibited immaturity.  He had suggested that she get
parent counselling, but she had angrily refused.  It was generally agreed,
however, that Norma Jean loved her daughter and that Samantha was developing
normally and without any significant health problems.

 

48                              
The evidence at the centre of this appeal, as earlier noted, was led by
the Crown from the two jailhouse informants, Balogh and King.  Each testified
that while incarcerated in the Segregation Unit of the Hamilton‑Wentworth
Detention Centre, the respondent had admitted to them that he had killed
Samantha to stop her crying.  In addition, King said that shortly before the
trial he had been left alone in a holding cell with the respondent and that the
respondent had then recited King’s mother’s street address and threatened to
have her house burned down if King testified.  The informants’ testimony did
not include any suggestion that the killing was committed during the commission
of a sexual assault.

 

49                              
Both Balogh and King were of unsavoury and infamous character.  Both had
lengthy criminal records of dishonesty.  King had informed the police that in
coming forward he was seeking a lighter sentence for his most recent
conviction, although that did not happen.

 

50                              
In addition, Balogh had a history of substance abuse and an alarming
psychiatric history highlighted by three suicide attempts, paranoia, deep
depression and a belief in clairvoyant ability.  As well, both witnesses had
histories of offering to testify against other accuseds.  One of Balogh’s past
accusations had been the result of a paranoid delusion.

 








51                              
In closing argument, defence counsel emphasized Norma Jean’s
shortcomings as a mother, in particular that she had struck Samantha on several
occasions, all in an effort to raise the possibility that she was the killer
and not the respondent.

 

52                              
Defence counsel invited the jury to reject the testimony of Balogh and
King in its entirety.  Expressions such as “comic relief”, and “incapable of
belief” were used in the jury address.  He told the jury that King was a “con
artist”, and a “witness for hire”, one who would “seize the opportunity to look
out for number one” and who would concoct a story in the hope of reducing his
sentence, oblivious to the harm caused to others.  He suggested that King had
used details that he was aware of to concoct a story that simply did not make
sense.  Defence counsel referred to Balogh as a “very sad individual” who
obviously had “some problems with himself” and who was a “willing foil” for
King.  He suggested that Balogh’s story made no sense and that nothing further
needed to be said about Balogh and King.

 

53                              
The Crown’s position was that the respondent’s guilt was the only
reasonable conclusion arising from the evidence.  Although Norma Jean was not
a  perfect mother, it was pointed out to the jury that she could not have been
the source of the sperm found in Samantha’s vagina and anus.

 

54                              
The Crown told the jury that the respondent was the only adult male with
access to Samantha during the period that the unidentifiable sperm was
deposited and the injuries to the vagina and anus were incurred.

 








55                              
Crown counsel referred to Balogh and King as criminals with long
criminal records.  He referred to the fact that King had previously been a
Crown witness and testified in an earlier murder trial.  The Crown acknowledged
that King had attempted to make a deal to avoid going to a federal
penitentiary, and that even if he did not get that deal, the police had
testified at his parole hearing to confirm that King’s criminal history did not
include violence.  The Crown referred to Balogh’s criminal record, but noted
that he did not seek or get a deal.

 

56                              
The trial judge did not provide the “clear and sharp warning” directed
by Vetrovec,  that it would be dangerous to convict the respondent based
on the evidence of Balogh and King unless corroborated by independent evidence.
Nor did the trial judge refer to evidence capable of supporting their stories.

 

57                              
Neither counsel requested a specific Vetrovec warning in the
charge to the jury and neither counsel objected to its omission.

 

II.  Judgments
in the Court of Appeal for Ontario

 

58                              
The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred in
the  exercise of his discretion by failing to give a Vetrovec warning. 
They concluded that both the Crown’s case and the trial judge’s charge were
insufficient to justify the application of the curative provision of s. 686 (l)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .  The appeal was allowed and a new trial
ordered: (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 661.

 

59                              
Weiler J.A. dissented.  In her view a Vetrovec warning was not
required since Balogh’s and King’s testimony was relatively unimportant to the
Crown’s case. In addition, the details of the testimony in the context of the
case were sufficiently reliable to overcome the difficulties presented by their
unsavoury character.  She concluded that the trial judge’s charge sufficiently
alerted the jury to the frailties of their evidence.

 

III.  Points
in Issue








 

60                              
As noted the following issues arise:

 

1.                                
Was there a need for the trial judge to provide a Vetrovec
warning to the jury?

 

2.                                
If so, was that warning or its equivalent given?

 

3.                If the answer to question two is
no, can s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  be applied?

 

4.                                
If the answer to question three is yes, ought s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
be applied to cure the error?

 

IV.  Analysis

 

61                              
The analysis will be in the following order:

 

A.   History of the Vetrovec Rule

 

B.    Is the Failure to Give a Vetrovec
Warning a Potential Error of Law or Miscarriage of Justice?

 

C.   Was There a Need for the Trial Judge to
Provide a Vetrovec Warning to the Jury?

 

D.   Was an Equivalent Warning Given?








E.    Defence Counsel’s Failure to Request a Vetrovec
Warning

 

F.    Should s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  Be Applied to Cure the Error?

 

A.   History
of the Vetrovec Rule

 

62                              
The historical roots of the Vetrovec warning are traceable to the
early common law rule which disqualified the testimony of anyone convicted of a
felony. The rule was reflected in several decisions of the early 1600s,
including that of Coke  C.J. in Brown v. Crashaw (1613), 2 Bulstr. 154,
80 E.R. 1028, where it was held that the evidence of a person formerly
convicted of a felony was to be rejected in all cases.

 

63                              
A policy rationale underlying the rule excluding the evidence of
“persons of infamy” from legal proceedings was to continue the punishment of
the person excluded.  It was also based upon a theory of moral turpitude.  In
1727, Chief Baron Gilbert explained the rationale as follows (cited in J. H.
Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law (2nd  ed. 1923), vol. I, at p.
934):

 

... where a man is convicted of falsehood and other crimes against
common principles of honesty and humanity, his oath is of no weight, because he
hath not the credit of a witness, ... and he is rather to be intended as a man
profligate and abandoned than one under the sentiments and convictions of those
principles that teach probity and veracity.

 

The rigidity
of excluding such evidence resulted almost immediately in exceptions being made
(see R. v. Rudd (1775), 1 Cowp. 331, 98 E.R. 1114).

 








64                              
By the 19th century, while convictions could be based upon such
evidence, judges generally advised juries that it would be dangerous to convict
a prisoner upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated by independent
evidence.  See R. v. Jones (1809), 2 Camp. 131, 170 E.R. 1105, per
Lord Ellenborough, at p. 1106 E.R.:

 

No one can seriously doubt that a conviction is legal, though it
proceed upon the evidence of an accomplice only.  Judges in their discretion
will advise a jury not to believe an accomplice, unless he is confirmed, or
only in as far as he is confirmed; but if he is believed, his testimony is
unquestionably sufficient to establish the facts which he deposes.

 

(See also R.
v. Barnard (1823), 1 Car. & P. 87, 171 E.R. 1113, and R. v. Wilkes  (1836),
7 Car. & P. 272, 173 E.R. 120.)

 

65                              
At the same time, the shortcomings of the aforementioned general
exclusionary rule were recognized.  Criticism of the rule pointed out that the
punishment of the exclusion had not fallen upon the witness disqualified, but
upon all persons who had need of the evidence (J. Bentham, Rationale of
Judicial Evidence (1827), vol. 5, at pp. 87‑88).  It was obvious that
the rule was based not only upon the notion that such witnesses were incapable
of telling the truth, but also upon the presumption that juries were incapable
of recognizing a lie.

 

66                              
The general rule of exclusion was abrogated in England in 1843 by An
Act for improving the Law of Evidence (“Lord Denman’s Act”), 6 &
7 Vict., c. 85, and in Canada in 1893 by The Canada Evidence Act, 1893,
S.C. 1893, c. 31.  The effect was that accomplices became competent witnesses.

 








67                              
The practice of jury warnings persisted beyond the passage of Lord
Denman’s Act.  Although initially a discretionary measure, the practice
eventually evolved into a firm rule of law (see R. v. Tate, [1908] 2
K.B. 680 (C.C.A.), where it was held that the failure on the part of the trial
judge to give the warning would necessitate quashing the conviction).  This was
the Canadian position from R. v. Baskerville, [1916] 2 K.B. 658, until
the 1982 Vetrovec decision of this Court.

 

68                              
The decision of Dickson J. (later C.J.) in Vetrovec varied the
law in several respects.  The Vetrovec case did away with what were seen
as cumbersome and technical definitions of “accomplice” and “corroboration”. 
Rather than attempting to “pigeon­hole” a witness as falling within or without
the definition of an accomplice, it was held that trial judges ought to
consider all of the factors which might impair the credibility of a particular
witness and accordingly decide whether a special instruction was necessary.

 

69                              
Similarly, the trial judge did not have to apply the technical
definition of corroboration.  Instead, the trial judge was required to consider
whether the evidence properly weighed overcame its suspicious roots.  This new
approach, while a change, was not intended to prejudice the accused.  It would
not lessen the protection afforded the accused when faced with unsavoury
witnesses.  Equally, it was intended that the jury could view that evidence
with more ease but not less scepticism than previously required.

 

70                              
In R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, this Court recognized that
the long‑standing technicalities had been removed and that a caution to
the jury was a matter of the trial judge’s discretion and not required in all
cases of unsavoury witnesses.  It was also recognized that there are cases
where a Vetrovec caution is required.  The failure of the court to give
the caution where required is a misdirection.

 

B.                Is the Failure to Give a
Vetrovec Warning a Potential Error of Law or Miscarriage of Justice?








71                              
The appellant submitted that the majority decision in the Court of
Appeal mistakenly assessed the Vetrovec issue as a potential error of
law under s. 686(l)(a)(ii) of the Code rather than a potential
miscarriage of justice under s. 686 (l)(a)(iii).  If the majority’s
approach was correct, the trial judge’s failure to give a Vetrovec
warning constituted an error of law.  The curative provision of s. 686 (l)(b)(iii)
then would have arisen and required the Crown to establish that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same in spite of the error.

 

72                              
On the other hand, if the failure of the trial judge amounted to a
miscarriage of justice under s. 686 (l)(a)(iii), the curative provision
had no application and the remedy would have been to allow the appeal and order
a new trial or enter an acquittal.

 

73                              
The Criminal Code  provisions read:

 

686. (l) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand
trial or not criminally responsible on  account of mental disorder, the court
of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the
opinion that

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(ii)  the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any
ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be
decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

 








74                              
The nature of the trial judge’s decision to provide the jury with a
warning was described by Dickson J. in Vetrovec at p. 831:

 

Because of the infinite range of circumstance which will arise in the
criminal trial process it is not sensible to attempt to compress into a rule, a
formula, or a direction the concept of the need for prudent scrutiny of the
testimony of any witness. What may be appropriate, however, in some
circumstances, is a clear and sharp warning to attract the attention of the
juror to the risks of adopting, without more, the evidence of the witness.

 

75                              
Two post‑Vetrovec decisions of this Court suggested
that the matter was not a question of law, and therefore not subject to review
under s. 686 (l)(a)(ii):  see R. v. Hayes, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 44, and
R. v. Pittman, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 148.  However, in Bevan,
this Court held that the trial judge’s failure to give a Vetrovec warning
was an error of law and that the prejudice occasioned by the error could be
assessed under the curative provision of s. 686 (l)(b)(iii).

 

76                              
This Court was invited by the Crown to adopt the approach suggested in Hayes
and Pittman, that the failure to give the warning is a miscarriage
of justice, rather than that adopted in Bevan that it is an error of
law.  In striving to determine the preferable rule, it bears noting that the Hayes
case, decided in 1989, pre‑dates Bevan.  Moreover, I read the
decision of L'Heureux‑Dubé J. for the majority in Hayes as being
equivocal with respect to this issue (see p. 48).  The post‑Bevan case
of Pittman made a simple assertion that in the circumstances of that
case, the failure to give a Vetrovec warning only raised the possibility
of a miscarriage of justice.  While there may be cases in which the failure to
warn will result in a miscarriage of justice, the usual result of such failure
is an error of law subject to the curative provision.

 








77                              
There was no persuasive submission made to depart from the principles
adopted in Bevan.  Errors and omissions in jury charges have
consistently been treated as errors of law under s. 686 (l)(a)(ii) and
its predecessors:  see Veuillette v. The King (1919), 58 S.C.R. 414;
Manchuk v. The King, [1938] S.C.R. 341; Hebert v. The Queen,
[1955] S.C.R. 120; Brown v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 371;
Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739; Vézeau v. The
Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277; McFall v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
321; Olbey v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008; Young v. The Queen,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 39; R. v. Simpson, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3; R. v.
Romeo, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 86; R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697;
R. v. Livermore, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 123; R. v. G. (R.M.),
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 362; R. v. Hinchey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1128; R. v.
Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314; R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320.

 

78                              
The approach in Bevan is consistent with the application of a Vetrovec
warning to the use of children’s testimony in R. v. Marquard, [1993] 4
S.C.R. 223, children being a group whose evidence historically had required
corroboration.

 

C.   Was
There a Need for the Trial Judge to Provide a Vetrovec Warning to the Jury?

 

(1)   Approach to the Vetrovec Warning

 

79                              
The “common sense” approach to this issue was described by Dickson J. 
in Vetrovec as follows at p. 823:

 








Rather than attempting to pigeon-hole a witness into a category and
then recite a ritualistic incantation, the trial judge might better direct his
mind to the facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all the factors which
might impair the worth of a particular witness.  If, in his judgment, the
credit of the witness is such that the jury should be cautioned, then he may
instruct accordingly.  If, on the other hand, he believes the witness to be 
trustworthy, then regardless of whether the witness is technically an
“accomplice” no warning is necessary.

 

Additional
commentary is found in Bevan (at pp. 614-15):

 

While under Vetrovec a caution to the jury
is a matter of the trial judge’s discretion and is not required in all cases
involving testimony of accomplices or accessories after the fact, there are
some cases in which the circumstances may be such that a Vetrovec
caution must be given.  The trial judge’s discretion whether to give a Vetrovec
warning should generally be given wide latitude by appellate courts.  But in my
respectful view a Vetrovec caution was clearly required in this case
with respect to the testimony of both Dietrich and Belmont.

 

Both of them had lengthy criminal records, had
strong motivations to lie, and approached the police only when each perceived
that some benefit -- such as release from prison, a discontinuation of charges
against them, or cash payments -- could be obtained in exchange for their
testimony.  Both of them explicitly told the police at the time they came
forward that they were seeking a “deal” in exchange for their evidence against
the appellants.  Moreover, the evidence of Belmont and Dietrich was incriminating
to the appellants, and crucial to the Crown’s case.

 

I agree with
the view expressed in “Developments in the Law of Evidence: The 1992-93 Term”
(1994), 5 S.C.L.R. (2d) 421.  The author, M. Rosenberg (now Rosenberg
J.A.), concluded that Vetrovec and Bevan require the trial judge
to focus on two different elements of the case in determining whether or not a
warning is necessary.  At p. 463 he stated:

 








The judge should first in an objective way
determine whether there is a reason to suspect the credibility of the witness
according to the traditional means by which such determinations are made.  This
would include a review of the evidence to determine whether there are factors
which have properly led the courts to be wary of accepting a witness’s evidence. 
Factors might include involvement of criminal activities, a motive to lie by
reason of connection to the crime or to the authorities, unexplained delay in
coming forward with the story, providing different accounts on other occasions,
lies told under oath, and similar considerations.  It is not then whether the
trial judge personally finds the witness trustworthy but whether there are
factors which experience teaches that the witness’s story be approached with
caution.  Second, the trial judge must assess the importance of the witness to
the Crown’s case. If the witness plays a relatively minor role in the proof of
guilt it is probably unnecessary to burden the jury with a special caution and
then review the confirmatory evidence.  However, the more important the witness
the greater the duty on the judge to give the caution.  At some point, as where
the witness plays a central role in the proof of guilt, the warning is
mandatory.  This, in my view, flows from the duty imposed on the trial judge in
criminal cases to review the evidence and relate the evidence to the issues.

 

80                              
In summary, two main factors are relevant when deciding whether a Vetrovec
warning is necessary:  the witness’s credibility, and the importance of the
witness’s testimony to the Crown’s case.  No specific threshold need be met on
either factor before a warning becomes necessary.  Instead, where the witness
is absolutely essential to the Crown’s case, more moderate credibility problems
will warrant a warning.  Where the witness has overwhelming credibility
problems, a warning may be necessary even if the Crown’s case is a strong one
without the witness’s evidence.  In short, the factors should not be looked to
independently of one another but in combination.

 

(2)  Recommendations of the Kaufman Report

 

81                              
Since the decisions of this Court in Vetrovec and Bevan,
the extreme dangers of relying on the use of “jailhouse informers” as witnesses
in criminal prosecutions has been highlighted in the Report of The
Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin (the “Kaufman Report”)
released in 1998 where the Honourable Fred Kaufman, C.M., Q.C., stated at p.
602:

 

In-custody informers are almost invariably
motivated by self-interest. They often have little or no respect for the truth
or their testimonial oath or affirmation.  Accordingly, they may lie or tell
the truth, depending only upon where their perceived self-interest lies. 
In-custody confessions are often easy to allege and difficult, if not
impossible, to disprove.

 








and at p. 638:

 

The evidence at this Inquiry demonstrates the
inherent unreliability of in-custody informer testimony, its contribution to
miscarriages of justice and the substantial risk that the dangers may not be
fully appreciated by the jury.  In my view, the present law has developed to
the point that a cautionary instruction is virtually mandated in cases where
the in-custody informer’s testimony is contested:  see R. v. Simmons,
[[1998] O.J. No. 152 (QL) (C.A.)]; R. v. Bevan, [(1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d)
310].

 

Since the
release of the Kaufman Report, the Ministry of the Attorney General of
Ontario has revised its internal policies to reflect many of the Report’s
recommendations.  New policies include the establishment of an “In-Custody
Informer Committee”, the function of which is to review the use of all
in-custody informers in criminal trials to determine whether their use as a witness
is in the public interest. 

 

82                              
The Ministry has also adopted into its Policy Manual the Kaufman
Report’s recommended list of factors to be considered in assessing an
informer’s reliability or lack thereof.  The factors also serve as a useful
guide to a trial judge when determining whether a Vetrovec warning is
necessary.  The list is at pp. 607-9 and may be paraphrased as follows:

 

1.    The extent to which the statement is
confirmed by independent evidence;

 

2.    The specificity of the alleged statement. For
example, a claim that the accused said “I killed A.B.” is easy to make but
extremely difficult for any accused to disprove;

 








3.    The extent to which the statement contains
details and leads to the discovery of evidence known only to the perpetrator;

 

4.    The degree of access that the in-custody
informer has to sources of outside information (e.g. media reports, preliminary
inquiry transcripts, etc.);

 

5.    The informer’s general character, which may
be evidenced by his or her criminal record or other disreputable conduct;

 

6.    Any request the informer has made for
special benefits and any promises that may have been made;

 

7.    Whether the informer has in the past given
reliable information to the authorities;

 

8.    Whether the informer has previously claimed
to have received statements while in custody;

 

9.    Whether the informer has previously
testified in any court proceeding and the accuracy or reliability of that
evidence, if known;

 

10.  Whether the informer made some written or
other record of the words allegedly spoken by the accused and, if so, whether
the record was made contemporaneously with the alleged statement of the
accused;

 








11.  The circumstances under which the informer’s
report of the alleged statement was taken (i.e., how soon after it was made and
to more than one officer, etc.);

 

12.  The manner in which the report was taken by
the police;

 

13.  Any other known evidence that may attest or
diminish the credibility of the informer, including the presence or absence of
any relationship between the accused and the informer;

 

14.  Any relevant information contained in any
registry of informers.

 

Another useful
factor not expressly referred to in the Kaufman Report, but added
to the list in the Attorney General for Ontario’s Policy Manual is the
following:

 

15.  Any medical or psychiatric reports concerning
the in-custody informer where relevant....

 

83                              
The trial judge in this case did not have the benefit of this report. 
However, with its availability trial judges should consider such factors as
these in determining whether or not a Vetrovec warning is necessary in
the circumstances of a particular trial.

 

(3)   Application to the Facts of This Case

 

(a)  Credibility of the Witnesses

 








84                              
A careful consideration of the factors relevant to the first stage of
the Vetrovec inquiry makes it obvious that the credibility of Balogh and
King was inherently suspect.  While the trial judge has a wide discretion in
determining whether a warning should be given, such discretion must be
reasonably exercised.  In my view, the risks associated with the use of
jailhouse informers, coupled with the character of the witnesses and the
conditions to be considered in the Kaufman Report, should have on a
reasonable exercise of discretion lead the trial judge to give a Vetrovec
warning.  

 

85                              
It is worth reviewing again and in greater detail the personality and
character of the jailhouse informers, in this appeal, who were cellmates at the
relevant time.  Balogh was 32 at the time of trial yet had 25 criminal
convictions.  These included convictions for break, enter and theft, 
possession of property obtained by crime, theft over $200, mischief to private
property, being unlawfully at large, dangerous driving, taking an automobile
without the owner’s consent, breach of probation, failing to appear at court,
failing to comply with recognizances, and possession of a substance contrary to
the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1.

 

86                              
King, for his part, admitted that he was a career burglar.  Although he
was only 24 at the time of trial, his record already included 18 convictions
for break, enter and theft.

 








87                              
Balogh and King had both offered to testify against other accuseds on
earlier occasions.  Although Balogh had never, in fact, been called to testify,
he had come forward with information three times.  On one of these occasions,
he had alleged that a police sergeant and an inmate had conspired to fabricate
a case against an accused, an allegation later proved to have been the product
of his paranoia.  Two years prior to the respondent’s trial, King had testified
against a former schoolmate named McCullough and had secured a lighter sentence
in exchange.

 

88                              
King admitted that he came forward to testify against the respondent for
the same reason that he had come forward to testify against McCullough. 
Specifically, he had to receive a sentence of no more than two years less a day
in order to avoid being incarcerated in a federal institution.  Although King
in fact received a sentence of three years, he was promised special protection
during his term of incarceration.  As well, two police officers agreed to
appear on his behalf at a parole hearing.

 

89                              
Turning to Balogh, he had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals since
he was 15.  He had attempted suicide on at least three occasions.  In 1989,
concerns had arisen with respect to his competency to stand trial, based on his
hearing voices and experiencing paranoia and severe depression.  Balogh
believed that he had had several clairvoyant experiences and premonitions over
the years.  He had been prescribed medication to treat his depression, but his
drugs of choice were LSD, marijuana and alcohol.

 

(b)  Importance of the Witnesses’ Evidence

 

90                              
Balogh’s and King’s testimonies were important but not crucial to the
Crown’s case against the respondent.  They were incriminating and relevant.  In
Bevan, the evidence was determinative and therefore found to be
crucial.  Here the evidence of Balogh and King did not reach that level.  It
incriminated the accused in an assault leading to an unlawful death but did not
implicate the accused in the sexual assault, a fact necessary for the first
degree murder conviction.

 








91                              
Although the Crown had mounted an independent circumstantial case
against the accused, the evidence of the jailhouse informant was of sufficient
importance that a Vetrovec warning should have been given.  The jury was
entitled to be alerted to its frailties if they were to hear that evidence.

 

(4)   Conclusion on the Need for a Vetrovec
Warning

 

92                              
A trial judge’s discretion, if properly exercised, ought not to be
lightly interfered with on appeal.  In my opinion, the trial judge in this case
failed to evaluate the evidence of Balogh and King in light of the
considerations set out above.  Had he done so, he would have concluded that it
was necessary to approach their evidence with extreme caution and the proper
warning would have followed.  A Vetrovec warning was required on the
facts of this case.

 

 D.   Was
an Equivalent Warning Given?

 

93                              
It was submitted that the trial judge’s jury charge contained the
essential values of a Vetrovec warning.  If taken in its entirety, it
was argued the charge amounted to the equivalent of that warning.  I disagree. 
Vetrovec refers to “a clear and sharp warning to attract the attention
of the juror to the risks of adopting, without more, the evidence of the
witness” (p. 831).  A review of the jury charge in its entirety does not
disclose a clear, sharp warning.

 








94                              
What then is a clear, sharp warning?  It is obvious there is no
particular language or formula.  At a minimum, a proper Vetrovec warning
must focus the jury’s attention specifically on the inherently unreliable
evidence.  It should refer to the characteristics of the witness that bring the
credibility of his or her evidence into serious question.  It should plainly
emphasize the dangers inherent in convicting an accused on the basis of such
evidence unless confirmed by independent evidence.

 

95                              
The warning does not come without risk to the accused as it should also
be accompanied by a reference to the evidence capable of providing independent
confirmation of the unsavoury witness’s testimony.  The independent
confirmation relates to other evidence that would support the credibility of
the unsavoury witness.  It does not mean reference to any other evidence
supporting the Crown’s case.  It is not apparent what other evidence the trial
judge could have referred to that would have bolstered the evidence of Balogh
and King.

 

96                              
The Kaufman Report at pp. 638-39 recommends that a trial judge
ought to caution the jury in terms even stronger than those traditionally
contained in a Vetrovec warning.  Specifically, the Report recommends
that the warning ought to emphasize that jailhouse informers are almost
invariably motivated by self-interest and that historically, such evidence has
been shown to be untruthful and has produced miscarriages of justice in the
form of unjust convictions.  It further recommended that the warning should be
given not only during the charge to the jury but immediately before or after
the evidence is tendered by the Crown.

 

97                              
Our law does not go as far as the Kaufman recommendation.  The
added measures suggested by the Report are not presently necessary to ensure a
fair trial.  A proper Vetrovec warning suffices.  Nonetheless, the trial
judge in a particular case may find the extra caution helpful in identifying
unreliable evidence from unsavoury witnesses. 

 








98                              
            In this case, although the trial judge did point to problems
with the evidence of Balogh and King, this was done in the course of a lengthy,
seriatim review of the evidence, and in his general discussion on credibility. 
The problems with Balogh’s and King’s evidence were not singled out for special
attention, instead, the trial judge merely summarized and repeated the problems
with their testimonies elicited on direct and cross-examination.  The fact that
defence counsel challenged their evidence in summation to the jury is not a
substitute for the trial judge’s instruction.

 

E.   Defence
Counsel’s Failure to Request a Vetrovec Warning

 

99                              
The absence of a request from defence counsel is not determinative of
the issue of whether or not a Vetrovec warning must, as a matter of law,
be included in a trial judge’s charge to the jury.  It is the trial judge who
is ultimately responsible for the determination of this issue.  However, it has
often been recognized that once non‑direction or misdirection has
occurred, the absence of a request from counsel to correct it is a factor to be
considered in evaluating the prejudice that has been occasioned.

 

100                          
In this case, defence counsel did not request that a Vetrovec warning
be included in the charge.  The Vetrovec warning, while usually helpful,
carries the risk of having the opposite effect.  This is so since following the
warning the trial judge should point to independent evidence, if any, that
supports the impugned evidence.  In those cases where such evidence is
available the attention drawn to it may carry a risk greater than the gain
obtained from the warning.  For that reason, it may be that the defence chose
not to request a warning for tactical reasons.  On the other hand, it is
possible that no request was made by defence counsel due to oversight or
inadvertence.  In either event, I find the prejudice occasioned by the absence
of a Vetrovec warning to be substantial.








 

101                          
In deciding whether to include a Vetrovec warning, the absence of
a specific request from defence counsel for a Vetrovec warning does not
vitiate the trial judge’s responsibility.  However, the trial judge would
undoubtedly be assisted by seeking submissions of counsel for both the Crown
and the defence in the absence of the jury as to whether that warning should be
given.

 

F.  Should
s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  Be Applied to Cure the Error?

 

102                          
The argument was made that if the evidence was important enough to
require a Vetrovec warning then it must follow that in the absence of
that evidence it cannot be said that the verdict would necessarily have been
the same.  The argument is not sound.  It seems apparent that cases could occur
in which the evidence precluded by the absence of the Vetrovec warning
while important by definition, is not crucial.  In those cases the other
evidence on its own will sustain the conviction.

 

103                          
It will have to be determined in each particular case what, in the
absence of a Vetrovec warning, the effect of excluding the unsavoury
evidence was.  In most cases, it seems likely that the precluded evidence will
not permit use of the curative proviso, s. 686(1)(b)(iii).  However, it
seems equally clear that there will be instances when the precluded evidence
would not raise the possibility of a different result.

 

104                          
Bevan described the nature of the test to be met by the Crown
under s. 686 (l)(b)(iii) in the following terms at pp. 616‑17:

 








The question to be asked in determining whether
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice as a result of a
trial judge’s error is whether “the verdict would necessarily have been the
same if such error had not occurred”:  see Colpitts v. The Queen, [
1965] S.C.R. 739, per Cartwright J. (as he then was), at p. 744; Wildman
v. The Queen,  [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 328‑29.  This test has
also been expressed in terms of whether there is any possibility that if the
error had not been committed, a judge or properly instructed jury would have
acquitted the accused:  see Colpitts, per Spence J., at p. 756; R.
v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, per Sopinka J., at p. 919;
R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at p. 620; R. v. B. (F.F.),
[1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, per Iacobucci J. at pp. 736‑37.  I do not
interpret these two approaches as being intended to convey different meanings. 
Under either approach, the task of an appellate court is to determine whether
there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different
had the error at issue not been made.

 

105                          
In my opinion the failure of the trial judge to give a Vetrovec
warning was a misdirection of law.  The question is then whether in light of
all the evidence the test in Bevan is met.  Would the result have
necessarily been the same? 

 

106                          
The relevant evidence at the trial was that Balogh and King related
statements made to them by the accused that he had struck the baby on the head,
that the baby had started choking and had then stopped moving.  There was no
mention of a sexual assault.  The following review of the evidence as it was
presented, in my opinion, raises some doubt as to whether a sexual assault
occurred at all at the time in question.

 

107                          
There was evidence that the accused was the only male person alone with
Samantha on the night of her death and that sperm was found on her body.  The
impact of that evidence was lessened by the Crown expert’s inability to
determine the age and source of the sperm.  The result of this uncertainty was
to destroy the Crown’s theory of exclusive opportunity.

 








108                          
There was evidence of intense sexual activity in the apartment during
the weeks preceding the death, and that the housekeeping conditions were poor. 
Sperm was found on a toy in the crib, on the neckline of Samantha’s pyjama top,
on the crib sheets and in two places on the green comforter in which the child
had been wrapped.  At least one of these samples was identified as not being
from the accused but from the child’s natural father.

 

109                          
The largest sperm stains were found on the green comforter.  The semen
mixture matched DNA from the respondent and from Norma Jean.  However,
testimony indicated that sexual relations between them occurred at a rate of
approximately 25 times per week and usually on the bed where the green
comforter was kept.  This confirms that there were many opportunities apart
from the night of the murder when the accused’s sperm could have been deposited
on the bed and the green comforter.

 

110                          
While the pathologist, Dr. Rao, thought it unlikely that the sperm
removed from Samantha could have originated from this stain, that possibility
was not ruled out by her evidence.  Given the presence of semen throughout the
apartment, it was  possible for trace amounts, which is all that was present,
to have found their way into Samantha’s vagina and anus.  While the semen was
on the interior of these orifices, it was near the entrance, was not consistent
with penile penetration, and could have been deposited in an innocent fashion. 
For example, while wiping Samantha clean in the course of changing her diaper,
or drying her after a bath, either Norma Jean or the respondent could have
transferred semen traces from their hands to Samantha.  Therefore even this
potentially most damning of the Crown’s evidence was open to question.

 

111                          
It could not be established that the sperm found in Samantha’s body was
deposited on the night of her death.  The Crown’s expert testified that sperm
samples from an adult can survive in a vaginal sample for five to six days and
in a rectal sample for two to three days, but she was not familiar with any
comparable studies involving infants.








 

112                          
In light of the foregoing there is a serious question as previously
commented on whether a sexual assault occurred that evening or early morning. 
If there was no sexual assault then the conviction for first degree murder
cannot be sustained even accepting the evidence of the unsavoury witnesses.

 

113                          
In the several days preceding her death, Samantha had had contact with
other male adults.  Her grandfather had seen her on December 11.  The jury
heard evidence that he had sexually abused his own daughter, Norma Jean, when
she was a child.  In addition, Charles Furry, the common law spouse of
Samantha’s grandmother, babysat Samantha alone on December 12 from 6:00 p.m. to
10:00 p.m.

 

114                          
There was evidence to indicate that grey track pants worn by the accused
on the night of the murder contained stains of Samantha’s blood and of a fruit
juice similar to that in her feeding bottle.  If the accused was wearing the
grey pants at the time of the assault that would account for the blood and
fruit juice stains.  There was evidence that he had changed from his grey track
pants to his black pants prior to trying to revive Samantha.  If that had
occurred and he was wearing his black pants when trying to revive Samantha then
the blood and juice on his grey pants was not deposited at the time of the
attempted revival.  Both Norma Jean and the police gave evidence consistent
with the accused changing his pants prior to the time stated by him.

 

115                          
That evidence raised serious suspicions pointing to the accused. 
However, in the conflicting circumstances of the testimony at the trial, that
evidence alone and as presented would not by itself necessarily result in the
same jury verdict.   There was evidence that the accused said he was sorry and
repeated this more than once on the way to the hospital.  But there is no
evidence of what he was sorry about.








 

116                          
The Crown’s case turned in part on the theory that the accused was the
only male person with the opportunity to murder Samantha but as pointed out
earlier, the evidence on the identification of the sperm was inconclusive.  The
question, therefore,  should be whether the accused was the only person
regardless of sex with the opportunity to commit this crime.

 

117                          
The answer is no.  The mother had as much opportunity to commit the
crime as did the respondent.  This is significant when considered in light of
the evidence previously noted that the mother, Norma Jean, had problems with
her temper.  Several witnesses testified that they had witnessed her strike
Samantha’s face on numerous occasions.  The apartment was a place of violence
with evidence of physical abuse being committed by the mother and the accused
as well as visitors such as Samantha’s grandfather who had some history of
abuse.

 

118                          
As well, there existed several inconsistencies in Norma Jean’s testimony
which were noted by defence counsel.  First, Norma Jean testified that on the
morning after the murder, she was awoken at 11:00 a.m. by her mother’s knocking
at the door.  However, an assistant at the office of the Johnings’ doctor
testified that Norma Jean had called the office at 10:25 a.m. to check on an
appointment for Anthony.  Norma Jean denies ever making this call.  Moreover,
Norma Jean’s mother testified that when Norma Jean answered the door that
morning, a bottle was already warming in the microwave, contradicting Norma
Jean’s testimony that she had not been awake prior to her mother’s arrival.  It
is inconsistencies like these out of which reasonable doubt is formed.

 








119                          
Another question raised by the evidence is how Norma Jean did not hear
Samantha being assaulted and murdered.  The autopsy revealed multiple wounds to
the head caused by blunt force trauma.  It seems unlikely that this could have
been done silently.  Moreover, Norma Jean testified that she saw the respondent
wrapping Samantha in a green comforter around 2:00 a.m.  If the respondent is
the culprit, the sexual assault, if there was one, and murder most likely
occurred prior to this.  However, Norma Jean, according to her own testimony,
had been walking up and down the hallway for the last hour and a half, trying
to soothe Anthony, who had been crying.  Would she not have heard the
respondent doing anything untoward to Samantha?  Moreover, even after 2:00
a.m., Norma Jean testified that she was asleep on the couch with Anthony, and
that she was a light sleeper.  If this were so, one would expect her to hear
any violence committed by the respondent during this time period.

 

120                          
A third area of inconsistencies surrounding Norma Jean’s testimony is
that she claimed to have found Samantha in her crib, and then rushed her to the
bathroom while attempting to revive her.  Substantial amounts of blood and
vomit were found spattered around the bathtub.  Moreover, while it had dried by
the time the police arrived, the blood and vomit had clearly been relatively
fluid at one point, as photographs show that the blood and vomit had flowed
towards the drain.  If the blood and vomit had been in a liquid state when
Samantha was found, why was none of it found between the crib and the bathtub? 
Would it not have been likely to spill or splatter somewhat while Norma Jean
was rushing Samantha into the bathroom? 

 








121                          
Moreover, there was evidence from other witnesses which indicated that
Norma Jean’s difficulties in dealing with her children had intensified over the
several days preceding Samantha’s death.  For example, the respondent’s mother
testified that at 2:00 a.m., while on the phone with the respondent (who was
seeking advice on how to soothe Anthony), she overheard Norma Jean yell, “I
can’t handle this anymore!”    As well, Norma Jean’s father Robert Johnings
testified that Norma Jean was having difficulty dealing with Samantha’s
jealousy towards her new brother. Samantha had struck her baby brother on more
than one occasion and Norma Jean had responded by slapping Samantha.  On the
night of Samantha’s death, Norma Jean had telephoned Robert Johnings and asked
if he would take Samantha for the evening because she could not handle both
children. 

 

122                          
The mother’s character, family difficulties, the various inconsistencies
in her story and the history of physical abuse by people occupying or visiting
the apartment had the potential to raise a reasonable doubt in the jury’s mind
as to the respondent’s guilt.

 

123                          
The purpose of this review has been to consider the question raised in Bevan: 
Is there any reasonable possibility that the verdict would not have necessarily
been the same?  There was evidence that implicated the accused but with a
proper instruction regarding the testimony of the jailhouse informants it is
difficult for me to preclude the possibility of a different result.

 

V.  Conclusion

 

124                          
I agree with the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal and
confirm the order for a new trial.

 

125                          
In cases where a new trial is ordered an appellate court avoids to the
extent possible comment on the evidence.  For that reason the evidence here was
reviewed only to the extent necessary to reach a conclusion on the result that
should follow from the misdirection and not to prejudge or suggest a different
result should be reached.

 








126                          
It is understood that at the new trial there may be new evidence, the
same evidence as is or presented differently and nothing said in these reasons
on the evidence in this appeal should affect the new trial.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

127                          
Binnie J. -- I agree with the result reached by Justice Bastarache, but
I reach that conclusion by a different route.  In my view, the evidence of the
“jailhouse informants” in this case was tainted by a combination of some of the
more notorious badges of testimonial unreliability, including the opportunity
to lie for personal benefit, and the jury ought to have been given a clear and
sharp warning to that effect.  The trial judge erred in law in failing to give
such a warning, as found by Justice Major and a majority of the Ontario Court
of Appeal.  At the same time, I differ, with respect, from the conclusion that
this error of law requires a new trial.  Given the other evidence against the
respondent that was necessarily accepted by the jury in reaching their verdict
of first degree murder, I think, with great respect to those of the opposite
view, that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been
different had the error of law not been made.

 








128                          
The courts have grappled for some years with a growing concern that a
conviction based on the evidence of jailhouse informants has led in the past to
some wrongful convictions and should be treated with special caution: R. v.
Frumusa (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 211 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Simmons
(1998), 105 O.A.C. 360 (C.A.); Report of The Commission on Proceedings
Involving Guy Paul Morin, the Honourable Fred Kaufman, C.M., Q.C., 1998; C.
Sherrin, “Jailhouse Informants, Part I: Problems with their Use” (1998), 40 C.L.Q.
106, and “Jailhouse Informants in the Canadian Criminal Justice System, Part
II: Options for Reform” (1998), 40 C.L.Q. 157; the Report of the
1989-1990 Los Angeles Grand Jury:  Investigation of the Involvement of Jail
House Informants in the Criminal Justice System in Los Angeles County (June
26, 1990).  The most extensive review of this issue in Canada is the Kaufman
Report, which concludes at p. 638:

 

The evidence at this Inquiry demonstrates the inherent
unreliability of in-custody informer testimony, its contribution to
miscarriages of justice and the substantial risk that the dangers may not be
fully appreciated by the jury.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 








129                          
This Court’s decision in Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R.
811, does not stand in the way of taking appropriate action to address that
targeted concern.  Vetrovec did not deal with jailhouse informants as
such, but more generally with the law of corroboration in relation to
accomplices.  The trial judge in that case had given a very specific warning
about the danger of convicting on the basis of uncorroborated evidence from
accomplices, and the issue on the appeal was the correctness of the trial
judge’s subsequent reference to pieces of evidence that in his view were
capable of having a corroborative effect.  In that context, Dickson J.
protested against “a fixed and invariable rule regarding all accomplices” and
“blind and empty formalism” (p. 823).  The Court was unanimous in affirming
that in this area as in others a label is no substitute for analysis.  That
having been said, “jailhouse informant” is a term that conveniently captures a
number of factors that are highly relevant to the need for caution.  These
include the facts that the jailhouse informant is already in the power of the
state, is looking to better his or her situation in a jailhouse environment
where bargaining power is otherwise hard to come by, and will often have a
history of criminality.  This is not to deny the possibility that a jailhouse
can on occasion produce a trustworthy witness.  The trigger for caution is not
so much the label “jailhouse informant” as it is the extent to which these
underlying sources of potential unreliability are present in a particular
case.  The testimony of Balogh and King exhibited some of the worst
characteristics of purveyors of jailhouse confessions.  Both were career
criminals who had a history of coming forward to offer incriminating testimony
in anticipation of personal reward.  They tried to ingratiate themselves with
the respondent by offering to get “his girlfriend knocked off”.  This was a
confidence trick to gain his trust and loosen his tongue.  In the
circumstances, failure of counsel to request a Vetrovec warning is a
relevant consideration in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion, but
does not save a charge that, as a matter of law, is inadequate. The jury in
this case should have been warned to proceed with caution.

 

130                          
It is not sufficient, in my view, to say that these particular
witnesses apparently impressed the trial judge as reasonably capable of
belief.  The concern here is with the underlying weaknesses historically
associated with jailhouse confessions offered by fellow inmates.  Vetrovec
affirmed that the court may legitimately concern itself with such factors, and
this affirmation was picked up and developed by M. Rosenberg (now Rosenberg
J.A.) in “Developments in the Law of Evidence:  The 1992-93 Term” (1994), 5 S.C.L.R.
(2d) 421, at p. 463:

 

It is not then whether the trial judge personally finds the witness
trustworthy but whether there are factors which experience teaches that the
witness’s story be approached with caution.

 

 

The jurors
will not likely have the benefit of this “experience” unless it is imparted to
them by the trial judge in the “clear and sharp warning” contemplated by Vetrovec.








While some
passages in Dickson J.’s reasons can be argued to focus on the assessment of
the credibility of a particular witness made by the trial judge, he also emphasized
that the credibility of a particular witness is for the jury not the trial
judge to assess.  The trial judge’s role is to provide the proper framework
within which that credibility can be evaluated, and in that regard problems
historically associated with particular types of evidence should not be
overlooked.  Jailhouse informants presenting a profile such as Balogh and King,
generally do, it seems to me, justify an inference of untrustworthiness, and as
a general rule in such cases a Vetrovec warning should be given.

 

131                          
Major J. has reviewed the weaknesses of their testimony and I agree with
his conclusions that prosecutorial use of jailhouse informants generally calls
for special caution and that the testimony of these particular jailhouse
informants manifested the dangers associated with the genre.  The trial judge
appears not to have taken into account these relevant considerations and he
thus erred in the exercise of his discretion.  It was a sufficient trigger to
the requirement of a Vetrovec warning that their evidence was “important
but not crucial to the Crown’s case against the respondent” (para. 90).  It
will be rare, I think, that an alleged jailhouse confession would not be
regarded as important evidence against an accused.

 

132                          
My colleague Bastarache J. concludes that the trial judge’s instruction
to the jury amply conveyed the dangers associated with the Balogh and King
evidence.  I do not agree.  He did not, as Dickson J. put it in Vetrovec,
supra, at p. 831, clearly “attract the attention of the juror to the risks
of adopting, without more, the evidence of the witness”.  A useful guide in
this regard is the comment of Osborne J.A., dissenting,  when R. v. Bevan
was in the Ontario Court of Appeal (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 333, at pp. 361-62:

 








However, in those cases where a clear sharp warning is required, it
seems to me that it is of fundamental importance that the form of the warning
take into account that its underlying purpose is to direct the jury’s special
attention to the risk of convicting an accused on the basis of the evidence of
a witness who may be viewed, for reasons such as self-interest, as
untrustworthy.  Thus, the witness should be singled out, that is, separated
from the pack.  The jury should be told to scrutinize the evidence for
evidence which would confirm or support the testimony of the witness who is
said to have a motive to lie, or who is of unsavoury character.  . . .  In my
view, it is preferable in most cases that the trial judge tell the jury why the
evidence of a given witness requires special scrutiny, that is, why the light
of the credibility microscope should be turned up.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

133                          
In the course of his instruction in this case, which covers almost 100
pages of transcript, the trial judge gave only one specific caution bearing on
the credibility of Balogh and King, namely that the jury should take their
respective criminal records into account “when considering the credibility and
weight of their evidence”.  Some 70 pages of transcript later, he pointed out
that both Balogh and King were in custody with the accused at the time of the
alleged confession, but this was noted to identify the physical location of the
alleged confession.  Far from being “singled out” for special caution, the
jailhouse evidence was summarized in much the same language as used for other
witnesses.  He noted that Balogh had a history of psychiatric problems,
including a stint at the London Psychiatric Centre, and had twice attempted
suicide, but this, while perhaps relevant to credibility, did not go to the
systemic problems of “unsavouriness” associated with jailhouse confessions. 
The trial judge mentioned that King “tried to get a lighter sentence” from
Detective Hrab, but Hrab was not called to testify, and contemporaneous notes
made by the two jailhouse informants pooling their recollections and apparently
given to Detective Hrab were never produced.  The trial judge reminded the jury
that King had not been successful in securing a benefit.  He noted that
Sergeant Harild (who did testify) and Detective Hrab had both appeared before
the Parole Board to explain that King’s criminal record did not include any
convictions for violence.  

 








134                          
None of this constituted a “clear and sharp warning” to the jury about
the dangers of relying on evidence of jailhouse informants.  On the contrary, I
expect the impression the jury took from the trial judge’s instruction is that
King had been unsuccessful in his plea for special treatment, but he had come
forward with his damaging testimony in spite of his disappointment.  This
would, if anything, add to his credibility in the mind of persons who were
unaware of the problems associated with jailhouse confessions.  Balogh, with
his history of mental illness, seems to have been a tag-along to King’s initiative,
although protesting that his motive was revulsion at the nature of the crime. 
Balogh had attempted to purvey jailhouse confessions on three previous
occasions in other cases.  Despite his choice of crime for a career, his sense
of revulsion at the crimes of others apparently was chronic, if he is to be
believed.

 

135                          
It is now established that the failure to give a Vetrovec warning
where required is an error of law, which opens up the possibility of salvaging
the verdict under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 .  Not every error of law justifies a new trial, as noted by
McIntyre J. in Fanjoy v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233, at p. 240:

 

It is not every error which will result in a miscarriage of justice,
the very existence of the proviso to relieve against errors of law which do not
cause a miscarriage of justice recognizes that fact.

 

 

136                          
While it may often be difficult to analyse a record in terms of what would
have happened if the error had not occurred -- and any reasonable doubt in that
regard must be resolved in favour of an accused --  nevertheless the legitimacy
of a “what if” approach is implicit in the Bevan test (“whether there is
any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different” (R.
v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617 (emphasis added))), and explicit
in cases such as R. v. Haughton, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516, per Sopinka
J., at pp. 516-17:

 








The application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , requires the Court to consider whether a jury
properly instructed could, acting reasonably, have come to a different
conclusion absent the error.  In applying this test the findings of the jury
in the case under appeal may be a factor in determining what the
hypothetical reasonable jury would have done, provided those findings are not
tainted by the error.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

and R. v.
Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, per Iacobucci J., at pp. 620-21:

 

Accordingly, the question here is whether there is
any possibility that the trier of fact would have had a reasonable doubt
as to the guilt of the accused had the impugned evidence been removed from
their consideration.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

137                          
Whether or not a new trial is necessary will largely depend on the
degree of centrality of the evidence of the unsavoury witness to the
conviction.  In most cases, a witness whose testimony is sufficiently important
to require the Vetrovec warning in the first place will likely be
sufficiently central to preclude application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii),
as in R. v. Sanderson (1999), 134 Man. R. (2d) 191 (C.A.), at p. 194
(where the unsavoury witness gave “[t]he only evidence presented by the Crown
which implicated” the accused), and R. v. Siu (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d)
301 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 330 (“the Crown would have had virtually no case” without
the unsavoury witness’s evidence).  In such cases, application of the curative
proviso would clearly be wrong.

 

138                          
I part company from Major J. on whether in this case there is any
reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had a Vetrovec
warning been given.  It must be kept in mind that the respondent was not
entitled to a trial that excluded altogether the evidence of Balogh and King. 
The issue under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) is whether there is any
reasonable possibility that it would have made any difference to the ultimate
verdict if their evidence had been accompanied by a warning instead of
merely being heaped with ridicule by defence counsel, as was the case here.  

 








139                          
In reaching their verdict of first degree murder, the jury necessarily
accepted the evidence of sexual assault contemporaneously with the murder,
which was an added feature that did not depend at all on the story told by the
jailhouse informants.  In addition, the respondent made inculpatory statements
to other people, including the victim’s mother.  All of this evidence was
consistent with, and was not tainted by, the testimony of Balogh and
King.  I thus conclude that the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) is
justified on six grounds.  

 

1.  Other Inculpatory Statements Made by the Respondent

 

140                          
The victim’s mother testified that the respondent had whispered to her
more than once in the ambulance on the way to the hospital with the dead child
that he was sorry “for what he had done” (emphasis added).  This was
vigorously challenged in cross-examination, but the witness remained adamant:

 

Q.   And you said that Mr. Brooks said “I’m sorry,
I’m sorry for what I’ve done”?

 

A.   Yes sir.

 

Q.   Now that’s not at all what Mr. Brooks said,
was it?

 

A.   That’s exactly what Mr. Brooks said.

 

Q.   He said “I’m sorry”?

 

A.   No, sorry, he said he was sorry, he was sorry
for what he had done.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Q.   I take it that you were terribly concerned
about the death of your daughter?

 

A.   Yes sir.

 

Q.   And somebody has just said to you, “I’m sorry
for what I’ve done” and you said “Thanks”?

 








A.   No, I did not say thanks.

 

Q.   Or you stare straight ahead?

 

A.   I don’t know what I was thinking sir, but I
remember I didn’t say nothing.

 

Q.   Miss Johnings, that is a lie?

 

A.   No, it’s not sir.

 

Q.   What Fred said to you, more than once, in a
low voice, sometimes he mouthed it, is just “I’m sorry”?

 

A.   No sir.

 

Q.   That’s all he said is “I’m sorry”?

 

A.   No sir.

 

Q.   And he said that because what would you
expect him to say when he finds out that your daughter’s dead?

 

A.   He said more than that sir.

 

 

The sting of
these statements depended on what interpretation the jury placed on them, but
it is evident from the jury’s verdict that its members believed the mother’s
version of events and disbelieved the respondent’s, and that the reference to
“what he had done” was taken to refer to his treatment of Samantha that had
resulted in her death.

 

2.  Verdict
of Sexual Assault

 








141                          
It was not disputed that the appellant was the only male who had access
to the child on the day that she was murdered.  The jury was instructed that in
order to return a verdict of first degree murder, which the jury did, “you must
be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that in addition to everything required
for second degree murder, the accused caused the death of Samantha Johnings while
committing or attempting to commit the sexual assault” (emphasis added). 
While the DNA results were inconclusive, there is no doubt that male semen was
present in the dead child’s anus and in her vagina.  The uncontradicted
evidence was that Samantha had been bathed on both December 12 and 13, and the
expert evidence was that the bathing combined with the bacterial environment of
a child in diapers would tend to degrade the sperm quickly.  The only persons
(male or female) with access to Samantha between the time she was put to
bed and the time she was discovered dead were the mother and the respondent. 
The mother testified that she saw the respondent in Samantha’s bedroom at 2:00
a.m. on the morning of her death, wrapping the child in a blanket.  The jury
clearly rejected the possibility that the sperm had been picked up from the
blanket, and this rejection was supported by Dr. Rao’s evidence that semen
would be highly unlikely to migrate into the vagina from simple contact of the
child’s outer body with a semen stain deposited on bedding at an earlier time. 
The respondent’s grey track pants revealed deposits of Samantha’s blood and the
respondent’s semen, as well as some residue thought to be Samantha’s fruit
juice.  The evidence of Constable Bennett and the mother tended to confirm that
the respondent was wearing his grey track pants at the time of Samantha’s
murder.  The notion that another male slipped into the child’s bedroom and
committed the sexual assault just before or after the mother committed the
murder has no support in the evidence.

 








142                          
My colleague Major J. draws attention to matters in the record that could
have raised a reasonable doubt in the jurors’ minds regarding the sexual
assault, but it is clear that at the actual trial they did not do so.  The
point here is that in order to find the respondent guilty of first degree
murder the jury not only had to entirely reject the respondent’s evidence but
had to accept the circumstantial evidence of sexual assault by the respondent
that did not depend on the jailhouse confession supplied by Balogh and King.  I
cannot believe that a jury that was prepared to conclude that the respondent
was guilty of sex with the 19-month-old girl at the time of her murder would
have reached a different conclusion because of a warning to treat with caution
the evidence of Balogh and King of non-sexual physical violence on the
night in question.  

 

3.  Respondent’s
Relationship with the Victim

 

143                          
There was already ample evidence from Samantha’s relatives on the issue
of the respondent’s pattern of violence towards Samantha, albeit not in
relation to the night of her murder.  The respondent himself acknowledged that
there were bruise marks close to Samantha’s vaginal area when he bathed her
earlier that day, but he said he did not know where they came from.  The
respondent’s suggestion that the mother, Norma Jean, in a fury murdered her own
child was not consistent with the respondent’s own statement to the police that
the mother did not have a bad temper:

 

Q.   She’s got a bad temper?

 

A.   Norma, ah, no.

 

Q.   No?

 

A.   Nope.

 

Q.   You’ve never seen her blow her cool?

 

A.   No.

 

Q.   How about you, do you blow your cool?

 

A.   Ah, I try to hold it in and that there, cause
I get frustrated a lot, and I’ll just hold it in instead of exploding, cause if
I explode, I get myself into trouble, so I, hold it in.

 

 








Although the
mother was criticized for lack of parenting skills and some inappropriate
discipline of Samantha (who was given to the occasional tantrum and flailing of
arms and legs), all of the witnesses, including the respondent, agreed that she
loved Samantha and that the child was well nourished and thriving.  There was
no evidence of any significant physical injuries inflicted at any time by the
mother.  Her expressed concern to the ambulance attendant that she might have
hurt or even killed her baby was in the context of talking about thumping the
baby’s back in a futile effort to revive the child after she was found comatose
in her crib, i.e., after she was already dead.  The respondent, on the other
hand, was said to have inflicted several injuries on Samantha in their short
period of cohabitation in exasperation because of her crying, including picking
the child up and throwing her about a metre into the wooden base of a couch
with a “heavy thud” a few weeks before the murder.  The jury heard that
Samantha had a crying fit the night of her murder.

 

4.                                
A Vetrovec Warning Would Likely Have Been Accompanied by a
Review of the Corroborative Evidence.

 

144                          
Consideration of the likely impact of the failure to give a Vetrovec
warning must also be qualified by the trial judge’s undoubted discretion to
bring to the jury’s attention other evidence capable of corroborating the
testimony of Balogh and King, specifically their knowledge of some details of
the respondent’s relationship with the mother and Samantha and some details of
the child’s injuries which the jury might think would be unlikely to be known
to Balogh and King unless told to them by the respondent.  As stated, the
respondent was not entitled to a trial free of the evidence of Balogh and
King.  He was entitled only to a Vetrovec warning, which in this case
would have been a mixed blessing, as defence counsel perhaps acknowledged by
his lack of objection to the trial judge’s failure to deliver a Vetrovec
warning.  

 

5.  Lack of
Objection by the Defence

 








145                          
While the Crown correctly concedes that lack of objection does not
foreclose the right of the respondent to a proper instruction by the trial
judge on the issue of jailhouse confessions, such failure usefully indicates
the absence of prejudice in the professional opinion of experienced counsel who
was retained to protect the interests of the accused and who was fully alive to
the atmosphere and dynamics of the trial.  The position taken by defence
counsel in that sense is properly considered as a factor in the application of
the curative provision.

 

6.  An Otherwise
Favourable Jury Instruction

 

146                          
Finally, while the jury charge was insufficient to constitute a proper Vetrovec
warning, it laid out other issues very fairly, many of them in a manner
favourable to the respondent.

 

147                          
For these reasons, I conclude that the failure of the trial judge to
give a Vetrovec warning was an error of law, but that there is no reasonable
possibility the jury would have rendered a different verdict had the proper
warning been given.  The Crown bears a heavy onus in seeking the application of
the curative provision of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) but, for the reasons
given, it is my view that justice does not require a new trial on the
particular facts of this case.  The appeal should therefore be allowed and the
respondent’s conviction and sentence restored.

Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Conditional sentences
-- Aboriginal offenders -- Accused convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to
20 months’ incarceration --  Whether non-custodial sentence reasonable in
circumstances where paramount sentencing objectives are denunciation and deterrence
-- Whether sentencing judge failed to take into account appropriate
considerations in light of accused’s aboriginal status -- Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 718.2 (e), 742.1 .

 

The accused was convicted of sexual assault.  He had
attended a house party at the home of the victim, an 18‑year‑old
aboriginal woman living with friends.  Evidence at trial established that the
victim was assaulted in her own bedroom while she was either asleep or
unconscious from the effects of alcohol.  There was medical evidence of vaginal
abrasions but no evidence of penetration.  At the sentencing hearing, the judge
characterized the accused’s actions as a “major” or “near major” sexual
assault.  In his view, deterrence and denunciation were the paramount sentencing
factors to be considered for this type of offence.  The sentencing judge took
into account that there was no evidence of planning or deliberation, or
gratuitous violence.  He also observed that the accused had two prior
convictions for assault.  Finally, he noted that there was no evidence of
remorse.  The pre-sentence report was generally favourable to the accused and
recommended a conditional sentence.  Given that the accused was an aboriginal,
the sentencing judge observed that he was “obliged to bear in mind”
s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code .  Taking all these factors
into account, the sentencing judge held that “the necessary elements of
deterrence and denunciation would be lacking” if the accused were permitted to
serve a conditional sentence in the community.  He sentenced the accused to 20
months’ incarceration.  The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence.

 








Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 








A purposive interpretation of s. 742.1of the Criminal
Code  requires the sentencing judge to proceed in stages in determining the
appropriateness of a conditional sentence.  At the preliminary stage, the judge
simply has to exclude two possibilities:  (a) probationary measures; and (b) a
penitentiary term.  Pursuant to s. 742.1 (b), the second and most
substantial stage of the analysis involves the determination of whether a
conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and
principles set out in ss. 718  to 718.2 .  If the judge’s preliminary assessment
of a fit sentence excludes both a suspended sentence and a penitentiary
sentence, and the statutory prerequisites in s. 742.1  are fulfilled, then
he or she is required to consider s. 718.2 (e) when deciding the
appropriateness of a conditional sentence.  Under that provision, all available
sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances
should be considered, with particular attention to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders.  Moreover, whenever a judge narrows the choice to a
sentence involving a sentence of incarceration, the judge is obliged to
consider the unique systemic or background circumstances which may have played
a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts.  As
well, the judge must consider the types of practicable procedures and sanctions
which would be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his
or her particular aboriginal heritage.  The application of s. 718.2 (e)
does not mean that a sentence will automatically be reduced, since the
determination of a fit sentence requires a consideration of all the principles
and objectives set out in Part XXIII.  Depending on the severity of the
conditions imposed, a conditional sentence may be reasonable in circumstances where
deterrence and denunciation are paramount considerations.  Ultimately, however,
the determination of the availability of a conditional sentence depends upon
the sentencing judge’s assessment of the specific circumstances of the case,
including a consideration of the aggravating factors, the nature of the
offence, the community context, and the availability of conditions which have
the capacity to properly reflect society’s condemnation.

 

While the objective of restorative justice, by virtue
of s. 718.2(e), applies to all offenders, the requirement to pay
“particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders” recognizes
that most traditional aboriginal conceptions of sentencing hold restorative
justice to be the primary objective.  In addition, s. 718.2(e) has
a particular remedial purpose for aboriginal peoples, as it was intended to
address the serious problem of overincarceration of aboriginal offenders in
Canadian penal institutions.  While s. 718.2(e) requires a
different methodology for assessing a fit sentence for an aboriginal offender,
it does not necessarily mandate a different result.  Section 718.2(e)
does not alter the fundamental duty of the sentencing judge to impose a
sentence that is fit for the offence and the offender.  Furthermore, the
application of s. 718.2(e) does not mean that aboriginal offenders
must always be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight to the
principles of restorative justice and less weight to goals such as deterrence,
denunciation, and separation.  It was accordingly open to the sentencing judge
to give primacy to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in this case
on the basis that the crime involved was a serious one.

 

The sentencing judge made a reasonable determination
as to the availability of a conditional sentence in this case.  He did not
misconstrue the seriousness of the crime, and his use of the words “near major”
or “major” instead of “serious” does not constitute a reversible error.  Since
there was no error in principle, no overemphasis of the appropriate factors,
and no failure to consider a relevant factor, deference should be shown to the
trial judge’s assessment of the particular circumstances of the offence and the
offender.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

Iacobucci J. –

 

I.  Introduction

 

1                                  
This appeal requires us to consider the conditional sentencing
provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , in the
context of aboriginal offenders.  The appellant appeals his 20-month custodial
sentence, seeking to have it converted to a conditional sentence on the basis
that the sentencing judge did not take into account the appropriate
considerations required in s. 718.2(e) of the Code, in light of
the appellant’s aboriginal status.      

 

2                                  
In September 1996, the Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing)
and other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill C-41”), came
into effect, introducing significant amendments to the sentencing regime
outlined in  Part XXIII of the Code.  These amendments included an
expanded articulation of the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing
(ss. 718 to 718.2), a specific provision dealing with aboriginal offenders (s.
718.2(e)), and the introduction of the conditional sentence (s. 742.1 ).

 








3                                  
       In R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, this Court was asked
to determine the proper application of s. 718.2(e).  In so deciding, it
was necessary to place this provision within the context provided by the
purposes and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2, and the
overall scheme of Part XXIII.  The Court determined that the new sentencing
amendments represented “a watershed, marking the first codification and
significant reform of sentencing principles in the history of Canadian criminal
law” (para. 39).

 

4                                  
In noting that Parliament had two primary objectives in enacting this
new legislation: (i) reducing the use of prison as a sanction, and (ii)
expanding the use of restorative justice principles in sentencing, the Court
stated (at para. 48):

 

It can be seen, therefore, that the government
position when Bill C-41 was under consideration was that the new Part XXIII was
to be remedial in nature.  The proposed enactment was directed, in particular,
at reducing the use of prison as a sanction, at expanding the use of
restorative justice principles in sentencing, and at engaging in both of these
objectives with a sensitivity to aboriginal community justice initiatives when
sentencing aboriginal offenders.

 

 

 

5                                  
This appeal was heard along with five companion appeals in which the
Court was called upon to outline the general principles governing the new conditional
sentencing provisions in Part XXIII (s. 742.1): see R. v. Proulx, [2000]
1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5; R. v. L.F.W., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, 2000 SCC 6; R.
v. R.N.S., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149, 2000 SCC 7; R. v. R.A.R., [2000] 1
S.C.R. 163, 2000 SCC 8, and R. v. Bunn, [2000] 1  S.C.R. 183,
2000 SCC 9.  The Court has extensively outlined its interpretation of s. 742.1
in Proulx.  

 

6                                  
Consequently, the decisions in Gladue and Proulx provide
the legal background for understanding the manner in which ss. 742.1 and 718.2(e)
interact on the issues presented in this appeal.  It should be pointed out that
neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal had these decisions available
to them when they considered the new sentencing regime.

 

II.  Background








7                                  
On November 8, 1996, a jury convicted the appellant of committing sexual
assault contrary to s. 271  of the Criminal Code , and on December 19,
1996, he was sentenced to 20 months’ incarceration with a 10-year firearm
prohibition pursuant to s. 100 of the Code.

 

8                                  
Early in the morning of May 15, 1994, the appellant attended a house
party at the home of the victim, an 18-year-old aboriginal woman living with 
friends on the Tsuu T’ina Nation Reserve (also known as the Sarcee Reserve).  
Evidence at trial established that the victim was either asleep or unconscious
from the effects of alcohol and she was assaulted in her own bedroom.  There
was medical evidence of vaginal abrasions but there was no evidence of
penetration.  While the victim has no memory of the assault, she suffered hurt
and humiliation when she learned of the event the next morning.  

 

III.   Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

9                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 

 

718.  The fundamental purpose of sentencing
is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the
law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a)  to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b)   to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

 

(c)  to separate offenders from society, where necessary;

 

(d)  to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

 

(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 








(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

718.1   A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2   A court that imposes a sentence
shall also take into consideration the following principles:

 

(a)  a sentence should be increased or reduced to
account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to
the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,

 

(i)   evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or
hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex,
age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar
factor,

 

(ii)   evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused
the offender’s spouse or child,

 

(iii)  evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a
position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or

 

(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the
direction of or in association with a criminal organization 

 

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

 

(b)  a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on
similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

 

(c)  where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined
sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;

 

(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less
restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and

 

(e)  all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment, and the court

 

(a)  imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,

would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to
718.2,

 








the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour
in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,
subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional

IV.  Judicial History

 

A.  Alberta Court of Queen’s
Bench

 

10         
At the sentencing hearing, McMahon J. characterized the appellant’s
actions as a “major” or “near major sexual assault”.  In his view, deterrence
and denunciation were the paramount sentencing factors to be considered for
this type of offence.  McMahon J. took into account that there was no evidence
of planning or deliberation, or gratuitous violence.  He also observed that the
appellant had two prior convictions for assault.  Finally, he noted that there
was no evidence of remorse.

 








11                     
The pre-sentence report was generally favourable to the appellant and
recommended a conditional sentence.  The appellant had completed a 28-day
treatment program for alcohol abuse at the Poundmaker’s Lodge, an
aboriginal-focussed alcohol treatment centre.  In addition, the appellant was
assessed as posing no threat to the community as long as he abstained from
alcohol use.  Given that the appellant was an aboriginal, McMahon J. observed
that he was “obliged to bear in mind section 718.2(e) of the Code”.

 

12                     
Taking all these factors into account, McMahon J. held that  “the
necessary elements of deterrence and denunciation would be lacking” if the
appellant were permitted to serve a conditional sentence in the community.   As
a result, he sentenced the appellant to 20 months in a provincial correctional
institution.

 

B.  Alberta
Court of Appeal (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 129

 

13                     
 The appellant appealed on the basis that s. 718.2(e) had not
been  properly considered by the sentencing judge. The Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal, upholding the sentence imposed by the trial judge.

 

14                     
At the outset, the Court of Appeal determined that the standard of
appellate review for a trial judge’s imposition of sentence had been set out in
a trilogy of sentencing decisions from this Court: R. v. Shropshire,
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, and R. v.
McDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948.  The court accepted (at p. 135) that
“absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an
overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only
intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably
unfit” (citing M. (C.A.), per Lamer C.J., at para. 90).

 

 








15                     
Fresh evidence of the appellant’s involvement in community alcohol
programs was presented at the Court of Appeal with the consent of the Crown. 
The appellant and Crown had agreed that the Court of Appeal could consider this
new evidence, and treat it as if it had been available at the original
sentencing. 

 

16                     
The evidence included an application, made by the appellant, to the
aboriginal-specific services of the Poundmaker’s Lodge Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Centre for a second treatment session by the appellant.  There were also
submissions from the Tsuu T’ina Nation Spirit Healing Lodge indicating that
they were willing to admit the appellant after the hearing of the Court of
Appeal, and that he could remain in this alcohol treatment program until his
admission to the Poundmaker’s Lodge.  There was also a brochure outlining the
Tsuu T’ina Nation Spirit Healing Lodge program which described the Lodge’s
goals and objectives.  The court took note that the Tsuu T’ina Nation Spirit
Healing Lodge’s brochure indicated that “persons who have a history of
violence, child molestation, sexual offences” were considered “inappropriate
clients” (p. 141).

 

17                     
In holding that the evidence was properly adduced, the court remarked
that this information had assisted the court in considering alternatives to
imprisonment.  However,  the court commented that the evidence was problematic
for the appellant since the nature of the appellant’s crime had apparently
rendered him an inappropriate client for the alcohol treatment centre.

 

18                     
Adopting the approach in R. v. Brady (1998), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 504
(Alta. C.A.),  the court determined that a conditional sentence would rarely be
available where the paramount sentencing concerns are deterrence and
denunciation which pursuant to Brady called for actual imprisonment.   








19                     
The court also held that the application of s. 718.2(e) would not
alter this result  (at p. 142):

 

We reject the suggestion that s. 718.2(e)
would displace the rationale in Brady, and faced as we are here with a
crime worthy of denunciation and deterrence, and the fact that the sentence
must be proportionate to the gravity of the crime, it is clear that s. 718.2(e)
cannot be interpreted to mean that in some fashion an alternative to
imprisonment must be imposed as a sentence for the Appellant. [Emphasis
in original.]

 

20                     
The court stated that the words “reasonable in the circumstances”
contained in s. 718.2(e) required an expansive reading, understanding
them within the context of the objectives and purposes of sentencing outlined
in ss. 718 to 718.2.  From this basis, the term “reasonable” requires that the
sentence be commensurate with these objectives and principles of sentencing. 
Accordingly, the “circumstances” to be considered include the gravity and
nature of the offence, the record of the accused, impact on victims and the
community, the need for denunciation and deterrence, the need to maintain
proportionality, aggravating and mitigating factors, relevant case law, and the
particular circumstances of the accused (at p. 138).

 

21                     
The court’s analysis of s. 718.2(e) continued with his
examination of the words “with particular attention to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders”.  In its view these words required that the sentencing
judge pay attention to all of the sentencing factors noted above, “together
with the additional circumstances particular to aboriginal offenders” (p.
138).  These “additional circumstances” included:  social factors particular to
aboriginal Canadians; recognition of the alternative approaches taken to
sanctions by aboriginal communities; the geographic availability of alternative
sanctions; and community support.

 








22                     
The court held that Parliament could not have intended that victims of
aboriginal offenders, including aboriginal victims, would receive less
protection under the law.  Nor did Parliament intend s. 718.2(e) to be
in any way paramount to the other provisions set out in ss. 718 to 718.2. 
Again, the court emphasized that the sentence must be one which accords with
all of the sentencing principles and objectives set out in ss. 718 to 718.2,
and includes attention to the factors noted above.

 

23                     
Noting that s. 726.1  of the Criminal Code  was permissive rather
than mandatory, the court held that the sentencing judge was not under an
obligation to conduct an inquiry as to the circumstances of the aboriginal
offender.  Rather, the onus rests on the accused to suggest specific
alternative sanctions supported by evidentiary submissions to the court.  The
sentencing judge must take into account that he or she is dealing with an
aboriginal offender and “must address his or her mind to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders” (p. 141).  In order to succeed, the submissions on behalf
of the accused must be reasonable in the circumstances and must be commensurate
with the other sentencing provisions set out in the Criminal Code  as
well as relevant jurisprudence. 

 

24                     
In summary, the court found that the sentencing judge had properly taken
into account the circumstances of the appellant, including the fact that the
appellant was an aboriginal.  In concluding, the court stated (at p. 142):

 

The Trial Judge was faced with a serious sexual
assault on an unconscious victim in her own bedroom, involving an adult
offender with a record.  While it is clear that the Appellant has a
long-standing problem of alcohol abuse, the Appellant evidently made no effort
prior to 1994 to address this problem and all efforts to rehabilitate have been
subsequent to the offence.

 

Given the circumstances which were before the Trial
Judge, it is clear that any sentence that he imposed would have to properly
reflect denunciation, specific and general deterrence, and be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence.








 

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Introduction

 

 

25                           
Section 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code  provides that all
available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the
circumstances should be considered, with particular attention to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders.  As a general matter, this appeal raises
the issue of whether a non-custodial sentence is reasonable, to use the
language of s. 718.2 (e), in circumstances where the paramount sentencing
objectives are denunciation and deterrence.  More specifically, this appeal
must determine whether the trial judge properly applied s. 718.2 (e) when
sentencing the appellant.  

 

26                           
My discussion of these issues will deal with the following points. 
First, as a preliminary matter, it is important to understand how and when a
sentencing judge should consider the particular circumstances of an aboriginal
offender in relation to the determination of the availability of a conditional
sentence pursuant to s. 742.1.   Since s. 718.2(e) requires the
consideration of “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable
in the circumstances” (emphasis added), the second section of my analysis
focuses on the availability of conditional sentences for crimes where, as in
this appeal, the objectives of denunciation or deterrence are paramount. 
Finally, given that a conditional sentence is possible where the sentencing
objectives are denunciation and deterrence, the third section of the analysis
will discuss whether the imposition of a conditional sentence, as opposed to a
sentence of incarceration, was “reasonable in the circumstances” of this case. 
In other words, the issue is whether the sentencing judge properly applied s.
718.2(e) to this appellant.








    

B.  The
Determination of the Availability of a Conditional Sentence, and
Section                 718.2(e)’s Role Therein

 

27                           
Lamer C.J., in Proulx, supra, held that a purposive
interpretation of s. 742.1 required the sentencing judge to proceed in stages
in determining the appropriateness of a conditional sentence.  At the
preliminary stage, the judge simply has to exclude two possibilities: (a)
probationary measures; and (b) a penitentiary term.  The duration and venue of
the sentence are not determined at this preliminary stage.  In addition, the
judge is required to consider the fundamental purpose and principles of
sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 only to the extent necessary to
narrow the range of sentence for the offender.  If, at this point, either a
penitentiary or a suspended sentence is appropriate, then a conditional
sentence should not be imposed (Proulx, at paras. 58-59).

 

28                           
Before moving to the next stage of the analysis, the sentencing judge
must also establish whether the statutory prerequisites set out in s. 742.1
have been satisfied.  These prerequisites include: (i) the absence of a minimum
term of imprisonment; (ii) a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years
(i.e., the elimination of a penitentiary term per step one); and (iii) that the
safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the
sentence in the community.  Two factors must be taken into account in assessing
the danger to a community posed by an offender: (i) the risk of the offender
re-offending; and (ii) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event
of re-offence.  In Proulx, the Chief Justice provided helpful guidance
for this risk assessment at paras. 69-76.

 








29                           
Pursuant to s. 742.1(b), the second and most substantial stage of
the analysis involves the determination of whether a conditional sentence would
be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles set out in ss. 718 to
718.2.  Unlike the more cursory review of the purpose and principles of
sentencing at the preliminary stage, this second stage requires a comprehensive
consideration of these principles and objectives.  It is this comprehensive
consideration which guides the sentencing judge in determining (i) whether the
offender should serve the sentence in the community or in jail, (ii) the
duration of the sentence, and, if a conditional sentence, (iii) the nature of
the conditions to be imposed.  

 

30                           
If the judge’s preliminary assessment of a fit sentence excludes both a
suspended sentence and a penitentiary sentence, and the statutory prerequisites
in s. 742.1 are fulfilled, then he or she is required to consider s. 718.2(e)
when deciding the appropriateness of a conditional sentence.   The judge’s
consideration of s. 718.2(e) at this stage does not displace the need to
take into account all of the other principles and objectives set out in ss. 718
to 718.2.    Moreover, whenever a judge narrows the choice to a sentence
involving a sentence of incarceration, the judge is obliged to consider the
unique systemic or background circumstances which may have played a part in
bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts.   As well, the
judge must consider the types of practicable procedures and sanctions which
would be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or
her particular aboriginal heritage (Gladue, supra, at para. 93). 
As was indicated in Gladue, the application of s. 718.2(e) does
not mean that a sentence will automatically be reduced, since the determination
of a fit sentence requires a consideration of all the principles and objectives
set out in Part XXIII.

 

C.  The
Availability of a Conditional Sentence for Offences Where the
Paramount               Sentencing Objectives Are Denunciation or Deterrence

 

 








31                           
In Proulx, supra, the Court determined that the
conditional sentence of imprisonment, introduced with Bill C-41, represents a
meaningful alternative to incarceration for less serious and non-dangerous
offenders.  As was the case with s. 718.2(e) (see Gladue, supra),
the conditional sentence was enacted in order to further Parliament’s goals of
reducing the use of prison and expanding the use of restorative justice
principles in sentencing.  At paras. 99-100 in Proulx, Lamer C.J.
described how the conditional sentence incorporates traditionally punitive
goals of sentencing while also providing an opportunity to further the goals of
restorative justice:

 

The conditional sentence facilitates the achievement
of both of Parliament’s objectives.  It affords the sentencing judge the
opportunity to craft a sentence with appropriate conditions that can lead to
the rehabilitation of the offender, reparations to the community, and the
promotion of a sense of responsibility in ways that jail cannot.  However, it
is also a punitive sanction.  Indeed, it is the punitive aspect of a
conditional sentence that distinguishes it from probation.  As discussed above,
it was not Parliament’s intention that offenders who would otherwise have gone
to jail for up to  two years less a day now be given probation or some
equivalent thereof.

 

Thus, a conditional sentence can achieve both
punitive and restorative objectives.  To the extent that both punitive and
restorative objectives can be achieved in a given case, a conditional sentence
is likely a better sanction than incarceration.  Where the need for punishment
is particularly pressing, and there is little opportunity to achieve any
restorative objectives, incarceration will likely be the more attractive
sanction.  However, even where restorative objectives cannot be readily
satisfied, a conditional sentence will be preferable to incarceration in cases
where a conditional sentence can achieve the objectives of denunciation and
deterrence as effectively as incarceration.  This follows from the principle of
restraint in s. 718.2(d) and (e), which militates in favour of
alternatives to incarceration where appropriate in the circumstances.

 

32                           
The Chief Justice discussed how the sentencing objectives, outlined in
s. 718(a) to (f), related to this interpretation of the
provision’s dual purpose.  While recognizing that a conditional sentence is
generally better suited to achieve the restorative objectives of
rehabilitation, reparations, and promotion of a sense of responsibility in the
offender, Lamer C.J. indicated that the objectives of deterrence and denunciation
could be well served with a conditional sentence.  Indeed, he noted that
certain conditions can create more onerous circumstances than those associated
with incarceration (at para. 105).








 

33                           
The amount of denunciation and deterrence provided by a conditional
sentence varies depending on the nature of the conditions imposed and the
duration of the sentence.  Since the imposition of any sentence is determined
on an individual basis, each conditional sentence needs to be crafted with
attention to the particular circumstances of the offence, offender, and the
community in which the offence took place (see M. (C.A.), supra, per
Lamer C.J., at para. 92).  Consequently, conditions will vary according to
these factors with it being generally true that “the more serious the offence
and the greater the need for denunciation, the longer and more onerous the
conditional sentence should be” (Proulx, at para. 106).

 

34                           
Nevertheless, Lamer C.J. pointed out that “there may be certain
circumstances in which the need for denunciation [or deterrence] is so pressing
that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society’s
condemnation of the offender’s conduct” (Proulx, at para. 106).   He
further stated (at paras. 114 and 116): 

 

This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might be
achieved by a conditional sentence.  Conversely, a conditional sentence may
provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which 
restorative objectives are of diminished importance, depending on the nature of
the conditions imposed, the duration of the conditional sentence, and the
circumstances of the offender and the community in which the conditional
sentence is to be served.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Sentencing judges will frequently be confronted with
situations in which some objectives militate in favour of a conditional
sentence, whereas others favour incarceration.  In those cases, the trial judge
will be called upon to weigh the various objectives in fashioning a fit
sentence.  As La Forest J. stated in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309,
at p. 329 “[i]n a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of
prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to
the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender”.  There is no
easy test or formula that the judge can apply in weighing these factors.  Much
will depend on the good judgment and wisdom of sentencing judges, whom
Parliament vested with considerable discretion in making these determinations
pursuant to s. 718.3.

 








35                           
Therefore, depending on the severity of the conditions imposed, a
conditional sentence may be reasonable in circumstances where deterrence and
denunciation are paramount considerations.  Ultimately, however, the
determination of the availability of a conditional sentence depends upon the
sentencing judge’s assessment of the specific circumstances of the case,
including a consideration of the aggravating factors, the nature of the offence,
the community context, and the availability of conditions which have the
capacity to properly reflect society’s condemnation.

 

D.              Whether the Imposition of a
Conditional Sentence Is Reasonable in the Circumstances

 

36                           
In  Gladue, supra, the Court concluded that, as a general
principle, s. 718.2(e) indicates that a custodial sentence is the penal
sanction of last resort for all offenders, to be used only where no other
sanction is appropriate.  As to the words “with particular attention to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders”, the Court reasoned that sentencing
judges should pay particular attention to the fact that the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders are unique in comparison with those of non-aboriginal
offenders.  Section 718.2(e) has a remedial purpose for all offenders,
focussing as it does on the concept of restorative justice, a sentencing
approach which seeks to restore the harmony that existed prior to the accused’s
actions.  Again, the appropriateness of the sentence will take into account the
needs of the victims, the offender, and the community as a whole.  

 








37                           
While the objective of restorative justice, by virtue of s. 718.2(e),
applies to all offenders, the requirement to pay “particular attention to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders” recognizes that most traditional
aboriginal conceptions of sentencing hold restorative justice to be the primary
objective.  In addition, s. 718.2(e) has a particular remedial purpose
for aboriginal peoples, as it was intended to address the serious problem of
overincarceration of aboriginal offenders in Canadian penal institutions.  In
singling out aboriginal offenders for distinct sentencing treatment in s.
718.2(e), it is reasonable to assume that Parliament intended to address
this social problem, to the extent that a remedy was possible through
sentencing procedures.

 

38                           
In order to provide guidance to sentencing judges as to the manner in
which the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e) could be given effect, the
reasons in Gladue set out a framework of analysis for the sentencing
judge.  In considering the circumstances of aboriginal offenders, the
sentencing judge must take into account, at the very least, both the unique
systemic or background factors that are mitigating in nature in that they may
have played a part in the aboriginal offender’s conduct, and the types of
sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the
circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal
heritage or connection (Gladue, at para. 66).  In particular, given that
most traditional aboriginal approaches place a primary emphasis on the goal of
restorative justice, the alternative of community-based sanctions must be
explored.

 

39                           
In the search for a fit sentence, therefore, the role of the sentencing
judge is to conduct the sentencing process and impose sanctions taking into
account the perspective of the aboriginal offender’s community.  As was noted
in Gladue, it is often the case that imposing a custodial sentence on an
aboriginal offender does not advance the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e),
neither for the offender nor for his community.  This is particularly true for
less serious or non-violent offences, where the goal of restorative justice
will no doubt be given greater weight than principles of denunciation or
deterrence.

 








40                           
However, the scope of s. 718.2(e), as it applies to all
offenders, restricts the adoption of alternatives to incarceration to those
sanctions that are “reasonable in the circumstances”.  Again, as was expressly
stated in Gladue, the Court in no way intended to suggest that as a
general rule, the greatest weight is to be given to principles of restorative
justice, and less weight accorded to goals such as denunciation and
deterrence.  Indeed, such a general rule would contradict the individual or
case-by-case nature of the sentencing process, which proceeds on the basis of
inquiring whether, given the particular facts of the offence, the offender, the
victim and the community, the sentence is fit in the circumstances.

 

41                           
I should take this opportunity to stress that the guidelines as set out
in Gladue, and reiterated in the present appeal, are not intended to
provide a single test for a sentencing judge to apply in determining a
reasonable sentence in the circumstances.   Section 718.2(e) imposes an
affirmative duty on the sentencing judge to take into account the surrounding
circumstances of the offender, including the nature of the offence, the victims
and the community. 

 

42                           
Notwithstanding what may well be different approaches to sentencing as
between aboriginal and non-aboriginal conceptions of sentencing, it is
reasonable to assume that for some aboriginal offenders, and depending upon the
nature of the offence, the goals of denunciation and deterrence are
fundamentally relevant to the offender’s community.  As held in Gladue,
at para. 79, to the extent that generalizations may be made, the more violent
and serious the offence, the more likely as a practical matter that the appropriate
sentence will not differ as between aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders,
given that in these circumstances, the goals of denunciation and deterrence are
accorded increasing significance.

 








E.  Whether
the Imposition of a Conditional Sentence Is Reasonable in the

     
Circumstances of This Case

 

 

 

(1)  Significance of the Goal of Restorative Justice in Sentencing
Aboriginal                          Offenders Convicted of Serious
Crimes

 

 

43                           
The appellant submits that in according greater weight to the goals of
denunciation and deterrence based on the nature of his offence, the sentencing
judge did not take into account, as required by s. 718.2(e),  the
paramount significance of restorative justice within aboriginal communities. 
The appellant also submits that on the same basis, the Court of Appeal was in
error when it held that it would be unreasonable to conclude that a fit
sentence for a non-aboriginal offender would not also be a fit sentence for an
aboriginal offender.  It is important to note, however, that consistent with
the reasoning in Gladue, supra, the Court of Appeal was referring
to “serious crimes”, rather than offences in general, as follows (at p. 140):

 

For serious crimes, it would not be
reasonable to conclude that a fit sentence for a non-aboriginal person would
not also be fit for an aboriginal person, and this point was made by Esson,
J.A. speaking for the majority in the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision
of R. v. Gladue (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at p. 506, who stated, “To
put it another way, the particular circumstances could not reasonably support a
conclusion that the sentence, if a fit one for a non-aboriginal person, would
not also be fit for an aboriginal person”. [Emphasis added.]

 

 








44                           
Let me emphasize that s. 718.2(e) requires a different methodology
for assessing a fit sentence for an aboriginal offender; it does not mandate,
necessarily,  a different result.  Section 718.2(e) does not
alter the fundamental duty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is
fit for the offence and the offender.  Furthermore, in Gladue, as
mentioned the Court stressed that the application of s. 718.2(e) does
not mean that aboriginal offenders must always be sentenced in a manner which
gives greatest weight to the principles of restorative justice and less weight
to goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation (at para. 78).  As a
result, it will generally be the case, as a practical matter, that
particularly violent and serious offences will result in imprisonment for
aboriginal offenders as often as for non-aboriginal offenders (Gladue,
at para. 33).  Accordingly, I conclude  that it was open to the trial judge to
give primacy to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in this case on
the basis that the crime involved was a serious one.

 

45                           
  Whether a crime is indeed serious in the given circumstances is, in my
opinion, a factual matter that can only be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
I am not suggesting that there are categories of offences which presumptively
exclude the possibility of a non-custodial sentence.  Indeed, Lamer C.J.
specifically rejected such an approach in relation to the conditional
sentencing regime (Proulx, supra, at para. 79).  More generally,
Sopinka J., in McDonnell, supra, at paras. 32-33, rejected a
category-based approach to sentencing for the following reasons:

 

In any event, in my view it can never be an error in
principle in itself to fail to place a particular offence within a judicially
created category of assault for the purposes of sentencing. There are two main
reasons for this conclusion. First, Shropshire and M. (C.A.), two
recent and unanimous decisions of this Court, clearly indicate that deference
should be shown to a lower court's sentencing decision. If an appellate court
could simply create reviewable principles by creating categories of offences,
deference is diminished in a manner that is inconsistent with Shropshire and
M. (C.A.).  In order to circumvent deference and to enable appellate
review of a particular sentence, a court may simply create a category of
offence and a ""starting point"" for that offence, and treat as an
error in principle any deviation in sentencing from the category so created. .
. .   If the categories are defined narrowly, and deviations from the
categorization are generally reversed, the discretion that should be left in
the hands of the trial and sentencing judges is shifted considerably to the
appellate courts.

 

Second, there is no legal basis for the judicial
creation of a category of offence within a statutory offence for the purposes
of sentencing. As has been true since Frey v. Fedoruk, [1950] S.C.R.
517, it is not for judges to create criminal offences, but rather for the
legislature to enact such offences. 

 

 








46                           
Furthermore, Lamer C.J. reasoned that a categorical approach represents
only a partial, and therefore unbalanced, application of the fundamental
sentencing principle of proportionality contained in s. 718.1 (Proulx, supra,
at para. 83).  Moreover, s. 718.1 provides that “[a] sentence must be
proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender” (emphasis added).   Thus, in assessing the
seriousness of a crime we are directed to consider the gravity of the offence
and the offender’s degree of responsibility.

 

47                           
In this case, the trial judge did refer to “guideline cases binding on
this court”, an apparent reference to case law which outlined “starting point”
guidelines for establishing sentences for serious sexual assaults.  The
reference to a “starting point” does not, however, establish that the judge
failed to consider the seriousness of the offence and the offender’s degree of
responsibility on the facts of the case.  Independent of this reference it is
clear that the trial judge determined that this was a serious crime, taking
into account the gravity of the offence, the existence or absence of
aggravating factors, and the lack of evidence of remorse:   

 

The maximum term provided by the Criminal Code  is 10 years
imprisonment.  The sexual assault occurred when the 18-year-old victim was
either asleep or unconscious from the effects of alcohol.  The medical evidence
indicated vaginal abrasions but did not establish penetration or intercourse. 
It was, in my view, in any event, a major, or at the very best, a near major
sexual assault, as those terms have been used in the guideline cases binding on
this court.  The paramount sentencing factors for these kinds of offences are
deterrence and denunciation.

 

Mr. Wells here took complete advantage of an
unconscious 18-year-old girl.  His own admitted and voluntary intoxication is
no excuse.  He violated the victim’s personal integrity in the basest of ways.

 

 








48                           
I cannot conclude that the trial judge misconstrued the seriousness of
the crime.  In addition, the judge’s use of the words “near major” or “major”
instead of “serious” does not constitute a reversible error.  I find no error
in principle, no overemphasis of the appropriate factors, nor a failure to
consider a relevant factor, and, accordingly, defer to the trial judge’s
assessment of the particular circumstances of the offence and offender (M.
(C.A.), supra).  Therefore, the trial judge made a reasonable
determination as to the availability of a conditional sentence.

 

49                           
I would like to add at this point that the reasons in Gladue, supra,
do not foreclose the possibility that, in the appropriate circumstances, a
sentencing judge may accord the greatest weight to the concept of restorative
justice, notwithstanding that an aboriginal offender has committed a serious
crime.   As was concluded in Gladue, at para. 81, the remedial purpose
of s. 718.2(e) directs the sentencing judge not only to take into
account the unique circumstances of aboriginal offenders, but also to
appreciate relevant cultural differences in terms of the objectives of the
sentencing process:

 

The analysis for sentencing aboriginal offenders, as
for all offenders, must be holistic and designed to achieve a fit sentence in
the circumstances.  There is no single test that a judge can apply in order to
determine the sentence.  The sentencing judge is required to take into account
all of the surrounding circumstances regarding the offence, the offender, the
victims, and the community, including the unique circumstances of the offender
as an aboriginal person.  Sentencing must proceed with sensitivity to and
understanding of the difficulties aboriginal people have faced with both the
criminal justice system and society at large.  When evaluating these
circumstances in light of the aims and principles of sentencing as set out in
Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  and in the jurisprudence, the judge must
strive to arrive at a sentence which is just and appropriate in the
circumstances.  By means of s. 718.2 (e), sentencing judges have been
provided with a degree of flexibility and discretion to consider in appropriate
circumstances alternative sentences to incarceration which are appropriate for
the aboriginal offender and community and yet comply with the mandated
principles and purpose of sentencing.  In this way, effect may be given to the
aboriginal emphasis upon healing and restoration of both the victim and the
offender.

 








50                           
The generalization drawn in Gladue to the effect that the more
violent and serious the offence, the more likely as a practical matter for
similar terms of imprisonment to be imposed on aboriginal and non-aboriginal
offenders, was not meant to be a principle of universal application.  In each
case, the sentencing judge must look to the circumstances of the aboriginal
offender.  In some cases, it may be that these circumstances include evidence
of the community’s decision to address criminal activity associated with social
problems, such as sexual assault, in a manner that emphasizes the goal of
restorative justice, notwithstanding the serious nature of the offences in
question.

 

51                           
As Lamer C.J. noted in M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 92,
sentencing requires an individualized focus, not only of the offender, but also
of the victim and community as well:

It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a
uniform sentence for a particular crime. . . .  Sentencing is an inherently
individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a
similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of
academic abstraction.  As well, sentences for a particular offence should be
expected to vary to some degree across various communities and regions in this
country, as the “just and appropriate” mix of accepted sentencing goals will
depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community
where the crime occurred.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

52                           
In this respect, I note that the appellant introduced evidence of the
availability of an aboriginal-specific alcohol and drug abuse treatment
program.  There was, however, an indication that this program would be
inappropriate for the appellant as a sexual offender.  In addition, there was
no evidence of the existence of, or the appellant’s participation in, an
anti-sexual-assault program.

 

(2)        Extent of the Sentencing Judge’s
Obligation to Inquire into the  Circumstances of an Aboriginal Offender

 

 

53                           
As noted in Gladue, supra, at para. 83, it will be
necessary in every case for the sentencing judge to take judicial notice of
systemic or background factors that have contributed to the difficulties faced
by aboriginal people in both the criminal justice system, and throughout
society at large.  In addition, the judge is obliged to inquire into the unique
circumstances of aboriginal offenders.








 

54                           
At times, it may be necessary to introduce evidence of this nature.  It
is to be expected in our adversarial system of criminal law that counsel for
both the prosecution and the accused will adduce this evidence, but even where
counsel do not provide the necessary information, s. 718.2(e) places an
affirmative obligation upon the sentencing judge to inquire into the relevant
circumstances.   In most cases, the requirement of special attention to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders can be satisfied by the information
contained in pre-sentence reports.   Where this information is insufficient, s.
718.2(e) authorizes the sentencing judge on his or her own initiative to
request that witnesses be called to testify as to reasonable alternatives to a
custodial sentence.

 

55                           
Having said that, it was never the Court’s intention, in setting out the
appropriate methodology for this assessment, to transform the role of the
sentencing judge into that of a board of inquiry.   It must be remembered that
in the reasons in Gladue, this affirmative obligation to make inquiries
beyond the information contained in the pre-sentence report was limited to
“appropriate circumstances”, and where such inquiries were “practicable” (para.
84).   The application of s. 718.2(e) requires a practical inquiry, not
an impractical one.  As with any other factual finding made by a court of first
instance, the sentencing judge’s assessment of whether further inquiries are
either appropriate or practicable is accorded deference at the appellate level.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

 








Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Legislative amendment
-- Accused sentenced to two years’ incarceration -- New legislation introducing
conditional sentencing regime after trial but before appeal -- Conditional
sentence available when sentence of less than two years imposed -- Whether
accused eligible to conditional sentence on appeal.

 

Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Conditional sentences
-- Lawyer convicted of breach of trust -- Whether Court of Appeal erred in
substituting conditional sentence for two-year penitentiary term imposed by
sentencing judge -- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 742.1 .

 

The accused, a lawyer, was retained by Soviet lawyers
to recover and remit inheritances of money from the estates of six deceased
Manitoba and Saskatchewan residents.  In all cases, he converted part of the
trust money received for each of the beneficiaries from his trust account to
his general account.  When the conversions were discovered by the Law Society,
his right to practice was suspended.  He was later disbarred.  The accused was
convicted of six counts of breach of trust and sentenced to two years’
incarceration.  At the time of sentencing, the accused was married with one
teenage daughter.  His wife was disabled and confined to a wheelchair.  After
trial but prior to the appeal, Bill C-41 and the conditional sentencing regime
came into force.  The Court of Appeal allowed the accused’s appeal from
sentence and imposed a conditional sentence of two years less a day.

 

Held (L’Heureux-Dubé, Bastarache and Binnie JJ. dissenting):  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Gonthier, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  Bill C-41 introduced the
conditional sentencing regime and significant changes to the principles of
sentencing.  These changes raise the distinct possibility that a judge who
sentenced an offender to a short penitentiary term prior to the introduction of
Bill C-41, particularly a term of exactly two years, would have found that a
sentence of less than two years was appropriate had the new provisions been in
force at the time of sentencing.  The offender would therefore have been
eligible for a conditional sentence.  Accordingly, the new amendments
constitute a potential mitigation of punishment for such an offender, and
should apply on appeal.

 

Where there has been an intervening change in the law
between sentencing and appeal, it is as though the sentencing judge has
committed an error in principle, because relevant principles have not been
considered.  The Court of Appeal need not, therefore, defer to all of the trial
judge’s findings, and can proceed to re-sentence the accused in light of the
new principles.  In reviewing the Court of Appeal’s sentence, this Court should
accord it some deference. 

 








In this case, there is no reason to interfere with the
Court of Appeal’s sentence.  None of the offences carried a minimum term of
imprisonment.  The decision to reduce the sentence to less than two years was
justified in light of the changes in the law.  The effect of ss. 718.2(e)
and 718(e) and (f) was sufficient to warrant a reduction of the
sentence in this case.  The Court of Appeal reasonably concluded that the ruin
and humiliation that the accused had brought down upon himself and his family,
together with the loss of his professional status, could provide sufficient
denunciation and deterrence when coupled with a conditional sentence of two
years less a day with house arrest.  The court also imposed a condition of 200
hours of community service which was capable of achieving the restorative
objective of reparation to the community.  Moreover, the Court of Appeal noted
important mitigating circumstances in this case.  The accused was the sole
provider and caregiver for both his disabled wife and their daughter.  The Court
of Appeal’s sentence provided sufficient denunciation and deterrence, and was
not disproportionately lenient.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Bastarache and Binnie JJ. (dissenting):  The trial judge’s sentence should be
restored.  An intervening change in the law does not necessarily give rise to
re-sentencing by the Court of Appeal.  Rather, it gives rise to a right of
review to determine whether the sentence of the trial judge is inconsistent
with the new sentencing principles and therefore in error.  Here, the Court of
Appeal did not have sufficient reason to interfere with the trial judge’s
decision to impose the penitentiary term.  The two-year sentence of
incarceration was neither unfit, nor inconsistent with the new principles of
sentencing introduced by Bill C-41.

 








While the changes to the Criminal Code  would in
a proper case permit a reduction of a sentence to two years less a day, thereby
triggering the consideration of a conditional sentence, this is not an
appropriate case for community sanctions.  The focus of the sanction for
criminal breach of trust is denunciation and general deterrence.  Lawyers
convicted of criminal breach of trust have generally been sentenced to jail. 
This emphasis on denunciation and general deterrence is particularly important
when courts punish lawyers who have committed criminal breach of trust.  First,
the criminal dishonesty of lawyers has profound effects on the public’s ability
to conduct business that affect people far beyond the victims of the particular
crime.  Second, as officers of the court, lawyers are entrusted with heightened
duties, the breach of which brings the administration of justice into
disrepute.  Thirdly, judges are drawn from the legal profession and there is a
duty to ensure public confidence in the pool from which members of the bench
are selected.  Finally, judges must be particularly scrupulous in sentencing
lawyers in a manner that dispels any apprehension of bias.  A lawyer should
receive, and be seen to receive, the same treatment as any other person
convicted of a similar crime.  Any perception that a lawyer might receive more
lenient consideration by the courts must be guarded against.

 

Even if the Court of Appeal correctly relied on the
introduction of the conditional sentencing regime to revisit the sentence,
given that denunciation and deterrence are the primary principles of sentencing
engaged by a breach of trust by a lawyer, a conditional sentence would be
disproportionally lenient in this case.  The facts display a significant level
of criminal culpability and the short penitentiary sentence imposed by the
trial judge was proportionate to the gravity of the offence.  The severity of
this sentence is seriously undermined by the substitution of a conditional
sentence of two years less a day.  This is more than a reduction of a single
day, it is also significantly less severe in terms of incarceration.

1                                  
The Chief Justice -- This
is a Crown appeal from a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal substituting
a conditional sentence for the penitentiary term imposed by the trial judge. 
This case was heard together with the appeals in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5; R. v. L.F.W., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, 2000 SCC 6; R.

1 S.C.R.163, 2000 SCC 8.  Like R.A.R. and R.N.S., this case
raises questions about the effects of changes in the law between the
pronouncement of the sentence by the trial judge and the hearing of the appeal.

 

I.     Factual
Background

 

2                                  
The respondent, a lawyer, began an agency relationship with an
association of lawyers in the former Soviet Union.  The Soviet lawyers retained
the respondent to recover and remit inheritances of money from the estates of
six deceased Manitoba and Saskatchewan residents.  The money involved was sent
to the respondent by the executors of the estates or their solicitors, and he acted
for the beneficiaries pursuant to a power of attorney signed by each of the
beneficiaries.  The respondent was also the executor of one estate.

 








3                                  
In all cases, the respondent converted part of the trust money received
for each of the beneficiaries  from his trust account to his general account. 
Approximately $86,000 was converted through 145 separate transfers between
February 1986 and September 1989, after he had already taken 10 percent as fees
for his services.  The conversions were discovered by a spot audit conducted by
the Law Society of Manitoba in October 1989.  The Law Society suspended the
respondent’s right to practice and  later disbarred him.

 

4                                  
The respondent was convicted of six counts of breach of trust and six
counts of theft, although the theft charges were stayed pursuant to the
principles set out in R. v. Kienapple, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  At the time
of sentencing, the respondent was 45 years old and employed with a local
corporation.  He was married with one teenage daughter.  His wife was disabled
and confined to a wheelchair.  As a result of his wife’s disability, the
respondent had taken on a large share of family responsibilities, and he was
the sole income-earner for the family.  His legal career had been beset by
financial woes for many years.  According to the pre-sentence report, the
respondent was acutely aware of what he had already lost in personal terms,
namely a 20-year career as a lawyer, and the respect of the public and his
peers.  He suffered “humiliation and torment . . . amplified with the
realization that his invalid wife and teenage daughter must share in the
embarrassment and debasement of his personal debacle” (p. 9 of the pre-sentence
report).

 








5                                  
He was sentenced to two years’ incarceration (sentences of imprisonment
of two years or more are served in a penitentiary).  The respondent appealed
his convictions and sentence, and the Crown cross-appealed the sentence.  After
trial but prior to the appeal, An Act to amend the Criminal Code
(sentencing) and other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill
C-41”), and the conditional sentencing regime came into force.  The Manitoba
Court of Appeal dismissed the respondent’s convictions appeal and the Crown’s
cross-appeal, but allowed the respondent’s appeal from sentence and substituted
a conditional sentence of two years less a day.

 

II.       Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

6                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing
is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the
law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a)  to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b)     to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

 

(c)  to separate offenders from society, where necessary;

 

(d)   to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

 

(e)  to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 

(f)  to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall
also take into consideration the following principles:

 

(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any
relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the
offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

 

(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate
based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age,
mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,

 

(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the
offender’s spouse or child,

 








(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a
position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or

 

(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the
direction of or in association with a criminal organization

 

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

 

(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

 

(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined
sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;

 

(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less
restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and

 

(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

 

 

742.1 Where a person is convicted of an
offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment, and the court

 

(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,
and

 

(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community
would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to
718.2,

 

the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour
in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,
subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional
sentence order made under section 742.3.

 

III.       Judgments
Below

 

A. Manitoba
Court of Queen’s Bench, C.R. 94-01-14797, February 5, 1996

 








7                                  
In brief reasons, Scollin J. stated that the
aggravating and mitigating factors in the case had been thoroughly explored by
both counsel.  The Crown had listed as aggravating factors the breach of trust,
the repeated occurrence of illegal conversions (145 transactions), the amount
of money at issue, and the fact that the respondent had been unwilling to
acknowledge guilt and repay the sums.  Defence counsel referred to the
embarrassment and loss of reputation already suffered by the respondent and the
letters of reference from other lawyers written in the respondent’s favour.

 

8                                  
Scollin J. referred to the poor treatment of the distant Soviet
beneficiaries, and to the burden placed upon other members of the Law Society
by the respondent’s unlawful conduct.  He stated that he gave weight to the
reference letter from a lawyer with whom the respondent had been associated
from time to time, and that he had paid attention to a letter from another
lawyer who had been told by the victims’ lawyer in the U.S.S.R. that the
victims would be satisfied with a one-year sentence of imprisonment.  He also
stated that he “paid close attention” to the pre-sentence report, which
described the hardship that the respondent had already suffered as a result of
his actions.  Commenting that it was difficult to reach a perfect sentence,
Scollin J. held that a sentence of two years’ imprisonment was merited.  He
stated that a longer sentence would “cross the border into vengeance”, while a
shorter sentence would be an “excess of sympathy in the guise of mercy”.

 

B. Manitoba
Court of Appeal (1997), 118 Man. R. (2d) 300

 








9                                  
Kroft J.A. began by noting that the court’s
primary concern was not with the duration of the detention ordered by the trial
judge, since a sentence of two years’ imprisonment on the facts of the
particular case was not one which, prior to the introduction of the conditional
sentencing regime, would have been likely to invite appellate intervention.  He
stated that the introduction of the conditional sentence was part of a change
that involved replacing the existing Part XXIII of the Criminal Code 
with a new set of principles.  He held that the new conditional sentencing
provisions could be given retroactive effect in relation to this appeal
pursuant to s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.
I-21 , and this Court’s decision in R. v. Dunn, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 226. 
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal was in the position of considering the fitness
of the sentence according to different statutory criteria than those in effect
when the trial judge rendered his decision.  Unlike the usual sentence appeal,
the court was entitled, if not bound, to exercise its own discretion.

 

10                              
Kroft J.A. was persuaded that if the option had been open to him, the
trial judge would have, and should have, addressed the possibility of imposing
a sentence of two years less a day instead of two years.  He based this
observation on the wording of the sentencing judgment and on the mitigating factors
of the case, including the important role played by the respondent at home with
his disabled wife and as sole supporter of his family, as well as the
respondent’s financial difficulties.  Kroft J.A. also considered the letter
referred to by the trial judge which indicated that the victims would be
satisfied with a one-year sentence of imprisonment.

 

11                              
In determining whether a conditional sentence would be appropriate,
Kroft J.A. began by noting that the respondent was not a danger to the
community.  Turning to a consideration of the principles of sentencing, Kroft
J.A. stated that concerns of denunciation and deterrence had been addressed by
the ruin and humiliation that the respondent had brought upon himself and his
family, and by the loss of the respondent’s professional status.  Kroft J.A.
therefore reduced the sentence originally imposed by one day, and ordered that
it be served in the community.  In addition to the mandatory conditions, he
ordered the respondent to perform 200 hours of community service, remain
resident at his current address or another approved address, and be confined to
his property at all times, with limited exceptions.

 

IV.    Issue








12                              
At issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal improperly
interfered in substituting a conditional sentence for the two-year penitentiary
term imposed by the sentencing judge.

 

V.    Analysis

 

13                              
The Crown argued that the Court of Appeal erred in two respects.  First,
the Court of Appeal should not have reduced the two-year sentence imposed by
the trial judge by one day so as to make the respondent eligible for a
conditional sentence.  Second, and in the alternative, the Court of Appeal
erred in concluding that a conditional sentence was warranted in this case,
particularly because a conditional sentence could not provide sufficient
denunciation and deterrence.  I will consider each argument in turn.

 

A. Did the
Court of Appeal Err in Reducing the Sentence by One Day?

 

14                              
The Crown’s argument may be briefly put as follows.  Pursuant to s.
742.1 (a) of the Criminal Code , conditional sentences are only
available in cases where a sentence of less than two years is imposed.  Where a
sentence of two years is imposed by the sentencing judge, a conditional
sentence is unavailable, unless that sentence is demonstrably unfit and reduced
to less than two years on appeal.  In this case Scollin J. imposed a two-year sentence. 
The Court of Appeal stated that it was not primarily concerned with the
duration of the detention ordered, and that a sentence of two years for the
offences the respondent committed would not have been likely to invite
appellate intervention in the past.  Therefore, according to the Crown, the
two-year sentence imposed by Scollin J. was not demonstrably unfit.  It should
not have been disturbed, and a conditional sentence should not have been
imposed.

 








15                              
The Crown’s argument presupposes that the respondent was not entitled to
the benefit of the sentencing amendments introduced by Bill C-41 on appeal.  As
I discussed in R.A.R., supra, at paras. 14-16, an offender
is entitled to the benefit of any amendments to sentencing provisions introduced
after sentencing but prior to appeal that provide for a reduction or mitigation
of punishment.  The Crown’s argument is that Bill C-41 only constitutes a
reduction or mitigation of punishment for those offenders sentenced to less
than two years’ imprisonment because a conditional sentence is unavailable for
offenders who receive a penitentiary term.  Since the respondent was sentenced
to a penitentiary term, the sentencing provisions in force at the time the
respondent was originally sentenced should continue to apply.  If these
provisions were applied, the sentence of incarceration should not have been
reduced by one day, as the Court of Appeal conceded that a sentence of two
years would not have warranted appellate intervention in the past.

 

16                              
In my view, the Crown construes the mitigating effect of the new
sentencing amendments too narrowly.  While Bill C-41 and the introduction of
the conditional sentencing regime constitute a mitigation of punishment for
offenders sentenced to less than two years’ imprisonment, I am of the opinion
that the new amendments may also constitute a mitigation of punishment for
offenders who were sentenced to short penitentiary terms, particularly those
sentenced to terms of exactly two years.

 








17                              
In addition to the introduction of the conditional sentence, Bill C-41
also introduced significant changes to the principles of sentencing.   As this
Court found in R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 48, and Proulx,
supra, at paras. 14-19, two of Parliament’s principal objectives in
enacting Bill C-41 were to reduce the use of prison as a sanction and to expand
the use of restorative justice principles in sentencing.  It was noted that
these two objectives were linked, as the objectives of restorative justice would
generally be achieved more efficiently by sanctions other than incarceration:
see Gladue, supra, at para. 43; Proulx, supra, at
para. 109.  

 

18                              
These objectives are reflected in several provisions of the new Part
XXIII of the Criminal Code .  Section 718.2 (e) provides that “all
available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the
circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention
to the circumstances of the aboriginal offenders”.  Commenting on the
significance of the enactment of s. 718.2 (e), the Court found in Gladue,
supra, at para. 39, that:

 

With respect for the contrary view, we do not
interpret s. 718.2(e) as expressing only a restatement of existing law,
either with respect to the general principle of restraint in the use of prison
or with respect to the specific direction regarding aboriginal offenders. . .
.  The enactment of the new Part XXIII was a watershed, marking the first
codification and significant reform of sentencing principles in the history of
Canadian criminal law.

 

New emphasis
is also placed on the principles of restorative justice in s. 718(e) and
(f): see Gladue, supra, at para. 43.

 

19                              
These changes to the law raise the distinct possibility that a
judge who sentenced an offender to a short penitentiary term prior to the
introduction of Bill C-41, particularly a term of exactly two years, would have
found that a sentence of less than two years was appropriate had the new
provisions been in force at the time of the sentencing.  The offender would
therefore have been eligible for a conditional sentence.  Accordingly, the new
amendments constitute a potential mitigation of punishment for such an
offender, and should apply on appeal.

 








20                              
I note one further argument in support of this position.  On occasion, a
sentencing judge will impose a short penitentiary term, especially one of
exactly two years, instead of a long jail term because in some areas of the
country, the conditions in federal penitentiaries are better than those in
provincial institutions.  Where a penitentiary term was imposed for this reason
prior to the introduction of Bill C-41, it is even more likely that the
sentencing judge may have sentenced the offender to a term of imprisonment of
less than two years had the new provisions been in force at the time of
sentencing.        

 

21                              
For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the respondent was
entitled to the benefit of the changes to the law on appeal.  As a result, the
Court of Appeal was entitled to conduct a re-sentencing.  In R. v. M. (C.A.),
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90, I explained that ""absent an error in
principle . . . a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence
imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit"".  Where there has
been an intervening change in the law between sentencing and appeal, it is as
though the sentencing judge has committed an error in principle, albeit for
reasons beyond his or her control, because relevant principles have not been
considered.  The Court of Appeal need not, therefore, defer to all of the trial
judge's findings, and can proceed to re-sentence the respondent in light of the
new principles.

 

B. Did the
Court of Appeal Err in Imposing a Conditional Sentence?

 








22                              
  In reviewing
the Court of Appeal’s sentence, this Court should accord it some deference; see
R.A.R., supra,  at para. 21.  I find no reason to interfere with
the Court of Appeal’s sentence.  None of the offences of which the respondent
was convicted carried a minimum term of imprisonment.  The Court of Appeal’s
decision to reduce the sentence to less than two years was justified in light
of the changes in the law.  In my view, the effect of ss. 718.2(e) and
718(e) and (f) was sufficient to warrant a reduction of the
respondent’s sentence, thereby satisfying the requirement of s. 742.1 (a). 
I also see no reason to interfere with the Court of Appeal’s finding that the
respondent did not pose any danger to the community.  

 

23                              
Turning to a consideration of the principles of sentencing, the court
reasonably concluded that the ruin and humiliation that Mr. Bunn had brought
down upon himself and his family, together with the loss of his professional
status, could provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence when coupled with
a conditional sentence of two years less a day with house arrest.  The Court of
Appeal also imposed a condition of 200 hours of community service which was
capable of achieving the restorative objective of reparation to the community. 
Moreover, the Court of Appeal noted important mitigating circumstances in this
case.  The respondent was the sole provider and caregiver for both his wife,
who suffered from multiple sclerosis and had been confined to a wheelchair for
years, and their teenage daughter.

 

VI.       Disposition

 

24                              
The Court of Appeal’s sentence provided sufficient denunciation and
deterrence, and was not disproportionately lenient.  I would dismiss the
appeal.

JJ. were delivered by       

 








25                              
Bastarache J. (dissenting)
-- This Crown’s appeal raises the question of whether the Manitoba Court of
Appeal erred in substituting a conditional sentence for the penitentiary term
of two years imposed by the trial judge.  As in the companion cases of R. v.
R.N.S., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149, 2000 SCC 7, and R. v. R.A.R., [2000] 1
S.C.R. 163, 2000 SCC 8, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and
other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill C‑41”),
was introduced after trial and before appeal.  In contrast with those appeals,
the trial judge in this case did not impose a sentence within the range of
sentences that might benefit from the new conditional sentencing provisions. 
Instead he found that the appropriate sentence was a short penitentiary term.

 

26                              
While I agree with the statement of principles set out in R. v.
Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5, I cannot accept the conclusion reached
by the Chief Justice in this case.  While on the face of it the Court of Appeal
made a minor adjustment of one day in the two-year sentence imposed by the
trial judge, the Court of Appeal in fact levered this minor adjustment into the
substitution of an altogether different sentencing approach from that
considered appropriate by the trial judge, who, as stated, concluded that the
appellant ought to be incarcerated in a penitentiary for two years.  In my
view, the Court of Appeal did not have sufficient reason to interfere with this
determination by the trial judge:  the sentence was neither unfit, nor
inconsistent with the new principles of sentencing introduced by Bill C-41. 
Furthermore, while the changes to the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , could in a proper case permit a reduction of a sentence to two years less
a day, thereby triggering the consideration of a conditional sentence, this is
not an appropriate case for community sanctions.

 








27                              
A Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to revisit and vary a sentence if the
sentence is demonstrably unfit or if the trial judge made an error in principle
(R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90).  By virtue of
the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , an accused found guilty
has the right to receive the benefit of an intervening change in the applicable
law that would serve to reduce or to mitigate a penalty when that change occurs
after sentencing but before appeal (R. v. Dunn, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 226). 
Thus, the Court of Appeal could have varied the sentence of two years if it was
unfit, or if the provisions of Bill C-41 would have reduced or mitigated the
sentence, which would have amounted to finding that an error in principle was
made.

 

28                              
The Court of Appeal began by determining that a sentence of two years
was not demonstrably unfit, and would not have invited appellate intervention
prior to the legislative amendment.  The decision of the trial judge to impose
a penitentiary term is a significant one.  I agree with the Chief Justice that
this choice may sometimes be affected by outside factors, such as the
availability of treatment facilities, the location of prisons, the risks posed
to the prisoner at a specific institution, or the timing of predicted release. 
However, I find no indication that the trial judge in this case considered any
factors other than those pertaining directly to the criminal culpability of the
respondent.  I agree that this sentence was appropriate in light of all the
facts before the trial court and in consideration of sentences for similar
crimes before the change in the law.

 

29                              
The Court of Appeal went on to consider the effect of Bill C-41.  Kroft
J.A. found that the introduction of the conditional sentencing option required
the Court of Appeal to reconsider the sentence, and concluded:

 

I am persuaded that if the option had been open to
him, Scollin, J., would have, and should have, addressed the possibility of
imposing a sentence of two years less a day instead of two years, and that
sanctions other than imprisonment would have been considered.

 

((1997), 118 Man. R. (2d) 300, at p. 302.)

 








30                              
While I agree that the trial judge, Scollin J., would undoubtedly have
considered the full range of sentencing options open to him, the more important
consideration is that Scollin J. rejected all options short of a term in the penitentiary. 
After considering all of the submissions on sentence, he specifically
concluded:

 

[A] sentence of two years is merited by the conduct of the accused. 
More than that, in this case, would cross the border into vengeance; less would
be an excess of sympathy in the guise of mercy.

 

(Man. Q.B., C.R. 94-01-14797, February 5, 1996, at p. 34 (transcript).)

 

The trial
judge came to this determination after hearing extensive submissions from the
Crown, who requested a sentence of four years, and the defence, who urged a
sentence of one year.  The trial judge also had the benefit of a pre-sentence
report indicating that the accused was reluctant to acknowledge criminal
culpability and concluding that, “supervised probation would serve no practical
need or purpose.  Mr. Bunn has all the tools in terms of requisite capacities,
skills, and supports to construct any reality he so chooses” (p. 9 of the
pre-sentence report).

 








31                              
In my view, the introduction of the conditional sentencing option alone
should have had no effect on the appeal in this case since the offender would
not have been eligible for the conditional sentence given the penitentiary term
imposed.  In the two-stage approach set out in Proulx, supra, the
first step is to exclude the possibility of both probationary measures and a
penitentiary term:  “[i]f either of these sentences is appropriate, then a
conditional sentence should not be imposed” (para. 58 (emphasis
added)).  In this case the trial judge fashioned a fit and proper sentence that
was outside the range of sentences eligible for conditional sentencing.  The
Court of Appeal should therefore not have considered the availability of a
conditional sentence unless Bill C‑41 introduced other changes relevant
to the punishment of the offender that would mitigate or reduce his sentence.

 

32                              
It is true that Bill C-41 made other significant changes in the
sentencing regime that would, in an appropriate case, require a Court of Appeal
to vary a sentence imposed by a trial judge that is outside the range of
sentences eligible for conditional sentences.  As recognized in R. v. Gladue,
[1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 43, in addition to introducing the conditional
sentence and requiring sentencing judges to consider alternatives to
imprisonment, the new provisions both codify the existing sentencing principles
which are listed in s. 718(a) through (d) and introduce new
restorative justice principles in s. 718(e) and (f).  It may be
that in an appropriate case the combination of the restorative principles with
the requirement to consider alternatives to imprisonment would serve to reduce
a penitentiary term to two years less a day so that a conditional sentence
might be imposed.  But this can only occur where consideration of all
sentencing principles makes it clear that there has been an error in principle
producing an unfit sentence.  I would therefore, with respect, disagree with
the Chief Justice where he says that an intervening change in the law
necessarily gives rise to re‑sentencing by the Court of Appeal.  In my
view, the intervening change in the law gives rise to a right of review to
determine whether the sentence of the trial judge is inconsistent with the new
sentencing principles and therefore in error.  This interpretation is in accord
with the decision of the majority in Dunn, supra, where this
Court rejected the notion that de novo sentencing was appropriate.

 








33                              
This is not a case where a variance in sentence is warranted based on
the changes introduced in s. 718.  It is well established that the focus of the
sanction for criminal breach of trust is denunciation and general deterrence;
see, for example, R. v. Barker (1995), 102 Man. R. (2d) 305 (C.A.); R.
v. Kelleher, [1995] M.J. No. 398 (QL) (Prov. Ct.), at para. 7.  In the past
this has required that, absent exceptional circumstances, lawyers convicted of
criminal breach of trust have been sentenced to jail; see R. v. Ryan,
[1976] 6 W.W.R. 668 (Alta. C.A.); Barker, supra; R. v.
Bergeron, [1998] Q.J. No. 3539 (QL) (C.Q.), at para. 19.  This emphasis on
denunciation and general deterrence is, for a number of reasons, particularly
important when courts punish lawyers who have committed criminal breach of
trust.  First, the criminal dishonesty of lawyers has profound effects on the
public’s ability to conduct business that affect people far beyond the victims
of the particular crime (R. v. Salmon, Alta. Q.B., Calgary 9001‑2179‑02,
October 21, 1991).  Second, as officers of the court, lawyers are entrusted
with heightened duties, the breach of which brings the administration of
justice into disrepute (R. v. Gingera, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 273 (Man. C.A.); R.
v. Manolescu (1997), 202 A.R. 241 (Prov. Ct.)).  Thirdly, judges are drawn
from the legal profession and there is a duty to ensure public confidence in
the pool from which members of the bench are selected (R. v. Oliver,
[1977] 5 W.W.R. 344 (B.C.C.A.)).

 

34                              
Finally, judges must be particularly scrupulous in sentencing lawyers in
a manner that dispels any apprehension of bias.  A lawyer should receive, and
be seen to receive, the same treatment as any other person convicted of a
similar crime.  While they are not to be singled out for harsher penalties than
others convicted in comparable circumstances, any perception that a lawyer
might receive more lenient consideration by the courts must be guarded against
(Ryan, supra; R. v. Shandro (1985), 65 A.R. 311 (C.A.)). 
In this regard I would adopt the reasoning of my colleague Justice L’Heureux‑Dubé,
then a member of the Quebec Court of Appeal, in Marchessault v. La Reine,
C.A. Mtl., No. 500-10-000035-848, July 12, 1984, at p. 3:

 








[translation] 
On a subjective level, it is clear that whenever a crime is committed by a
public figure, a person in authority, a star, etc., all the factors mentioned,
or almost all, are present: the crime and the punishment receive greater
publicity, the shame and opprobrium are that much greater, the financial loss
resulting from the loss of employment is commensurate with the high income. 
.  .  .  

 

Popular wisdom has it that the further one falls,
the more it hurts. . . . 

 

[T]he higher the rank or position the figure occupies in society, the
more well known he or she is, the lighter the sentence should be and,
conversely, the more humble or obscure the figure is, the harsher it will be. 
I do not accept this proposition:  the scales could not accommodate these two
unequal measures.  Justice must be the same for everyone, great or small, rich
or poor.

 

35                              
Even if I were to accept that the Court of Appeal correctly relied on
the introduction of the conditional sentencing regime to revisit the sentence
on the Dunn principle, I would still decline to impose a conditional
sentence in this case.

 

36                              
In the instant case, the serious nature of the statutory aggravating
factor of abuse of trust (s. 718.2) renders a conditional sentence
inappropriately lenient.  In this regard I would also point to further
aggravating factors:  the vulnerability and number of the foreign victims, many
of whom were elderly; the extended length of time over which the accused
perpetrated the breaches, three years and seven months; the pattern of conduct,
consisting of the repetition of 145 separate transactions; and the unlikeliness
that he would have been caught, especially by the victims.  The  mitigating
significance of the accused’s otherwise good reputation in the community and
lack of prior record should be given little weight in this type of case because
it is that same unsullied reputation that allowed the accused to gain the
position from which he could commit the crime (R. v. Foran, [1970] 1
C.C.C. 336 (Ont. C.A.); Kelleher, supra).

 








37                              
These facts display a significant level of criminal culpability and in
my view the short penitentiary sentence imposed by the trial judge was
proportionate to the gravity of the offence.  The severity of this sentence is
seriously undermined by the substitution of a conditional sentence of two years
less a day.  This is more than a reduction of a single day; it is, as explained
in Proulx, at para. 40, also significantly less severe in terms of
incarceration.  As observed in Proulx, at para. 102:

 

Incarceration will usually provide more denunciation than a conditional
sentence, as a  conditional sentence is generally a more lenient sentence
than a jail term of equivalent duration.  That said, a conditional sentence
can still provide a significant amount of denunciation.  This is particularly
so when onerous conditions are imposed and the duration of the conditional
sentence is extended beyond the duration of the jail sentence that would
ordinarily have been imposed in the circumstances.  [Emphasis added.]

 

In this case,
because the jail term that would otherwise have been imposed was either two
years or two years less a day, it is impossible for the length of the
conditional sentence to be extended in order to compensate for the lessened
degree of denunciation.  Since denunciation and deterrence are the primary
principles of sentencing engaged by a breach of trust by a lawyer, it would be
disproportionally lenient to give a conditional sentence in this case.

 

38                              
I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the two-year sentence
of incarceration imposed by the trial judge.  The Crown requested only that the
respondent be incarcerated for the remainder of his conditional sentence. 
Since the respondent has already served his conditional sentence in its
entirety, I would stay the service of this sentence.

Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Conditional sentences
-- Accused convicted of one count of sexual assault and two counts of common
assault -- Sentencing provisions and relevant facts changing after trial but
prior to sentence appeal -- Whether Court of Appeal erred in substituting
conditional sentence for jail term -- Review of sentence imposed by Court of
Appeal -- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 718.2 .

 

Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Legislative
amendments -- Accused convicted of one count of sexual assault and two counts
of common assault -- Sentencing provisions changing after trial but prior to
sentence appeal -- Whether accused entitled to benefit from new sentencing
provisions -- Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , s. 44 (e).

 

The accused was convicted of one count of sexual
assault and two counts of assault committed against a former employee.  He was
sentenced to one year of incarceration followed by three years of supervised
probation for the count of sexual assault and to fines for the two counts of
assault.  He appealed the convictions and the sentences.  After trial but prior
to the appeal, amendments to the sentencing provisions in the Criminal Code 
came into force and the conditional sentence became an option for offenders
sentenced to less than two years of imprisonment.  In addition to this change
in the law, shortly before the appeal, a different panel of the Manitoba Court
of Appeal quashed two prior convictions of the accused for sexual assault.

 








The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions on the
three counts.  However, it found that the accused was entitled to the benefit
of the new sentencing provisions.  Given the changes in the law and the
relevant facts, the Court of Appeal considered that in a real sense, this was
an appeal de novo.  It allowed the sentence appeal and imposed a
nine-month global sentence made up of six months for the sexual assault, two
months for the first common assault, and one month for the second common assault
to be served consecutively in the community.

 

Held (Lamer C.J. and
Iacobucci J. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier, McLachlin, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.:  The Court of Appeal was
correct in holding that the accused was entitled to the benefit of the
conditional sentencing regime on appeal.  The court erred, however, in imposing
the six-month conditional sentence for the sexual assault.  The sentence was
unfit in light of the gravity of the offences committed and the accused’s moral
blameworthiness given his abuse of a position of authority.  This aggravating
factor, combined with the demeaning and violent nature of the assaults, make
the punitive objectives of denunciation and deterrence particularly pressing in
this case.  The Court of Appeal erred in failing to give significant weight to
these objectives and in imposing a short conditional sentence, where a sentence
of incarceration was the preferable sanction. Accordingly, the one-year
sentence of incarceration for the sexual assault imposed by the trial judge is
restored, to be followed by a three-month conditional sentence for the common
assaults and three years probation imposed by the trial judge for the sexual
assault.  The service of the sentences should be stayed, however, as the
offender has now served his nine-month conditional sentence in full.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Iacobucci J. (dissenting):  The Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the
accused was entitled to the benefit of the conditional sentencing regime on
appeal.  The accused is entitled to the benefit of any amendments to sentencing
provisions in force at the time of the appeal that provide for a lesser
penalty.  Since a conditional sentence is less restrictive of liberty than
incarceration, it constitutes a mitigation of punishment within the meaning of
s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act .

 

Sentencing decisions of courts of
appeal are entitled to some deference from this Court.  The degree of deference
to be given appellate courts is an issue that will arise only in exceptional
cases, given that this Court rarely hears appeals relating to sentences. 
Accordingly, although the sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal appears to be
somewhat lenient, it should not be interfered with given the Court of Appeal’s
careful analysis of the relevant sentencing principles and review of the
evidence.

The Chief Justice
(dissenting) -- This is a Crown appeal from a decision of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal substituting a conditional sentence for the jail term imposed by the
sentencing judge. This case was heard together with the appeals in R. v.
Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5; R. v. L.F.W., [2000] 1
S.C.R. 132, 2000 SCC 6; R. v. R.N.S., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149, 2000 SCC 7,
and  R. v. Bunn, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 183, 2000 SCC 9.  At issue in all of
these appeals are the principles governing the pronouncement of conditional
sentences in the new legislative scheme.  These reasons are concerned primarily
with the application of the principles set out in Proulx, supra. 
In addition, this case raises questions about the effects of changes in the law
and in the facts between the pronouncement of the sentence by the trial judge
and the hearing of the appeal.   

  

I.  Factual
Background

 

2                                  
The respondent was convicted on May 2, 1996, of one count of sexual
assault and two counts of assault committed against a former employee in her
early twenties, who worked on his farm.  I will rely on the Court of Appeal’s
statement of facts ((1997), 123 Man. R. (2d) 91, at p. 96) which was endorsed
by the parties in their written submissions before this Court:

 








In November of 1990, the [respondent] was harnessing a horse in his
barn when he cornered the complainant, placed his hands inside her pants and
pulled her pubic hair.  He then directed her into a box stall where he ordered
her to lie down on the straw.  He then proceeded to take off her pants and
inserted his finger in her vagina, told her not to tell anyone and departed for
breakfast.  

 

The second incident occurred in February of 1991 in
the barn when the complainant was putting a halter on a horse.  The
[respondent] pulled on the halter so that she stumbled and fell.  He placed one
arm around her neck and put a finger up each of her nostrils and pulled quite
hard causing her nose to bleed.

 

The third assault occurred in the summer of 1991,
when the [respondent] came into the garden where the complainant was working,
telling her it was time to eat.  He then grabbed her from behind by her wrists,
had his two sons and a friend grab her feet and carry her to the house.  When
she struggled, the boys let go of her feet but the [respondent] dragged her by
her wrists across a gravel driveway.  During this incident, he told the
[complainant] that she was fat and he laughed.  He also told her that she had
to go to eat when he told her.

 

3                                  
The respondent was sentenced in June 1996 to one year of incarceration
for the count of sexual assault and to fines for the two counts of assault. 
The respondent appealed the convictions and the sentences.  After trial but
prior to the appeal, the amendments to Part XXIII of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and
other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill C-41”)), came
into force. 

 

II.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

4                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

718.  The fundamental purpose of sentencing
is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the
law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a)   to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b)     to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

 

(c)    to separate offenders from society, where necessary;

 

(d)    to assist in rehabilitating offenders;








(e)   to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 

(f)   to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall
also take into consideration the following principles:

 

(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any
relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the
offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

 

(i)  evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate
based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age,
mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,

 

(ii)   evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused
the offender’s spouse or child,

 

(iii)  evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a
position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or

 

(iv)   evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at
the direction of or in association with a criminal organization

 

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

 

(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

 

(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence
should not be unduly long or harsh;

 

(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less
restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and

 

(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

 

 

742.1 Where a person is convicted of an
offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment, and the court

 

(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,
and

 








(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community
would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718  to
718.2 ,

 

the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour
in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,
subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional
sentence order made under section 742.3.

 

 

III.  Judgments
Below

 

A.                              
Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench (Reasons for Sentence), C.R.
94-03-0028, June 6, 1996

 

5                                 
The respondent was sentenced on June 6, 1996.  At the time of
sentencing, Bill C-41 was not yet in force.  Accordingly, Schwartz J., the
sentencing judge, did not have the option of imposing a conditional sentence.  

 








6                                  
Schwartz J. began by noting that the case had attracted a considerable
amount of interest because of the high visibility of the respondent in his
local community and the horse-racing community.  He stated that the respondent
was a valued and involved member of the community in which he resided.  The
respondent had a sound marriage and was a successful entrepreneur.  In
considering the appropriate sentence, Schwartz J. reviewed the various
principles of sentencing.  He found that in this case, the elements of general
deterrence and denunciation seemed to be more important than the others.  He
was satisfied that the respondent would likely never re-offend, and that he was
rehabilitated.  If that were the only concern, he would not have been sent to
prison.  In order to deter others and to show the rest of the community that
the respondent’s conduct was reprehensible, however, he found that a prison
sentence was required.  On the sexual assault count, Schwartz J. imposed a
sentence of one year’s incarceration to be served consecutively  to a term to
which the respondent had already been sentenced for a prior conviction on two
counts of sexual assault.  The term of imprisonment was to be followed by three
years of supervised probation.  On the assault charges, the respondent was
sentenced to pay fines of $10,000 and $2,000, and in default thereof, to serve
one year and three months in jail respectively.  

 

B. Manitoba
Court of Appeal (1997), 123 Man. R. (2d) 91

 

7                                  
The respondent appealed the convictions and the sentences.  The
convictions on the three counts were upheld by the Court of Appeal.  

 

8                                  
Prior to the hearing of the appeal, Bill C-41 came into force.  The
conditional sentence was now an option for offenders sentenced to less than two
years of imprisonment.  In addition to this change in the law, there was also a
change in the relevant facts.  At the time of the original sentencing, the
respondent had just been convicted on two other counts of sexual assault in an
unrelated case, for which two 10-month concurrent sentences of incarceration
had been imposed.  Shortly before the appeal, a different panel of the Manitoba
Court of Appeal quashed these convictions: (1997), 118 Man. R. (2d) 37.  In
addition, by the time the appeal in this case was heard, the respondent had
paid $10,000 to the complainant pursuant to a Manitoba Human Rights Board
settlement.  

 

9                                  
The Court of Appeal found that the respondent was entitled to the
benefit of the new sentencing provisions which came into force after his
original sentencing.  Given changes in both the law and the relevant facts, the
Court of Appeal considered that in a real sense, this was an appeal de novo.


 








10                              
The court reviewed the various decisions under the conditional
sentencing regime, and concluded that because of the confusion surrounding the
provisions, they had been applied inconsistently.  According to the Court of
Appeal, the further amendment to s. 742.1(b)  (Criminal Law
Improvement Act, 1996, S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 107.1), which came into
force on May 2, 1997, appeared to clarify that judges should consider the
principles of sentencing twice: first when determining if and for how long
incarceration was required, and then again when determining whether that
sentence should be served in the community.  The court noted that
notwithstanding the amendment, the main thrust of the legislation as a whole
remained the crafting of sentences that treat imprisonment as a last resort,
and that no offenders or offences were automatically precluded from the
benefits of the new conditional sentencing regime, provided they met the
benchmark of time and non-danger to the community.

  

11                              
In this case, the court felt that the respondent was a good candidate
for a conditional sentence.  He was unlikely to re-offend, and rehabilitation
was not an issue.  Most importantly, denunciation and deterrence would be
effectively achieved if he were forced to live in his own small community,
conspicuously confined by strict limitations as to his movement and
endeavours.  The only reason to put the respondent in prison would be to seek
revenge or retribution for the totally unacceptable manner in which he treated
his young and vulnerable employee.  Nothing in the evidence suggested that the
respondent was likely to be a danger to his community.  In so finding, the
court kept in mind all of the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal
Code , including the principle that an offender should not be deprived of
his liberty if less restrictive sanctions are appropriate.  The court concluded
that the shame, the loss of respect, and the condemnation of the community, as
well as the strict conditions to which the respondent would be subject, would
be sufficient to forcefully impress upon him that his conduct was totally
unacceptable and that there was a need for immediate and drastic change.  








 

12                              
The court allowed the sentence appeal and imposed a nine-month global
sentence made up of six months for the sexual assault, two months for the first
common assault, and one month for the second common assault, to be served
consecutively.  The court found that this case warranted the application of s.
742.1 and therefore ordered the respondent to serve his sentence in the
community.  In addition to the mandatory conditions, the court ordered that the
respondent complete 100 hours of community service within the first six months,
that he complete a sexual offender course chosen by his supervisor, and that he
be confined to his farm property at all times, subject to limited exceptions.

 

IV.   Issue

 

13                              
At issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal erred in
substituting a conditional sentence for the jail term imposed by the trial
judge. 

 

V.  Analysis

 

A. Benefit
of the Conditional Sentencing Regime on Appeal

 

14                              
The Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the respondent was
entitled to the benefit of the conditional sentencing regime on appeal.  I rely
on s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 ,
which provides that:

 

44. Where an enactment, in this section
called the “former enactment”, is repealed and another enactment, in this
section called the “new enactment”, is substituted therefor,

 

.
. .








(e) when any punishment, penalty or forfeiture is reduced or
mitigated by the new enactment, the punishment, penalty or forfeiture if
imposed or adjudged after the repeal shall be reduced or mitigated accordingly;

 

15                              
As my colleague Major J. held in R. v. Dunn, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 226,
at para. 27:

 

I conclude that s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation
Act  resolves the question raised by this appeal.  Where an amendment to a
sentencing provision has been passed after the conviction and sentence by the
trial judge, but before the appeal has been “decided”, the offender is entitled
to the benefit of the lesser penalty or punishment.

 

The same
reasoning applies here.  The respondent is entitled to the benefit of any
amendments to sentencing provisions in force at the time of the appeal that
provide for a lesser penalty, or, in the language of s. 44 (e), a
reduction or mitigation of punishment.  

16                              
At trial, the respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one
year.  Pursuant to s. 742.1(a), a conditional sentence is now an option
in circumstances where a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years is
imposed, provided the other statutory prerequisites are met.  Had the
conditional sentencing regime and the additional sentencing provisions in Bill
C-41 been in force at the time of sentencing, the trial judge would have given
the possibility of a conditional sentence some consideration.  This follows
from s. 718.2 (e) which provides that a court should consider all
alternatives to incarceration that are reasonable in the circumstances.  Since
a conditional sentence is less restrictive of liberty than incarceration, it
constitutes a mitigation of punishment within the meaning of s. 44 (e) of
the Interpretation Act .  Accordingly, the respondent should be entitled
to the benefit of the conditional sentencing regime on appeal.    

 

B. Review
of Sentence Imposed by Court of Appeal

 








17                              
As a result of the intervening changes to both the applicable law and
the relevant facts between trial and appeal, the Court of Appeal re-sentenced
the respondent, as it was entitled to.  This raises the issue of what standard
of review this Court should apply to the sentence imposed by the Court of
Appeal.

 

18                              
In Proulx, supra,  the Court considered the standard of
appellate review applicable to sentences imposed by trial judges.  The Court
reaffirmed its holding in R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para.
90, that 

 

absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or
an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only
intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably
unfit.

 

19                              
As explained in M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 91, this
deferential standard of review has  “profound functional justifications”.  Two
of the justifications set out in M. (C.A.) are that sentencing judges,
serving on the front lines of the criminal justice system, generally have more
day-to-day experience in sentencing matters than many appellate court judges. 
Second, and more importantly, the sentencing judge will generally have a better
knowledge of the community in which the offences occurred and is therefore in a
better position to craft an appropriate sentence. 

 








20                              
In light of the foregoing, it is my view that a sentence imposed by a
court of appeal is not entitled to the same level of deference as that imposed
by a sentencing judge.  However, this is not to say that such a sentence is
entitled to no deference whatsoever.  Provincial appellate courts deal with
appeals from sentence more frequently than this Court, which, as noted in Proulx,
supra,  at para. 2, rarely hears such appeals.  And while a court of
appeal is generally further removed from the community in which the offences
occurred than a sentencing judge, it will almost invariably be closer to the
community than this Court.

 

21                              
Therefore, I am of the opinion that sentencing decisions of courts of
appeal are entitled to some deference from this Court.  I hasten to add that
the degree of deference to be given appellate courts is an issue that will
arise only in exceptional cases, given that this Court rarely hears appeals
relating to sentences.

   

C.
Application of the Principles Set Out in Proulx to the Case at Hand

 








22                              
I would not interfere with the sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal. 
I say this despite the fact that the Court of Appeal seems to have adopted a
rigid two-step approach, in deviation from the approach set down in Proulx,
supra.  In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal carefully considered
the evidentiary record, noting that since the original sentencing, the
respondent’s previous sexual assault convictions had been quashed and he had
paid $10,000 to the complainant pursuant to a Manitoba Human Rights Board
settlement.  The court concluded that the safety of the community would not be
endangered by the respondent’s presence there, as the respondent was unlikely
to re-offend and his rehabilitation was not an issue.  It considered the application
of the principle of restraint in the use of incarceration and addressed the
relevant objectives of sentencing.  It found that the shame, the loss of
respect, the condemnation of his community which the respondent has brought
upon himself, together with the strict conditions to which he would be subject
pursuant to his sentence would sufficiently vindicate objectives such as
denunciation and deterrence.  The Court of Appeal acknowledged the demeaning
conduct of the respondent towards his employee, but decided that this did not
constitute an absolute bar to a conditional sentence in the circumstances.  It
imposed a nine-month sentence with stringent conditions such as house arrest,
community work and treatment for sexual offenders (to be chosen by the
respondent’s supervisor).  Although this sentence appears to be somewhat
lenient and, had I been the sentencing judge, I might have imposed a longer
conditional sentence or a term of incarceration, I am reluctant to substitute
my opinion for that of the Court of Appeal for the reasons set out at paras. 20
and 21.    

 

VI.   Disposition

 

23                              
Given the Court of Appeal’s careful analysis of the relevant sentencing
principles and review of the evidence, I do not feel that I can interfere.  I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

The judgment of L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, McLachlin, Major, Bastarache
and Binnie JJ. was delivered by

 

24                              
L’Heureux-Dubé J.
-- This appeal turns on whether the Court of Appeal erred in sentencing the
respondent, who was the complainant’s employer, to a global  nine-month
conditional sentence for one count of sexual assault and two counts of common
assault.  Specifically, the sentence comprised:  six months for the sexual
assault, and two months and one month for the respective counts of common
assault.  With respect, I find that the Court of Appeal erred in imposing the
six-month conditional sentence for the sexual assault.  In doing so, it
substituted a short conditional sentence for the one-year sentence of
incarceration imposed at trial.  Based on the sentencing principles set out in
the companion appeal of R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5, I
find that the Court of Appeal’s sentence was unfit in light of the gravity of the offences committed and
the respondent’s moral blameworthiness given his abuse of a position of
authority.








 

25                              
I adopt the statement of facts and the judgments below set out by
the Chief Justice and I agree with the law on the principles of sentencing as
set out in Proulx,
supra.  In addition, I recognize that the respondent was entitled to the
benefit of the new sentencing provisions enacted in Bill C-41 (now S.C. 1995,
c. 22) in light of the majority’s decision in R. v. Dunn, [1995] 1
S.C.R. 226.   

 

26                              
While the Court of Appeal was entitled to review the respondent’s
sentence, it ought to have recognized that the trial judge’s finding that the
fit and proper sentence for the sexual assault under the old provisions  –  one
year’s  incarceration plus three years’ probation –  was a relevant reflection
of the gravity of the acts in question and the need for denunciation and
general deterrence in this case.  (On the gravity of sexual assault as an
offence and its pervasiveness in Canadian society more generally, see: R. v.
Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 669; R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1
S.C.R. 330, at paras.
68 to 75, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.; on problems relating to sentencing in
sexual assault cases, see: P. Marshall, “Sexual Assault, the Charter and
Sentencing Reform” (1988), 63 C.R. (3d) 216.)  

 

27                              
The Court of Appeal substituted a six-month conditional sentence for the
one-year sentence of incarceration imposed at trial, thereby imposing a
significantly more lenient sentence (see Proulx, supra, at para.
44).  In my opinion, this showed a serious disregard for the need to give
significant weight to denunciation and deterrence in cases such as this one.

 








28                              
The court suggested that, in this case, these objectives could be
“effectively achieved if this prominent [respondent] is forced to live in his
own small community, conspicuously confined by strict limitations as to his
movement and his endeavours”  ((1997), 123 Man. R. (2d) 91, at p. 99). In my
opinion, while service of the sentence in the community and house arrest might
well achieve an appropriate measure of denunciation and deterrence in some
circumstances, it did not send a sufficiently strong message in this case. 

 

29                              
Schwartz J. recognized that there was little or no risk of
re-offence and that with the support of family and friends, the offender would
rehabilitate himself.  Nevertheless, the record also shows that the trial judge
was aware that many members of the respondent’s community supported him and
tended to deny that the respondent could have committed the offence of which he
was convicted.  Taking into account these factors, he emphasized that in light
of the gravity of the sexual assault and other assaults committed, the court
needed to send the message to the community that this type of conduct was
reprehensible and would not be tolerated.  In his view, this meant that the
objectives of denunciation and general deterrence were more important than the
objective of rehabilitation in this case.   In fact, he viewed the one-year sentence requested by the
Crown for the sexual assault conviction as being at the “low end of the scale”
and stated:

 

The Court, on behalf of the community,
denounces [conduct such as  sexual assault] in fixing the sentence.  The more
worthy of denunciation, the higher the sentence to show that the community will
not accept that type of conduct by its members. 

(Man. Q.B., C.R. 94-03-0028, June 6, 1996, at
p. 4 (transcript).)

 








30                              
The changes in the sentencing regime brought about by Bill C-41 entitled
the Court of Appeal to re-weigh the objectives of denunciation, deterrence and
rehabilitation in light of the new emphasis on restorative objectives.  They
also entitled the court to consider the possibility of imposing a conditional
sentence.  Although the Court of Appeal made no finding that the respondent
showed voluntary signs of remorse or acknowledged responsibility for his acts,
it did note that since the imposition of the original sentence, he had made a
payment of $10,000 to the complainant pursuant to a settlement of the
complainant’s proceedings before the Manitoba Human Rights Commission relating
to the same incidents.  This weighed in favour of restorative objectives and
therefore of a conditional sentence.  (See s.. 718(f) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and Proulx, supra, at para.
113.)  In my view, however, this factor was not so important as to outweigh the
need for a one-year sentence of incarceration in order to provide sufficient
denunciation and deterrence, as found by the trial judge.

 

31                              
I am mindful of the fact that the respondent’s prior convictions for
sexual assault in two separate cases had been quashed by the Court of Appeal
before it heard the appeal in this case.  This removed one of the aggravating
factors the trial judge weighed in his sentencing decision.  However, I note
that there were several other aggravating factors which remained, including: 
the abuse of a position of authority by an employer against his employee (see
s. 718.2 (a)(iii) of the Criminal Code ); the violent and demeaning
nature of the acts committed; the naïveté and vulnerability of the complainant;
and the harm done to her career and family life.  In my opinion, these
remaining aggravating factors were sufficient to militate against the short
conditional sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal.

 








32                              
The Court of Appeal erred in failing to take sufficient account
of the key
aggravating factor in this case: the offender’s abuse of his position of authority by
assaulting the complainant in the workplace. (For an appropriate recognition of
similar conduct as an aggravating factor, see:  R. v. Boudreau, [1996]
N.W.T.J. No. 107 (QL) (S.C.), at para. 18; for a general discussion of the
meaning of “position of authority” and “position of trust”, see: R. v. Audet,
[1996] 2 S.C.R. 171, at paras. 33-45; for recognition of the relationship of
power and authority between employer and employee in the context of sexual
harassment, see: Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252,
at p. 1281.)

  

33                              
In Proulx, supra, at para. 114, this Court stated: 

 

Where punitive objectives such as denunciation and
deterrence are particularly pressing, such as cases in which there are
aggravating circumstances, incarceration will generally be the preferable
sanction.  This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might
be achieved by a conditional sentence. 

 

The
respondent’s abuse of his position of authority, combined with the demeaning
and violent nature of the assaults, make the punitive objectives of
denunciation and deterrence particularly pressing in this case.  The Court of
Appeal therefore erred in imposing a short conditional sentence, where a 
sentence of incarceration was the preferable sanction. 

 

34                              
For these reasons, I find that a six-month conditional sentence for the
sexual assault was unfit in the circumstances of this case.  As was the case in
R. v. R.N.S., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149, 2000 SCC 7, the Crown conceded in
oral argument that it was not seeking further punishment now that the
respondent has served his conditional sentence in full.  Thus, I do not have to
decide whether a longer conditional sentence with more stringent conditions
might also have satisfied the new sentencing principles, as this would have no
practical effect for this respondent.  With respect to the common assaults, the
Crown conceded on appeal that the fines imposed at trial were not appropriate. 
I would therefore defer to the Court of Appeal’s finding that conditional
sentences of two months and one month respectively were appropriate for the
common assaults. 

 








35                              
I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the six-month conditional
sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal for the sexual assault, and restore the
one-year sentence of incarceration imposed by Schwartz J. for this offence, to
be followed by a three-month conditional sentence for the common assaults and
three years’ probation imposed by the trial judge for the sexual assault.  I
would nevertheless stay the service of the sentences in this case, based on the
Crown’s concessions in oral argument before this Court.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 








Criminal law – Sentencing – Conditional sentences – Accused
convicted of sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching – Whether Court
of Appeal erred in substituting conditional sentence for jail term imposed by
trial judge – Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 742.1 .

 

The accused was convicted of sexual assault and
invitation to sexual touching in relation to incidents with his
step-granddaughter.  The offences were committed between 1990 and 1994 and, at
the time, the victim was between 5 and 8 and the accused was between 46 and 50
years old.  The trial judge sentenced the accused to nine months’
imprisonment.  The conditional sentencing regime came into force after the
accused was sentenced.  The Court of Appeal allowed the accused’s sentence
appeal and substituted a nine-month conditional sentence.

 

Held:  The
appeal should be allowed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Iacobucci, Major and Binnie JJ.:  For the reasons outlined in R. v. R.A.R.,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 163, 2000 SCC 8, the accused was entitled to the benefit of the
conditional sentencing regime on appeal, and the Court of Appeal could
re-sentence him.  Notwithstanding the deference to which sentencing decisions
by a court of appeal are entitled, this Court should intervene in this case and
restore the trial judge’s original sentence.  A nine-month conditional sentence
was not a fit sentence, in light of the gravity of the offences committed and
the high moral blameworthiness of the accused.  Despite the fact that the
accused’s liberty was restricted by the conditions imposed, the amount of
denunciation provided by a nine-month conditional sentence was clearly
insufficient in the circumstances to signify society’s abhorrence for the acts
the accused committed.  By imposing a conditional sentence of only nine months,
the Court of Appeal transformed what was already a lenient sentence into an
unfit sentence.  A nine-month sentence of incarceration would have been
appropriate in this case.  Since the accused has served his conditional
sentence in its entirety and the Crown does not seek any further punishment,
the nine-month term of incarceration should be stayed.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier, McLachlin and Bastarache JJ.:  There is agreement with the reasons of
the Chief Justice with the exception of his comments regarding the disposition
of the appeal in R. v. L.F.W., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, 2000 SCC 6, in view
of the dissent in that case.

1                                  
The Chief Justice  –  This
is a Crown appeal from a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
substituting a conditional sentence for the jail term imposed by the sentencing
judge. This case was heard together with the appeals in R. v. Proulx,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5; R. v. L.F.W., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, 2000
SCC 6;  R. v. R.A.R., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 163,  2000 SCC 8,  and R. v.
Bunn, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 183, 2000 SCC 9.  At issue in all of these appeals
are the principles governing the pronouncement of conditional sentences in the
new legislative scheme.  These reasons are concerned primarily with the
application of the principles set out in Proulx.  As in R.A.R.,
this case raises the additional question of the consequences of changes in the
law between the pronouncement of the sentence by the trial judge and the
hearing of the appeal.   

  

I.  Factual
Background

 








2                                  
The respondent was convicted of sexual assault and invitation to sexual
touching in relation to incidents with his step-granddaughter which occurred between
October 1990 and September 1994.  At the time of the offences, the complainant
was between 5 and 8 years old, and the respondent was between the ages of 46
and 50.  The evidence on the sexual assault count was that the respondent
fondled the complainant’s vagina on a number of occasions.  On none of the
occasions was there any vaginal penetration.  The evidence on the incidents
comprising the invitation to sexual touching count was that the complainant was
offered $5 or some such sum to touch the accused’s penis, that she accepted the
offer and was paid the money.  The touching incidents occurred two or three
times.  A charge of sexual interference was conditionally stayed pursuant to
the principles discussed by this Court in R. v.  Kienapple, [1975] 1
S.C.R. 729.  

 

3                                  
At the time of sentencing, the respondent lived with his wife.  Both his
wife and his two step-sons remained supportive of the respondent throughout the
proceedings against him and following his conviction, while the complainant and
her mother were ostracized by the family.  The respondent was in poor health,
suffering from heart problems and hypertension, as well as agitation as a
result of the proceedings against him.  He had no prior criminal record, and
had good letters of reference from members of his community.  He maintained his
innocence after his convictions, and expressed no remorse.

 

4                               
On July 31, 1996, the respondent was sentenced to nine months’
imprisonment.  The conditional sentencing regime came into force in September
1996.  The respondent appealed his convictions and sentence.  The conviction
appeal was dismissed.  The sentence appeal was heard on October 6, 1997, and
the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a nine-month conditional
sentence.

 

5                               
The respondent completed his conditional sentence on September 12,
1998,  and is bound by a probation order until September 12, 2000.    

 

II.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

6                               
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 








718.  The fundamental purpose of sentencing
is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the
law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a)  to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b)  to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

 

(c)        to separate offenders from
society, where necessary;

 

(d)  to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

 

(e)  to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 

(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall
also take into consideration the following principles:

 

(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any
relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the
offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

 

(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate
based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age,
mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor,

 

(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the
offender’s spouse or child,

 

(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a
position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or

 

(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the
direction of or in association with a criminal organization

 

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

 

(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

 

(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined
sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;

 

(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less
restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and








(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offender

 

 

742.1 Where a person is convicted of an
offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment, and the court

 

(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,
and

 

(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community
would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to
718.2,

 

the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour
in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,
subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional
sentence order made under section 742.3.

 

III. Judgments
Below

 

A.  Provincial
Court of British Columbia (Reasons for sentence)

 

7                                  
The respondent was sentenced on July 31, 1996.  At the time of
sentencing, the amendments to Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  (An Act
to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other Acts in consequence thereof,
S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill C-41”)), were not yet in force.  Accordingly, MacArthur
Prov. Ct. J., the trial judge,  did not have the option of imposing a
conditional sentence.

 

8                                  
MacArthur Prov. Ct. J. outlined the principles of sentencing.  He stated
that the fundamental principle was the protection of the public and that
special concern had to be given to the objective of general deterrence in cases
of sexual interference with a child.  He added that the Supreme Court of Canada
had reinforced the notion that denunciation  had its place in the criminal
sentencing process.  Finally, he said he also had to take into consideration
the rehabilitation of the offender.    








 

9                                  
MacArthur Prov. Ct. J. decided that a term of incarceration was
necessary, in light of the clearly abhorrent and reprehensible conduct that had
occurred.  The judge conceded that the actions of the respondent were somewhat
limited, but found that they were still extremely harmful to such a young
child, particularly considering that the child was in a trust relationship with
the respondent.  He agreed with the submission of the Crown that a term between
18 months and two years might be warranted.  However, taking into consideration
the respondent’s poor health at the time of sentencing, that he had withdrawn
from socializing, experienced difficulties in his marriage since the charges
had been laid and that he had no prior criminal record, MacArthur Prov. Ct. J.
sentenced him to nine months’ imprisonment on each count, to be served
concurrently.  MacArthur Prov. Ct. J. recommended that the respondent be
incarcerated in the institution of Stave Lake, so as to allow him to take part
in a treatment program for sexual offenders.  Finally, MacArthur Prov. Ct. J.
ordered that the term of incarceration be followed by probation for a period of
two years.

 

B.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1997), 100 B.C.A.C. 120

 

10                              
Bill C-41 came into force in September 1996.  The respondent’s
convictions were upheld by the Court of Appeal on September 29, 1997.  On
December 12, 1997, the Court of Appeal allowed the sentence appeal and
substituted a nine-month conditional sentence for the term of incarceration
imposed by MacArthur Prov. Ct. J. 

 








11                              
Lambert J.A. held that the new conditional sentencing provisions were
applicable to this appeal, pursuant to s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , and this Court’s decision in R. v. Dunn,
[1995] 1 S.C.R. 226.  Lambert J.A. then considered whether the respondent
should receive a conditional sentence.  He explained that he was not bound by
the deferential standard usually applied by appellate courts in reviewing the
sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, in light of the changes in the law
since the original sentencing.  He found that this case should be treated like
one in which a trial judge had erred in principle by failing to consider the
new Part XXIII of the Criminal Code , and that the Court of Appeal could
proceed as if it were sentencing the respondent for the first time. 

 

12                              
After summarizing the principles laid down by the British Columbia Court
of Appeal in R. v. Ursel (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 289, Lambert J.A.
concluded that a conditional sentence may fulfill the sentencing objectives of
general deterrence, specific deterrence and denunciation as well as or better
than a sentence of incarceration, particularly if the conditions that are made
part of the sentence are appropriate for the fulfilment of these sentencing
objectives.

 

13                              
Turning to the case at hand, Lambert J.A. noted that the offences for
which the respondent was convicted did not require a minimum term of
imprisonment.  In reviewing the requirement of s. 742.1 (a), Lambert J.A.
concluded that the sentence ought to be less than two years, and he gave
considerable weight to the sentence of nine months imposed by the trial judge. 
He was satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger
its safety.   In spite of the aggravating factor of breach of trust, Lambert
J.A. felt that the respondent’s previously clean record, his poor health, the
fact that he was self-employed and that his business would suffer greatly if he
were incarcerated, the tensions in his marriage and social stigma he suffered,
combined with the minimal risk of re-offence suggested that this was a proper
case for a conditional sentence.  

 








14                              
Lambert J.A. allowed the sentence appeal, and substituted a nine-month
conditional sentence.  The conditions imposed were that the respondent attend
counselling as directed by his supervisor, including counselling for sexual
offenders; that he have no contact or communication with the complainant and
her mother; that he not be alone with any female child under the age of 14
(except when in the company of a responsible adult); and, finally, that he be
confined to his house subject to limited exceptions.  Lambert J.A. did not
modify the probation order imposed by the judge, stating that it would run from
the completion of the conditional sentence.

 

IV.  Issue

 

15                              
At issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal erred in
substituting a conditional sentence for the jail term imposed by the trial
judge.

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Benefit
of the Conditional Sentencing Regime on Appeal

 

16                              
For the reasons I outlined in R.A.R., supra, at paras.
14-16, the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the conditional sentencing
regime on appeal, as he received a sentence of less than two years’
imprisonment at trial.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal could re-sentence the
respondent. 

 

B. 
Application of the Principles Set Out in Proulx to the Case at Hand 

 

17                              
As I explained in R.A.R., supra, at paras. 17-21,
sentencing decisions by appellate courts are entitled to some deference from
this Court.  Notwithstanding this deference, I believe our intervention is
justified in this case.   

 








18                              
With respect, I do not think that a nine-month conditional sentence was
a fit sentence, in light of the relevant sentencing considerations, including
the gravity of the offences committed and the high moral blameworthiness of the
respondent.  The impugned acts occurred repeatedly over a period of
approximately five years.  The respondent abused the trust of a very young
child, despite clear indications from the complainant that she did not like
what he was doing.  He remained unrepentant and continued to deny that the
offences took place.  The amount of denunciation provided by a nine-month
conditional sentence was clearly insufficient in the circumstances to signify
society’s abhorrence for the acts the respondent committed, despite the fact
that his liberty was restricted by the conditions imposed.  It must be
remembered that, even though the respondent experienced some marital
difficulties, he still benefited from the support of his family, while the
victim and her mother were ostracized by the rest of the family.   

 

19                              
In conducting its re-sentencing, the Court of Appeal should have
recognized that the relatively lenient nine-month term imposed by MacArthur
Prov. Ct. J.  was the result of his taking into account the precarious health
of the respondent at the time of sentencing, his marital difficulties and the
social stigma he had already suffered, as the sentencing judge would have been
inclined to agree with the Crown’s submission that a term of incarceration in
the range of 18 to 24 months was warranted.  By imposing a conditional sentence
of only nine months, the Court of Appeal transformed what was already a lenient
sentence into an unfit sentence.  I would add that the Court of Appeal was not
obligated to impose a conditional sentence of equivalent duration to the term
of incarceration imposed by the trial judge: see Proulx, supra,
at para. 104.  

 








20                              
The errors committed by the Court of Appeal entitle this Court to
intervene.  The Crown is seeking a restoration of the trial judge’s original
sentence of nine months’ incarceration.  I agree with the Crown that a
nine-month sentence of incarceration would have been appropriate in this case. 
That said, a lengthy conditional sentence with restrictive conditions might
also have been appropriate.  

 

21                              
In circumstances where either a sentence of incarceration or a
conditional sentence would be appropriate, a conditional sentence should
generally be imposed.  This follows from s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal
Code , which provides that all available sanctions other than imprisonment
that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all
offenders.  I would note, however, that there may be circumstances in which a
short, sharp sentence of incarceration may be preferable to a lengthy
conditional sentence.  

 

22                              
I need not decide whether this is such a case.  The respondent has
served his conditional sentence in its entirety, having completed it in
September 1998.  Further, in oral argument the Crown stated that even if it
were successful it would not seek any further punishment.  Thus, whether this
Court imposes a sentence of incarceration or a conditional sentence will make
no practical difference to the respondent.  Accordingly, I am content to grant
the order requested by the Crown.  I would allow the appeal, restore the
nine-month sentence of incarceration imposed by the trial judge, and stay the
service of the sentence.

 








23                              
Although this conclusion seems to differ from the result I have reached
in L.F.W., supra, the present appeal can be distinguished from L.F.W.
in three respects.  First, in L.F.W., the conditional sentence
imposed was considerably longer than the nine-month conditional sentence
imposed by the Court of Appeal in this case.  Had the Court of Appeal imposed a
significantly longer conditional sentence, I would not have interfered, given
the deference to which sentencing decisions by appellate courts are entitled. 
Second, in L.F.W., the offender was arguably rehabilitated, as
demonstrated by the 25-year period that had elapsed without any further
criminal activity.  Finally, in L.F.W., the conditional sentence imposed
by the trial judge (and confirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal) was
entitled to considerable deference, according to the standard enunciated in R.
v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90, and Proulx, supra,
at paras. 123-26.  The Court of Appeal’s sentence in this case, although
entitled to some deference, is not entitled to the same level of deference
accorded to sentences imposed by trial judges.  I would add that in L.F.W.,
I might well have imposed a term of incarceration were it not for the deference
I was bound to give to the sentence imposed by the trial judge (at para. 25).

 

VI.   Disposition

 

24                              
I would allow the appeal, restore the nine-month sentence of
incarceration imposed by the trial judge, and stay the service of this
sentence, given the fact that the respondent has already served his conditional
sentence in its entirety and the Crown is not seeking any further punishment. 
The probation order should remain in force.

on appeal from the court of appeal for newfoundland

 








Criminal law – Sentencing – Conditional sentences –
Accused convicted of indecent assault and gross indecency and receiving
21-month conditional sentence –  Whether Court of Appeal erred in affirming
trial judge’s decision to impose conditional sentence – Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , s. 742.1 .

 

The accused was convicted of one count of indecent
assault and one count of gross indecency.  The offences were committed between
1967 and 1973 and, at the time, the victim was between 6 and 12 and the accused
was between 22 and 28 years old.  The trial judge sentenced the accused to a
21-month conditional sentence.  The Crown appealed, seeking a 21-month term of
incarceration.  A majority of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal dismissed the
appeal.

 

Held on equal division
(L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, McLachlin and Bastarache JJ. dissenting):  The
appeal should be dismissed. 

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Iacobucci, Major and Binnie JJ.:  In R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61,
2000 SCC 5, this Court set out the principles governing the conditional
sentencing regime of the Criminal Code .  The sentence imposed by a trial
judge is entitled to considerable deference from appellate courts.  In the
present case, although the accused committed very serious offences, the
conditional sentence imposed by the trial judge was nevertheless within the
acceptable range of sentences that could have been imposed in the
circumstances.  The trial judge’s reasons were very thorough, taking into
consideration all relevant sentencing principles, including denunciation and
deterrence.  A conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and
deterrence, particularly when onerous conditions are imposed.  The trial judge
was well positioned to assess the degree of denunciation and deterrence
required in the circumstances and that would be provided by the conditional
sentence he imposed.  He also imposed conditions capable of achieving
restorative objectives.  Where a combination of both punitive and restorative
objectives may be achieved, a conditional sentence will likely be more
appropriate than incarceration.  Since the trial judge committed no reversible
error in principle and thoroughly considered all appropriate factors, there is
no reason to disturb the sentence.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier, McLachlin and Bastarache JJ.  (dissenting):  There is disagreement
with the majority’s application of the principles of sentencing as set out in R.
v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5, to the facts at hand.  In this
case, a conditional sentence of 21 months was a demonstrably unfit sentence. 
In deciding that a conditional sentence was appropriate, the trial judge
overemphasized restorative objectives, while giving inordinately little weight
to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence.  The principle of
denunciation weighs particularly heavily in cases of offences perpetrated
against children by adults in positions of trust and authority.  The trial
judge did not give sufficient weight to the moral blameworthiness of the
offender in disregard of the proportionality principle.  Even taking into
account the deference owed to trial judges’ discretion in sentencing, the
conditional sentence should not stand.  The passing of the sentence of
incarceration should, however, be stayed as the offender has now served his
21-month conditional sentence in full.

delivered by

 

1                                  
The Chief Justice -- This
is a Crown appeal from a decision of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal affirming
the respondent’s conditional sentence.  This case was heard together with the
appeals in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61,  2000 SCC 5; R. v.
R.N.S., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149, 2000 SCC 7;  R. v. R.A.R., [2000] 1
S.C.R. 163, 2000 SCC 8, and R. v. Bunn, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 183, 2000 SCC 9. 
In disposing of this appeal I will apply the general principles governing the
conditional sentencing regime set out in Proulx to the facts of this
case.

 

I.  Factual
Background

 

2                                  
The respondent was convicted of one count of indecent assault and one
count of gross indecency.  The offences were committed on the respondent’s
first cousin and next-door neighbour M.W. between October 1967 and July 1973 in
the rural community of Bay de Verde, Newfoundland.  At the time, M.W. was
between 6 and 12 years old while the respondent was between 22 and 28 years
old.  There were 10 to 12 incidents, involving forced masturbation and
fellatio.  Most of the incidents occurred in a locked shed next to their
homes.  The complainant was warned not to tell anyone about what transpired,
particularly her parents.  The respondent told M.W. that he had a gun, leading
her to believe that her family would be endangered if she told anyone about the
events.

 








3                                  
In her victim impact statement the complainant described the consequences
of the abuse she suffered.  Her childhood and adolescent years were marred by
feelings of shame, isolation, and low self-esteem.  These feelings stood in the
way of her confiding in her family and thereby accentuated her stress.  She
also experienced difficulties in her marriage, finding it difficult to be
sexually intimate with her husband.  The birth of her son intensified her
feelings of fear, confusion, and pain, as she found it difficult to change his
diapers and toilet train him.  In 1995, with her husband’s support, she
contacted the RCMP.  The indictment was filed over 20 years after the offences
were committed.

 

4                                  
The respondent, a widower, had four children and has resided in Bay de Verde
his whole life, except for three years spent in the armed forces.   He had no
criminal record and a good work record.  He was close to and had the support of
his four children, whom he had provided for throughout their lives.  Letters
from the mayor of Bay de Verde, a former postmaster and parish priest entered
by consent at the sentencing hearing attested to his good character and
reputation in the community.  The respondent acknowledged a problem with
alcohol in the past, around the time the offences were committed, but had
abstained from drinking for approximately 20 years.

  

5                                  
The respondent was sentenced to a 21-month conditional sentence.  The
Crown appealed, seeking a 21-month term of incarceration.  A majority of the
Newfoundland Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.  Cameron J.A. dissenting,
would have ordered the respondent to serve the remainder of his sentence in
prison.  The Crown sought leave to appeal to this Court.

 

II. Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 








6                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

718.  The fundamental purpose of sentencing
is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the
law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b)  to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

 

(c)  to separate offenders from society, where necessary;

 

(d)  to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

 

(e)  to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 

(f)  to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall
also take into consideration the following principles:

 

(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any
relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the
offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

 

(i)  evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate
based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age,
mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,

 

(ii)  evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the
offender’s spouse or child,

 

(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused                             a
position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or

 

(iv)  evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at
the direction of or in association with a criminal organization

 

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

 

(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

 








(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined
sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;

 

(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less
restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and

 

(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

 

742.1 Where a person is convicted of an
offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment, and the court

 

(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,
and

 

(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community
would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to
718.2,

 

the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour
in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,
subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional
sentence order made under section 742.3.

 

III.   Judgments
Below

 

A. Supreme
Court of Newfoundland, Trial Division (1996), 146 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 298 

 

7                                  
In his reasons for sentence, Mercer J. reviewed the various aggravating
and mitigating circumstances in the case.  Aggravating factors were the
victim’s age, the fact that the crimes were repeated, the harmful impact on the
victim, and the abuse of a relationship of familial trust.  Mitigating factors
were the absence of further criminal conduct and the respondent’s good
reputation in the community.  He agreed with counsel that the appropriate
length of sentence was between 18 and 24 months, and concluded that a sentence
of 21 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

 








8                                  
Mercer J. then considered whether a conditional sentence should
be imposed.  He was satisfied by the evidence at trial, the
information contained in a pre-sentence report, and various letters of
reference that there was no appreciable risk of criminal conduct by the
offender if he served his sentence in the community.  Over a quarter of a
century had passed since the offences occurred without any related criminal
activity by the respondent, who had led a productive life.  Incarceration was,
therefore, not needed for specific deterrence of the offender despite the
absence of expressed remorse. 

 

9                                  
In determining whether to exercise the discretion to impose a
conditional sentence, the trial judge also considered the principles of
denunciation and general deterrence.  In that regard, he stated that the stigma
of trial and conviction should not be minimized, and that a conditional
sentence may indeed serve the purposes of denunciation and general deterrence
if meaningful conditions are imposed and enforced.  He also found that a
community service order was appropriate in this case.  The respondent was
proficient in construction and had previously performed valuable volunteer work
in the community utilizing that skill.  

 

10                              
Accordingly, he ordered the respondent to serve a sentence of 21 months’
imprisonment, to be served in the community.  Aside from the mandatory
statutory conditions imposed pursuant to s. 742.3(1)  of the Criminal Code ,
Mercer J. ordered that the respondent (1) abstain from the consumption of
alcohol or drugs, (2) attend sex-offender counselling if required by his
supervisor, (3) not associate with M.W. or her immediate family except at their
request, (4) perform up to 150 hours of community service if so directed by his
supervisor, and (5) remain under house arrest subject to specified exceptions.

 

B. Newfoundland
Court of Appeal (1997), 155 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 115 








(1) Marshall J.A. for the majority

 

11                              
Marshall J.A. (Green J.A. concurring) began by reviewing the
principles governing the conditional sentencing regime.  He then turned to consider the Crown’s argument that sexual offences against children
merit incarceration except in the rarest and most exceptional cases.  He found
that the Crown’s argument failed on three fronts.  In the first place, the
argument assumed that deterrence and denunciation could not be achieved through
a conditional sentence, and reflected the traditional mind set that those objectives
could only be achieved through incarceration in a jail.  That was not a tenable
position, in his view.  As the trial judge observed, the denunciatory and
general deterrent effect of a conditional sentence ought not to be
underestimated.  Not only may the offender’s freedom be severely limited, but
his continued presence in the community, detained at home and bearing the
stigma of conviction, is calculated to serve as a daily deterrent to any
like-minded person and to have real denunciatory consequences.  These effects
may perhaps be considered all the more pronounced in the rural setting from
which the respondent came.  

 

12                              
The second weakness in the Crown’s argument was that it presupposed that
nothing had really changed in the sentencing process.  Marshall J.A. said that
it was a mistake to depict the new provisions as making no changes.  Part XXIII
now contains the new option of conditional sentencing that was not part of the
process before.  While the stance that deterrence and denunciation are prime
considerations in child sexual abuse cases is still operative, the option of
serving sentences in the community under strict conditions is now available in
certain circumstances to give effect to those ends.  








13                              
Finally, the Crown’s position was flawed insofar as it attempted to set
up certain categories of offences whose gravity is such that they will never,
or rarely ever, be punishable by a conditional sentence notwithstanding the
length of imprisonment imposed.  As the trial judge underscored, however, this
is a restriction that Parliament chose not to impose.  Marshall J.A. found that
it was neither within the province of the courts to exempt certain categories
of offences from the new conditional sentencing option, nor to impose more rigorous
standards for its application to them, on grounds that the gravity of a given
crime accentuates the imperatives of deterrence and denunciation to such a
level that only incarceration in a penal institution will adequately address
them.  The role of the courts, as directed by the legislation, was rather to
examine the specific circumstances of each offence and offender, while
screening them through the requirement that a conditional sentence be
consistent with the principles of sentencing to determine if service of the
sentence in the community can, nevertheless, be justified. 

 

14                              
Marshall J.A. found that appellate courts should not intervene to vary a
sentence unless the sentence was clearly unreasonable.  The gist of the Crown’s
challenge was that the trial judge did not place sufficient weight on the
principles of denunciation and deterrence.  In this case, the trial judge
exercised his discretion to impose a conditional sentence after a full and
careful consideration of all factors and principles, including deterrence and
denunciation.  Accordingly, there was no reason to vary the original sentence,
and Marshall J.A. dismissed the appeal.

 

(2) Cameron J.A. (dissenting)

 








15                              
Cameron J.A. began by reviewing the conditional sentencing provisions,
and was in basic agreement with the majority’s approach to their
interpretation.  She noted that Parliament did not exclude any offences from
the conditional sentencing regime except those with a minimum term of
imprisonment.  However, she found that the circumstances of a particular
offence or offender may make conditional sentences inappropriate, and certain
classes of offences are more likely to result in the circumstances which make
conditional sentences inappropriate.

 

16                              
In analysing the circumstances of this particular case, Cameron J.A.
accepted that the safety of the community was not a concern, and that the
factors of rehabilitation and specific deterrence did not require that the
respondent serve his time in a prison.  The real issue, as she saw it, was
whether retribution, denunciation and general deterrence could be adequately
served by a conditional sentence with meaningful conditions.

 

17                              
Cameron J.A. noted that the sexual assault of children is abhorrent to
Canadian society and that society’s condemnation of such offences must be
communicated in the clearest of terms since they involve a very high level of
moral blameworthiness.  She disagreed with the trial judge’s finding that house
arrest under a conditional sentence of imprisonment in this case could satisfy
the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence, and properly address the
offender’s moral blameworthiness.  Cameron J.A. stated that the sentence
imposed by the trial judge was “so inadequate that it demands action by the
Court of Appeal” (p. 148).  She referred specifically to the fact that the
offence involved several incidents, a locked shed, a warning to be silent, a
child victim, and an offender who was an older relative and a neighbour.  The
nature of the crimes demanded the limitation on the liberty of the offender
provided by service of the term in an institution.  She would have allowed the
appeal in part, confirming the term of 21 months’ imprisonment but requiring
that the balance of the sentence be served in prison.

 

IV.   Issue

 








18                              
Since this Court has set out the principles governing the conditional
sentencing regime in Proulx, supra, the sole issue in this appeal
is whether the Newfoundland Court of Appeal erred in affirming the trial judge’s
decision to impose a conditional sentence in this case.

 

V.  Analysis

 

19                              
In Proulx, supra, at para. 123, this Court reiterated that
the sentence imposed by a trial judge is entitled to considerable deference
from appellate courts.  The Court reaffirmed its holding in R. v. M. (C.A.),
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90, that 

 

absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or
an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only
intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably
unfit.

 

 

The majority
of the Court of Appeal, in applying this deferential standard of review,
concluded that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was not demonstrably
unfit and should therefore not be disturbed.  

 

20                              
I agree.  Although the respondent committed terrible offences and did
not express any remorse, the conditional sentence imposed by the trial judge
was nevertheless within the acceptable range of sentences that could have been
imposed in the circumstances.  I would add that in Proulx, this Court
held, at para. 79, that a conditional sentence is available for all offences
with no minimum sentence of imprisonment.  Gross indecency and indecent assault
carry no minimum term.

 








21                              
Mercer J.’s reasons were very thorough, taking into consideration all
relevant sentencing principles, including denunciation and deterrence.  As this
Court held in Proulx, supra, at paras. 102 and 107, a conditional
sentence can provide significant denunciation and deterrence, particularly when
onerous conditions are imposed.  In this case the respondent received a
21-month conditional sentence which included a condition of house arrest. 
Commenting on the severity of this sentence, the majority of the Court of
Appeal held, at p. 134:

 

It is no mean punishment for a person of previously unblemished
reputation to bear the stigma of being confined to virtual house arrest,
subject to restricted conditions of circulation within a community for a
serious crime committed in his early adult years, all to the general knowledge
of others in that community.  Neither may it be counted inconsequential for
such a person to daily bear the shame of his guilt for that crime and of his
loss of esteem before his fellow residents during his restricted ventures from
his home.

 

22                              
I would also note that the sentencing judge had the opportunity to
observe the respondent and the victim at trial, and was presumably familiar
with the conditions in the rural community of Bay de Verde, Newfoundland. 
Accordingly, he was well positioned to assess the degree of denunciation and
deterrence required in the circumstances and that would be provided by the
conditional sentence he imposed.  His finding should not be interfered with
lightly.

 

23                              
Moreover, Mercer J. imposed conditions capable of achieving restorative
objectives.  Two of the conditions were that the respondent attend sex offender
counselling and perform up to 150 hours community service if so directed by his
supervisor.  Despite the respondent’s lack of remorse, he agreed to comply with
any order the court imposed.  Mercer J. also noted the respondent’s proficiency
in construction and previous volunteer work using this skill.  In Proulx,
supra, at para. 113, the Court held that “[w]here a combination of both
punitive and restorative objectives may be achieved, a conditional sentence
will likely be more appropriate than incarceration”.   








 

24                              
While there are aggravating circumstances in this case, in Proulx,
supra, the Court stated “that a conditional sentence may be imposed even
in circumstances where there are aggravating circumstances relating to the
offence or the offender” (para. 115).  Mercer J. also pointed out an important
mitigating factor, namely, that over a quarter of a century had passed since
the offences occurred without any related criminal activity, and that the
respondent had led a productive life.

 

25                              
I note that Cameron J.A. dissented on the ground that the sentencing
judge did not give the principles of denunciation and deterrence sufficient
weight, and that a sentence of incarceration was necessary in the
circumstances.  Were I a trial judge, I might well have agreed with Cameron
J.A. and imposed a sentence of incarceration.  That said, as an appellate
judge, deference must be given to the trial judge’s decision.  Mercer J. did
not commit a reversible error in principle and thoroughly considered all
appropriate factors.  Nor was the sentence demonstrably unfit.  Counsel for
both parties agreed that the appropriate range of sentence was a term of
imprisonment of 18 to 24 months.  A 21-month conditional sentence with
restrictive conditions, to be served in the small rural community in which the
respondent resided for offences which occurred over 25 years ago, when viewed
in light of the fact that the respondent has since led a productive life
without further criminal activity is not “clearly unreasonable”: see R. v.
Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 46.  Therefore, despite the fact
that I might have imposed a sentence of incarceration, the sentence should not
be disturbed.

 

VI.  Disposition


 

26                              
For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

 








The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, McLachlin and
Bastarache JJ. were delivered by

 

27                           
L’Heureux-Dubé J. (dissenting)
-- The issue in this appeal is whether a conditional sentence of 21 months was
a demonstrably unfit sentence in the case of a conviction on one count of
indecent assault and one count of gross indecency for multiple incidents
involving an adult male who forced fellatio and masturbation on a female child,
his cousin, over a period of 5 to 6 years.

 

28                           
While I agree with the law on the principles of sentencing as set out by
the Chief Justice in the companion appeal of R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5, I am unable to agree with the majority’s application of
the law to the facts at hand.  For the reasons given by Cameron J.A. in dissent
in the Newfoundland Court of Appeal in this case ((1997), 155 Nfld. &
P.E.I.R. 115), I would allow the appeal on the basis that in deciding that a
conditional sentence was appropriate, the trial judge overemphasized
restorative objectives, while giving inordinately little weight to the
principles of denunciation and general deterrence.  

 








29                           
      Courts have tended, even under the new sentencing principles
adopted in Bill C-41 (now S.C. 1995, c. 22), to find that the principle of
denunciation weighs particularly heavily in cases of offences perpetrated
against children by adults in positions of trust and authority.  See: R. v.
Oliver (1997), 99 O.A.C. 234;  R. v. Alfred (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d)

While the trial judge stated that he considered principles of deterrence and
denunciation in determining the sentence, in my view, the decision to impose a
conditional sentence in this case indicates a serious failure to give
appropriate weight to the objective of denunciation. 

 

30                           
I also agree with Cameron J.A. that the trial judge did not give
sufficient weight to the moral blameworthiness of the offender, who engaged in
offensive and demeaning behaviour with a young person over whom he had
significant power as an older relative and neighbour, and who indicated no
remorse even upon conviction for the offences.  This offends the
proportionality principle set out in s. 718.1  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which establishes the fundamental principle that the
court must impose a sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence and
the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

31                           
Recognizing that there is no presumption in favour of incarceration for
certain types of offences, I adopt the following comments of Cameron J.A., at
p. 148:

 

. . . I do start from the premise that sexual assault of a child is a
crime that is abhorrent to Canadian society and society’s condemnation of those
who commit such offences must be communicated in the clearest of terms.  As to
moral blameworthiness, the use of a vulnerable child for the sexual
gratification of an adult cannot be viewed as anything but a crime
demonstrating the worst of intentions.  The trial judge obviously concluded
that “house arrest” with certain liberties would be sufficient to communicate
society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct in the case.  With the
greatest respect for the opinion of the trial judge, I do not accept that the
objectives of sentencing can be met in this case by a conditional sentence and,
in my view, the sentence imposed is so inadequate that it demands action by the
Court of Appeal.  

 

 








32                           
I therefore find that Cameron J.A. was correct to hold that the
conditional sentence imposed by the trial judge should not stand, even taking
into account the deference owed to trial judges’ discretion in sentencing. 
Cameron J.A. would have allowed the appeal and sentenced the offender to
incarceration for the remainder of his 21-month sentence which, at the time of
the appeal, was approximately 12 months.  While I find that this would have
fallen within the range of appropriate sentences in factual circumstances such
as these, I recognize that the offender has now served his 21-month conditional
sentence in full.  It is therefore impossible to restore Cameron J.A.’s
sentence on the terms she specified.  I recognize that it would also be very
difficult for a trial judge to whom the case was now remanded to determine an
appropriate equivalent.  Thus, I would allow the appeal but stay the passing of
the sentence of incarceration.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

 








Criminal law – Sentencing – Conditional sentences –
Accused pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing death and dangerous
driving causing bodily harm and receiving sentence of 18 months of
incarceration – Whether Court of Appeal erred in substituting conditional
custodial sentence for jail term – Proper interpretation and application of
conditional sentencing regime – Distinction between conditional sentence of
imprisonment and suspended sentence with probation – Meaning of “safety of the
community” – Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 742.1 , 742.3 .

 

After a night of partying involving consumption of
some alcohol, the accused decided to drive his friends home even though he knew
that his vehicle was not mechanically sound.  For a period of 10 to 20 minutes,
the accused, who had only seven weeks of experience as a licensed driver, drove
erratically, weaving in and out of traffic, tailgating and trying to pass other
vehicles without signalling, despite steady oncoming traffic and slippery
roads.  As the accused was trying to pass another vehicle, he drove his car
into an oncoming lane of traffic, side-swiped a first car and crashed into a
second one.  The driver of that second vehicle was seriously injured.  The
accident also claimed the life of a passenger in the accused’s car.  The
accused was in a near-death coma for some time, but ultimately recovered from
his injuries.  The accused entered guilty pleas to one count of dangerous
driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. 
He was sentenced to 18 months of incarceration, to be served concurrently on
both charges.  The sentencing judge concluded that a conditional sentence
pursuant to s. 742.1  of the Criminal Code , which would allow the accused
to serve his sentence in the community, would not be appropriate because it
would be inconsistent with the objectives of denunciation and general
deterrence.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a
conditional custodial sentence for the jail term.

 








Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

The 1996 sentencing reforms (“Bill C-41"")
substantially reformed Part XXIII of the Code, and introduced, inter
alia, an express statement of the purposes and principles of sentencing,
provisions for alternative measures for adult offenders and a new type of
sanction, the conditional sentence of imprisonment.  Bill C-41 in general and
the conditional sentence in particular were enacted both to reduce reliance on
incarceration as a sanction and to increase the use of principles of
restorative justice in sentencing.  

 

A conditional sentence should be distinguished from
probationary measures.  Probation is primarily a rehabilitative sentencing
tool.  By contrast, Parliament intended conditional sentences to include both
punitive and rehabilitative aspects.  Therefore, conditional sentences should
generally include punitive conditions that are restrictive of the offender's liberty. 
Conditions such as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception.

 

No offences are excluded from the conditional
sentencing regime except those with a minimum term of imprisonment, nor should
there be presumptions in favour of or against a conditional sentence for
specific offences.

 








Section 742.1 of the Code lists four
criteria that a court must consider before deciding to impose a conditional
sentence:  (1) the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not
punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment; (2) the court must impose a term
of imprisonment of less than two years; (3) the safety of the community would
not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community; and
(4) a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and
principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.  

 

The requirement in s. 742.1 (a) that the judge
impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years does not require the
judge to first impose a sentence of imprisonment of a fixed duration before
considering whether that sentence can be served in the community.  Although
this approach is suggested by the text of s. 742.1 (a), it is unrealistic
and could lead to unfit sentences in some cases.  Instead, a purposive
interpretation of s. 742.1 (a) should be adopted.  In a preliminary
determination, the sentencing judge should reject a penitentiary term and
probationary measures as inappropriate.  Having determined that the appropriate
range of sentence is a term of imprisonment of less than two years, the judge
should then consider whether it is appropriate for the offender to serve his or
her sentence in the community.  As a corollary of the purposive interpretation
of s. 742.1 (a), a conditional sentence need not be of equivalent
duration to the sentence of incarceration that would otherwise have been
imposed.  The sole requirement is that the duration and conditions of a
conditional sentence make for a just and appropriate sentence.

 








The requirement in s. 742.1 (b) that the judge
be satisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered by the
offender serving his or her sentence in the community is a condition precedent
to the imposition of a conditional sentence, and not the primary consideration
in determining whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.  In making this
determination, the judge should consider the risk posed by the specific
offender, not the broader risk of whether the imposition of a conditional
sentence would endanger the safety of the community by providing insufficient
general deterrence or undermining general respect for the law.  Two factors
should be taken into account:  (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and
(2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence.  A
consideration of the risk posed by the offender should include the risk of any
criminal activity, and not be limited solely to the risk of physical or
psychological harm to individuals. 

 

Once the prerequisites of s. 742.1  are satisfied, the
judge should give serious consideration to the possibility of a conditional
sentence in all cases by examining whether a conditional sentence is consistent
with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to
718.2.  This follows from Parliament’s clear message to the judiciary to reduce
the use of incarceration as a sanction. 

 

A conditional sentence can provide significant
denunciation and deterrence.  As a general matter, the more serious the
offence, the longer and more onerous the conditional sentence should be.  There
may be some circumstances, however, where the need for denunciation or
deterrence is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in
which to express society's condemnation of the offender's conduct or to deter
similar conduct in the future.

 

Generally, a conditional sentence will be better than
incarceration at achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation,
reparations to the victim and the community, and promotion of a sense of
responsibility in the offender and acknowledgment of the harm done to the
victim and the community.

 








Where a combination of both punitive and restorative
objectives may be achieved, a conditional sentence will likely be more
appropriate than incarceration.  Where objectives such as denunciation and
deterrence are particularly pressing, incarceration will generally be the
preferable sanction.  This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals
might be achieved.  However, a conditional sentence may provide sufficient
denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative objectives are
of lesser importance, depending on the nature of the conditions imposed, the
duration of the sentence, and the circumstances of both the offender and the
community in which the conditional sentence is to be served.  A conditional
sentence may be imposed even where there are aggravating circumstances,
although the need for denunciation and deterrence will increase in these
circumstances.  

 

No party is under a burden of proof to establish that
a conditional sentence is either appropriate or inappropriate in the
circumstances.  The judge should consider all relevant evidence, no matter by
whom it is adduced.  However, it would be in the offender’s best interests to
establish elements militating in favour of a conditional sentence.

 

Sentencing judges have a wide discretion in the choice
of the appropriate sentence.  They are entitled to considerable deference from
appellate courts.  Absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant
factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should
only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is
demonstrably unfit.

 








In this case the sentencing judge considered that a
term of imprisonment of 18 months was appropriate and declined to permit the
accused to serve his term in the community.  She found that, while the accused
would not endanger the safety of the community by serving a conditional
sentence, such a sentence would not be in conformity with the objectives of s.
718.  In her view, even if incarceration was not necessary to deter the accused
from similar future conduct or necessary for his rehabilitation, incarceration
was necessary to send a strong message to denounce the accused’s conduct and to
deter others from engaging in similar conduct.  While the sentencing judge
seems to have proceeded according to a rigid two-step process, in deviation from
the approach set out in these reasons, an 18-month sentence of incarceration
was not demonstrably unfit for these offences and this offender.  The offences
here were very serious, and had resulted in a death and in severe bodily harm. 
Moreover, dangerous driving and impaired driving may be offences for which
harsh sentences plausibly provide general deterrence.  The Court of Appeal
erred in holding that the sentencing judge had given undue weight to the
objective of denunciation.  Absent evidence that the sentence was demonstrably
unfit, the Court of Appeal should not have interfered to substitute its own
opinion for that of the sentencing judge.  The sentencing judge did not commit
a reversible error in principle and she appropriately considered all the
relevant factors.  Accordingly, the 18-month sentence of incarceration imposed
by her should be restored.  Since the accused has already served the
conditional sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal in its entirety, and the
Crown stated in oral argument that it was not seeking any further punishment,
the service of the sentence of incarceration should be stayed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

 

1                                  
The Chief Justice – By
passing the Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other Acts in
consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill C-41”), Parliament has sent a
clear message to all Canadian judges that too many people are being sent to
prison.  In an attempt to remedy the problem of overincarceration, Parliament
has introduced a new form of sentence, the conditional sentence of imprisonment.

 

2                                  
As a matter of established practice and sound policy, this Court rarely
hears appeals relating to sentences: see R. v. Gardiner,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p. 404, R. v. Chaisson, [1995] 2
S.C.R. 1118, at para. 7, and R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1
S.C.R. 500, at para. 33.  However, we have decided to hear this case and four
related cases because they afford the Court the opportunity to set out for the
first time the principles that govern the new and innovative conditional
sentencing regime.  Given the inevitable length of these reasons, I have
summarized the essentials at para. 127.  

 

I.  Factual
Background

 








3                                  
On the morning of November 1, 1995, after a night of partying involving
consumption of some alcohol, the respondent decided to drive his friends home
even though he knew that his vehicle was not mechanically sound.  For a period
of 10  to 20 minutes, the respondent, who had only seven weeks of experience as
a licensed driver, drove erratically, weaving in and out of traffic, tailgating
and trying to pass other vehicles without signalling, despite steady oncoming
traffic and slippery roads.  As the respondent was trying to pass another
vehicle, he drove his car into an oncoming lane of traffic, side-swiped a first
car and crashed into a second one.   The driver of the second vehicle was
seriously injured.  The accident also claimed the life of a passenger in the
respondent’s car.  The respondent was in a near-death coma for some time, but
ultimately recovered from his injuries.  The respondent entered guilty pleas to
one count of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving
causing bodily harm.

 

II.  Judgments
Below

 

A.  Manitoba
Court of Queen’s Bench

 

4                                  
On June 5, 1997, Keyser J. sentenced the respondent to 18 months of incarceration,
to be served concurrently on both charges.  In her reasons for sentence, the
judge explained that she was not prepared to order a penitentiary term because
the respondent was only 18 years old at the time of the accident, he had no
prior record and he himself was seriously injured in the accident.   She also
noted that the respondent was now employed and expecting a first child with his
girlfriend.  She conceded that the amount of alcohol involved -- one and a half
to two beers -- was probably not a major factor in the accident.  However, she
found that the respondent’s knowledge that he was operating an unsafe vehicle,
the fact that, prior to the accident, he had just barely avoided rear-ending
another vehicle and his egregious driving in general that morning warranted
such a sentence.

 








5                                  
Keyser J. then turned her attention to the question of whether it was
appropriate to allow the respondent to serve his sentence in the community,
pursuant to s. 742.1  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  She
took notice of the May 2, 1997 amendment to s. 742.1 , which added to that
section an express reference to the fundamental purpose and principles of
sentencing listed in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code.  She concluded that
this amendment meant that she had to refer to the fundamental purpose and
principles of sentencing in deciding whether to impose a conditional sentence. 
In the case at hand, she found that even though the respondent would not
endanger the community and a jail sentence would not be necessary to deter him
from similar conduct in the future or to rehabilitate him, a conditional
sentence would not be appropriate because it would be inconsistent with the
objectives of denunciation and general deterrence.

           

6                                  
Keyser J. sentenced the respondent to 18 months of incarceration and,
pursuant to s. 259(2) of the Code, she made an order prohibiting the
respondent from driving for a period of five years.

 

B. Manitoba
Court of Appeal (1997), 123 Man. R. (2d) 107

 

7                                  
The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a conditional
custodial sentence for the jail term.  Helper J.A., writing for the court,
contended that the sentencing judge had erred in her application of s. 742.1  by
giving undue weight to the objective of denunciation.  She explained that the
recent amendment to s. 742.1  had not changed the fact that Parliament had
identified the safety of the community as the primary consideration when
deciding whether to impose a conditional sentence.  Helper  J.A. added that the
principles of sentencing played a different role in the determination of
whether to impose a conditional sentence than they did in determining the
length of the sentence.  At pp. 111-12, she stated:

 








However, in s. 742.1 (b), Parliament has directed
the sentencing judge to look to the principles of sentencing only for the
purpose of satisfying herself that there is consistency between those
principles and a conditional sentence for a particular offender.  The amendment
does not direct the sentencing judge to consider individually each of the
principles of sentencing and determine that each is consistent with the
offender’s serving his sentence in the community.  The sentencing judge must
consider the principles of sentencing globally.  It would be contrary to
Parliament’s intent for the sentencing judge to single out any one factor and
to give it substantial weight to the exclusion of the other listed factors when
she is making a decision under s. 742.1 (b).

 

8                   
According to Helper J.A., the sentencing judge’s comments implied that a
conditional sentence would never be appropriate for the offence of dangerous
driving, even when the offender did not potentially endanger the community,
because that offence required a large component of general deterrence.  Helper
J.A. found this to be an error, as  it would have rendered s. 742.1  inoperable
in the case of particular offences, contrary to Parliament’s intention.  She
found that, in the instant appeal, the sentencing judge had failed to recognize
that a conditional sentence had some denunciatory effect.        

 

9                   
Helper J.A. concluded that generally, after the judge has attributed the
appropriate weight to each relevant principle of sentencing, determined that a
fit sentence would be less than two years and found that the offender would not
be a danger to the community, a conditional sentence would be consistent with
ss. 718 to 718.2.  

 

III.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

10               
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

718.  The fundamental purpose of sentencing
is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the
law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;








(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 

(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

718.1  A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2  A court that imposes a sentence shall
also take into consideration the following principles:

IV.  Issues

 

11               
              This appeal concerns the proper interpretation and
application of the conditional sentencing regime set out in s. 742.1  and
subsequent sections of the Criminal Code .

 








12               
Since it came into force on September 3, 1996, the conditional sentence
has generated considerable debate.  With the advent of s. 742.1 , Parliament has
clearly mandated that certain offenders who used to go to prison should now
serve their sentences in the community.  Section 742.1  makes a conditional
sentence available to a subclass of non-dangerous offenders who, prior to the
introduction of this new regime, would have been sentenced to a term of
incarceration of less than two years for offences with no minimum term of
imprisonment.  

 

13               
In my view, to address meaningfully the complex interpretive issues
raised by this appeal, it is important to situate this new sentencing tool in
the broader context of the comprehensive sentencing reforms enacted by
Parliament in Bill C-41.  I will also consider the nature of the conditional sentence,
contrasting it with probationary measures and incarceration.  Next, I will
address particular interpretive issues posed by s. 742.1 .  I will first discuss
the statutory prerequisites to the imposition of a conditional sentence. 
Thereafter, I will consider how courts should determine whether a conditional
sentence is appropriate, assuming the prerequisites are satisfied.  I conclude
with some general comments on the deference to which trial judges are entitled
in matters of sentencing and dispose of the case at hand in conformity with the
principles outlined in these reasons.

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  The
1996 Sentencing Reforms (Bill C-41)

 

14               
In September 1996, Bill C-41 came into effect.  It substantially
reformed Part XXIII of the Code, and introduced, inter alia, an
express statement of the purposes and principles of sentencing, provisions for
alternative measures for adult offenders and a new type of sanction, the
conditional sentence of imprisonment.

 








15               
As my colleagues Cory and Iacobucci JJ. explained in R. v. Gladue,
[1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 39, “[t]he enactment of the new Part XXIII was a
watershed, marking the first codification and significant reform of sentencing
principles in the history of Canadian criminal law”.  They noted two of
Parliament’s principal objectives in enacting this new legislation: (i)
reducing the use of prison as a sanction, and (ii) expanding the use of
restorative justice principles in sentencing (at para. 48).   

 

(1) Reducing the Use of Prison as a Sanction

 

16               
Bill C-41 is in large part a response to the problem of
overincarceration in Canada.  It was noted in Gladue, at para. 52, that
Canada’s incarceration rate of approximately 130 inmates per 100,000 population
places it second or third highest among industrialized democracies.  In their
reasons, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. reviewed numerous studies that uniformly
concluded that incarceration is costly, frequently unduly harsh and
“ineffective, not only in relation to its purported rehabilitative goals, but
also in relation to its broader public goals” (para. 54).  See also Report of
the Canadian Committee on Corrections, Toward Unity: Criminal Justice and
Corrections (1969); Canadian Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Reform: A
Canadian Approach (1987), at pp. xxiii‑xxiv; Standing Committee on
Justice and Solicitor General, Taking Responsibility (1988), at p.
75.    Prison has been characterized by some as a finishing school for
criminals and as ill-preparing them for reintegration into society: see
generally Canadian Committee on Corrections, supra, at p. 314;
Correctional Service of Canada, A Summary of Analysis of Some Major
Inquiries on Corrections  – 1938 to 1977 (1982), at p. iv.  
In Gladue, at para. 57, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. held:

 

        Thus, it may be seen that although imprisonment is intended to
serve the traditional sentencing goals of separation, deterrence, denunciation,
and rehabilitation, there is widespread consensus that imprisonment has not
been successful in achieving some of these goals. Overincarceration is a long‑standing
problem that has been many times publicly acknowledged but never addressed in a
systematic manner by Parliament. In recent years, compared to other countries,
sentences of imprisonment in Canada have increased at an alarming rate. The
1996 sentencing reforms embodied in Part XXIII, and s. 718.2(e) in
particular, must be understood as a reaction to the overuse of prison as a
sanction, and must accordingly be given appropriate force as remedial
provisions. [Emphasis added.]








 

17               
Parliament has sought to give increased prominence to the principle of
restraint in the use of prison as a sanction through the enactment of s. 718.2(d)
and (e).  Section 718.2(d) provides that “an offender should not
be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the
circumstances”, while s. 718.2(e) provides that “all available sanctions
other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be
considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders”.  Further evidence of Parliament’s desire to lower the
rate of incarceration comes from other provisions of Bill C-41: s. 718(c)
qualifies the sentencing objective of separating offenders from society with
the words “where necessary”, thereby indicating that caution be exercised in
sentencing offenders to prison; s. 734(2) imposes a duty on judges to undertake
a means inquiry before imposing a fine, so as to decrease the number of offenders
who are incarcerated for defaulting on payment of their fines; and of course,
s. 742.1 , which introduces the conditional sentence.  In Gladue, at
para. 40, the Court held that “[t]he creation of the conditional sentence
suggests, on its face, a desire to lessen the use of incarceration”.

 

(2) Expanding the Use of Restorative Justice Principles in
Sentencing

 

18               
Restorative justice is concerned with the restoration of the parties
that are affected by the commission of an offence.  Crime generally affects at
least three parties: the victim, the community, and the offender.  A
restorative justice approach seeks to remedy the adverse effects of crime in a
manner that addresses the needs of all parties involved.  This is accomplished,
in part, through the rehabilitation of the offender, reparations to the victim
and to the community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the
offender and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community. 

 








19               
Canadian sentencing jurisprudence has traditionally focussed on the aims
of denunciation, deterrence, separation, and rehabilitation, with
rehabilitation a relative late-comer to the sentencing analysis: see Gladue,
at para. 42.  With the introduction of Bill C-41, however, Parliament has
placed new emphasis upon the goals of restorative justice.  Section 718 sets
out the fundamental purpose of sentencing, as well as the various sentencing
objectives that should be vindicated when sanctions are imposed.  In Gladue,
supra, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. stated (at para. 43):

 

Clearly, s. 718 is, in part, a restatement of the basic sentencing
aims, which are listed in paras. (a) through (d).  What are new,
though, are paras. (e) and (f), which along with para. (d)
focus upon the restorative goals of repairing the harms suffered by individual
victims and by the community as a whole, promoting a sense of responsibility
and an acknowledgment of the harm caused on the part of the offender, and
attempting to rehabilitate or heal the offender.  The concept of restorative
justice which underpins paras. (d), (e), and (f) is
briefly discussed below, but as a general matter restorative justice
involves some form of restitution and reintegration into the community.  The
need for offenders to take responsibility for their actions is central to the
sentencing process. . . .  Restorative sentencing goals do not usually
correlate with the use of prison as a sanction.  In our view, Parliament’s
choice to include (e) and (f) alongside the traditional
sentencing goals must be understood as evidencing an intention to expand the
parameters of the sentencing analysis for all offenders. [Emphasis added;
citation omitted.]

 

20               
Parliament has mandated that expanded use be made of restorative
principles in sentencing as a result of the general failure of incarceration 
to rehabilitate offenders and reintegrate them into society.  By placing a new
emphasis on restorative principles, Parliament expects both to reduce the rate
of incarceration and improve the effectiveness of sentencing.  During the
second reading of Bill C-41 on September 20, 1994 (House of Commons Debates,
vol. IV, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., at p. 5873), Minister of Justice Allan Rock
made the following statements:

 

     A general principle that runs throughout Bill C-41 is that jails
should be reserved for those who should be there.  Alternatives should be put in
place for those who commits offences but who do not need or merit
incarceration.

 








.
. .

 

Jails and prisons will be there for those who need
them, for those who should be punished in that way or separated from society. .
. .   [T]his bill creates an environment which encourages community sanctions
and the rehabilitation of offenders together with reparation to victims and
promoting in criminals a sense of accountability for what they have done.

 

It is not simply by being more harsh that we will achieve more
effective criminal justice.  We must use our scarce resources wisely.  

 

B. The Nature of the
Conditional Sentence

 

21               
The conditional sentence was specifically enacted as a new sanction
designed to achieve both of Parliament’s objectives.  The conditional sentence
is a meaningful alternative to incarceration for less serious and non-dangerous
offenders.  The offenders who meet the criteria of s. 742.1  will serve a
sentence under strict surveillance in the community instead of going to prison. 
These offenders’ liberty will be constrained by  conditions to be attached to
the sentence, as set out in s. 742.3 of the Code.  In case of breach of
conditions, the offender will be brought back before a judge, pursuant to s.
742.6.  If an offender cannot provide a reasonable excuse for breaching the
conditions of his or her sentence, the judge may order him or her to serve the
remainder of the sentence in jail, as it was intended by Parliament that there
be a real threat of incarceration to increase compliance with the conditions of
the sentence.

 








22               
The conditional sentence incorporates some elements of non-custodial
measures and some others of incarceration.  Because it is served in the
community, it will generally be more effective than incarceration at achieving
the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations to the victim and
community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender. 
However, it is also a punitive sanction capable of achieving the objectives
of denunciation and deterrence.  It is this punitive aspect that
distinguishes the conditional sentence from probation, and it is to this issue
that I now turn.  

 

  (1) Comparing Conditional Sentences with Probation

 

23               
There has been some confusion among members of the judiciary and the
public alike about the difference between a conditional sentence and a
suspended sentence with probation.  This confusion is understandable, as the
statutory provisions regarding  conditions to be attached to conditional sentences
(s. 742.3 ) and probation orders (s. 732.1) are very similar.  Notwithstanding
these similarities, there is an important distinction between the two.  While a
suspended sentence with probation is primarily a rehabilitative sentencing
tool, the evidence suggests that Parliament intended a conditional sentence to
address both punitive and rehabilitative objectives.

 

(a) A Comparative Reading of the Provisions

 

24               
A comparative reading of the provisions governing conditional sentences
and probation orders reveals three differences.  First, a probation order
includes only three  compulsory conditions  –  to keep the peace and be of good
behaviour, appear before the court when required, and notify the court or
probation officer of any change in employment or address –  whereas there are
five such conditions in the case of a conditional sentence.  The two additional
compulsory conditions of a conditional sentence – to report to a supervisor and
remain within the jurisdiction unless permission is granted to leave – are
listed as optional conditions under a probation order.

 








25               
The second difference concerns the power of the judge to order the
offender to undergo treatment.  Under a conditional sentence, the sentencing
judge can order the offender to attend a treatment program, regardless of
whether the offender consents.  Under a probation order, the judge can only
impose a treatment order with the consent of the offender (with the exception
of drug or alcohol addiction programs since the 1999 amendment to s. 732.1
(S.C. 1999, c. 32, s. 6)).  In practice, however, this difference is not very
significant, since it is unlikely that an offender faced with the choice
between imprisonment and a suspended sentence with treatment as a condition of
probation would refuse to consent to treatment.

 

26               
The third difference is in the wording of the residual clauses of the
provisions governing the imposition of optional conditions.  In the case of a
conditional sentence, s. 742.3(2)(f) provides that the court may order
that the offender comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court
considers desirable “for securing the good conduct of the offender and for
preventing a repetition by the offender of the same offence or the commission
of other offences”.  By contrast, s. 732.1(3)(h) provides that the court
may impose such other reasonable conditions of probation “for protecting
society and for facilitating the offender’s successful reintegration into the
community”.

 








27               
On their face, these three differences do not suggest that a conditional
sentence is more punitive than a suspended sentence with probation.  Moreover,
the penalty for breach of probation is potentially more severe than that for
breach of a conditional sentence. Pursuant to s. 733.1(1), breach of probation
constitutes a new offence, punishable by up to two years  imprisonment, while a
breach of condition does not constitute a new offence per se.  The
maximum penalties are also different.  In the case of a breach of probation,
the offender is subject to the revocation of the probation order and can be
sentenced for the original offence (in cases where a suspended sentence was
rendered): see s. 732.2(5).  By contrast, in the case of breaches of
conditional sentences,  the maximum punishment available is incarceration for
the time remaining of the original sentence (s. 742.6(9)).  Presumably, if a
conditional sentence is more onerous than probation, the consequences of
breaching a condition should be more onerous as well.     

 

(b) Conditional Sentences Must Be More Punitive Than Probation

 

28               
Despite the similarities between the provisions and the fact that the
penalty for breach of probation is potentially more severe than for breach of a
conditional sentence, there are strong indications that Parliament intended the
conditional sentence to be more punitive than probation.  It is a well accepted
principle of statutory interpretation that no legislative provision should be
interpreted so as to render it mere surplusage.  It would be absurd if
Parliament  intended conditional sentences to amount merely to probation under
a different name.  While this argument is clearly not dispositive, it suggests
that Parliament intended there to be a meaningful distinction between the two
sanctions.  I will now consider more specific arguments in support of this
position.

 

29               
The conditional sentence is defined in the Code as a sentence of
imprisonment.  The heading of s. 742 reads “Conditional Sentence of
Imprisonment”.  Furthermore, s. 742.1(a) requires the court to impose a
sentence of imprisonment of less than two years before considering whether the
sentence can be served in the community subject to the appropriate conditions. 
Parliament intended imprisonment, in the form of incarceration, to be more
punitive than probation, as it is far more restrictive of the offender’s
liberty.  Since a conditional sentence is, at least notionally, a sentence of
imprisonment, it follows that it too should be interpreted as more punitive
than probation.

 








30               
On a related note, with the enactment of s. 742.1, Parliament has
mandated that certain non-dangerous offenders who would otherwise have gone to
jail for up to two years now serve their sentences in the community.  If a
conditional sentence is not distinguished from probation, then these offenders
will receive what are effectively considerably less onerous probation orders
instead of jail terms.  Such lenient sentences would not provide sufficient
denunciation and deterrence, nor would they be accepted by the public.  Section
718 provides that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is “to contribute . . .
to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe
society”.  Inadequate sanctions undermine respect for the law.  Accordingly, it
is important to distinguish a conditional sentence from probation by way of the
use of punitive conditions.

 

31               
Earlier I drew attention to a subtle difference between the residual
clauses in the provisions governing the imposition of optional conditions of
probation orders and conditional sentences.  While the difference between the
two residual clauses is subtle, it is also significant.  In order to appreciate
this difference, it is necessary to consider the case law and practice that has
developed with respect to probation.

 

32               
Probation has traditionally been viewed as a rehabilitative sentencing
tool.  Recently, the rehabilitative nature of the probation order was explained
by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Taylor
(1997), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 376.  Bayda C.J.S. wrote, at p. 394:

 








       Apart from the wording of the provision, the innate character of
a probation order is such that it seeks to influence the future behaviour of
the offender.  More specifically, it seeks to secure “the good conduct” of the
offender and to deter him from committing other offences.  It does not
particularly seek to reflect the seriousness of the offence or the offender’s
degree of culpability.  Nor does it particularly seek to fill the need for
denunciation of the offence or the general deterrence of others to commit the
same or other offences. Depending upon the specific conditions of the order
there may well be a punitive aspect to a probation order but punishment is not
the dominant or an inherent purpose.  It is perhaps not even a secondary
purpose but is more in the nature of a consequence of an offender’s compliance
with one or more of the specific conditions with which he or she may find it
hard to comply. [Emphasis added.]

 

33               
        Many appellate courts have struck out conditions of probation
that were imposed to punish rather than rehabilitate the offender: see  R.
v. Ziatas (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 287 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 288; R.
v. Caja (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 401 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 402-3;  R.
v. Lavender (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 551 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 552-53,
and R. v. L. (1986), 50 C.R. (3d) 398 (Alta. C.A.), at pp.
399-400.  The impugned terms of probation in these cases were imposed pursuant
to a residual clause in force at the time whose wording was virtually identical
to that presently used in s. 742.3(2)(f).

 

34               
Despite the virtual identity in the wording of s. 742.3(2)(f) and
the old residual clause applicable to probation orders, it would be a mistake
to conclude that punitive conditions cannot now be imposed under s. 742.3(2)(f). 
Parliament amended the residual clause for probation, s. 732.1(3)(h), to
read “for protecting society and for facilitating the offender’s successful
reintegration into the community” (emphasis added).  It did so to make
clear the rehabilitative purpose of probation and to distinguish s. 742.3(2)(f)
from s. 732.1(3)(h).   The wording used in s. 742.3(2)(f) does
not focus principally on the rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender. 
If s. 742.3(2)(f) were interpreted as precluding punitive conditions, it
would frustrate Parliament’s intention in distinguishing the two forms of
sentence.  Parliament would not have distinguished them if it intended both
clauses to serve the same purpose.

 








35               
In light of the foregoing, it is clear that Parliament intended a
conditional sentence to be more punitive than a suspended sentence with probation,
notwithstanding the similarities between the two sanctions in respect of their
rehabilitative purposes.  I agree wholeheartedly with Vancise J.A., who,
dissenting in R. v. McDonald (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 418 (Sask. C.A.),
stated, at p. 443, that conditional sentences were designed to “permit the
accused to avoid imprisonment but not to avoid punishment”.

 

36               
Accordingly, conditional sentences should generally include punitive
conditions that are restrictive of the offender’s liberty.  Conditions such as
house arrest or strict curfews should be the norm, not the exception.  As the
Minister of Justice said during the second reading of Bill C-41 (House of
Commons Debates, supra, at p. 5873), “[t]his sanction is obviously
aimed at offenders who would otherwise be in jail but who could be in the
community under tight controls” (emphasis added).  

 

37               
There must be a reason for failing to impose punitive conditions when a
conditional sentence order is made.  Sentencing judges should always be mindful
of the fact that conditional sentences are only to be imposed on offenders who
would otherwise have been sent to jail.  If the judge is of the opinion that
punitive conditions are unnecessary, then probation, rather than a conditional
sentence, is most likely the appropriate disposition. 

 

38               
The punitive nature of the conditional sentence should also inform the
treatment of breaches of conditions.  As I have already discussed, the maximum
penalty for breach of probation is potentially more severe than that for breach
of a conditional sentence.  In practice, however, breaches of conditional
sentences may be punished more severely than breaches of probation.  Without
commenting on the constitutionality of these provisions, I note that breaches
of conditional sentence need only be proved on a balance of probabilities,
pursuant to s. 742.6(9), whereas breaches of probation must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.

 








39               
More importantly, where an offender breaches a condition without
reasonable excuse, there should be a presumption that the offender serve the
remainder of his or her sentence in jail.  This constant threat of
incarceration will help to ensure that the offender complies with the
conditions imposed: see R. v. Brady (1998), 121 C.C.C.  (3d) 504 (Alta.
C.A.); J. V. Roberts, “Conditional Sentencing: Sword of Damocles or Pandora’s
Box?” (1997), 2 Can. Crim. L. Rev. 183.  It also assists in
distinguishing the conditional sentence from probation by making the
consequences of a breach of condition more severe. 

 

 

(2) Conditional Sentences and Incarceration

 

40               
Although a conditional sentence is by statutory definition a sentence of
imprisonment, this Court,  in R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 227, at para. 21, recognized that there “is a very significant
difference between being behind bars and functioning within society while on
conditional release”. See also Cunningham v. Canada,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 143, at p. 150, per McLachlin J.  These comments are
equally applicable to the conditional sentence.  Indeed, offenders serving a
conditional sentence in the community are only partially deprived of their
freedom.  Even if their liberty is restricted by the conditions attached to
their sentence, they are not confined to an institution and they can continue
to attend to their normal employment or educational endeavours.  They are not
deprived of their private life to the same extent.  Nor are they subject to a
regimented schedule or an institutional diet.      

 

41               
This is not to say that the conditional sentence is a lenient punishment
or that it does not provide significant denunciation and deterrence, or that a
conditional sentence can never be as harsh as incarceration.  As this Court
stated in Gladue, supra, at para. 72:








 

. . . in our view a sentence focussed on restorative justice is not
necessarily a “lighter” punishment.  Some proponents of restorative justice
argue that when it is combined with probationary conditions it may in some
circumstances impose a greater burden on the offender than a custodial
sentence.

 

 

A conditional
sentence may be as onerous as, or perhaps even more onerous than, a jail term,
particularly in circumstances where the offender is forced to take
responsibility for his or her actions and make reparations to both the victim
and the community, all the while living in the community under tight controls. 

 

42               
Moreover, the conditional sentence is not subject to reduction through
parole.  This would seem to follow from s. 112(1)  of the Corrections and
Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 , which gives the provincial
parole board jurisdiction in respect of the parole of offenders “serving
sentences of imprisonment in provincial correctional facilities” (R. v.
Wismayer (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 33).    

 

43               
I would add that the fact that a conditional sentence cannot be reduced
through parole does not in itself lead to the conclusion that as a general
matter a conditional sentence is as onerous as or even more onerous than a jail
term of equivalent duration.  There is no parole simply because the offender is
never actually incarcerated and he or she does not need to be reintegrated into
society.  But even when an offender is released from custody on parole,  the
original sentence continues in force.  As I stated in M. (C.A.), supra,
at para. 62:

 








       In short, the history, structure and existing practice of the
conditional release system collectively indicate that a grant of parole
represents a change in the conditions under which a judicial sentence
must be served, rather than a reduction of the judicial sentence itself.
. . .  But even though the conditions of incarceration are subject to change
through a grant of parole to the offender’s benefit, the offender’s sentence
continues in full effect.  The offender remains under the strict control of the
parole system, and the offender’s liberty remains significantly curtailed for
the full duration of the offender’s numerical or life sentence. [Emphasis in
original.]

 

The parolee
has to serve the final portion of his or her sentence under conditions similar
to those that can be imposed under a conditional sentence, perhaps even under
stricter conditions, as the parolee can be assigned to a “community-based
residential facility”: see s. 133  of the Corrections and Conditional Release
Act  and s. 161 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations,
SOR/92-620.        

 

44               
In light of these observations, a conditional sentence, even with
stringent conditions, will usually be a more lenient sentence than a jail term
of equivalent duration: see also  Gagnon v. La Reine, [1998] R.J.Q. 2636
(C.A.), at p. 2645; Brady, supra, at paras. 36 and 48 to 50.  The
fact that incarceration is a threatened punishment for those who breach their
conditions provides further support for this conclusion.  In order for
incarceration to serve as a punishment for breach of a conditional sentence,
logically it must be more onerous than a conditional sentence. 

 

C.   Application
of Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code

 

45               
For convenience, I will reproduce here s. 742.1:  

 

742.1 Where a person is convicted of an
offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment, and the court 

                                                                     

(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,
and

 

(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community
would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to
718.2,

 








the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour
in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,
subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional
sentence order made under section 742.3 .

 

46               
This provision lists four criteria that a court must consider before
deciding to impose a conditional sentence: 

 

(1) the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable
by a minimum term of imprisonment;

 

(2) the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two
years;

 

(3) the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender
serving the sentence in the community; and 

 

(4) a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental
purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.

 

47               
In my view, the first three criteria are prerequisites to any
conditional sentence.  These prerequisites answer the question of whether or
not a conditional sentence is possible in the circumstances.  Once they are
met, the next question is whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.  This
decision turns upon a consideration of the fundamental purpose and principles
of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.  I will discuss each of these
elements in turn.

 

(1)   The Offender Must be Convicted of an
Offence That Is Not Punishable by a Minimum Term of Imprisonment  

 








48               
This prerequisite is straightforward.  The offence for which the
offender was convicted must not be punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment. 
Offences with a minimum term of imprisonment are the only statutory exclusions
from the conditional sentencing regime.

 

(2) The Court Must Impose a Term of Imprisonment
of Less than Two Years  

 

49               
Parliament intended that a conditional sentence be considered only for
those offenders who would have otherwise received a sentence of imprisonment of
less than two years.  There is some controversy as to whether this means that
the judge must actually impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed
duration before considering the possibility of a conditional sentence.  Far
from addressing purely methodological concerns, this question carries
implications as to the role of ss. 718 to 718.2 in the determination of the
appropriate sentence, the duration of the sentence, its venue and other
modalities.    

     

50               
A literal reading of s. 742.1(a) suggests that the decision to
impose a conditional sentence should be made in two distinct stages.  In the
first stage, the judge would have to decide the appropriate sentence according
to the general purposes and principles of sentencing (now set out in ss. 718 to
718.2).  Having found that a term of imprisonment of less than two years is
warranted, the judge would then, in a second stage, decide whether this same
term should be served in the community pursuant to s. 742.1.  At first sight,
since Parliament said: “and the court (a) imposes a sentence of
imprisonment of less than two years”, it seems that the sentencing judge must
first impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration before
contemplating the possibility that this term be served in the community.  

 








51               
This two-step approach was endorsed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in
the present appeal.  However, this literal reading of s. 742.1 and the
two-step approach it implies introduce a rigidity which is both unworkable and
undesirable in practice. 

 

(a)  Duration and Venue Cannot Be Separated

 

52               
This two-step process does not correspond to the reality of sentencing. 
In practice, the determination of a term of imprisonment is necessarily
intertwined with the decision of where the offender will serve the sentence.  A
judge does not impose a fixed sentence of “x months” in the abstract, without
having in mind where that sentence will be served (see Brady, supra,
at para. 86; R. v. Pierce (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (Ont. C.A.), at p.
39; R. v. Ursel (1997), 96 B.C.A.C. 241, at p. 284 (per Ryan
J.A.) and pp.  291-92 (per Rowles J.A.)).  Furthermore, when a
conditional sentence is chosen, its duration will depend on the type of
conditions imposed.  Therefore, the duration of the sentence should not be
determined separately from the determination of its venue.  

 

(b)  “Penalogical Paradox” 

 








53               
There is a contradiction embedded in this rigid two-step process.  After
having applied ss. 718 to 718.2 in the first stage to conclude that the
appropriate sentence is a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration (in all
cases less than two years), the judge would then have to decide if serving the
same sentence in the community is still consistent with the fundamental
purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2, as required
by s. 742.1(b).  It is unrealistic to believe that a judge would
consider the objectives and principles twice or make a clear distinction in his
or her mind between the application of ss. 718 to 718.2 in the first stage and
in the second stage.   Even if this could be done, it could lead to a
“penalogical paradox”, as described by J. Gemmell in,  “The New Conditional
Sentencing Regime” (1997), 39 Crim. L.Q. 334, at p. 337:

 

. . .  the judge must first determine that imprisonment is the only
reasonable sanction in the circumstances then decide whether the offender
should nevertheless serve that sentence in the community.  The decision to
impose a conditional sentence is almost a kind of reductio ad absurdum
of the original decision that called for imprisonment. [Footnote omitted.]

 

54               
This second step of the analytical process would effectively compromise
the principles of sentencing that led to the imposition of a sentence of
imprisonment in the first place.  For instance, the principle of
proportionality, set out in s. 718.1 as the fundamental principle of
sentencing, directs that all sentences must be proportional to the gravity of
the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.  When a judge –
in the first stage - decides that a
term of imprisonment of “x months” is appropriate, it means that this
sentence is proportional.  If the sentencing judge decides – in the second
stage – that the same term can be served in the community, it is
possible that the sentence is no longer proportional to the gravity of the
offence and the responsibility of the offender, since a conditional sentence
will generally be more lenient than a jail term of equivalent duration.  Thus,
such a two-step approach introduces a rigidity in the sentencing process that
could lead to an unfit sentence.  

 

(c)  A Purposive Interpretation of Section 742.1(a)

 








55               
These problems can be addressed by a purposive interpretation of s.
742.1(a).  For the reasons discussed above, the requirement that the
court “imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years” could not
have been intended to impose on judges a rigid two-step process.  Rather, it
was included to identify the type of offenders who could be entitled to a
conditional sentence.   At one end of the range, Parliament denied the
possibility of a conditional sentence for offenders who should receive a
penitentiary term.  At the other end, Parliament intended to ensure that
offenders who were entitled to a more lenient community measure – such as a
suspended sentence with probation – did not receive a conditional sentence, a
harsher sanction in this legislative scheme.

 

56               
Section 742.1(a), when read in conjunction with ss. 718.2(d)
and 718.2(e), cautions sentencing judges against “widening the net” of
the conditional sentencing regime by imposing conditional sentences on
offenders who would otherwise have received a non-custodial disposition (Gagnon,
supra, at p. 2645; McDonald, supra, at pp. 437-39).  As
Rosenberg J.A. puts it in Wismayer, supra, at p. 42:

 

     Parliament’s goal of reducing the prison population of non-violent
offenders and increased use of community sanctions will be frustrated if the
courts refuse to use the conditional sentence order for offences that normally
attract a jail sentence and resort to the conditional sentence only for
offences that previously would have attracted non-custodial dispositions.

    

Erroneously
imposing conditional sentences could  undermine Parliament’s objective of
reducing incarceration for less serious offenders.    

 

57               
These concerns are illustrated by the English experience with a similar
sentence called a “suspended sentence”.  As Parker L.C.J. explained, writing
for the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R. v. O’Keefe
(1968), 53 Cr. App. R. 91, at pp. 94-95:

 

     This Court would like to say as emphatically as they can that
suspended sentences should not be given when, but for the power to give a
suspended sentence, a probation order was the proper order to make.  After all,
a suspended sentence is a sentence of imprisonment. . . .

 








     Therefore, it seems to the Court that before one gets to a
suspended sentence at all, a court must go through the process of eliminating
other possible courses such as absolute discharge, conditional discharge, probation
order, fine, and then say to itself: this is a case for imprisonment, and the
final question, it being a case for imprisonment: is immediate imprisonment
required, or can I give a suspended sentence?   

 

58               
A similar approach should be used by Canadian courts.  Hence, a
purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(a) does not dictate a rigid
two-step approach in which the judge would first have to impose a term of
imprisonment of a fixed duration and then decide if that fixed term of
imprisonment can be served in the community.  In my view, the requirement that
the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years can be
fulfilled by a preliminary determination of the appropriate range of available
sentences.  Thus, the approach I suggest still requires the judge to proceed in
two stages.  However, the judge need not impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed
duration at the first stage of the analysis.  Rather, at this stage, the judge
simply has to exclude two possibilities: (a) probationary measures; and (b) a
penitentiary term.  If either of these sentences is appropriate, then a
conditional sentence should not be imposed.   

 

59               
In making this preliminary determination, the judge need only consider
the  fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to
718.2 to the extent necessary to narrow the range of sentence for the
offender.  The submissions of the parties, although not binding, may prove
helpful in this regard.  For example, both parties may agree that the
appropriate range of sentence is a term of imprisonment of less than two
years.  

 








60               
Once that preliminary determination is made, and assuming the other
statutory prerequisites are met, the judge should then proceed to the second
stage of the analysis: determining whether a conditional sentence would be
consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in
ss. 718 to 718.2.  Unlike the first stage, the principles of sentencing are now
considered comprehensively.  Further, it is at the second stage that the
duration and venue of the sentence should be determined, and, if a conditional
sentence, the conditions to be imposed. 

 

61               
This purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(a) avoids the pitfalls
of the literal interpretation discussed above, while at all times taking into
account the principles and objectives of sentencing. As I stressed in M.
(C.A.), supra, at para. 82.

 

In the final analysis, the overarching duty of a sentencing judge is to
draw upon all the legitimate principles of sentencing to determine a “just and
appropriate” sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence committed and
the moral blameworthiness of the offender.

 

 

(3)          The Safety of the Community Would
Not Be Endangered by the Offender Serving the Sentence in the Community

 

 

62               
This criterion, set out in s. 742.1(b), has generated wide
discussion in courts and among authors. I intend to discuss the following
issues:

 

(a)  Is safety of the community a prerequisite to any conditional
sentence?

 

(b)  Does “safety of the community” refer only to the threat posed by
the specific offender?

 

(c)  How should courts evaluate danger to the community?

 

(d)  Is risk of economic prejudice to be considered in assessing danger
to the community?








 

(a)  A Prerequisite to Any Conditional Sentence

 

63               
As a prerequisite to any conditional sentence, the sentencing judge must
be satisfied that having the offender serve the sentence in the community would
not endanger its safety: see Brady, supra, at para. 58; R.
v. Maheu, [1997] R.J.Q. 410, 116 C.C.C. (3d) 361 (C.A.), at p.
368 C.C.C.; Gagnon, supra, at p. 2641; Pierce, supra,
at p. 39; Ursel, supra, at pp. 284-86 (per Ryan J.A.).  If
the sentencing judge is not satisfied that the safety of the community can be
preserved, a conditional sentence must never be imposed.  

 

64               
With respect, the Manitoba Court of Appeal in the case before us erred
in concluding that safety of the community was the primary consideration in the
decision to impose a conditional sentence.  As the Alberta Court of Appeal in Brady,
supra, at para. 58, stated:

 

So to suggest that danger is the primary consideration is tendentious. 
It wrongly implies that absence of danger trumps or has paramountcy over other
sentencing principles.  Either the offender meets the no-danger threshold, or
he does not.  If he does, this consideration is spent and the focus must then
properly be on the other sentencing principles and objectives.

 








65               
I agree.  It is only once the judge is satisfied that the safety of the
community would not be endangered, in the sense explained in paras. 66 to 76
below, that he or she can examine whether a conditional sentence “would be
consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in
sections 718 to 718.2”.  In other words, rather than being an overarching
consideration in the process of determining whether a conditional sentence is
appropriate, the criterion of safety of the community should be viewed as a
condition precedent to the assessment of whether a conditional sentence would
be a fit and proper sanction in the circumstances.

 

(b)          “Safety of the Community” Refers
to the Threat Posed by the Specific Offender

 

66               
The issue here is whether “safety of the community” refers only to the
threat posed by the specific offender or whether it also extends to the broader
risk of undermining respect for the law.  The proponents of the broader
interpretation argue that, in certain cases where a conditional sentence could
be imposed, it would be perceived that wrongdoers are receiving lenient
sentences, thereby insufficiently deterring those who may be inclined to engage
in similar acts of wrongdoing, and, in turn, endangering the safety of the community.


 

67               
Leaving aside the fact that a properly crafted conditional sentence can
also achieve the objectives of general deterrence and denunciation, I think the
debate has been rendered largely academic in light of an amendment to s. 742.1(b)
(S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 107.1) which clarified that courts must take into
consideration the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in
ss. 718 to 718.2 in deciding whether to impose a conditional sentence.  This
ensures that objectives such as denunciation and deterrence will be dealt with
in the decision to impose a conditional sentence.  Since these factors will be
taken into account later in the analysis, there is no need to include them in
the consideration of the safety of the community.

 








68               
In my view, the focus of the analysis at this point should clearly be on
the risk posed by the individual offender while serving his sentence in the
community.  I would note that a majority of appellate courts have adopted an
interpretation of the criterion referring only to the threat posed by the
specific offender: see Gagnon, supra, at pp. 2640-41 (per
Fish J.A.); R. v. Parker (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 236
(N.S.C.A.), at pp. 247-48; Ursel, supra, at p. 260; R. v.
Horvath, [1997] 8 W.W.R. 357 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 374; Brady, supra,
at paras. 60-61; Wismayer, supra, at p. 44.

 

(c)  How Should Courts Evaluate Danger to the Community?

 

69               
In my opinion, to assess the danger to the community posed by the
offender while serving his or her sentence in the community, two factors must
be taken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and (2) the
gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence.  If the
judge finds that there is a real risk of re-offence, incarceration should be
imposed.  Of course, there is always some risk that an offender may re-offend. 
If the judge thinks this risk is minimal, the gravity of the damage that could
follow were the offender to re-offend should also be taken into consideration. 
In certain cases, the minimal risk of re-offending will be offset by the
possibility of a great prejudice, thereby precluding a conditional sentence. 

 

(i)  Risk of Re-offence

   

70               
A variety of factors will be relevant in assessing the risk of
re-offence.  In Brady, supra, at paras. 117-27, Fraser C.J.A.
suggested that consideration be given to whether the offender has previously
complied with court orders and, more generally, to whether the offender has a
criminal record that suggests that the offender will not abide by the
conditional sentence.  Rousseau-Houle J.A. in Maheu, supra, at p.
374 C.C.C. enumerated additional factors which may be of relevance:

 








[translation] . . . 1)
the nature of the offence, 2) the relevant circumstances of the offence, which
can put in issue prior and subsequent incidents, 3) the degree of participation
of the accused, 4) the relationship of the accused with the victim, 5) the
profile of the accused, that is, his [or her] occupation, lifestyle, criminal
record, family situation, mental state, 6) his [or her] conduct following the
commission of the offence, 7) the danger which the interim release of the
accused represents for the community, notably that part of the community
affected by the matter.

 

71               
This list is instructive, but should not be considered exhaustive.  The
risk that a particular offender poses to the community must be assessed in each
case, on its own facts.  Moreover, the factors outlined above should not be
applied mechanically.  As Fraser C.J.A. held in Brady, supra, at
para. 124:

 

Forgetting a court date once ten years ago does not automatically bar
an offender from any future conditional sentence.  Nor does turning up for his
trial guarantee an offender a conditional sentence.  The sentencing judge must
of course look at all aspects of these previous disobediences of courts.  That
includes frequency, age, maturity, recency, seriousness of disobedience and
surrounding circumstances.

      

72               
The risk of re-offence should also be assessed in light of the
conditions attached to the sentence.  Where an offender might pose some risk of
endangering the safety of the community, it is possible that this risk be
reduced to a minimal one by the imposition of appropriate conditions to the
sentence: see Wismayer, supra, at p. 32; Brady, supra,
at para. 62; Maheu, supra, at p. 374 C.C.C.  Indeed, this is
contemplated by s. 742.3(2)(f), which allows the court to include as
optional conditions “such other reasonable conditions as the court considers
desirable . . . for securing the good conduct of the offender and for
preventing a repetition by the offender of the same offence or the commission
of other offences”.  For example, a judge may wish to impose a conditional
sentence with a treatment order on an offender with a drug addiction,
notwithstanding the fact that the offender has a lengthy criminal record linked
to this addiction, provided the judge is confident that there is a good chance
of rehabilitation and that the level of supervision will be sufficient to
ensure that the offender complies with the sentence. 

 








73               
This last point concerning the level of supervision in the community
must be underscored.  As the Alberta Court of Appeal stressed in Brady, supra,
at para. 135:

 

A conditional sentence drafted in the abstract without knowledge of
what actual supervision and institutions and programs are available and
suitable for this offender is often worse than tokenism: it is a sham.

 

 

Hence, the
judge must know or be made aware of the supervision available in the community
by the supervision officer or by counsel.  If the level of supervision
available in the community is not sufficient to ensure safety of the community,
the judge should  impose a sentence of incarceration.

   

(ii)  Gravity of the Damage in the Event of Re-offence   

 

74               
Once the judge finds that the risk of recidivism is minimal, the second
factor to consider is the gravity of the potential damage in case of
re-offence.  Particularly in the case of violent offenders, a small risk of
very harmful future crime may well warrant a conclusion that the prerequisite
is not met: see Brady, supra, at para. 63.

 

(d)  Risk of Economic Harm Can Be Taken Into Consideration

 

75               
The meaning of the phrase “would not endanger the safety of the
community” should not be restricted to a consideration of the danger to
physical or psychological safety of persons.  In my view, this part of s.
742.1(b) cannot be given this narrow meaning.  As Finch J.A. stated in Ursel,
supra, at p. 264 (dissenting in part but endorsed by the majority on
this issue, at p. 287):

 








I would not give to this phrase the restricted
meaning for which the defence contends.  Members of our community have a
reasonable expectation of safety not only in respect of their persons, but in
respect as well of their property and financial resources.  When homes are
broken into, motor-vehicles are stolen, employers are defrauded of monies, or
financial papers are forged, the safety of  the community is, in my view
endangered.  We go to considerable lengths to protect and secure ourselves
against the losses that may result from these sorts of crimes, and I think most
ordinary citizens would regard themselves as threatened or endangered where
their property or financial resources are exposed to the risk of loss.

 

76               
I agree with this reasoning.  The phrase “would not endanger the safety
of the community” should be construed broadly, and include the risk of any
criminal activity.  Such a broad interpretation encompasses the risk of
economic harm.

 

(4)          Consistent with
the  Fundamental Purpose and Principles of Sentencing Set Out in Sections 718
to 718.2

 

77               
Once the sentencing judge has found the offender guilty of an offence
for which there is no minimum term of imprisonment, has rejected both a
probationary sentence and a penitentiary term as inappropriate, and is
satisfied that the offender would not endanger the community, the judge must
then consider whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to  718.2.

 

78               
A consideration of the principles set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 will determine
whether the offender should serve his or her sentence in the community or in
jail.  The sentencing principles also inform the determination of the duration
of these sentences and, if a conditional sentence, the nature of the conditions
to be imposed.

 

(a)  Offences Presumptively Excluded from the Conditional Sentencing
Regime?

 








79               
Section 742.1 does not exclude any offences from the conditional
sentencing regime except those with a minimum term of imprisonment.  Parliament
could have easily excluded specific offences in addition to those with a
mandatory minimum term of imprisonment but chose not to.  As Rosenberg J.A.
held in Wismayer, supra, at p. 31: 

 

Parliament clearly envisaged that a conditional sentence would be
available even in cases of crimes of violence that are not punishable by a
minimum term of imprisonment.  Thus, s. 742.2 requires the court, before
imposing a conditional sentence, to consider whether a firearms prohibition under
s. 100  of the Criminal Code  is applicable.  Such orders may only be
imposed for indictable offences having a maximum sentence of ten years or more
“in the commission of which violence against a person is used, threatened, or
attempted” (s. 100(1) ) and for certain weapons and drug offences (s. 100(2) ).  

 

Thus, a
conditional sentence is available in principle for all offences in which
the statutory prerequisites are satisfied.

 

80               
Several parties in the appeals before us argued that the fundamental
purpose and principles of sentencing support a presumption against conditional
sentences for certain offences.  The Attorney General of Canada and the
Attorney General for Ontario submitted that a conditional sentence would rarely
be appropriate for offences such as: sexual offences against children;
aggravated sexual assault; manslaughter; serious fraud or theft; serious
morality offences; impaired or dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm;
and trafficking or possession of certain narcotics.   They submitted that this
followed from the principle of proportionality as well as from a consideration
of the objectives of denunciation and deterrence.  A number of appellate court
decisions support this position. 

 








81               
In my view, while the gravity of such offences is clearly relevant to
determining whether a conditional sentence is appropriate in the circumstances,
it would be both unwise and unnecessary to establish judicially created
presumptions that conditional sentences are inappropriate for specific offences. 
Offence-specific presumptions introduce unwarranted rigidity in the
determination of whether a conditional sentence is a just and appropriate
sanction.  Such presumptions do not accord with the principle of
proportionality set out in s. 718.1 and the value of individualization in
sentencing, nor are they necessary to achieve the important objectives of
uniformity and consistency in the use of conditional sentences.

 

82               
This Court has held on a number of occasions that sentencing is an
individualized process, in which the trial judge has considerable discretion in
fashioning a fit sentence.  The rationale behind this approach stems from the
principle of proportionality, the fundamental principle of sentencing, which
provides that a sentence must be proportional to the gravity of the offence and
the degree of responsibility of the offender.  Proportionality requires an
examination of the specific circumstances of both the offender and the offence
so that the “punishment fits the crime”.  As a by-product of such an
individualized approach, there will be inevitable variation in sentences
imposed for particular crimes.  In M. (C.A.), supra, I stated, at
para. 92: 

 

It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a
uniform sentence for a particular crime. . . . Sentencing is an inherently
individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a
similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of
academic abstraction.  As well, sentences for a particular offence should be
expected to vary to some degree across various communities and regions in this
country, as the “just and appropriate” mix of accepted sentencing goals will
depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community
where the crime occurred.

 

83               
My difficulty with the suggestion that the proportionality principle
presumptively excludes certain offences from the conditional sentencing regime
is that such an approach focuses inordinately on the gravity of the offence and
insufficiently on the moral blameworthiness of the offender.  This
fundamentally misconstrues the nature of the principle.  Proportionality
requires that full consideration be given to both factors.  As s. 718.1
provides: 

 








A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and
the degree of responsibility of the offender. [Emphasis added.]

 

84               
Some appellate courts have held that once the statutory prerequisites
are satisfied  there ought to be a presumption in favour of a conditional
sentence.  In the instant appeal, Helper J.A. found at p. 112  that:

 

Generally (though certainly not in all cases), it will be that, when a
sentencing judge has attributed the appropriate weight to each of the relevant
principles in determining that a fit sentence would be less than two years and
has found that the offender would not be a danger to the community, a decision
to allow the offender to serve his sentence in the community will be consistent
with ss. 718 to 718.2.  

 

85               
It is possible to interpret these comments as implying that once the
judge has found that the prerequisites to a conditional sentence are met, a
conditional sentence would presumably be consistent with the fundamental
purpose and principles of sentencing.  Assuming that Helper J.A. intended to suggest
that there ought to be a presumption in favour of a conditional sentence once
the prerequisites are met, I respectfully disagree with her.  For the same
reasons that I rejected the use of presumptions against conditional sentences,
I also reject presumptions in favour of them.  The particular circumstances of
the offender and the offence must be considered in each case.  

 

(b)  A Need for Starting Points?

 








86               
An individualized sentencing regime will of necessity entail a certain
degree of disparity in sentencing.  I recognize that it is important for
appellate courts to minimize, to the greatest extent possible, “the disparity
of sentences imposed by sentencing judges for similar offenders and similar
offences committed throughout Canada”: M. (C.A.), supra, at para.
92.  Towards this end, this Court held in R. v. McDonnell, [1997]
1 S.C.R. 948, that “starting point sentences” may be set out as guides to lower
courts in order to achieve greater uniformity and consistency.  I am also
acutely aware of the need to provide guidance to lower courts regarding the use
of the conditional sentence, as it is a new sanction which has created a
considerable amount of controversy and confusion in its short life.

 

87               
That said, I do not find it necessary to resort to starting points in
respect of specific offences to provide guidance as to the proper use of
conditional sentences.   In my view, the risks posed by starting points, in the
form of offence-specific presumptions in favour of incarceration, outweigh their
benefits.  Starting points are most useful in circumstances where there is the
potential for a large disparity between sentences imposed for a particular
crime because the range of sentence set out in the Code is particularly
broad.  In the case of conditional sentences, however, the statutory
prerequisites of s. 742.1 considerably narrow the range of cases in which a
conditional sentence may be imposed.  A conditional sentence may only be
imposed on non-dangerous offenders who would otherwise have received a jail
sentence of less than two years.  Accordingly, the potential disparity of
sentence between those offenders who were candidates for a conditional sentence
and received a jail term, and those who received a conditional sentence, is
relatively small.

 

88               
The minimal benefits of uniformity in these circumstances are exceeded
by the costs of the associated loss of individualization in sentencing.  By
creating offence-specific starting points, there is a risk that these starting
points will evolve into de facto minimum sentences of imprisonment. 
This would thwart Parliament’s intention of not excluding particular categories
of offence from the conditional sentencing regime.  It could also result in the
imposition of disproportionate sentences in some cases. 

 








89               
Given the narrow range of application for conditional sentences, I am of
the opinion that a consideration of the principles of sentencing themselves,
without offence-specific presumptions, can provide sufficient guidance as to
whether a conditional sentence should be imposed.  Some principles militate in
favour of a conditional sentence, whereas others favour incarceration.  It is
the task of this Court to articulate, in general terms, which principles favour
each sanction.  Although it cannot ensure uniformity of result, the
articulation of these principles can at least ensure uniformity in approach to
the imposition of conditional sentences.  It is to this task that I now turn.

 

(c)  Principles Militating For and Against a Conditional Sentence


 

90               
First, a consideration of ss. 718.2(d) and 718.2(e) leads
me to the conclusion that serious consideration should be given to the
imposition of a conditional sentence in all cases where the first three
statutory prerequisites are satisfied.  Sections 718.2(d) and 718.2(e)
codify the important principle of restraint in sentencing and were specifically
enacted, along with s. 742.1, to help reduce the rate of incarceration in
Canada.   Accordingly, it would be an error in principle not to consider the
possibility of a conditional sentence seriously when the statutory
prerequisites are met.  Failure to advert to the possibility of a conditional
sentence in reasons for sentence where there are reasonable grounds for finding
that the first three statutory prerequisites have been met may well constitute
reversible error.

 








91               
I pause here to consider an interpretive difficulty posed by s. 718.2(e). 
By its terms, s. 718.2(e) requires judges to consider “all available
sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the
circumstances” (emphasis added).  A conditional sentence, however, is defined
as a sentence of imprisonment.  As a sentence of imprisonment, it cannot be an
alternative to imprisonment.  It would therefore appear as though s. 718.2(e)
has no bearing on the sentencing judge’s decision as to whether a conditional
sentence or a jail term should be imposed.  Indeed, if interpreted in the
technical sense ascribed to imprisonment in Part XXIII of the Code, s.
718.2(e) would only be relevant to the judge’s preliminary determination
as to whether a sentence of imprisonment, as opposed to a probationary measure,
should be imposed.  Once the sentencing judge rejects a probationary sentence
as inappropriate, the legislative force of s. 718.2(e) is arguably spent.

 

92               
This interpretation seems to fly in the face of Parliament’s intention
in enacting s. 718.2(e)  –   reducing the rate of incarceration.  As
this Court held in Gladue, supra, at para. 40:

 

The availability of the conditional sentence of
imprisonment, in particular, alters the sentencing landscape in a manner which
gives an entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should be
resorted to only where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the
circumstances.  The creation of the conditional sentence suggests, on its
face, a desire to lessen the use of incarceration.  The general principle
expressed in s. 718.2(e) must be construed and applied in this light.
[Emphasis added.]

 

Moreover, if
this interpretation of s. 718.2(e) were adopted, it could lead to absurd
results in relation to aboriginal offenders.  The particular circumstances of
aboriginal offenders would only be relevant in deciding whether to impose
probationary sentences, and not in deciding whether a conditional sentence
should be preferred to incarceration.  This would greatly diminish the remedial
purpose animating Parliament’s enactment of this provision, which contemplates
the greater use of conditional sentences and other alternatives to
incarceration in cases of aboriginal offenders.

 

93               
The language used in the French version avoids this difficulty.  The
French version reads as follows:








 

                          718.2  Le tribunal détermine la peine à infliger compte tenu également
des principes suivants:

 

. . .

 

e) l’examen de
toutes les sanctions substitutives applicables qui sont justifiées dans les
circonstances, plus particulièrement en ce qui concerne les délinquants
autochtones. [Emphasis added.]

 

94               
The use of “sanctions substitutives” for “sanctions other than
imprisonment” in the French version of this provision means that s. 718.2(e)
plays a role not only in the decision as to whether imprisonment or
probationary measures should be imposed (preliminary step of the analysis), but
also in the decision as to whether to impose a conditional sentence of
imprisonment since conditional sentences are clearly “sanctions
substitutives” to incarceration. 

 

95               
The French version and the English version of s. 718.2(e) are
therefore in conflict.  In conformity with a long-standing principle of
interpretation, to resolve the conflict between the two official versions, we
have to look for the meaning common to both: see for instance Kwiatkowsky v.
Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 856, at pp. 863-64;
Gravel v. City of St-Léonard, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 660, at p. 669; Pfizer
Co. v. Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise, [1977] 1
S.C.R. 456, at pp. 464-65; Tupper v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 589, at p.
593; Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada v. T. Eaton Co., [1956]
S.C.R. 610, at p. 614; P.-A. Côté, Interprétation des lois (3rd ed.
1999), at pp. 412-15.  Accordingly, the word “imprisonment” in s. 718.2(e)
should be interpreted as “incarceration” rather than in its technical sense of
encompassing both incarceration and a conditional sentence.  Read in this
light, s. 718.2(e) clearly exerts an influence on the sentencing judge’s
determination as to whether to impose a conditional sentence as opposed to a
jail term.

 








96               
Both ss. 718.2(d) and 718.2(e) seek to vindicate the
important objective of restraint in the use of incarceration.  However, neither
seeks to do so at all costs.  Section 718.2(d) provides that “an
offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may
be appropriate in the circumstances” (emphasis added).  Section 718.2(e)
provides that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered” (emphasis added).  In
my view, a determination of when less restrictive sanctions are “appropriate”
and alternatives to incarceration “reasonable” in the circumstances  requires a
consideration of the other principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to
718.2  

 

97               
In determining which principles favour of a conditional sentence and
which favour incarceration, it is necessary to consider again the nature and
purpose of the conditional sentence.  Through an appreciation of Parliament’s
intention in enacting this new sanction and the mischief it seeks to redress,
trial judges will be better able to make appropriate use of this innovative
tool.

 

98               
The conditional sentence, as I have already noted, was introduced in the
amendments to Part XXIII of the Code.  Two of the main objectives underlying
the reform of Part XXIII were to reduce the use of incarceration as a sanction
and to give greater prominence to the principles of restorative justice in
sentencing – the objectives of rehabilitation, reparation to the victim and the
community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender.

 








99               
The conditional sentence facilitates the achievement of both of
Parliament’s objectives.  It affords the sentencing judge the opportunity to
craft a sentence with appropriate conditions that can lead to the
rehabilitation of the offender, reparations to the community, and the promotion
of a sense of responsibility in ways that jail cannot.  However, it is also a
punitive sanction.  Indeed, it is the punitive aspect of a conditional sentence
that distinguishes it from probation.  As discussed above, it was not
Parliament’s intention that offenders who would otherwise have gone to jail for
up to two years less a day now be given probation or some equivalent thereof.  


 

100           
Thus, a conditional sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative
objectives.  To the extent that both punitive and restorative objectives can be
achieved in a given case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction
than incarceration.  Where the need for punishment is particularly pressing,
and there is little opportunity to achieve any restorative objectives,
incarceration will likely be the more attractive sanction.  However, even where
restorative objectives cannot be readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will
be preferable to incarceration in cases where a conditional sentence can
achieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence as effectively as
incarceration.  This follows from the principle of restraint in s. 718.2(d)
and (e), which militates in favour of alternatives to incarceration
where appropriate in the circumstances.

 

101           
I turn now to the question of when a conditional sentence may be
appropriate having regard to the six sentencing objectives set out in s. 718. 

 

(i)  Denunciation

 

102           
Denunciation is the communication of society's condemnation of the
offender's conduct.  In M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 81, I wrote: 

 








In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic,
collective statement that the offender’s conduct should be punished for
encroaching on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined within our
substantive criminal law.  As Lord Justice Lawton stated in R. v. Sargeant
(1974), 60 Cr. App. R. 74, at p. 77: “society, through the courts, must show
its abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which the
courts can show this is by the sentences they pass”.

 

 

Incarceration
will usually provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence, as a
conditional sentence is generally a more lenient sentence than a jail term of
equivalent duration.  That said, a conditional sentence can still provide a
significant amount of denunciation.  This is particularly so when onerous
conditions are imposed and the duration of the conditional sentence is extended
beyond the duration of the jail sentence that would ordinarily have been
imposed in the circumstances.  I will discuss each point in turn.

 

103           
First, the conditions should have a punitive aspect.  Indeed, the need
for punitive conditions is the reason why a probationary sentence was rejected
and a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years imposed.  As stated
above, conditions such as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception. 
This means that the offender should be confined to his or her home except when
working, attending school, or fulfilling other conditions of his or her
sentence, e.g. community service, meeting with the supervisor, or participating
in treatment programs.  Of course, there will need to be exceptions for medical
emergencies, religious observance, and the like.  

 








104           
Second, although a literal reading of s. 742.1 suggests that a
conditional sentence must be of equivalent duration to the jail term that would
otherwise have been imposed,  I have explained earlier why such a literal
interpretation of s. 742.1 should be eschewed.  Instead, the preferred approach
is to have the judge reject a probationary sentence and a penitentiary term as
inappropriate in the circumstances, and then consider whether a conditional
sentence of less than two years would be consistent with the fundamental
purpose and principles of sentencing, provided the statutory prerequisites are
met.  This approach does not require that there be any equivalence between the
duration of the conditional sentence and the jail term that would otherwise
have been imposed.  The sole requirement is that the duration and conditions of
a conditional sentence make for a just and appropriate sentence: see Brady, supra, at para. 111;  Ursel,
supra, at pp. 284-86 and 291-92; Pierce, supra, at p. 39;
J. V. Roberts, “The Hunt for the Paper Tiger:  Conditional Sentencing after
Brady” (1999), 42 Crim. L.Q. 38, at pp. 47-52.

 

105           
The stigma of a conditional sentence with house arrest should not be
underestimated.  Living in the community under strict conditions where fellow
residents are well aware of the offender’s criminal misconduct can provide
ample denunciation in many cases.   In certain circumstances, the shame of
encountering members of the community may make it even more difficult for the
offender to serve his or her sentence in the community than in prison.

  

106           
The amount of denunciation provided by a conditional sentence will be
heavily dependent on the circumstances of the offender, the nature of the
conditions imposed, and the community in which the sentence is to be served. 
As a general matter, the more serious the offence and the greater the need for
denunciation, the longer and more onerous the conditional sentence should be.  However,
there may be certain circumstances in which the need for denunciation is so
pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express
society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct.  

 

(ii)  Deterrence

 








107           
Incarceration, which is ordinarily a harsher sanction, may provide more
deterrence than a conditional sentence.  Judges should be wary, however, of
placing too much weight on deterrence when choosing between a conditional
sentence and incarceration: see Wismayer, supra, at p. 36.  The
empirical evidence suggests that the deterrent effect of incarceration is
uncertain: see generally Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach, supra, 
at pp. 136-37.  Moreover, a conditional sentence can provide significant
deterrence if sufficiently punitive conditions are imposed and the public is
made aware of the severity of these sentences.  There is also the possibility
of deterrence through the use of community service orders, including those in
which the offender may be obliged to speak to members of the community about
the evils of the particular criminal conduct in which he or she engaged,
assuming the offender were amenable to such a condition.  Nevertheless, there
may be circumstances in which the need for deterrence will warrant
incarceration.  This will depend in part on whether the offence is one in which
the effects of incarceration are likely to have a real deterrent effect, as
well as on the circumstances of the community in which the offences were
committed.

 

(iii) Separation

 

108           
The objective of separation is not applicable in determining whether a
conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and
principles of sentencing because it is a prerequisite of a conditional sentence
that the offender not pose a danger to the community.  Accordingly, it is not
necessary to completely separate the offender from society.  To the extent that
incarceration, which leads to the complete separation of offenders, is
warranted in circumstances where the statutory prerequisites are met, it is as
a result of the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, not the need for
separation as such.

 

(iv)  Restorative Objectives

 








109           
While incarceration may provide for more denunciation and deterrence
than a conditional sentence, a conditional sentence is generally better suited
to achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations, and
promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender.  As this Court held in Gladue,
supra, at para. 43, “[r]estorative sentencing goals do not usually
correlate with the use of prison as a sanction”.  The importance of these goals
is not to be underestimated, as they are primarily responsible for lowering the
rate of recidivism.  Consequently, when the objectives of rehabilitation,
reparation, and promotion of a sense of responsibility may realistically be
achieved in the case of a particular offender, a conditional sentence will likely
be the appropriate sanction, subject to the denunciation and deterrence
considerations outlined above. 

 

110           
 I will now consider examples of conditions that seek to vindicate these
objectives.  There are any number of conditions a judge may impose in order to
rehabilitate an offender.  Mandatory treatment orders may be imposed, such as
psychological counseling and alcohol and drug rehabilitation.  It is well known
that sentencing an offender to a term of incarceration for an offence related
to a drug addiction, without addressing the addiction, will probably not lead
to the rehabilitation of the offender.  The Final Report of the Commission
of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs (1973) noted at p. 59 that:

 

     These adverse effects of imprisonment are particularly reflected
in the treatment of drug offenders.  Our investigations suggest that there is
considerable circulation of drugs within penal institutions, that offenders are
reinforced in their attachment to the drug culture, and that in many cases they
are introduced to certain kinds of drug use by prison contacts.  Thus
imprisonment does not cut off all contact with drugs or the drug subculture,
nor does it cut off contact with individual drug users.  Actually, it increases
exposure to the influence of chronic, harmful drug users.

 








111           
House arrest may also have a rehabilitative effect to a certain extent
in so far as it prevents the offender from engaging in habitual anti-social
associations and promotes pro-social behaviors such as attendance at work or
educational institutions: see Roberts, “The Hunt for the Paper Tiger:
Conditional Sentencing after Brady”, supra, at p. 65.    

 

112           
The objectives of reparations to the victim and the community, as well
as the promotion of a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment
of the harm done to victims and to the community may also be well served by a
conditional sentence.  For example, in some cases, restitution orders to
compensate the victim may be made a condition.  Furthermore, the imposition of
a condition of community service can assist the offender in making reparations
to the community and in promoting a sense of responsibility.  An interesting
possibility in this regard would be an order that the offender speak in public
about the unfortunate consequences of his or her conduct, assuming the offender
were amenable to such a condition.  Not only could such an order promote a
sense of responsibility and an acknowledgment of the harm done by the offender,
it could also further the objective of deterrence, as I discussed above.  In my
view, the use of community service orders should be encouraged, provided that
there are suitable programs available for the offender in the community.  By
increasing the use of community service orders, offenders will be seen by
members of the public as paying back their debt to society.  This will assist
in contributing to public respect for the law.

 

(v) Summary

     








113           
In sum, in determining whether a conditional sentence would be
consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing,
sentencing judges should consider which sentencing objectives figure most
prominently in the factual circumstances of the particular case before them. 
Where a combination of both punitive and restorative objectives may be
achieved, a conditional sentence will likely be more appropriate than
incarceration.  In determining whether restorative objectives can be satisfied
in a particular case, the judge should consider the offender’s prospects of
rehabilitation, including whether the offender has proposed a particular plan
of rehabilitation; the availability of appropriate community service and
treatment programs; whether the offender has acknowledged his or her wrongdoing
and expresses remorse; as well as the victim’s wishes as revealed by the victim
impact statement (consideration of which is now mandatory pursuant to s. 722 of
the Code).  This list is not exhaustive.  

 

114           
Where punitive objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are
particularly pressing, such as cases in which there are aggravating
circumstances, incarceration will generally be the preferable sanction.  This
may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might be achieved by
a conditional sentence.  Conversely, a conditional sentence may provide
sufficient denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative
objectives are of diminished importance, depending on the nature of the
conditions imposed, the duration of the conditional sentence, and the
circumstances of the offender and the community in which the conditional
sentence is to be served.  

 

115           
Finally, it bears pointing out that a conditional sentence may be
imposed even in circumstances where there are aggravating circumstances
relating to the offence or the offender.  Aggravating circumstances will
obviously increase the need for denunciation and deterrence.  However, it would
be a mistake to rule out the possibility of a conditional sentence ab initio
simply because aggravating factors are present.  I repeat that each case must
be considered individually.

 








116           
Sentencing judges will frequently be confronted with situations in which
some objectives militate in favour of a conditional sentence, whereas others
favour incarceration.  In those cases, the trial judge will be called upon to
weigh the various objectives in fashioning a fit sentence.  As La Forest J.
stated in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 329, “[i]n a rational
system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention, deterrence,
retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of the crime
and the circumstances of the offender”.  There is no easy test or formula that
the judge can apply in weighing these factors.  Much will depend on the good
judgment and wisdom of sentencing judges, whom Parliament vested with
considerable discretion in making these determinations pursuant to  s. 718.3.

 

(d)  Appropriate Conditions    

 

117           
In the event that a judge chooses to impose a conditional sentence,
there are five compulsory conditions listed in s. 742.3(1) that must be
imposed.  The judge also has considerable discretion in imposing optional
conditions pursuant to s. 742.3(2).  There are a number of principles that
should guide the judge in exercising this discretion.  First,  the conditions
must ensure the safety of the community.  Second, conditions must be tailored
to fit the particular circumstances of the offender and the offence.  The type
of conditions imposed will be a function of the sentencing judge’s creativity. 
However, conditions will prove fruitless if the offender is incapable of
abiding by them, and will increase the probability that the offender will be
incarcerated as a result of breaching them.  Third,  punitive conditions such
as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception.  Fourth, the conditions
must be realistically enforceable.  This requires a consideration of the
available resources in the community in which the sentence is to be served.  I
agree with Rosenberg J.A., who, in “Recent Developments in Sentencing”, a paper
prepared for the National Judicial Institute’s Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
Education Seminar in Halifax, February 25-26, 1999, at p. 63, wrote that: 

 








. . . the courts must be careful not to impose conditions that are
purely cosmetic and are incapable of effective enforcement.  For example, I
would think that any condition that can only be effectively enforced through an
intolerable intrusion into the privacy of innocent persons would be
problematic.  Conditions that impose an unacceptable burden on the supervisor
might also be of dubious value.  If the conditions that the court imposes are
impractical, the justice system will be brought into disrepute.

 

 

D.  Burden of Proof

 

118           
It is submitted by the intervener the Attorney General for Ontario that
the offender has the burden of proving that a conditional sentence should be
imposed pursuant to s. 742.1.  According to the Attorney General: 

 

[W]hen a sentencing court determines that a reformatory sentence of
imprisonment is an appropriate sentence for an offender, there is, in effect, a
rebuttable presumption that this custodial sentence will prevail
unless the offender can convince the sentencing Court to make the
sentence of imprisonment “conditional”.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

119           
The Attorney General for Ontario’s position seems to be premised on a rigid
two-step approach, which I rejected for the reasons explained earlier.  The
Attorney General submits that the offender has to establish that: (a) he or she
would not endanger the safety of the community by serving a conditional
sentence; and (b) the imposition of a conditional sentence would be consistent
with the fundamental purpose and principles set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.

 

120           
I disagree. The wording used in s. 742.1 does not attribute to either
party the onus of establishing that the offender should or should not receive a
conditional sentence.  To inform his or her decision about the appropriate
sentence, the judge can take into consideration all the evidence, no matter who
adduces it (Ursel, supra, at pp. 264-65 and  287).

 








121           
In matters of sentencing, while each party is expected to establish
elements in support of its position as to the appropriate sentence that should
be imposed, the ultimate decision as to what constitutes the best disposition
is left to the discretion of the sentencing judge.  This message is explicit in
s. 718.3(1) and (2):

 

718.3 (1)  Where an enactment prescribes
different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the
punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the
enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits
the offence.

 

(2)  Where an enactment prescribes a punishment in
respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the
limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that
convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum
punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.

 

 

122           
The sentencing judge can take into account the submissions and evidence
presented by counsel (s. 723), but is in no way bound by them in the decision
as to the sentence.  Having said this, in practice, it will generally be the
offender who is best situated to convince the judge that a conditional sentence
is indeed appropriate.  Therefore, it would be in the offender’s best interests
to establish those elements militating in favour of a conditional sentence: see
Ursel, supra, at pp. 264-65; R. v. Fleet
(1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 26.  For instance, the
offender should inform the judge of his or her remorse, willingness to repair
and  acknowledgment of responsibility, and propose a plan of rehabilitation.  The
offender could also convince the judge that he or she would not endanger the
safety of the community if appropriate conditions were imposed.  It would be to
the great benefit of the offender to make submissions in this regard.  I would
also note the importance of the role of the supervision officer in informing
the judge on these issues.

 








E.  Deference Owed to Sentencing Judges

 

123           
In  recent years, this Court has repeatedly stated that the sentence
imposed by a trial court is entitled to considerable deference from appellate
courts: see  Shropshire, supra, at paras. 46-50; M. (C.A.),
supra, at paras. 89-94; McDonnell, supra, at paras. 15-17
(majority); R. v. W. (G.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 597, at
paras. 18-19.  In M. (C.A.), at para. 90, I wrote:

 

      Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a
relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of
appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the
sentence is demonstrably unfit.  Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges
with a discretion to determine the appropriate degree and kind of
punishment under the Criminal Code . [Emphasis in original.] 

    

 

124           
Several provisions of Part XXIII confirm that Parliament intended to
confer a wide discretion upon the sentencing judge.  As a general rule, ss.
718.3(1) and 718.3(2) provide that the degree and kind of punishment to be
imposed is left to the discretion of the sentencing judge.  Moreover, the
opening words of s. 718 specify that the sentencing judge must seek to achieve
the fundamental purpose of sentencing “by imposing just sanctions that have one
or more of the following objectives” (emphasis added).  In the context of
the conditional sentence, s. 742.1 provides that the judge “may” impose a
conditional sentence and enjoys a wide discretion in the drafting of the
appropriate conditions, pursuant to s. 742.3(2).

 








125           
Although an appellate court might entertain a different opinion as to
what objectives should be pursued and the best way to do so, that difference
will generally not constitute an error of law justifying interference. 
Further, minor errors in the sequence of application of s. 742.1 may not
warrant intervention by appellate courts.  Again, I stress that appellate
courts should not second-guess sentencing judges unless the sentence imposed is
demonstrably unfit.   

 

126           
As explained in M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 91:

 

     This deferential standard of review has profound functional
justifications. As Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire, at para. 46,
where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding over the trial of
the offender, he or she will have had the comparative advantage of having seen
and heard the witnesses to the crime. But in the absence of a full trial, where
the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only
enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case
in both Shropshire and this instance), the argument in favour of
deference remains compelling. A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of
advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the
sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender. A sentencing judge
also possesses the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having
served on the front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most
importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the
community which has suffered the consequences of the offender's crime. As such,
the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of
sentencing goals that will be ""just and appropriate"" for the protection
of that community. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a
delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of
sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the
circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs
and current conditions of and in the community.  The discretion of a
sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly. [Emphasis added.]

 

This last
justification is particularly relevant in the case of conditional sentences. 
Crafting appropriate conditions requires knowledge of both the needs and
resources of the community.  

    

VI.      Summary

 

127           
At this point, a short summary of what has been said in these reasons
might be useful:

 








1.  Bill C-41 in general and the conditional sentence in particular
were enacted both to reduce reliance on incarceration as a sanction and to
increase the use of principles of restorative justice in sentencing.

 

2. A conditional sentence should be distinguished from probationary
measures.  Probation is primarily a rehabilitative sentencing tool.  By
contrast, Parliament intended conditional sentences to include both punitive
and rehabilitative aspects.  Therefore, conditional sentences should generally
include punitive conditions that are restrictive of the offender's liberty. 
Conditions such as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception.  

 

3.  No offences are excluded from the conditional sentencing regime
except those with a minimum term of imprisonment, nor should there be
presumptions in favour of or against a conditional sentence for specific
offences.  

 

4. The requirement in s. 742.1(a) that the judge impose a
sentence of imprisonment of less than two years does not require the judge to
first impose a sentence of imprisonment of a fixed duration before considering
whether that sentence can be served in the community.  Although this approach
is suggested by the text of s. 742.1(a), it is unrealistic and could
lead to unfit sentences in some cases.  Instead, a purposive interpretation of
s. 742.1(a) should be adopted.  In a preliminary determination, the
sentencing judge should reject a penitentiary term and probationary measures as
inappropriate.  Having determined that the appropriate range of sentence is a
term of imprisonment of less than two years, the judge should then consider
whether it is appropriate for the offender to serve his or her sentence in the
community.

 








5.  As a corollary of the purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(a),
a conditional sentence need not be of equivalent duration to the sentence of
incarceration that would otherwise have been imposed.  The sole requirement is
that the duration and conditions of a conditional sentence make for a just and
appropriate sentence.

 

6.  The requirement in s. 742.1(b) that the judge be satisfied
that the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender
serving his or her sentence in the community is a condition precedent to the
imposition of a conditional sentence, and not the primary consideration in
determining whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.  In making this
determination, the judge should consider the risk posed by the specific
offender, not the broader risk of whether the imposition of a conditional
sentence would endanger the safety of the community by providing insufficient
general deterrence or undermining general respect for the law.  Two factors
should be taken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and
(2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence.  A
consideration of the risk posed by the offender should include the risk of any
criminal activity, and not be limited solely to the risk of physical or
psychological harm to individuals. 

 

7. Once the prerequisites of s. 742.1 are satisfied, the judge should
give serious consideration to the possibility of a conditional sentence in all
cases by examining whether a conditional sentence is consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2. 
This follows from Parliament’s clear message to the judiciary to reduce the use
of incarceration as a sanction. 

 








8. A conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and
deterrence.  As a general matter, the more serious the offence, the longer and
more onerous the conditional sentence should be.  There may be some
circumstances, however, where the need for denunciation or deterrence is so
pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express
society's condemnation of the offender's conduct or to deter similar conduct in
the future.

 

9.  Generally, a conditional sentence will be better than incarceration
at achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations to the
victim and the community, and promotion of a sense of responsibility in the
offender and acknowledgment of the harm done to the victim and the community.

        

10.  Where a combination of both punitive and restorative objectives
may be achieved, a conditional sentence will likely be more appropriate than
incarceration.  Where objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are
particularly pressing, incarceration will generally be the preferable
sanction.  This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might
be achieved.  However, a conditional sentence may provide sufficient
denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative objectives are
of lesser importance, depending on the nature of the conditions imposed, the
duration of the sentence, and the circumstances of both the offender and the
community in which the conditional sentence is to be served.

 

11.  A conditional sentence may be imposed even where there are
aggravating circumstances, although the need for denunciation and deterrence
will increase in these circumstances.  

 








12.  No party is under a burden of proof to establish that a
conditional sentence is either appropriate or inappropriate in the
circumstances.  The judge should consider all relevant evidence, no matter by
whom it is adduced.  However, it would be in the offender’s best interests to
establish elements militating in favour of a conditional sentence.

 

13.  Sentencing judges have a wide discretion in the choice of the
appropriate sentence.  They are entitled to considerable deference from
appellate courts.  As explained in M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 90:
""Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant
factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should
only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is
demonstrably unfit”.

 

 

VII.     Application to the Case at Hand

 

128           
In the case at hand, Keyser J. considered that a term of imprisonment of
18 months was appropriate and declined to permit the respondent to serve his
term in the community.  She found  that, while the respondent would not
endanger the safety of the community by serving a conditional sentence, such a
sentence would not be in conformity with the objectives of s. 718.  In her
view, even if incarceration was not necessary to deter the respondent from
similar future conduct or necessary for his rehabilitation, incarceration was necessary
to denounce the conduct of the respondent and to deter others from engaging in
similar conduct.

 








129           
While Keyser J. seems to have proceeded according to a rigid two-step
process, in deviation from the approach I have set out, I am not convinced that
an 18-month sentence of incarceration was demonstrably unfit for these offences
and this offender.  I point out that the offences here were very serious, and
that they had resulted in a death and in severe bodily harm.  Moreover,
dangerous driving and impaired driving may be offences for which harsh
sentences plausibly provide general deterrence.  These crimes are often
committed by otherwise law-abiding persons, with good employment records and
families.  Arguably, such persons are the ones most likely to be deterred by
the threat of severe penalties: see R. v. McVeigh (1985),
22 C.C.C. (3d) 145 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 150;  R. v. Biancofiore
(1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 18-24; R. v. Blakeley
(1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 541 (C.A.), at pp. 542-43.

 

130           
I hasten to add that these comments should not be taken as a directive
that conditional sentences can never be imposed for offences such as dangerous
driving or impaired driving.  In fact, were I a trial judge, I might have found
that a conditional sentence would have been appropriate in this case.  The
respondent is still very young, he had no prior record and no convictions since
the accident, he seems completely rehabilitated, he wants to go back to school,
he has already suffered a lot by causing the death of a friend and was himself
in a coma for some time.  To make sure that the objectives of denunciation and
general deterrence would have been sufficiently addressed, I might have imposed
conditions such as house arrest and a community service order requiring the
offender to speak to designated groups about the consequences of dangerous
driving, as was the case in Parker, supra, at p. 239,  and R.
v. Hollinsky (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 472 (Ont. C.A.).  

 








131           
However, trial judges are closer to their community and know better what
would be acceptable to their community.  Absent evidence that the sentence
imposed by the trial judge was demonstrably unfit, the Court of Appeal should
not have interfered to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing
judge.  The trial judge did not commit a reversible error in principle and she
appropriately considered all the relevant factors.  Although the Court of
Appeal’s decision is entitled to some deference (see the companion appeal R.
v. R.A.R., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 163, 2000 SCC 8, at paras. 20-21), in my opinion
it erred in holding that the sentencing judge had given undue weight to the
objective of denunciation.  I see no ground for the Court of Appeal’s
intervention.

 

VIII.    Disposition

 

132           
I would allow the appeal.  Accordingly, the 18-month sentence of
incarceration imposed by the trial judge should be restored.  However, given
that the respondent has already served the conditional sentence imposed by the
Court of Appeal in its entirety, and that the Crown stated in oral argument
that it was not seeking any further punishment, I would stay the service of the
sentence of incarceration.

Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Fresh evidence ‑‑ Appeals against sentence ‑‑ Criteria
applicable to admission of fresh evidence on appeal from sentence ‑‑
Whether criteria are the same regardless of whether appeal relates to verdict
or to sentence  ‑‑ Whether Court of Appeal erred in admitting fresh

The accused pleaded guilty to 15 counts arising from a
robbery at a residence.  He was sentenced to several terms of imprisonment to
be served concurrently, the longest of which was a term of ten years and six
months for kidnapping.  In appealing his sentence, the accused is seeking to
have two new reports admitted in evidence to which the Crown objects.  The
first was prepared by a psychologist for Correctional Service Canada, and the
second was written by a psychiatrist at the accused’s request.  The Court of
Appeal unanimously held that the trial judge committed an error in sentencing
by comparing this case with cases involving hostage‑taking — a finding
that is not in issue in this appeal.  The majority of the Court of Appeal also
allowed the motions to adduce fresh evidence and, in view of the error by the
trial judge,  substituted a sentence of five years and six months for the
sentence of ten years and six months imposed by the trial judge.

 

Held (Arbour J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 








Per McLachlin C.J. and
L’Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Iacobucci, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.: 
Although the rules concerning sources and types of evidence are more flexible
in respect of sentence, the criteria for admitting fresh evidence on appeal are
the same regardless of whether the appeal relates to a verdict or a sentence. 
If a court of appeal thinks fit to admit fresh evidence, it will do so because
it is in the interests of justice to admit it.  The criteria set out in Palmer
call for a relaxed and flexible application and to relax them any further would
be contrary to the interests of justice.  These criteria, including the due
diligence criterion, are therefore applicable to applications to tender fresh
evidence in an appeal from a sentence.  Moreover, while the admission of fresh
evidence in an appeal from a sentence cannot lead to a new trial, unlike
admission of fresh evidence in an appeal from a verdict, this difference does
not justify the application of different tests.  The integrity of the criminal
process and the role of appeal courts could be jeopardized by the routine
admission of fresh evidence on appeal.  A two‑tier sentencing system
incompatible with the high standard of review applicable to appeals from
sentences and the underlying profound functional justifications would thus be
created.

 

In the context of the admission of fresh evidence on
appeal, the concepts of admissibility and probative value overlap.  To be
admissible, fresh evidence must be relevant and credible and, when taken with
the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result. 
The probative value of fresh evidence must thus be considered in order to
determine whether it is admissible on appeal.  To facilitate determination of
the probative value of fresh evidence, the party challenging it should test it
by making a formal motion to the court of appeal and explaining how it wishes
to proceed.  The court of appeal may in this regard exercise all the powers set
out in s. 683  of the Criminal Code .  Failure by a party to test
fresh evidence does not relieve a court of appeal from applying the criteria
established in Palmer.

 

The strict rules of a trial do not apply to a
sentencing hearing, since to determine the appropriate sentence the judge must
have as much information as possible about the accused.  The Palmer
criteria do not compromise the more flexible nature of the rules, since the
criteria concerning the admission of fresh evidence on appeal do not relate to
the sources and types of evidence.  The purpose of the due diligence criterion
is to protect the interests and the administration of justice and to preserve
the role of appeal courts.  Before admitting new opinion evidence on appeal, it
may be necessary to determine the basis of that opinion and to establish
whether the facts on which the opinion is based have been proven and are
credible.  Whether or not consent is given, the production of fresh evidence on
appeal is possible only with the leave of the court of appeal.  The court of
appeal may properly take into account the fact that the Crown has consented or
that admission is uncontested particularly when assessing the relevance,
credibility and probative value of fresh evidence.








In this case, the majority of the Court of Appeal
found that the two reports were admissible because they provided greater detail
or shed additional light on the evidence adduced at trial.  These grounds are
inadequate to justify the admission of the reports, since they could justify
the admission of a very broad range of additional evidence on appeal, which
would be contrary to the Palmer criteria and the limited role of
appellate courts in respect of sentencing.  The reports should not have been
admitted in evidence, since their probative value was not such that they might
have affected the result if they had been adduced at trial with the other
evidence.  The probative value of an expert opinion depends on the amount and
quality of admissible evidence on which it relies.  Both the psychologist and
the psychiatrist, whose report also does not meet the due diligence criterion,
based their opinions on a version of the facts that was not established or
adopted at trial.

 

For the reasons stated by the dissenting judge in the
Court of Appeal, it is, however, appropriate to substitute a sentence of imprisonment
of eight years and six months for the sentence imposed by the trial judge in
view of the error he committed in sentencing.

 








Per Arbour J.
(dissenting):  The Court of Appeal was entitled to admit the reports.  The
trial judge fundamentally mischaracterized the principal crime of which the
accused had been convicted in determining the just and appropriate sentence,
with the result that the Court of Appeal was, for all intents and purposes,
required to sentence afresh.  In these specific circumstances, it was for the
Court of Appeal to equip itself, pursuant to its broad statutory discretion
under s. 683(1)  of the Criminal Code , with whatever evidence it
deemed fit and necessary to decide the question of sentence.  In view of the
fundamental error committed by the trial judge, the principles governing the
admission of fresh evidence in appeals against sentence articulated by the
majority are not germane to the disposition of this appeal.  Further, the
majority’s stringent application of Lavallee was disagreed with.  The
nature of the sentencing process, and of the statutory rules that govern it,
contemplate that the sentencing court should have the benefit of the fullest
possible information concerning the background of the offender, from the widest
array of sources.  It is therefore inappropriate to tie the probative value of
evidence tendered under these rules to the probative value of evidence
proffered at trial, and thus, more specifically, to assess the weight of an
expert opinion on the basis of the quantity and quality of non‑hearsay
evidence introduced to support that opinion.  A sentencing court must be
entitled to receive and rely on any credible and trustworthy evidence which
assists it in obtaining as complete an understanding of the offender as
possible.  The extent to which evidence presented on sentencing conflicts with
the facts upon which the conviction was founded is a matter for the sentencing
court to take into consideration, but is not, as such, a matter for exclusion
of the evidence in question.  Here it was open to the Court of Appeal to find
both reports sufficiently credible and trustworthy to assist in the development
of a fuller picture of the accused, based as they were on the experts’ face‑to‑face
psychological assessment and evaluation of the former.

Binnie JJ. delivered by

 

Gonthier J. — 

 

I.  Issue

 

1                                  
This appeal concerns the rule that applies to the admission of fresh
evidence on appeal from a sentence.  In Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1
S.C.R. 759, this Court set out the principles governing the admission of fresh
evidence on appeal from a verdict.  In the case at bar, it must be determined
whether the criteria that apply are the same for both types of appeal, and
whether the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by admitting in evidence the
two expert reports tendered by the respondent, despite the objections of the
appellant.

 

II.  Facts

 








2                                  
On June 22, 1996, the respondent and his two accomplices went
to the home of the Fortier family intending to make off with large amounts of
money that he believed were kept in a safe.  While these three individuals were
in the shed located behind the house, they were surprised by David Fortier,
aged thirteen.  After grabbing him and tying him up, the respondent questioned
him about the location of the safe and the people who were in the house.  He
put a shotgun cartridge in his mouth, which he then taped shut, and threatened
him several times, both verbally and with his gun.  The respondent then left
the shed, taking David, with his gun pointed at the boy’s head, and escorted
him towards the house.  The two accomplices followed.  Once the respondent was
inside the house, he attacked Bertrand Fortier, David’s father, as he sat
watching television with his wife.  A fight broke out and a shot was fired in
the fray.  While this was going on, the two accomplices fled and one of the
Fortier boys called the police.  Mr. Fortier ultimately wrestled the
respondent to the ground and the police arrived shortly afterward.

 

3                                  
On December 18, 1996, the respondent pleaded guilty to fifteen
counts arising from the events of June 22, 1996.  In appealing his
sentence, the respondent is seeking to have three new reports admitted in
evidence.  The first, dated April 3, 1997, is entitled [translation] “Psychological/psychiatric
assessment report”.  This report was prepared by Marc Daigle, a psychologist,
for Correctional Service Canada.  The second report was written by Louis
Morissette, a psychiatrist, at the respondent’s request.  It is dated
March 17, 1998.  The appellant objects to the admission of these two
reports in evidence, but consents to the admission of the third report, which
is by Jacques Bigras, a psychologist.  That report is dated
March 31, 1998, and was prepared for Correctional Service Canada at
the end of a course taken by the respondent during his incarceration.

III.  Relevant Legislation

 

4                                  
The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C‑46 , are as follows:

 

683. (1)  For the purposes of an
appeal under this Part, the court of appeal may, where it considers it in the
interests of justice,

 

(a)  order the production of any writing, exhibit or
other thing connected with the proceedings;








(b)  order any witness who would have been a
compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was called at the trial,

 

(i)  to attend and be examined before the court of appeal,
or,

 

(ii)  to be examined in the manner provided by rules of court
before a judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer of the court of
appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the court of appeal
for the purpose;

 

(c)  admit, as evidence, an examination that is taken under
subparagraph (b)(ii);

 

(d)  receive the evidence, if tendered, of any
witness, including the appellant, who is a competent but not compellable
witness;

 

687. (1)  Where an appeal is taken
against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed
by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may on such
evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,

 

(a)  vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by
law for the offence of which the accused was convicted; or

 

(b)  dismiss the appeal.

 

IV. Proceedings

 

A.          Court of Québec, Criminal and Penal
Division, No. 505‑01‑008036‑960, February 19, 1997

 

 








5                                  
On December 18, 1996, the respondent pleaded guilty to charges
of kidnapping, confinement, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, disguise
with intent, pointing a firearm, possession of an unregistered restricted
weapon, robbery, breaking and entering a dwelling-house, and conspiracy to
commit robbery.  After the guilty pleas were entered, Judge Yves Lagacé ordered
that a pre-sentence report be prepared pursuant to s. 721  of the Criminal
Code .  On February 19, 1997, after hearing submissions from both
counsel and the testimony of Bernard Fortier, the accused’s brother, the
probation officer Philippe David, and the respondent himself, Judge Yves Lagacé
sentenced the respondent to several terms of imprisonment to be served
concurrently.  The longest sentence was imprisonment for a term of ten years
and six months on the kidnapping charge.

 

B.    
Quebec Court of Appeal, [1998] Q.J. No. 2680 (QL)

 

6                                  
On appeal, the respondent filed two motions seeking leave to adduce
fresh evidence, in the form of the reports by Marc Daigle, a psychologist, and
Louis Morissette, a psychiatrist.  On April 6, 1998, a panel of three
judges of the Court of Appeal (Beauregard, Gendreau and Baudouin JJ.A.)
referred that request to the panel that would determine the application to
appeal the sentence.

 

7                                  
These motions were heard by Deschamps, Chamberland and Nuss JJ.A. on
July 8, 1998.  They unanimously allowed the application for leave to appeal,
since in their view the trial judge had erred by comparing this case with cases
involving hostage‑taking for ransom in determining the appropriate
sentence.  That finding is not in issue in this appeal. The majority of
the Court of Appeal also allowed the motions to adduce fresh evidence,
Chamberland J.A. dissenting.

 

1.  Deschamps J.A. (Nuss J.A. concurring)

 








8                                  
After stating that the principles laid down in Palmer, supra,
are to be applied more flexibly in criminal cases than in civil cases, and that
the provisions governing the admission of fresh evidence on appeal are
different, depending on whether the Court is ruling in respect of a verdict
(s. 683  of the Criminal Code ) or a sentence (s. 687  of the Criminal
Code ), Deschamps J.A. said that a liberal approach must be taken on an
appeal from a sentence when the admissibility of fresh evidence is in dispute. 
At para. 12, she concluded: [translation]
“while the two sections [ss. 683  and 687  of the Criminal Code ] do
not establish different rules, it is my view that at the very least the wording
of s. 687  prescribes a flexible and liberal approach”. 

 

9                                  
Deschamps J.A. was of the opinion that the report prepared by the
psychologist, Marc Daigle, met the requirements for admissibility.  She noted
that the appellant did not ask to have this assessment done and that the report
was written less than two months after the probation officer’s report, which
was submitted to the trial judge.  In addition, the report could not have been
tendered at trial, since the psychological assessment takes place after
sentencing.  She says at para. 15:

 

[translation]  While
it is true that the appellant could have requested a separate expert opinion
following receipt of the pre-sentence report, I cannot criticize him for
failing to do so since, first, the appellant could not have foreseen that
Mr. Daigle would have had an opinion diametrically opposed to that of
Mr. David and, second, that would amount to encouraging competing expert
opinions in cases where accused persons are dissatisfied with pre-sentence
reports.

 

Ultimately,
Deschamps J.A. felt that it was in the interests of justice to admit the
psychologist’s report by Mr. Daigle in evidence, since [translation] “it explains the appellant’s past in greater
detail and shows his personality from a perspective that was not evident in the
trial record.  Whereas the pre-sentence report refers to a significant
probability of reoffending, the psychologist’s report by Mr. Daigle states the
opposite” (par. 16).

 








10                              
According to Deschamps J.A., the admissibility of the report
prepared by the psychiatrist, Dr. Morissette, was more debatable.  She
commented that the report was prepared at the respondent’s request and that
thirteen months had intervened between sentencing and the preparation of the
report.  She also stated that the portion of the report in which
Dr. Morissette responded to the probation officer’s report did not carry
much weight.  Nonetheless, she determined that the report was admissible, since
it shed additional light on Mr. Daigle’s report.

 

11                              
In view of the error committed by the trial judge and in light of the
fresh evidence, Deschamps J.A. substituted a sentence of five and a half years
for the sentence of ten and a half years imposed by Judge Lagacé.

 

2.  Chamberland J.A. (dissenting)

 

12                              
In the view of Chamberland J.A., the reports by Mr. Daigle and Dr.
Morissette should not be admitted in evidence.  It was his opinion that the
respondent, by exercising minimal diligence, could have sought other opinions
for the purpose of countering the probation officer’s opinion concerning his
personality and submitted them to the trial judge.  At para. 31 he stated:

 

[translation]  I
appreciate that the provisions governing fresh evidence differ depending
whether the Court is being asked to rule as to guilt (section 683  Cr. C.)
or the sentence (section 687  Cr. C.) but not, in my view, to the point
that the Court must, unless there are completely exceptional circumstances
(which are not found in the case at bar) or unless, of course, the other party
consents, admit evidence that was readily available at trial (R. v. Stolar,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 480; Palmer and Palmer v. R., [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759). 
In short, it is my view that the present adversarial debate concerning the
appellant’s personality should have been conducted at trial rather than on
appeal.

 

13                              
In view of the error committed by the trial judge in sentencing,
Chamberland J.A. would have substituted a sentence of imprisonment for eight
years and six months for the sentence imposed by Judge Lagacé.  He allowed the
motion to submit fresh evidence for the sole purpose of admitting in evidence
the report by Jacques Bigras, the psychologist. 








 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  The Criteria Laid Down in Palmer

 

14                              
In Palmer, supra, this Court considered the discretion of
a court of appeal to admit fresh evidence pursuant to s. 610  of the Criminal
Code , the predecessor of s. 683 .  After emphasizing that, in
accordance with the wording of s. 610 , the overriding consideration must
be “the interests of justice”, McIntyre J. set out the applicable
principles, at p. 775:

 

(1)  The evidence should generally not be admitted
if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this
general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in
civil cases: see McMartin v. The Queen.

 

(2)  The evidence must be relevant in the sense
that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

 

(3)  The evidence must be credible in the sense
that it is reasonably capable of belief, and

 

(4)  It must be such that if believed it could
reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
have affected the result.

 

In R. v.
M. (P.S.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 410, Doherty
J.A. wrote the following concerning these principles:

 

The last three criteria are conditions precedent to
the admission of evidence on appeal.  Indeed, the second and third form
part of the broader qualitative analysis required by the fourth consideration. 
The first criterion, due diligence, is not a condition precedent to the
admissibility of “fresh” evidence in criminal appeals, but is a factor to be
considered in deciding whether the interests of justice warrant the admission
of the evidence: McMartin v. The Queen, supra, at pp. 148‑50;
R. v. Palmer, supra, at p. 205.

 








In my view
this is a good description of the way in which in the principles set out in Palmer
interact.

 

15                              
This court was recently asked to apply these criteria in R. v. Warsing,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 579.  In that case, the British Columbia Court of Appeal
determined that the accused had not satisfied the due diligence criterion and
refused to admit fresh evidence.  At para. 51, Major J., for the
majority, pointed out that due diligence is only one factor and its absence,
particularly in criminal cases, should be assessed in light of other
circumstances.  In other words, failure to meet the due diligence criterion
should not be used to deny admission of fresh evidence on appeal if that
evidence is compelling and it is in the interests of justice to admit it.

 

B.  Criteria Applicable to Appeals Against Sentence

 

16                              
Relying on the different wording of ss. 683  and 687  of the Criminal
Code  and the fact that the words used in s. 687 , in her view, convey [translation] “a much more discretionary
connotation” (para. 10), Deschamps J.A. expressed the view that the
rules set out in Palmer are to be applied more flexibly in an appeal
from a sentence.  With respect, I do not share that view.  Although the rules
concerning sources and types of evidence are more flexible in respect of
sentence, the criteria for admitting fresh evidence on appeal are the same,
regardless of whether the appeal relates to a verdict or a sentence.

 

17                              
For purposes of comparison, I will reproduce again the relevant passages
of ss. 683  and 687  of the Criminal Code :

 








683. (1)  For the purposes of an
appeal under this Part, the court of appeal may, where it considers it in
the interests of justice, . . .

 

687. (1)  Where an appeal is taken
against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed
by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may on such
evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive, 
. . . [Emphasis added.]

 

At first
glance, it seems to me that the applicable criterion is not different:  see R.
v. Hogan (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 439 (N.S.C.A.), at p. 449; and R.
v. Edwards (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 21 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 27.  If a
court of appeal thinks fit to admit fresh evidence, it will do so
because it is in the interests of justice to admit it.  Furthermore, I
do not see how the discretion conferred on courts of appeal by s. 687 
could be broader than the discretion conferred by s. 683  since, if such
were the case, courts of appeal could exercise their discretion in a manner
contrary to the interests of justice.  However, it is assumed that the
legislator did not intend statutes to apply in a way contrary to justice: P.‑A. Côté,
The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at
p. 373.  Like McIntyre J. in Palmer, supra, at
p. 775, I believe that the overriding consideration must be the interests
of justice, regardless of whether the appeal is from a verdict or a sentence.

 








18                              
In any case, it is my belief that the criteria stated by this Court in Palmer
already call for a relaxed and flexible application and could hardly be relaxed
any further.  In accordance with the last three criteria, a court of appeal may
admit only evidence that is relevant and credible, and could reasonably, when
taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
the result.  If these criteria were made more flexible, it would be open to a
court of appeal to accept evidence that was not relevant or credible, and that
could not reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be
expected to have affected the result to which they led at trial.  In my view,
it would serve no purpose and be contrary to the interests of justice to introduce
this kind of flexibility.

 

19                              
Failure to satisfy the first criterion, due diligence, is not always
fatal. As Major J. said in Warsing, supra, at para. 51:

 

It is desirable that due diligence remain only one factor and its
absence, particularly in criminal cases, should be assessed in light of other
circumstances.  If the evidence is compelling and the interests of justice
require that it be admitted then the failure to meet the test should yield to
permit its admission.

 

This passage
clearly shows that the due diligence criterion must be applied flexibly.  In my
view, it is not necessary to make it more flexible in the context of appeals
from sentence.  While due diligence is not a necessary prerequisite for the
admission of fresh evidence on appeal, it is an important factor that must be
taken into account in determining whether it is in the interests of justice to
admit or exclude fresh evidence.  As Doherty J.A. said in M. (P.S.),
supra, at p. 411:

 

While the failure to exercise due diligence is not
determinative, it cannot be ignored in deciding whether to admit “fresh”
evidence.  The interests of justice referred to in s. 683  of the Criminal
Code  encompass not only an accused’s interest in having his or her guilt
determined upon all of the available evidence, but also the integrity of the
criminal process.  Finality and order are essential to that integrity.  The
criminal justice system is arranged so that the trial will provide the
opportunity to the parties to present their respective cases and the appeal
will provide the opportunity to challenge the correctness of what happened at
the trial.  Section 683(1)(d) of the Code recognizes that
the appellate function can be expanded in exceptional cases, but it cannot be
that the appellate process should be used routinely to augment the trial
record.  Were it otherwise, the finality of the trial process would be lost and
cases would be retried on appeal whenever more evidence was secured by a party
prior to the hearing of the appeal.  For this reason, the exceptional
nature of the admission of “fresh” evidence on appeal has been stressed: McMartin
v. The Queen, supra, at p. 148.

 

The due diligence criterion is designed to preserve
the integrity of the process and it must be accorded due weight in assessing
the admissibility of “fresh” evidence on appeal.








 

In my view,
these considerations are equally relevant in the context of an appeal from
sentence.  Accordingly, due diligence in producing fresh evidence is a factor
that must be taken into account in an appeal from sentence, on the same basis
as the other three criteria set out in Palmer. 

 

20                              
While the admission of fresh evidence in an appeal from a sentence
cannot lead to a new trial, unlike admission of fresh evidence in an appeal
from a verdict (see the wording of ss. 687  and 683  of the Criminal Code ),
I do not believe that this difference justifies the  application of different
tests.  The integrity of the criminal process and the role of appeal courts
could be jeopardized by the routine admission of fresh evidence on appeal,
since this would create a two‑tier sentencing system.  That kind of
system would be incompatible with the high standard of review applicable to
appeals from sentences and the underlying “profound functional
justifications”:  see R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at
para. 91.  Despite the fresh evidence, the sentencing judge, unlike the
appeal judge, has the benefit of being able to directly assess the other
evidence, the testimony and the submissions of the parties, as well as being
familiar with the needs and current conditions of and in the community where
the crime was committed:  see M. (C.A.), supra, at
para. 91.  Furthermore, appeal courts are not the appropriate forum in
which to determine questions of fact, and they should do so only when the fresh
evidence presents certain characteristics such as would justify expanding their
traditional role.  This Court has already identified those characteristics, in Palmer. 
In my view, whether the appeal relates to a verdict or a sentence, the criteria
laid down by this Court in Palmer are the criteria that are to be
applied where a court of appeal is determining whether to admit fresh evidence.

 








21                              
In addition to citing the different wording of ss. 683  and 687  of
the Criminal Code , Deschamps J.A. refers to cases decided in other
provinces.  A number of courts of appeal have considered the issue of admission
of fresh evidence on an appeal from a sentence: see R. v. Lockwood
(1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 438 (Ont. C.A.); Hogan, supra; R. v.
Irwin (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 423 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Langille
(1987), 77 N.S.R. (2d) 224 (C.A.); R. v. Archibald (1992), 15
B.C.A.C. 301; R. v. Lemay (1998), 127 C.C.C.  528 (3d) (Que. C.A.); R.
v. Gauthier, [1996] Q.J. No. 952 (QL) (C.A.); R. v.
McDow (1996), 147 N.S.R. (2d) 343 (C.A.); Edwards, supra; R.
v. Riley (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 278 (N.S.C.A.); and R. v. Mesgun
(1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 439 (Ont. C.A.).  Some courts of appeal have maintained
that the criteria to be applied are the same, whether the appeal relates to a
verdict or a sentence: see Hogan, supra, at p.  449,
and Edwards, supra, at p. 27.  Others have stated that the
rules relating to the admission of fresh evidence were applied more flexibly or
informally in the context of an appeal from a sentence: see Hogan, supra,
at p. 453; Langille, supra; Edwards, supra, at
p. 28; and Riley, supra, at p. 283.  However, a careful
review of the jurisprudence reveals that, far from applying different criteria,
courts of appeal have invariably applied the criteria set out in Palmer,
whether expressly or by implication (for examples of the application of the due
diligence criterion, see Lockwood, Hogan, Irwin, Langille,
Edwards and Mesgun; for examples of the application of the
relevance criterion, see Edwards and Lemay; and for an example of
the application of the criteria relating to credibility and effect on the result,
see Langille).  In addition, as I have already explained, it is neither
desirable nor really possible to relax the rule laid down in Palmer, in
view of its inherent flexibility and the requirements associated with the
interests of justice.

 








22                              
I therefore find that the criteria set out in Palmer are
applicable to applications to tender fresh evidence in an appeal from a
sentence.  Before applying these criteria to the two reports in the case at
bar, I believe it is worthwhile to briefly discuss the concepts of
admissibility and probative value in the context of the admission of fresh
evidence on appeal, as well as certain specific characteristics of the
sentencing process.

 

C.  The Concepts of Admissibility and Probative Value

 

23                              
In the law of evidence, admissibility and probative value are two
separate concepts: see Morris v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, at 
pp. 192 (McIntyre J.) and 203 (Lamer J.).  The general
principle that applies in respect of admissibility is that relevant evidence is
admissible unless it is subject to any exclusionary rule: see Morris, supra,
at p.  201, and J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A.
W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (2nd ed. 1999), at
p. 23.  The probative value of admissible evidence is a question for the
trier of fact: Morris, supra, at p. 193 (McIntyre J.).

 

24                              
In the context of the admission of fresh evidence on appeal, however,
the concepts of admissibility and probative value overlap. To be
admissible, it is not sufficient that the fresh evidence meet the prerequisite
of relevance.  It must also be credible and such that it could, when taken
with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the
result.  Accordingly, the probative value of the fresh evidence must, to some
degree, be reviewed by a court of appeal when it is determining the
admissibility of the fresh evidence.  The question to be considered was
expressed as follows by McIntyre J. in Palmer, supra, at
pp. 776‑77:

 

If presented to the trier of fact and believed, would the [fresh]
evidence possess such strength or probative force that it might, taken
with the other evidence adduced, have affected the result?  [Emphasis added.] 

 








See also McMartin
v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484, at p. 491, and R. v. Stolar,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 480, at pp. 491‑92.  The assessment of the
probative value of the fresh evidence is, however, limited, since after
determining that the evidence is credible, the court of appeal must assume that
the trial judge would have believed it.  If the fresh evidence is admitted, the
court of appeal must again consider its probative value as well as the
probative value of all the other evidence in order to determine whether the
sentence imposed by the trial judge was “demonstrably unfit”:  R. v. Shropshire,
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at paras. 46 and 50; M. (C.A.), supra,
at para. 90; and R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5, at para. 125.

 

25                              
Determining the probative value of fresh evidence on appeal may be a
difficult task, since the evidence has not been put to the test of cross‑examination
or rebuttal at trial. Some courts of appeal express reluctance when they
are asked to admit fresh evidence containing information which the adverse
party has not been able to verify.  In Riley, supra, at
p. 284, Pugsley J.A. wrote, for the majority of the Nova Scotia Court
of Appeal:

 

The panel was concerned, however, about the manner
in which critical information was presented to the court by defence counsel and
the lack of opportunity afforded to the Crown to assess, let alone contest the
information.

 








See also Archibald,
supra.  In my view, where fresh evidence is challenged, or where its
probative value is in dispute, it is desirable that it be tested before being
admitted, primarily for two reasons: (1) this facilitates the determination of
the probative value of the fresh evidence, and (2) this is fairer to the party
objecting to the admission of the fresh evidence.  This “testing” can be done
in a number of ways.  In Riley, for example, the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal gave the Crown the opportunity to file affidavits in response to those
submitted by the accused.  Courts of appeal may also, for example, allow cross‑examination
of a witness or submission of expert evidence in response to fresh expert
evidence.  In other words, they can do everything that the powers conferred on
them by s. 683  of the Criminal Code  permit them to do.  Courts of
appeal may exercise the powers set out in s. 683  of the Criminal Code ,
in both an appeal from a sentence and an appeal from a verdict: for an example
of the application of s. 683  in an appeal from a sentence, see R. v.
Berry (1997), 196 A.R. 398 (C.A.), at pp. 400‑401.

 

26                              
A party who wishes to tender evidence in response to fresh evidence,
cross‑examine the deponent of an affidavit or an expert, or challenge the
fresh evidence in any other way should make a formal motion to the court of
appeal for that purpose.  It is not sufficient, as occurred in this case, to
say during argument on the merit of the motion to introduce fresh evidence,
that a party would have liked to cross‑examine the authors of the
reports.  In my view, the appellant cannot rely on the fact that there was no
cross‑examination to argue that the fresh evidence should not have been
admitted, since it was up to the appellant to seek leave from the court of
appeal, at the appropriate time, to cross‑examine the authors of the
reports in dispute.

 

27                              
Nonetheless, the failure to put the fresh evidence to the test is not
fatal and does not make it automatically admissible or inadmissible.  To be
admissible on appeal, fresh evidence must satisfy the criteria set out in Palmer. 
Despite its not having been tested, the court of appeal must assess the prima
facie relevance, credibility and probative value of the fresh evidence.  It
must determine whether the fresh evidence has such probative force that if
presented to the trial judge and believed it could be expected to have affected
the result.  In the case of an expert opinion, the probative value to be
assigned to it is directly related to the amount and quality of admissible
evidence on which it relies: R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852,
at p. 897. 

 








28                              
To summarize, the probative value of fresh evidence must be considered
in order to determine whether it is admissible on appeal.  To facilitate
determination of the probative value of fresh evidence, it is desirable that it
be tested by the party challenging it.  For this purpose, that party should
make a formal motion to the court of appeal and explain how it wishes to test
the fresh evidence.  Failure by a party to test fresh evidence does not relieve
a court of appeal from applying the criteria established in Palmer.

 

29                              
The application of those criteria in the context of an appeal from a
sentence will inevitably be influenced by the specific characteristics of the
sentencing process, even though the criteria for the admission of fresh
evidence remain fundamentally the same.  I will now briefly consider some of
these specific characteristics and their interaction with the Palmer criteria.


 

D.  Application of the Criteria in the Context of an Appeal
Against Sentence

 








30                              
As pointed out by Macdonald J.A. in Langille, supra,
the strict rules of a trial do not apply to a sentencing hearing.  For example,
hearsay evidence may be accepted at the sentencing stage where found to be
credible and trustworthy: see R. v. Gardiner,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p. 414.  This relaxation of the rules is explained
by the fact that the judge must determine the appropriate sentence for the
accused, and to do so must have as much information as possible about him.  In
my view, the Palmer criteria do not compromise the more flexible nature
of the rules relating to the sources and types of evidence on which judges may
base their sentences.  The criteria concerning the admission of fresh evidence
on appeal do not relate to the sources and types of evidence and do not demand
that the strict rules of a trial apply to fresh evidence proffered on an appeal
from a sentence.  To be admissible, the fresh evidence need only be relevant
and credible and, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be
expected to have affected the result.  The purpose of the due diligence
criterion is to protect the interests and the administration of justice and to
preserve the role of appeal courts: see: M. (P.S.), supra. 

 

31                              
Another specific characteristic of the sentencing process that should be
emphasized is the importance of opinion evidence.  At the sentencing stage,
judges must often consider reports prepared by probation officers, correctional
service officers, psychologists or psychiatrists reporting their opinions
concerning the personality of the accused, and his or her chances of
rehabilitation and risk of reoffending.  As I have already noted, the probative
value to be assigned to an expert opinion is directly related to the amount and
quality of admissible evidence on which it relies: Lavallee, supra,
at p. 897.  Accordingly, before admitting new opinion evidence on appeal,
it may be necessary to determine the basis of that opinion (for example, the
version of events relied on by the expert, the documents he or she consulted,
and so forth) and to establish whether the facts on which the opinion is based
have been proven and are credible.

 








32                              
Quite often, fresh evidence submitted to an appeal court in the context
of an appeal from a sentence relates to events subsequent to the sentence, or
consists of information from the penitentiary administration relating to an
accused’s progress in terms of adjustment and rehabilitation: see, for example,
Archibald, Lemay, Gauthier, McDow, Riley and
Mesgun.  It is frequently the case that the Crown consents to the
introduction of this fresh evidence, since the facts reported are seldom
controversial: see Edwards, supra, at p. 28; Gauthier,
supra, at para. 14; McDow, supra, at para. 18; Mesgun,
supra, at para. 8; and C. Ruby, Sentencing (5th ed.
1999), at p. 607.  In the case at bar, the appellant consented to the
production of the report by Jacques Bigras, the psychologist.  It is important
to bear in mind that whether or not consent is given, the production of fresh
evidence on appeal is possible only with the leave of the court of appeal: Hogan,
supra, at p.  448.  Evidence relating to events subsequent to
the sentence or an accused’s rehabilitation process normally meet the due
diligence criterion, since by their very nature they were not available at the
time of sentencing.  However, in order to be found to be admissible, the
evidence must also satisfy the other criteria, particularly the criterion relating
to the likelihood that the result would be affected.  The court of appeal may
properly take into account the fact that the Crown has consented or that
admission is uncontested particularly when assessing the relevance, credibility
and probative value of fresh evidence.

 

33                              
Having completed my review of the concepts of admissibility and
probative value and of the specific characteristics of the sentencing process,
I now turn to the application of the Palmer criteria to the two reports
in question in the instant case.

 

E.  Application to the Case at Bar

 

34                              
In this case, the majority of the Court of Appeal found (at
para. 16) that the report by the psychologist, Mr. Daigle, was admissible
because it explained the respondent’s past in greater detail and showed his
personality from a perspective that was not evident in the trial record.  The
report by the psychiatrist, Dr. Morissette, was admitted in evidence because it
shed additional light on Mr. Daigle’s report (para. 17).  In my opinion,
these grounds are inadequate to justify the admission of those two reports,
since they could justify the admission of a very broad range of additional
evidence on appeal. Furthermore, the admission of any evidence on appeal
which merely adds certain details to or clarifies the evidence adduced at trial
would be contrary to the Palmer criteria and the limited role of
appellate courts in respect of sentencing.

 








35                              
In my view, neither of these two reports should have been admitted in
evidence.  It is worthwhile to reproduce the applicable criteria again, that
is, the criteria set out in Palmer:

 

(1)  The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general
principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases.

 

(2)  The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears
upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue relating to the sentence.

 

(3)  The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
reasonably capable of belief.

 

(4)  The evidence must be such that if believed it could
reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
have affected the result.

 

1.  Report by the Psychologist, Mr.
Daigle

 








36                              
The report by Mr. Daigle, a psychologist, is relevant in that it
expresses opinions regarding the respondent’s personality, dangerousness and
risk of reoffending.  In addition, this report is reasonably capable of belief,
particularly in that it was prepared independently and not at the request of
the respondent.  In addition, it can be concluded that this report satisfies
the due diligence criterion.  Although Mr. Daigle relied on facts prior to
sentencing and the respondent could have sought the opinion of another
psychologist concerning his personality and dangerousness, this particular
report was not available at the time of sentencing and the respondent could not
have obtained it before sentencing.  This report was prepared for
classification purposes for Correctional Service Canada, while the respondent
was at the Regional Reception Centre in Québec.

 

37                              
Despite the foregoing, I find that Mr. Daigle’s report should not have
been admitted in evidence by the Court of Appeal, since its probative value is
not such that if it had been presented to the trial judge it might have
affected the result.  I note, first, that Mr. Daigle did not look into the
proceedings at trial, did not read the testimony and did not consult the court
documents (p. 1 of the report).  While he did not prepare his report at
the respondent’s request, he relied only on his version of the facts.  That
version portrays the respondent as a victim who did not wish to commit the
robbery and was allegedly acting in response to threats by his accomplices
(pp. 1‑2 of the report).  This account makes no mention of the
violence and the threats against the child.  In addition, according to the
report, Bertrand Fortier attacked the respondent rather than the reverse
(p. 2 of the report).  As well, the respondent told Mr. Daigle that he
wanted to commit the robbery in order to win back his former girlfriend
(p. 7 of the report). 

 

38                              
The version of the facts set out in Mr. Daigle’s report differs in quite
a few respects from the version given by the respondent under oath at
trial. I will point out only the most obvious contradictions: the
respondent stated during his testimony that he wanted to commit the robbery to
repay a drug debt; that he planned the crime with one of his accomplices; and
that he grabbed Bertrand Fortier while he was sitting in the living room.

 








39                              
It is true that the version of the facts set out in Mr. Daigle’s report
is not wholly inconsistent with the respondent’s testimony at trial. In
that testimony, the respondent also sought to portray himself as a victim by
claiming that he did not want to commit the robbery; that he would have run
away if the opportunity had presented itself; and that he was only following
the orders of his accomplices when he tied up the Fortier boy, put a cartridge
in his mouth and took him hostage.  However, the respondent’s testimony is
confused and full of contradictions, and is also inconsistent with the account
given by the Fortier family.  The trial judge clearly rejected the respondent’s
version of the facts.  He found that the crime was planned (pp. 4‑6
of the reasons) and that the respondent scratched the face of the Fortier boy
with his weapon (p. 6 of the reasons) and threatened to kill him several
times (p. 4 of the reasons).  He also stated, at p. 7 of his reasons:

 

[translation]  Your
submissions at the beginning of the sentencing submissions dealt a lot with how
you were in fact a victim, I was talking about bad luck just now, we
choose our friends, we choose our girlfriends.  When something goes wrong, you
can’t always blame other people.

 

It is quite
clear from an exchange between the trial judge and counsel for the respondent
just before sentencing that the judge did not assign much weight to the defence
theory that the respondent was a victim in this case.

 








40                              
Mr. Daigle therefore relied on a version of the facts that was not
accepted by the trial judge, or on facts that were not established in evidence. 
Since the probative value of an expert opinion depends on the amount and
quality of admissible evidence on which it relies (Lavallee, supra,
at p. 897), I find that little probative value can be assigned to the
psychologist’s report prepared by Mr. Daigle.  Having regard to that low
probative value and the fact that the trial judge, on passing sentence,
stressed the seriousness of the offences committed by the respondent rather
than his personality, I am of the view that Mr. Daigle’s report would not have
affected the result if it had been introduced at trial with the other
evidence.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal should not have admitted it in
evidence, since it does not meet the Palmer criteria.

 

2.  Report by the Psychiatrist, Dr.
Morissette

 

41                              
The report prepared by Dr. Morissette, a psychiatrist, does not meet the
due diligence criterion.  It is dated March 17, 1998, that is, more
than a year after sentencing.  Unlike the report by the psychologist, Mr.
Daigle, Dr. Morissette’s opinion was solicited by the respondent.  I agree with
Chamberland J.A. that the respondent, by exercising minimal diligence,
could have sought this opinion before sentence was passed and submitted Dr.
Morissette’s report to the trial judge for the purpose of countering the
probation officer’s opinion concerning his personality (see Mesgun, supra,
at para. 8).

 

42                              
Nonetheless, failure to meet the due diligence criterion is not always
fatal:  Warsing, supra, at para. 51.  It is therefore
necessary to consider the other three criteria set out in Palmer in
order to determine whether their strength is such that failure to satisfy the
due diligence requirement is overborne: R. v. McAnespie, [1993] 4 S.C.R.
501, at pp. 502‑3.

 








43                              
Like the psychologist’s report prepared by Mr. Daigle, the
psychiatrist’s report written by Dr. Morissette is relevant, since it
communicates an opinion concerning the respondent’s personality, danger to
others and risk of reoffending.  Furthermore, there is nothing to indicate that
it is not reasonably capable of belief, even though it was prepared at the
respondent’s request.  However, its probative value is low.  Like the
psychologist, Mr. Daigle, Dr. Morissette based his opinion on a version of the
facts that was not established or adopted at trial. Although he reviewed
the report prepared by the probation officer, he does not seem to have read the
testimony or consulted the trial transcript.  His description of the events of
June 22, 1996, is very brief and does not reflect the seriousness of the
offences committed or the violence employed.  Furthermore, the respondent gave
Dr. Morissette an explanation that was completely different from the
explanation he gave under oath in respect of his participation in the events. 
At p. 15 of the report we read:

 

[translation]  Mr. Lévesque
now explains that at the time of his arrest and when he arrived at the
penitentiary, he did not to want to say that he had committed a robbery for a
woman . . ., he did not want to say that he was so dependent on a
woman that he would commit a robbery . . .  He felt that it would
look “better” if he explained the reason for his robbery in terms of a drug
debt.  He is now telling us that he never had a drug debt, that he never
cheated a drug dealer.  According to his explanation, the only purpose of the
robbery was financial gain in order to impress Francine, since
Mr. Lévesque felt that if he had more money she might come back to him.

 

In addition,
none of the details of the respondent’s love life referred to by Dr. Morissette
were established in evidence at trial. Thus, for the reasons I stated
concerning the psychologist’s report by Mr. Daigle, I find that the
psychiatrist’s report by Dr. Morissette is of little probative value and would
not have affected the result if it had been adduced at trial with the other
evidence.

 

44                              
In my view, as in McAnespie, supra, at pp. 502‑3,
“the strength of the other factors is not such that failure to satisfy
the due diligence requirement in this case is overborne by the other factors”
(emphasis in original).  Accordingly, the report by the psychiatrist, Dr.
Morissette, should not have been admitted in evidence on appeal.

 








VI.  Disposition

 

45                              
For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec and, for the reasons stated by
Chamberland J.A., substitute a sentence of imprisonment for eight years
and six months for the sentence imposed by the trial judge.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

46                              
Arbour J. (dissenting) --
I have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleague, Justice Gonthier, on
this appeal.  With respect, on the very particular facts of this case, I
believe that the majority of the Court of Appeal was entitled to admit the
reports prepared respectively by Marc Daigle and Dr. Louis Morissette.  Here,
the trial judge fundamentally mischaracterized the principal crime, of which
the respondent had been convicted, in determining the just and appropriate
sentence, with the result that the Court of Appeal was, for all intents and
purposes, required to sentence afresh.  In these specific circumstances, it was
for the Court of Appeal to equip itself, pursuant to its broad statutory
discretion under s. 683(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , with whatever evidence it deemed fit and necessary to decide the question
of sentence.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

 








47                              
I am in general agreement with the statement of the law governing the
admission of fresh evidence in appeals against sentence, provided by my
colleague at paras. 16-22 of his opinion.  However, in view of the fundamental
error committed by the trial judge, I do not believe that the principles articulated
by Gonthier J. are germane to the disposition of this appeal.  I must also
emphatically disagree with Gonthier J. that R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1
S.C.R. 852 (per Wilson J.), applies as stringently as he suggests in the
sentencing context.

 

48                              
The Court of Appeal was unanimous that the trial judge erred in
concluding that kidnapping for ransom was the dominant offence committed by the
respondent.  There is no challenge before us to the unanimous conclusion of the
Court of Appeal that robbery was the central, predominant offence, the
hostage-taking  being merely  [translation]
“ancillary to the main criminal operation carried out by the [respondent] and
his cohorts” ([1998] Q.J. No. 2680 (QL), at para. 35).

 

49                              
The trial judge’s initial error in identifying kidnapping as the [translation] “central matter alleged”
against the respondent, which he described as [translation] “one of the most serious crime in the Criminal
Code  . . . right after murder” (see C.Q., No. 505-01-008036-960, February 19,
1997, at p. 2), tainted his entire analysis, and produced a sentence that did
not accurately reflect the circumstances of the offence.  The Court of Appeal’s
task was thus not simply to assess the fitness of the sentence imposed at first
instance, and, to this end, to determine the admissibility of the reports
tendered by the respondent as fresh evidence on appeal.  Instead, having set
aside the sentence, the Court of Appeal was required to intervene essentially
for the purpose of sentencing the respondent anew.  In these circumstances, I
believe that the Court of Appeal was entitled to consider what it deemed to be
evidence relevant to the exercise of determining a just and appropriate
sentence.  Like a sentencing judge, a court of appeal, in circumstances such as
these, must

 

 

ha[ve] wide latitude as to the sources and types of evidence upon which
to base [its] sentence. [It] must have the fullest possible information
concerning the background of the accused if [it] is to fit the sentence to the
offender rather than to the crime.  

 








(R. v. Gardiner,  [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, per Dickson J. (as
he then was), at p. 414.)   

 

50                              
This “wide latitude” reflects the legal environment of a sentencing
hearing – described in R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para.
92, as an “inherently individualized process” – wherein the sentencing judge’s
task is to develop a composite picture or understanding of the offender,
including his past and present circumstances as well as his prospects for
rehabilitation and the danger that he will re-offend,  with a view to crafting
a just and appropriate sentence.  In this environment, as was recognized in Gardiner,
supra, at p. 414:

 

. . . it is manifest that the judge should not be denied an opportunity
to obtain relevant information by the imposition of all the restrictive
evidential rules common to a trial. . . .

 

        It is commonplace that the strict rules which govern at trial
do not apply at a sentencing hearing and it would be undesirable to have the
formalities and technicalities characteristic of the normal adversary
proceeding prevail.  The hearsay rule does not govern the sentencing hearing. 
Hearsay evidence may be accepted where found to be credible and trustworthy.

 

 








51                              
The holding in Lavallee, supra, that the weight properly
attributable to expert opinion is a direct function of the amount and quality
of admissible evidence on which it is based, is a product of the general rule
governing the inadmissibility of hearsay evidence at trial, where considerations
of probative value are critical to the presumption of innocence and the
fundamental fairness of the trial process.  The sentencing environment is
entirely different and permits, indeed encourages, recourse to evidentiary
materials that would not be appropriate in the determination of guilt or
innocence.  Hearsay evidence is admissible in sentencing proceedings (see s.
723(5) of the Code).  For example, probation officers’ reports, produced
pursuant to s. 721 of the Code, will inevitably contain opinions and
hearsay of the type that would not be admissible at trial.  Similarly, victim
impact statements, prepared in accordance with s. 722(2) of the Code,
must be considered by the sentencing judge, and may be given whatever weight
the sentencing judge sees fit, regardless of the fact that they often contain
non-expert opinions and hearsay information that would have no probative value,
even if relevant, in the trial proper.   Finally, s. 724(1) of the Code
explicitly provides that “[i]n determining a sentence, a court may accept as
proved any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings.
. .”.    

 

52                              
In my opinion, the nature of the sentencing process, and of the
statutory rules that govern it, contemplate that the sentencing court should 
have the benefit of “the fullest possible information concerning the background
of the [offender]”, from the widest array of sources.  It is therefore
inappropriate to tie the probative value of evidence tendered under these rules
to the probative value of evidence proffered at trial, and thus, more
specifically, to assess the weight of an expert opinion on the basis of the
quantity and quality of non-hearsay evidence introduced to support that
opinion.  Indeed, such a requirement would largely rob the permissive use of
hearsay, recognized and endorsed by this Court in Gardiner, supra,
of all its utility.  A sentencing court must be entitled to receive and rely on
any credible and trustworthy evidence which assists it in obtaining as complete
an understanding of the offender as possible.  The extent to which evidence
presented on sentencing conflicts with the facts upon which the conviction was
founded is a matter for the sentencing court to take into consideration, but is
not, as such, a matter for exclusion of the evidence in question.  A sentencing
court is entitled to discount any part of an expert opinion that may be based
on a misapprehension of the circumstances of the offence as found by the trial
judge, while making use of any insight that the opinion may properly provide
into the personality of the accused, his personal and emotional life,  as well
as his dangerousness and risk of recidivism.

 








53                              
In the case at bar, while I accept that the Daigle and Morissette
reports each contain an account of the events surrounding the offences
committed by the respondent that differ from facts accepted by the trial judge,
I cannot agree that they are of little probative value. 

 

54                              
In my opinion, it was open to the Court of Appeal to find both reports
sufficiently credible and trustworthy to assist in the development of a fuller
picture of the respondent, based as they were on the experts’ face-to-face
psychological assessment and evaluation of the former.  As such, I believe that
the Court of Appeal was entitled to consider and rely on all or part of the
opinions offered therein in sentencing the respondent.  Even though the Daigle
and Morissette reports were tendered as fresh evidence on appeal, they were not
tendered simply to demonstrate that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was
unfit, in light of the subsequent opinions offered by these experts.  As
indicated above, the sentence imposed by the trial judge was unfit because of
his misunderstanding of the central offence of which the respondent was
convicted.  Having set aside that sentence, the Court of Appeal was free to admit
any evidence that it deemed to be of assistance in discharging its sentencing
function.

 

55                              
For these reasons, I believe that the Court of Appeal’s decision to
admit the reports by Marc Daigle and Dr. Morissette was correct and should be
upheld.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for new brunswick

 

Criminal law – Charge to jury -- Misdirections --
Court of Appeal setting aside accused’s acquittal and ordering new trial --
Crown and defence agreeing that trial judge made errors in his formulation of
test for determining admissibility of co-conspirator hearsay evidence --
Whether Crown established that verdict would not necessarily have been the same
had errors not occurred.

 








The accused was acquitted of narcotics offences.  On
appeal, the Crown alleged errors in the trial judge’s direction to the jury
concerning the admissibility of co-conspirator hearsay evidence.  The Court of
Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new
trial.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 

                   The parties agreed that
two clear misdirections occurred in the trial judge’s formulation of the test
for determining the admissibility of co-conspirator hearsay evidence.  Either
of the trial judge’s errors could have led to the accused’s acquittal.  The
Crown has established with reasonable certainty that, had the jury been
properly charged, the verdict would not necessarily have been the same. 
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal’s order for a new trial should be confirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the New Brunswick Court of
Appeal (1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 336, 222 N.B.R. (2d) 78, [1999] N.B.J. No. 540

Margaret Gallagher, for
the appellant.

 








S. David Frankel, Q.C.,
and James C. Martin, for the respondent.

 

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1                                  
The Chief Justice – This
is an appeal as of right.  The appellant was charged with trafficking in
cocaine and possession of proceeds of trafficking.  The Crown alleged that the
appellant sold a prohibited drug to its undercover agent, Gulliver, through an intermediary, Merrick.  The Crown’s case
consisted of Gulliver’s testimony, tapes of conversations between Gulliver and
Merrick, police surveillance of events and the bag of cocaine allegedly
purchased by Gulliver.   At the end of the trial, the jury acquitted the
appellant.  The Crown appealed, alleging errors in the trial judge’s direction
to the jury.  The Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, Rice J.A. dissenting,
allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial:
(1999), 222 N.B.R. (2d) 78.  The appellant Sutton appeals that decision to this
Court.

 

2                                  
The parties agree that acquittals are not lightly overturned.  The test
as set out in Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, requires the
Crown to satisfy the court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the
same had the errors not occurred.  In R. v. Morin, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 345, this Court emphasized that “the onus is a heavy one and that the
Crown must satisfy the court with a reasonable degree of certainty” (p. 374).  


 








3                                  
The parties also agree that the trial judge
made errors in his direction to the
jury.  More specifically, they agree that two
clear misdirections occurred in his formulation of the test set out in R. v.
Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, for
determining the admissibility of co-conspirator hearsay evidence, a test not
challenged on this appeal. (The parties did not present argument on and
the Court did not consider whether the Carter test may be affected by R.
v. Starr, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 2000 SCC 40 (released on September 29,
2000).)

 

4                                  
First, the parties agree that in articulating
the initial stage of the Carter
test, the trial judge wrongly directed the jury that they were restricted to
“Gulliver’s evidence alone” in determining whether they were satisfied, beyond
a reasonable doubt, that there was a conspiracy or common design to traffic
cocaine.  This eliminated from the jury’s consideration evidence that both
parties agree was admissible on the point: the
testimony of police officers detailing their surveillance and the bag of
cocaine. 

 

5                                  
Second, the parties agree that the trial judge directed the jury to
apply the wrong standard of proof at the second stage of the Carter
test.  This stage involves a determination of whether, on the balance of
probabilities, the appellant was a member of the common
design.  The trial judge clearly erred by informing the jury they had to be satisfied of the appellant’s
membership beyond a reasonable doubt, failing which they were required to acquit him.   

 

6                                  
In addition to these admitted errors, the Crown alleges that the trial
judge erred in his caution to the jury
respecting the credibility of the undercover agent Gulliver as an unsavoury witness (the Vetrovec
warning).  The appellant disagrees on
this point.

 








7                                  
Leaving aside the disputed Vetrovec caution, which this Court
recently reviewed in R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, the critical
issue upon which the court below divided and the main ground upon which Rice
J.A. based his dissent,  was whether the admitted errors in charging the jury on the Carter test meet
the threshold for vacating an acquittal as set out in Vézeau, supra. 
Has the Crown established with reasonable certainty that the jury, had it been
charged correctly, would not necessarily have reached the same verdict?  We are
satisfied that the answer to this question must be yes.

 

8                                  
It is not disputed that had the jury been properly directed, they could
have found, upon a consideration of all the
relevant evidence and applying the proper standards of proof, that the Carter test
was satisfied.  In that case, the hearsay statements at issue, including the
taped conversations implicating the appellant, would have been admissible
against him, as properly falling within the co-conspirator exception to the
hearsay rule.  The errors in the trial judge’s charge may have unjustly frustrated such a
conclusion.  At the first stage of the test, the jury was effectively
precluded from considering evidence that both parties agree was admissible in
determining whether they were satisfied a conspiracy existed.  At the second
stage, the misdirection as to the appropriate standard of proof created the
potential for the jury to reject the admissibility of the offered evidence on
the grounds they were not satisfied of the appellant’s involvement in the
common design to traffic cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt, even though they
may have been satisfied of his involvement on the correct standard of
probability.  Either of these errors could have led to the appellant’s
acquittal.  Therefore, to use the language of Vézeau, supra, we
can say with reasonable certainty that, had the jury been properly charged, the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same.  

 

9                                  
We would therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the order for a
new trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑ Expert evidence
– Admissibility ‑‑ Mohan criteria – Accused
charged with sexual assaults on two young male children ‑‑ Expert
witness testifying that accused’s personality incompatible with any
predisposition to commit such offences ‑‑ Whether trial
judge erred in excluding expert evidence.

 

 








The accused was charged with a series of sexual
assaults on two young male children. He tendered the evidence of a
psychiatrist to establish that in all probability a serious sexual
deviant had inflicted the abuse, including anal intercourse, and no such deviant
personality traits were disclosed by the accused in various tests including
penile plethysmography.  After a voir dire, the trial judge excluded the
expert evidence because it purported to show only lack of general disposition
and was not saved by the “distinctive group” exception recognized in Mohan. 
The accused was convicted.  A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the
accused’s appeal and ordered a new trial on the basis that the expert evidence
was wrongly excluded.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be allowed and the conviction restored.

 

The trial judge’s discharge of his gatekeeper function
in the evaluation of the demands of a full and fair trial record, while
avoiding distortions of the fact‑finding exercise through the
introduction of inappropriate expert testimony, deserves a high degree of
respect.  In this case, the trial judge was not persuaded that the Mohan
requirements had been met. 

 

Novel science is subject to “special scrutiny”.  In
this case the psychiatrist was a pioneer in Canada in trying to use the penile
plethysmograph, previously recognized as a  therapeutic tool, as a forensic
tool.  Moreover, if expert evidence were accepted that the offence was probably
committed by a member of a “distinctive group” from which the accused is excluded,
it would be a short step to the conclusion on the ultimate issue of guilt or
innocence.  This was another reason for special scrutiny.  

 








The “distinctive group” exception sought to be applied
here requires that it be shown that the crime could only, or would only, be
committed by a person having distinctive personality traits that the accused
does not possess.  The personality profile of the perpetrator group must
identify truly distinctive psychological elements that were in all probability
present and operating in the perpetrator at the time of the offence.  The Mohan
requirement that this profile be “standard” was to ensure that it is not put
together on an ad hoc basis for the purpose of a particular case. 
Beyond that, the issue whether the “profile” is sufficient depends on the
expert's ability to identify and describe with workable precision what exactly
distinguishes the distinctive or deviant perpetrator from other people and on
what basis the accused can be excluded.  The expert evidence tendered in this
case was unsatisfactory on both points.  The definition of the “distinctive”
group of individuals with a propensity to commit the “distinctive crime” was
vague.  While the reference in Mohan to a “standard profile” should not
be taken to require an exhaustive inventory of personality traits, the profile
must confine the class to useful proportions.  Furthermore, the witness did not
satisfy the trial judge that the underlying principles and methodology of the
tests administered to the accused were reliable and, importantly, applicable. 
Even giving a loose interpretation to the need for a “standard profile”, and
passing over the doubts that only a pedophile would be capable of the offence,
the evidence of the error rate in the tests administered to the accused was
problematic.  The possibility that such evidence would distort the fact‑finding
process was very real.  Consideration of the cost‑benefit analysis
supports the trial judge's conclusion that the testimony offered as many problems
as it did solutions, and it was therefore within his discretion to exclude it. 
The majority of the Court of Appeal erred in interfering with the exercise of
that discretion.

1                                  
Binnie J. -- In this appeal we are required to consider aspects of the
“gatekeeper function” performed by trial judges in the reception of novel
scientific evidence.  The respondent was charged with a series of sexual
assaults over a period of four months on two young males with whom he stood in
a parental relationship.  At the time of the offences, which involved the
allegation of anal penetration, the young males were between three and five
years old.  The defence contended that such offences were committed by someone
possessed of a highly distinct personality disorder, and tendered an expert
psychiatrist, Dr. Édouard Beltrami, to testify that the respondent’s
personality was incompatible with any predisposition to commit such offences. 
The evidence was excluded by the trial judge, who convicted the respondent.  A
new trial was ordered by a majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal on the basis
that this evidence was wrongly excluded.  We are of the opinion that in the
circumstances the trial judge was entitled to exclude the expert evidence and
that the appeal must be allowed and the conviction restored.

 

I.  The Facts

 

2                                  
The respondent’s family situation is complex.  Between February 1, 1995
and May 19, 1995, he had custody of W. and L., two children between three and
five years old.  The respondent testified that at the time of the events, he
was living with his current wife and her son.  Because W. and L. did not get
along well with his wife’s son, the respondent had rented an apartment for them
where they lived with a female friend, who looked after them at nights and
during the weekends, and a babysitter who came in on weekdays.  The respondent
visited the apartment on a daily basis, took about half of his meals there and
was often present during the weekends.

 

3                                  
On May 9, 1995, a child and youth protection centre received information
alleging that L. had been sexually abused by the respondent.  About a week
later, the two children were removed from the respondent’s custody and placed
in a foster home.  The foster mother did not know the respondent nor did she
know why the children had been removed from his custody.  She and her sister
testified against the respondent at the trial.

 

1.  Statements
by the Children








4                                  
The foster mother testified that:

 

(i)  While giving a bath to the two children, she observed them rubbing
their penises together.  W. then started to hit L.’s buttock with his penis. 
On being questioned, the children said it was “Papi” who showed them to do
that.

 

(ii)  Another time, W. told her that “Papi” had rubbed his “coulout”
on his body, had [translation]
“wet his hair”, and that “when papi finished doing that . . . he put his
coulout in his behind”, and that when he had done doing that, there was
blood in W’s excrement.  W. told her that this was painful and caused him to
walk with difficulty.  According to the foster mother, W. had tears in his eyes
when he gave this account.  “Coulout” is a slang word for penis.  The
foster mother said she had never heard the word until the child mentioned it.

 

5                                  
The sister of the foster mother also did not know the respondent.  She
testified that at one point she was watching television with the children. 
During an episode in which two persons were kissing, W. blurted out a similar “coulot”
story with the same details about blood and difficulties in walking.  W. said
that “Papi” would then clean up the excrement with some paper and that “Papi’s”
“coulout” is quite different than his:  [translation] “it's bigger and all hairy”.

 

6                                  
On October 24, 1995, Sergeant Binette asked W. who had put his “coulout”
in his buttock.  The child answered “Papi J.” and quickly identified the
respondent as “Papi J.” when presented with pictures.

 








2.  The Charges

 

7                                  
The respondent was charged with sexual offences in relation to both W.
and L., including touching for a sexual purpose the body of a person under the
age of 14 years, unlawful anal intercourse, and sexual assault.  

 

3.  The
Examining Physicians

 

8                                  
Dr. Desmarchais, a pediatrist retained by the Crown, examined W. on July
24, 1995, more than two months after the children were removed from the
respondent’s custody.  She observed a 1.5 cm lesion near the anus and thought
that there was no doubt that the boy had been sodomized.  On the other hand,
Dr. Chabot, also a pediatrist who testified for the Crown, was equivocal.  He
examined W. on August 31, 1995.  He said that while the scar was longer than
one might expect from constipation, the injury was consistent with constipation
as well as with sodomy.

 

4.  The
Excluded Evidence

 

9                                  
In the course of his trial, the respondent tendered the evidence of Dr.
Édouard Beltrami, a qualified psychiatrist who works extensively in the field
of clinical psychology.  Dr. Beltrami’s evidence was tendered to establish that
in all probability a serious sexual deviant had inflicted anal intercourse on
two children of that age, and no such deviant personality traits were disclosed
in Dr. Beltrami’s testing of the respondent.  The Crown objected to the
admission of this evidence and a voir dire was held.  Dr. Beltrami
testified in the voir dire as follows:

 








(1)  While it is not possible to establish a standard profile of
individuals with a disposition to sodomize young children, such individuals [translation] “frequently” or
“habitually” exhibited certain distinctive characteristics which could be
identified.  The respondent had been tested for these characteristics and
excluded.

 

(2)  The tests, which had been administered by Dr. Beltrami’s
assistant, but the results evaluated by Dr. Beltrami himself, consisted of two
approaches, the first a series of general personality tests, and the second a
test which Dr. Beltrami considered could detect individuals with serious sexual
disorders.

 

10                              
In the first set of tests, the respondent was asked a series of
questions about his family history, his schooling, his work experiences, his
emotional and sexual life, his hobbies and life habits.  The “Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory Test Version 2” (hereinafter “MMPI2”) was
also administered.  The respondent’s reactions, while being questioned, were
monitored by electromyography (EMG), which measures anxiety.  It acts as a sort
of lie detector.  The objective of the MMPI2 is to identify different potential
personality characteristics, including the tendency to be truthful, to hide
symptoms, to be subject to psychosis, to be depressive, to be hyperactive, to
be anxious, to be histrionic, etc.  These tests are not designed specifically
for the detection of sexual disorders.

 








11                              
The second and more controversial test was directed to the respondent’s
sexual preferences.  It consisted of exposing him to images and sounds of
sexual activity, both normal and deviant, and measuring his physiological
reaction through a gauge attached to his penis.  The “strain gauge” is designed
to pick up signs of physical arousal.  Dr. Beltrami explained that if the
subject has previously derived pleasure from a specific form of sexual
activity, the pleasure is imprinted on the brain, and may be restimulated on
further exposure to pictures or sounds of similar activity.  This is how he
explained it to the court:

 

[translation]

 

Q.   How do you . . . how is it done?

 

A.   The subject is shown normal and deviant
images and is played normal and deviant audio cassettes.

 

Q.   Yes.

 

A.   And those who have derived pleasure in the
past from a deviant sexual activity, this . . . 

 

Q.   This test?

 

A.   . . . this pleasure is kind of ingrained in
his brain in the form of an engram, to use the technical term . . .

 

Q.   Okay, just to . . .

 

A.   And when the subject is shown the same
situations, it will cause either a mini-erection of which he is sometimes not
aware, but a tumescence, that is, a swelling of his penis that is measured with
a device for that purpose that is connected to electronic instruments that take
down the resulting measurements.

 

 

12                              
All of the tests used standardized questions, images and scenarios.  The
respondent was never confronted with specific images designed to replicate the
offences alleged against him.

 








13                              
Dr. Beltrami testified on the voir dire that the first set of
tests showed that the respondent had had an unexceptional childhood, that he
had not been sexually abused, that he had a good education which allowed him to
hold a responsible job and that he was ingenious and entrepreneurial.  He noted
that the respondent often maintained two or three intimate heterosexual
relationships at the same time without his partners knowing about one another. 
There were several children from these various relationships.  Dr. Beltrami
notes [translation] “He clearly
exhibits judgment problems in his tumultuous emotional life.  On the other
hand, he does not seem to have the irrational ideas associated with sexual
offences.”  Dr.  Beltrami noted a tendency on the part of the respondent to
deceive, but apart from some emotional instability with women, Dr. Beltrami
concluded that the respondent did not have any particular pathologies.  

 

14                              
With respect to the plethysmograph test, Dr. Beltrami concluded that the
respondent has [translation] “a
clearly normal profile with a preference for adult women and a slight attraction
to adolescents.  He exhibits no deviation in respect of boys in general or
prepubescent boys”. 

 

15                              
The trial judge ruled Dr. Beltrami’s evidence inadmissible.  He
acquitted the respondent of the charges related to L. but convicted the
respondent of having, for a sexual purpose,
invited, counseled or incited W. to touch the body of the respondent, (s. 152 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ) and having engaged in an
act of anal intercourse (s. 159(1)  of the Criminal Code ).  The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment of two years on each
charge, to be served concurrently.  The majority of the Court of Appeal,
Robert J.A. dissenting, found that Dr. Beltrami’s evidence ought to have
been admitted, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

II.  Judgments

 

1.  Court of Québec, No. 500-01-015157-958, September 27 and
October 18, 1996

 








16                              
Judge Trudel recognized Dr. Beltrami as an expert in psychiatry,
sexology and physiology.  He characterized his evidence, however, as evidence
only of general disposition or propensity to commit this type of offence.  As
such, the evidence did not come within the “distinctive group” exception
recognized in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, which he interpreted as
requiring a scientifically established standard profile of the “distinctive
group” of offenders.  As Dr. Beltrami had acknowledged that no such standard
profile had been developed, the exception was therefore inapplicable and the
evidence excluded.  Convictions were entered in relation to the offences
against W.

 

2.  Quebec
Court of Appeal (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 541

 

17                              
The respondent appealed his conviction on several grounds.  For present
purposes, it is sufficient to summarize the opinions of the Court of Appeal in
relation to the admission of Dr. Beltrami’s evidence, which formed the basis of
the dissent.

 

(a)     Beauregard and Fish JJ.A., majority

 

18                              
Fish J.A., with whom Beauregard J.A. agreed, allowed the appeal and
ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge erred in not admitting
Dr. Beltrami’s evidence.

 

19                              
In the opinion of the majority, even if Dr. Beltrami was unable to
identify a “single set of behavioural characteristics shared by every adult,
male pedophile” (p. 545), he was nonetheless able to give evidence
concerning the respondent’s behavioural profile and to assert, in substance,
that it included none of the characteristics that were in his view “compatible
with the . . . offence with which [he] was charged” (p. 545). 








 

20                              
Concerning the reliability requirement, Fish J.A. did not believe that
absolute reliability was the standard.  He noted that the plethysmograph is
generally recognized by the scientific community and is used by psychiatric
facilities such as the Institut Philippe Pinel de Montréal to monitor the
result of treatment for sexual pathologies.  He noted that Dr. Beltrami had
testified that the respondent’s results show a sexual preference for adult
women and no desire or preference for children.

 

21                              
Fish J.A. did not interpret Mohan, supra, as
requiring “the mechanical exclusion of expert evidence on the sole ground that
the scientific community has not developed a single set of personality traits
-- or single psychological profile -- that is common to every offender who
commits the crime charged” (p. 546).  He observed that in Mohan
Sopinka J. cited R. v. Garfinkle (1992), 15 C.R. (4th) 254 (Que. C.A.),
with apparent approval.  In Garfinkle, the Quebec Court of Appeal
had ruled Dr. Beltrami’s evidence admissible on the facts presented in that
case.

 

22                              
Unlike the expert evidence rejected in Mohan, the evidence of Dr.
Beltrami was to the effect that “the offence charged involves an extreme degree
of sexual deviancy.  It can properly be characterized as distinctive in virtue
of the biological nature of the act and the very young age of the alleged
victims” (p. 547).  These elements point to an offender having one or more distinctive
personality traits.  According to Dr. Beltrami, the person who committed the
offence would likely respond measurably to the penile plethysmograph test since
the instrument is particularly effective in detecting extreme deviance.  The
respondent did not test positive, and Dr. Beltrami’s evidence could therefore
be “of material assistance in determining innocence or guilt”: Mohan,
supra, at p. 37.  The majority allowed the appeal and ordered a
new trial.








 

(b)     Robert J.A., dissenting

 

23                              
Referring to Mohan, supra, Robert J.A. reviewed the
criteria applicable to the admissibility of expert evidence as to disposition
to commit a crime.  What is required is that the person who has committed the
crime or the accused has “distinctive characteristics” that allow the
trier of fact to make comparisons that will help him or her to determine the
issue of guilt.  The dissent is based in part on the following passage in Mohan,
at p. 37:

 

The trial judge should consider the
opinion of the expert and whether the expert is merely expressing a personal
opinion or whether the behavioural profile which the expert is putting forward
is in common use as a reliable indicator of membership in a distinctive group. 
Put another way:  Has the scientific community developed a standard profile
for the offender who commits this type of crime?  An affirmative finding on
this basis will satisfy the criteria of relevance and necessity.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

24                              
Robert J.A. agreed with the trial judge that Dr. Beltrami’s evidence was
inadmissible largely because science has not yet identified a standard profile
for individuals who commit sodomy on young children.  The fact that Dr.
Beltrami considered the respondent’s personality to be incompatible with
characteristics that are [translation]
“frequently” or “habitually” found among people who commit the crime with which
the respondent was accused does not satisfy the Mohan test.  Dr.
Beltrami’s evidence amounted to evidence of general disposition and did not
come within the limited exception to the prohibition against such evidence. 
Robert J.A. would thus have dismissed the appeal.

 

III.  Analysis

 








25                              
Expert witnesses have an essential role to play in the criminal courts. 
However, the dramatic growth in the frequency with which they have been called
upon in recent years has led to ongoing debate about suitable controls on their
participation, precautions to exclude “junk science”, and the need to preserve
and protect the role of the trier of fact – the judge or the jury.  The law in
this regard was significantly advanced by Mohan, supra, where
Sopinka J. expressed such a concern at p. 21:

 

Dressed up in scientific language which the jury does not easily understand
and submitted through a witness of impressive antecedents, this evidence is apt
to be accepted by the jury as being virtually infallible and as having more
weight than it deserves.

 

 

and at p. 24:

 

There is also a concern inherent in the application
of this criterion that experts not be permitted to usurp the functions of the
trier of fact.  Too liberal an approach could result in a trial’s becoming
nothing more than a contest of experts with the trier of fact acting as referee
in deciding which expert to accept.

 

 








26                              
In R. v. Béland, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, La Forest J.
warned at p. 434 about undue weight being given to “evidence cloaked under the
mystique of science”, and more recently in R. v. McIntosh (1997), 117
C.C.C. (3d) 385, the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected the evidence of an expert
who was put forward by the defence to discuss the frailties of eyewitness
identification.  Finlayson J.A. observed that admission of such evidence
would suggest that without expert help “our jury system is not adequate to the
task of determining the guilt of an accused person beyond a reasonable doubt
where the identification evidence is pivotal to the case for the Crown” (p.
395).  The present appeal involves a provincial court judge sitting alone, but
it raises the same controversy about the need to draw the line properly between
the role of the expert and the role of the court.

 

27                              
In Mohan, the Court excluded expert evidence that was directed to
a similar point to the one made here by Dr. Beltrami.  In that case, a
practising physician was charged with four counts of sexual assault on four
female patients aged 13 to 16.  The defence tendered a psychiatrist who was
prepared to testify that the perpetrator of the alleged offences was part of a
limited and distinctive group of individuals (pedophiles and sexual
psychopaths) and that the accused did not possess the characteristics typical
of members of the group.  This Court accepted the trial judge’s conclusion that
science had not yet developed sufficiently standardized profiles of pedophiles
and sexual psychopaths against which an alleged perpetrator could be matched. 
The evidence was therefore rejected as unreliable, and unnecessary in the sense
that it was not required to clarify “a matter otherwise inaccessible” (p. 38).

 

28                              
In the course of Mohan and other judgments, the Court has
emphasized that the trial judge should take seriously the role of
“gatekeeper”.  The admissibility of the expert evidence should be scrutinized
at the time it is proffered, and not allowed too easy an entry on the basis
that all of the frailties could go at the end of the day to weight rather than
admissibility.

 

29                              
The Court’s gatekeeper function must afford the parties the opportunity
to put forward the most complete evidentiary record consistent with the rules
of evidence.  As McLachlin J. noted in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2
S.C.R. 577, at p. 611:

 








Canadian courts, like courts in most common law jurisdictions, have
been extremely cautious in restricting the power of the accused to call
evidence in his or her defence, a reluctance founded in the fundamental tenet
of our judicial system that an innocent person must not be convicted.

 

 

Nevertheless,
the search for truth excludes expert evidence which may “distort the
fact-finding process” (Mohan, at p. 21).  To assist in the
gatekeeper exercise, the Court established a list of criteria against which, on
this appeal, the admissibility of Dr. Beltrami’s evidence must be judged.  For
ease of exposition, I will address these criteria in a sequence that differs
somewhat from that followed in Mohan.

 

1.  Subject Matter of the Inquiry

 

30                              
In Mohan, Sopinka J., at p. 23, approved a passage from Kelliher
(Village of) v. Smith, [1931]  S.C.R. 672, at p. 684, that “[t]he
subject-matter of the inquiry must be such that ordinary people are unlikely to
form a correct judgment about it, if unassisted by persons with special
knowledge”.  See also R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, per
Dickson J., at p. 42; R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, per
Wilson J., at p. 896; and McIntosh, supra, per
Finlayson J.A., at p. 392.

 

31                              
Dr. Beltrami’s evidence satisfies this threshold requirement.  In R.
v. McMillan (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160, aff'd [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824,
Martin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal considered psychiatric evidence
of disposition admissible “where the particular disposition or tendency in
issue is characteristic of an abnormal group, the characteristics of which
fall within the expertise of the psychiatrist” (p. 169 (emphasis
added)).  See also R. v. Lupien, [1970] S.C.R. 263; McMillan, supra;
and R. v. Robertson (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 385 (Ont. C.A.).  This line
of cases was approved in Mohan with the notation that the operative
concept is “distinctive” rather than “abnormal”, at p. 36:








 

In my opinion, the term “distinctive” more aptly
defines the behavioural characteristics which are a pre-condition to the admission
of this kind of evidence.

 

 

32                              
The exception is based on the notion that “psychical as well as physical
characteristics may be relevant to identify the perpetrator of the crime” (McMillan,
per Martin J.A., at p. 173), and “involves the psychiatrist in expressing
his conclusion that the accused does not have the capacity to commit the
crime with which he is charged” (Lupien, supra, per
Ritchie J., at p. 278 (emphasis added)).  This is clearly a proper subject
matter for expert evidence.  Whether or not the evidence tendered in this
particular case is admissible remains to be established.

 

2.  Novel
Scientific Theory or Technique

 

33                              
Mohan kept the door open to novel science, rejecting the “general
acceptance” test formulated in the United States in Frye v. United States,
293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), and moving in parallel with its replacement, the
“reliable foundation” test more recently laid down by the U.S. Supreme Court in
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). 
While Daubert must be read in light of the specific text of the Federal
Rules of Evidence, which differs from our own procedures, the U.S. Supreme
Court did list a number of factors that could be helpful in evaluating the
soundness of novel science (at pp. 593-94):

 

(1)   whether the theory or technique can be and has been tested:

 

Scientific methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and
testing them to see if they can be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what
distinguishes science from other fields of human inquiry.

 








(2)   whether the theory or technique has been
subjected to peer review and publication:

 

[S]ubmission to the scrutiny of the scientific community is a component
of “good science,” in part because it increases the likelihood that substantive
flaws in methodology will be detected.

 

(3)   the known or potential rate of error or the
existence of standards; and,

 

(4)   whether the theory or technique used has
been generally accepted:

 

A “reliability assessment does not require, although it does permit,
explicit identification of a relevant scientific community and an express
determination of a particular degree of acceptance within that community.”

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Widespread acceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular
evidence admissible, and “a known technique which has been able to attract only
minimal support within the community,” . . . may properly be viewed with
skepticism.

 

 

34                              
Thus, in the United States, as here, “general acceptance” is only
one of several factors to be considered.  A penile plethysmograph may not yet
be generally accepted as a forensic tool, but it may become so.  A case-by-case evaluation of novel science is
necessary in light of the changing nature of our scientific knowledge: it was
once accepted by the highest authorities of the western world that the earth
was flat. 

 

35                              
In Mohan, Sopinka J. emphasized that “novel science” is subject
to “special scrutiny”, at p. 25:

 

In summary, therefore, it appears from the foregoing
that expert evidence which advances a novel scientific theory or technique is
subjected to special scrutiny to determine whether it meets a basic threshold
of reliability and whether it is essential in the sense that the trier of fact
will be unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion without the assistance of
the expert.

 

 








The penile
plethysmograph, as noted by Fish J.A., is generally recognized by the
scientific community and is used by psychiatric facilities such as the Institut
Philippe Pinel de Montréal to monitor the result of treatment for sexual
pathologies.  The plethysmograph enables the medical staff to assess the
progress of therapy of known and admitted sexual deviants.  This is
inapplicable to the respondent.  He denies he is part of such a group.  He is
not undergoing therapy.  Dr. Beltrami is a pioneer in Canada in trying to use
this therapeutic tool as a forensic tool where the problems are firstly to
determine whether the offence could only be committed by a perpetrator who
possesses distinctive and identifiable psychological traits, secondly to
determine whether a “standard profile” of those traits has been developed, and
thirdly to match the accused against the profile.  Dr. Beltrami’s evidence is
therefore subject to “special scrutiny”.  While the techniques he employed are
not novel, he is using them for a novel purpose.  A level of reliability that
is quite useful in therapy because it yields some information about a course of
treatment is not necessarily sufficiently reliable to be used in a court of law
to identify or exclude the accused as a potential perpetrator of an offence. 
In fact, penile plethysmography has received a mixed reception in Quebec
courts:  Protection de la jeunesse – 539, [1992] R.J.Q. 1144; R. c.
Blondin, [1996] Q.J. No. 3605 (QL) (S.C.); L. Morin and C. Boisclair in “La
preuve d'abus sexuel:  allégations, déclarations et l'évaluation d'expert”
(1992), 23 R.D.U.S. 27.  Efforts to use penile plethysmography in the
United States as proof of disposition have largely been rejected:  People v.
John W., 185 Cal.App.3d 801 (1986); Gentry v. State, 443 S.E.2d 667
(Ga. Ct. App. 1994); United States v. Powers, 59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir.
1995); State v. Spencer, 459 S.E.2d 812 (N.C. App. 1995); J. E. B. Myers
et al., “Expert Testimony in Child Sexual Abuse Litigation” (1989), 68 Neb. L. Rev.
1, at pp. 134-35; J. G. Barker and R. J. Howell, “The Plethysmograph:  A
Review of Recent Literature” (1992), 20 Bull. Am. Acad. of Psychiatry &
L. 13.

 








36                              
Dr. Beltrami also purported to gain assistance from the personality
inventory tests (MMPI2) about the propensity of the respondent for sexual
deviance, but those tests are too broad and general for that purpose, although
the results may well have provided useful background information to the more
specific plethysmograph test.  Again, it was open to him to establish the
reliability of these tests for the purposes of excluding the respondent as
perpetrator of the offences, but Mohan teaches that the attempt is to be
regarded with “special scrutiny”.

 

3.  Approaching
the Ultimate Issue

 

37                              
Dr. Beltrami’s evidence, if accepted, was potentially very powerful.  Once
it is accepted that the offence was probably committed by a member of a
“distinctive group” from which the accused has been excluded, it is a short
step to the conclusion on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.  Dr.
Beltrami’s underlying hypothesis was that if the respondent did not “score” on
the plethysmograph, he must lack the disposition to commit such acts.  The
inference is that if he lacks the disposition then he did not do it.  The
closeness of his opinion to the ultimate issue is another reason for special
scrutiny, as mentioned by Sopinka J. in Mohan, at p. 25:

 

The closer the evidence approaches an opinion on an ultimate issue, the
stricter the application of this principle.

 

 

See also R.
v. Pascoe (1997), 5 C.R. (5th) 341 (Ont. C.A.), per Rosenberg J.A.,
at p. 357.

 

4.  The
Absence of Any Exclusionary Rule

 








38                              
In McMillan, supra, and again in Mohan, supra,
the Court carved out an exception to the general rule that the character of the
accused, in the sense of disposition to commit or not to commit the offence,
can only be evidenced by general reputation in the community.  The “distinctive
group” exception has already been mentioned.  As explained by Professor A. W.
Mewett in “Character as a Fact in Issue in Criminal Cases” (1984-85), 27 Crim.
L.Q. 29, at pp. 35-36, discussed in Mohan at p. 34 et seq.,
it arises in its relevant aspect where “it is shown that the crime is such that
it could only, or in all probability would only, be committed by a
person having identifiable peculiarities that the accused does not possess”
(emphasis added).  In Garfinkle, supra, pedophiles were
considered such a “distinctive” group.  It may be an issue, however, whether a
particular offence “in all probability would only” have been committed
by a pedophile, as opposed to a non-pedophile whose untypical behaviour was
modified by impulsiveness, stress, alcohol or drugs (R. v. B.L., [1988]
O.J. No. 2522 (QL) (Gen. Div.); R. v. G. (J.R.) (1998), 17 C.R. (5th)
399 (Ont. Ct. (Prov. Div.)).  Thus, in Mohan, supra,
Sopinka J. pointed out at p. 38 that:

 

Notwithstanding the opinion of Dr. Hill, the trial judge was also not
satisfied that the characteristics associated with the fourth complaint
identified the perpetrator as a member of a distinctive group.  He was not
prepared to accept that the characteristics of that complaint were such that only
a psychopath could have committed the act.  There was nothing to indicate any
general acceptance of this theory.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

39                              
Similarly, in McMillan, supra, Spence J., at p. 827,
approved Martin J.A.’s statement when the case was considered by the Ontario
Court of Appeal that the evidentiary exception was limited to cases where “the
offence is of a kind that is committed only by members of an abnormal
group” (p. 173 (emphasis added)).

 








40                              
Subject to this precondition being established on a balance of
probabilities, the personality profile of the perpetrator group must be
sufficiently complete to identify distinctive psychological elements
that were in all probability present and operating in the perpetrator at the
time of the offence.  Lack of distinctiveness robs the exception of its raison
d’être.  Thus R. v. Taillefer (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Que. C.A.),
Proulx J.A., upholding a trial judge’s ruling excluding
psychiatric testimony designed to establish that the perpetrator was marked by
distinctive characteristics that neither accused possessed, stated at p. 34:

 

[translation] . . . the
trial judge, came to the proper conclusion, in a well‑reasoned decision,
that the crime charged did not involve behavioural characteristics which
were sufficiently distinctive to facilitate the identification of the
author of the crime.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

Similarly, in R.
v. B. (S.C.) (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 530 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty and
Rosenberg JJ.A., applying Mohan, supra, stated at p. 537 that:

 

[T]he defence may, however, lead expert evidence of an accused’s disposition where the crime alleged is one that was
committed by a person who is part of a group possessing distinct and
identifiable behavioural characteristics.  In those cases, the defence may
lead  evidence to show that the accused’s mental makeup
or behavioural characteristics excluded him or her from that group.  

 

 

41                              
The question is whether in addition to identifying and describing
the distinct and identifiable behavioural characteristics, the expert must be
able to point to a more elaborate “standard profile” filling in the rest of the
personality portrait.  R. v. K.B. (1999), 176 N.S.R. (2d) 283 (C.A.), per Bateman J.A., at para. 10, is said
to be support for that additional requirement.  It is true, certainly, that in Mohan,
Sopinka J. made reference to a standard profile in one of his formulations
of the issue, at p. 37:

 








Has the scientific community developed a standard
profile for the offender who commits this type of crime?

 

 

The question is what is meant by a “standard profile”.  Given that
the purpose of the evidence is to define with reasonable precision the
psychological characteristics of the class of people to which the perpetrator
belongs, and on that basis argue that the accused is either included or
excluded, the important thing is to identify what exactly differentiates or
distinguishes the perpetrator class from the rest of the population.  The
“standard profile” relates directly to those distinguishing features.  This is
clear from Sopinka J.’s preceding sentence:

 

The trial judge should consider the opinion of the
expert and whether the expert is merely expressing a personal opinion or
whether the behavioural profile which the expert is putting forward is in
common use as a reliable indicator of membership in a distinctive group.

 

 








42                              
The level of detail required in the “standard profile” may vary
with the conclusiveness of individual elements.  For example, if commission of
an offence most likely requires so “distinctive” a psychological trait as
necrophilia, as in R. v. Malbœuf, [1997] O.J. No. 1398 (QL) (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1998] 3 S.C.R. vii, it may be sufficient
for exclusion to show that an accused has no such tendency without requiring
the rest of the perpetrator’s psychological portrait to be completed.  In Malbœuf
itself, the “necrophilia-lust type of murder” was considered sufficiently
distinctive that the Crown was allowed to lead expert evidence that the accused
“demonstrated distinctive characteristics that would place him in the category
of persons who would commit this type of crime” (para. 5).  A high level of
distinctiveness, of course, is in addition to the other limitations on the
Crown’s ability to lead such expert evidence, including the requirements that
it be relevant to an issue other than “mere propensity”, and that its probative
value outweighs its prejudicial effect:  Pascoe, supra, at p.
355.

 

43                              
More common personality disorders are perhaps less distinctive than
necrophilia.  They are less likely to serve as “badges” to distinguish the
perpetrator class from the rest of the population.  Thus in R. v. Perlett,
[1999] O.J. No. 1695 (QL) (S.C.J.), the trial judge found that the personality
profiles of the perpetrators offered by the expert were simply too broad to be
of material assistance in determining guilt or innocence:  “This collection of
ailments appears too general and vague to meet the test in Mohan” (per
Platana J., at para. 36).

 

44                              
Between these two extremes, the range and distinctiveness of personality
traits attributed to perpetrators of different offences will vary greatly.  The
requirement of the “standard profile” is to ensure that the profile of
distinctive features is not put together on an ad hoc basis for the
purpose of a particular case.  Beyond that, the issue is whether the “profile”
is sufficient for the purpose to be served, whether the expert can identify and
describe with workable precision what exactly distinguishes the distinctive or
deviant perpetrator from other people.  If the demarcation is clear and
compelling, the fact the personality portrait cannot be filled in with elements
that do not serve to distinguish the perpetrator is not fatal to acceptance of
the evidence.  While the trial judge was somewhat cryptic in his reasons on
this point, it seems to me his decision is consistent with this analysis.

 








45                              
Fish J.A. pointed out in the court below that Sopinka J., in Mohan,
supra, had cited Garfinkle, supra, where the Quebec Court
of Appeal had allowed expert psychiatric evidence that pedophilia is “abnormal”
and “that Garfinkle does not have such a disposition”.  While the “distinctive
offence” exception recognized in Garfinkle was affirmed in Mohan,
Garfinkle itself was decided without the benefit of the elaboration of
the “gatekeeper” function developed in Mohan.  In Mohan itself,
at p. 38, the exclusory evidence relating to pedophilia was ruled
inadmissible because

 

there was no material in the record to support a finding that the
profile of a pedophile or psychopath has been standardized to the extent that
it could be said that it matched the supposed profile of the offender depicted
in the charges.

 

 

Each case
turns on its facts.  The conclusion of the Garfinkle trial judge,
affirmed by the Quebec Court of Appeal, that in the circumstances there
presented the evidence of Dr. Beltrami was probative and its benefit outweighed
the cost, did not bind the trial judge on the facts of this case, who reached a
contrary conclusion on the evidence presented in the voir dire.

 

5.  A Properly Qualified Expert

 

46                              
Dr. Édouard Beltrami was accepted as qualified in the fields of
psychiatry, sexology and physiology.  It was within his expertise to give
opinion evidence about the various tests administered under his supervision and
his interpretation of the results.

 

6.  Relevance
of the Proposed Testimony

 








47                              
Evidence is relevant “where it has some tendency as a matter of logic
and human experience to make the proposition for which it is advanced more
likely than that proposition would appear to be in the absence of that
evidence” (D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence
(1996), at p. 19).  Because the concept of relevance provides a low threshold
(“some tendency”), Mohan built into the relevance requirement a
cost-benefit analysis to determine “whether its value is worth what it costs”
(p. 21) in terms of its impact on the trial process.  Thus the criteria for
reception are relevance, reliability and necessity measured against the
counterweights of consumption of time, prejudice and confusion:  R. J. Delisle,
“The Admissibility of Expert Evidence:  A New Caution Based on General
Principles” (1994), 29 C.R. (4th) 267.  Whether considered as an aspect of
relevance or a general exclusionary rule, “[t]he reliability versus effect
factor has special significance in assessing the admissibility of expert
evidence” (Mohan, at p. 21).  

 

48                              
It is on this requirement that Dr. Beltrami’s evidence is most
vulnerable.

 

(a)  Existence of a Distinctive Group

 

49                              
Dr. Beltrami’s definition of the “distinctive” group of individuals with
a propensity to commit these “distinctive crimes” is vague.  As the trial judge
and Robert J.A. noted, there is no standard profile.  The reliability of
the scientific foundations of the theory that certain acts will almost always
be done by people having certain distinctive characteristics requires
evidence;  it cannot simply be assumed:  K.B., supra, at para.
12; R. v. S. (J.T.) (1996), 47 C.R. (4th) 240 (Alta. C.A.), at p. 246; R.
v. Dowd (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 360 (N.B.C.A.), at p. 366.  Dr. Beltrami
said that:  [translation] “there
is no point in making me say it a thousand times, there is no standard profile,
but nonetheless I compared certain characteristics that are found frequently,
not absolutely . . .” (emphasis added).  Dr. Beltrami describes these
characteristics in the following way: 

 








[translation]  Well, as I
just mentioned sexual abuse may . . . be  committed by people who have organic
disorders, people who are psychotic, mentally deficient people, alcoholics,
drug addicts, so plainly different people may have committed sexual abuse,
but normally, when young children have been abused with a clear and
unmistakable [sic] such as penetration, there is -- there is no one
typical pathology, there is no pathology that is always the same and can be
categorized, but normally there are a certain number of things that
emerge, and the things that most often emerge are what was mentioned earlier, impulsiveness
and also having inadequate social controls, which often have been passed on.
So yes, it is true that there is no --  it isn’t a particular psychological
type that commits these acts, but when someone has committed that act, there is
a disorder somewhere and I considered all the possible disorders. [Emphasis
added.]

 

 

While the
reference in Mohan to a “standard profile” should not be taken to
require an exhaustive inventory of personality traits, the profile must confine
the class to useful proportions.  A spectrum of personality “disorders” that
stretches from alcoholics to sexual psychopaths is too broad to be useful.  If
a man with more or less ordinary sexual predilections is capable while under
the influence of alcohol or drugs to have committed these offences, the class
of potential perpetrators is insufficiently “distinctive” in the Mohan
sense for the expert evidence to be useful.  Dr. Beltrami considered biological
factors related to sexual interests to be the most important indicator but did
not rule out the possibility that the offence was prompted by behavioural
rather than biological factors.

 

(b)  Specificity of Tests

 








50                              
The defence was obliged to satisfy the court that the underlying
principles and methodology of the tests administered to the respondent were
reliable and, importantly, applicable.  The MMPI2 and related tests were used
to probe for behavioural problems that might trigger conduct that would be out
of sexual character, but these tests were not designed to complement the
plethysmograph test, and in any event drugs and alcohol-related offences are
hardly distinctive in the Mohan sense.  Dr. Beltrami readily
acknowledged that the MMPI2 was not designed for the detection of sexual
disorders and it does not contain any specific probe for unusual sexual
preferences.  Nor were specific scenarios prepared for the plethysmograph test,
as hereinafter discussed.  There was in fact no evidence from the people who
conducted the interviews or administered the plethysmograph test.  No test
protocols were introduced, and there was no confirmation that whatever standard
procedures exist had been followed.  An expert such as Dr. Beltrami is
certainly entitled to rely on data generated by tests carried out under his
supervision, but he more or less disavowed any supervisory function and could
not answer specific questions about how the tests on the respondent were
conducted.

 

(c)   Error Rate in Plethysmograph Results

 

51                              
In his report presented at the voir dire, Dr. Beltrami indicated
that the “sensitivity” of the plethysmograph would detect a sexual deviant 47.5
per cent of the time.  Where a detection was in fact made, the result was
considered highly reliable (97.4 per cent).  The respondent tested negative, i.e.,
was excluded, but the success rate of 47.5 per cent means that even in a test
population consisting entirely of sexual deviants, the test would deliver a
false negative more than half of the time.  Dr. Beltrami observed during the voir
dire, for example, that [translation]
“So, I acknowledge that in the usual literature, with people who come from all
backgrounds, putting all the studies together, that there are about fifty
percent (50%) of individuals who do not score.”  Such a result would render the
test so prone to error as not to be useful for purposes of identification or
exclusion.

 








52                              
When Dr. Beltrami was cross-examined on the 47.5 per cent success rate,
he responded that [translation]
“nonetheless there are also articles that clearly indicate that the younger the
age to which the deviation relates and the more unusual it is, the more
specific and precisely sensitive the test will be”.  He said that some
unidentified studies done “in Montreal” suggested that the detection rate in
more “unusual preferences” could be up to 87 per cent.  Thus the sensitivity of
the test would vary between 47.5 per cent and 87 per cent but Dr. Beltrami did
not give a more precise figure within this range, except to say that in the
case of a perpetrator who derived pleasure from anal penetration of a
prepubescent child the detection rate would likely be at the higher end of the
scale.  He said:

 

[translation]  So then,
when you are talking, if you want my professional opinion on anal penetration,
it is a serious act that, despite what may be said about it, is not really
naively so tolerated by children and it is an act that still requires some
degree of pressure, whether it be psychological, whether it be physical force
or something else, it leaves marks, it leaves marks and the well-known 40% may
rise to 80% because this is really something outside of the norm. 

 

 

53                              
Dr. Beltrami did not explain how, if the basis of the plethysmograph
test was the stimulation of remembrance of past pleasures, the results would vary
according to the degree of deviance from some norm, and the issue was not
addressed in his written report.

 








54                              
Dr. Beltrami agreed that a false negative (i.e., instances where the
plethysmograph failed to identify an actual deviant) can, among other things,
be caused by the fact that the visual and auditive scenarios presented to the
subject lacked certain specific elements of stimulation, for example
humiliation of the victim.  He said that tailor-made scenarios are sometimes
built to fit exactly the alleged acts but that was not done in this case.  The
standardized scenarios used by Dr. Beltrami were not presented to the Court and
no attempt was made to demonstrate that they in fact replicated the type of
stimulation the putative offender would have had while committing the alleged
act.

 

55                              
In my view, the trial judge had good reason to be sceptical about the
value of this testimony.  Even giving a loose interpretation to the need for a
“standard profile”, and passing over the doubts that only a pedophile
would be capable of the offence, the evidence of the test error rate in the
“match” of the respondent with or his “exclusion” from the “distinctive class”
was problematic.  The possibility that such evidence – “cloaked under the
mystique of science” (Béland, supra, at p. 434) – would distort
the fact-finding process, was very real.  Moreover, defence evidence of this
type can be expected to call forth expert evidence from the Crown in response,
with the consequent danger that the trial could be derailed into a controversy
on disposition or propensity, with the trial becoming “nothing more than a
contest of experts with the trier of fact acting as referee in deciding which
expert to accept” (Mohan, at p. 24).  The trial judge did not regard the
testimony as reliable for the purpose of excluding the respondent as a
potential perpetrator of the crime, and consideration of the cost-benefit
analysis seems to support the conclusion that the testimony offered as many
problems as it did solutions.

 

7.  Necessity
in Assisting the Trier of Fact

 








56                              
In Mohan, Sopinka J. held that the expert evidence in question
had to be more than merely helpful.  He required that the expert opinion be necessary
“in the sense that it provide information, ‘which is likely to be outside the
experience and knowledge of a judge or jury’, . . . the evidence must be
necessary to enable the trier of fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to
their technical nature” (p. 23).  In Béland, supra, McIntyre J.,
speaking about the inadmissibility of a polygraph test, cited, at p. 415, Davie
v. Magistrates of Edinburgh, [1953] S.C. 34, at p. 40, on the role of
expert witnesses where Lord Cooper said:

 

Their duty is to furnish the Judge or jury with the necessary
scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so as to
enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the
application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

 

The purpose of
expert evidence is thus to assist the trier of fact by providing special
knowledge that the ordinary person would not know.  Its purpose is not to
substitute the expert for the trier of fact.  What is asked of the trier of
fact is an act of informed judgment, not an act of faith.

 

57                              
Dr. Beltrami clearly did not consider it his function to enable the
trier of fact to appreciate the basis of the suggested inferences from his data
in favour of the respondent.  He offered a packaged opinion but was not
prepared to share with the trial judge the data which he relied upon.  At one
point, asked by the Crown about his failure to produce the chart with the
penile plethysmograph results, Dr. Beltrami said:

 

[translation]  Listen,
Your Honour, we have to understand that if we start – normally we do not submit
the psychological tests in detail or the curves because at that point if we
start calculating everything in centimetres or millimetres, we will be here all
morning.  Let’s just say that this curve, properly analysed, demonstrates the
following results, that there are no, according to how those curves are
normally evaluated, there are no signs of deviant behaviour in him.

 

 

Elsewhere, Dr.
Beltrami gave his reason for non-production of the data on which he based his
opinion as follows:

 








[translation]  Okay.  But
it is not normally produced because otherwise, it would be too complicated to
produce all the details, there would be battles over the little details. 

 

 

58                              
The devil, of course, is often in the “little details” and following the
cross-examination, Crown counsel had this exchange with the judge concerning
the non-production of the key documents:

 

[translation]

 

THE CROWN:

 

I am making my comments to enable my friend to complete, do you
understand what I mean?

 

THE COURT:

 

Yes, but that . . .

 

THE CROWN:

 

In a way . . .

 

THE COURT:

 

That’s his problem.

 

THE CROWN:

 

All right. 

 

 

 

The trial
judge then said to defence counsel:

 

 

 

[translation]

 

THE COURT:

 

. . . So, that’s your own problem . . .

 

 








59                              
Before any weight at all can be given to an expert’s opinion, the facts
upon which the opinion is based must be found to exist.  Even if Dr. Beltrami
had offered an explanation of his data, and explained to the trial judge the
“expert” basis on which he felt the trial judge could draw appropriate
inferences, there remained the question whether Dr. Beltrami’s contribution to
the judge’s ability to form his “own independent conclusion” on the
issue of the respondent’s exclusion was worth the cost in potential distortion
of the judge’s independent consideration of the evidence of opportunity,
the out-of-court statements of the children, the respondent’s parental
relationship with them, and the respondent’s ongoing heterosexual relationships
with several mature women.  It seems to me the trial judge was simply being
offered a conclusory opinion that on cross-examination turned out to be short
on demonstrated scientific support.  In terms of the questions posed in Daubert,
supra, Dr. Beltrami did address “the known or potential rate of error”
but was not asked to address the history or acceptance of the techniques for
diagnostic as opposed to therapeutic purposes, and the level of acceptance for
that purpose amongst his scientific peers.

 

60                              
Dr. Beltrami’s evidence said in effect that the respondent’s denial
ought to be believed because he is not the sort of person who would do such a
thing.  This was close to oath-helping in circumstances not within the expert
witness exception:  R. v. Marquard, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, per
McLachlin J., at p. 248.  As the trial judge excluded Dr. Beltrami’s evidence
because of the lack of a “standard profile”, he did not go on to deal in his
reasons with the necessity requirement, but it certainly would have been open
to him to exclude Dr. Beltrami’s opinion on the basis of a “cost-benefit”
analysis of the necessity requirement as well.

 








8.  The Discretion of the Trial Judge

 

61                              
The Mohan analysis necessarily reposes a good deal of confidence
in the trial judge’s ability to discharge the gatekeeper function (Malbœuf,
supra).  The trial judge addressed himself to the proper legal
requirements established in Mohan.  While he perhaps lingered on the
need for a “standard profile”, his reasons taken as a whole suggest that he was
simply not persuaded, on the basis of the evidence which the defence chose to
put forward, that the Mohan requirements had been met.  The trial
judge’s discharge of his gatekeeper function in the evaluation of the demands
of a full and fair trial record, while avoiding distortions of the fact-finding
exercise through the introduction of inappropriate expert testimony, deserves a
high degree of respect.  In this case, there was much in the evidence to
support the trial judge's decision to exclude Dr. Beltrami's testimony and in
my respectful view the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal erred in
interfering with the exercise of his discretion to do so.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 

Criminal law ‑‑ Charge to jury ‑‑
Reasonable doubt ‑‑ Accused convicted of second degree murder ‑‑
Whether pre-Lifchus charge on reasonable doubt in substantial compliance with
principles set out in Lifchus.

 








The accused was convicted of second degree murder.  He
appealed the conviction on several grounds and, in particular, argued that the
use of certain words and phrases in the trial judge’s charge on “reasonable
doubt” may have misled the jury on its ability to understand and apply the
criminal standard of proof.  The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the
trial judge, who did not have the benefit of this Court’s decision in Lifchus,
had not misled the jury.  The majority emphasized that Lifchus did not
demand that any specific wording be used in the charge and concluded  that the
jury had not been left with a reasonable misapprehension about the correct standard
of proof.  The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the other grounds of
appeal.  The sole issue raised in this appeal as of right was whether the
majority of the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the instructions given by
the trial judge to the jury  on reasonable doubt  were in substantial
compliance with the principles enunciated in Lifchus to alleviate
concerns that the jury may have misunderstood its task.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 








The trial judge’s instructions must be considered as a
whole, and in the overall context of the case, to determine whether there was
substantial compliance with Lifchus.  The absence of one of the required
ingredients of Lifchus, or the inclusion of one of the inappropriate
elements, will not usually be determinative of the charge as a whole. 
Appellate assessment of substantial compliance with the Lifchus
principles in cases where the trial judge did not have the benefit of that
decision is not a mechanical task.  Rather, it is a judgment call on whether
the deficiencies in the charge fall below the Lifchus standard such as
to cause serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead to
the conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial.  The appellate
review of substantial compliance with Lifchus is inevitably in a
transitional phase and the failure of jury charges prior to Lifchus to
reflect its principles cannot be taken to raise by that alone the spectre of an
unfair trial or miscarriage of justice.  At the same time, Canadian courts have
been and will continue to be vigilant to ensure that unfair trials and
miscarriages of justice do not go unremedied.  Here, there was no reason to
interfere with the disposition of the appeal by the majority of the Court of
Appeal, particularly when it thoroughly addressed the elements of the Lifchus
principles and no other issues are raised.  The accused’s trial was not unfair
in the sense that the integrity of the verdict was compromised.

I.  Introduction

 

1                                  
The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Alberta Court of Appeal
erred in its conclusion that the trial judge’s charge to the jury on the
reasonable doubt standard was in accord with the guidelines set out in R. v.
Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320.  That is, whether there was a reasonable
likelihood that the use of certain words and phrases would have misled the jury
in its task of understanding and applying the criminal standard of proof in
their deliberations.

 

2                                 
This is one of a line of cases heard in this Court where the
trial judge did not have the benefit of this Court’s reasons in Lifchus
and where the Court of Appeal did not have the benefit of R. v. Starr,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 2000 SCC 40 (see R. v. Beauchamp, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
720,  2000 SCC 54; and R. v. Avetysan, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 000, 2000 SCC
56).  In Starr, supra, released recently, the majority concluded
that a pre-Lifchus charge to a jury must be reviewed to ensure that
there was substantial compliance with the Lifchus principles.  In short, Lifchus affirmed that there should
be no ritual incantations and reiterated in no uncertain terms that the final
determination was still to be based on whether the charge to the jury, taken
globally, sufficiently informed the jury of the proper standard.

 

II.  Facts

 








3                                  
The appellant was found guilty of second degree murder by a jury on
September 27, 1996.  The incident giving rise to the charge occurred on July
27, 1995, when Kimberley Cahoon was shot in the neck and killed with a shotgun
fired at close range.  The shooting occurred in the kitchen of the home that
the appellant shared with another man.   At trial, the defence put forward the
theory that the appellant’s house-mate had killed Ms. Cahoon.  This theory was
grounded on the view that, given the appellant’s state of intoxication combined
with the consequences of a prior brain injury, the appellant could not have
formed the intent to kill.

 

4                                  
The appellant appealed the conviction on the grounds, inter alia,
that his rights to counsel and silence had been violated, that the trial judge
had improperly instructed the jury on the issues of capacity and intent, and
that the trial judge had misled the jury on the correct standard of proof.  The
Alberta Court of Appeal unanimously rejected all but the last of these
grounds.  With a dissenting opinion on the issue of whether the trial judge
misdirected the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt, the appeal comes
before this Court as of right pursuant to s. 691(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

III.   The
Courts Below

 

A.  Alberta
Court of Queen’s Bench (Sulatycky J.)

 

5                                  
The trial judge provided the jury with the following explanation of the
meaning of the words “beyond a reasonable doubt”:

 








     There is a basic rule of law which applies in this case, as it
does in every criminal case.  It’s the presumption of innocence and that’s been
spoken about already.  The accused is presumed to be innocent until the Crown,
his accuser, has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The presumption
of innocence and the burden of proof in a criminal case are inseparable.  The
burden of proving the guilt of the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt
rests with the Crown and that burden never shifts.  The Crown must prove each
and every element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, and I will shortly
discuss the elements of the offence with you, and it’s simple, but you have to
remember that the reasonable doubt standard applies only to the elements of the
offence and to the guilt of the accused. . . .

 

     Now, when I speak of a reasonable doubt, I use the words in their
ordinary sense and not as a legal term having some special meaning.  By a
reasonable doubt, we do not mean an imaginary or frivolous doubt which may be
conjured up in one’s mind.  Reasonable doubt is an honest and fair doubt, a
doubt based upon reason and common sense, a real doubt which arises from
evidence and not from any conjecture or speculation.  It may also arise from a
conflict in the evidence or from a lack of evidence.  A reasonable doubt is the
sort of doubt for which you can give a logical and rational explanation, if you
were asked to do so by a fellow juror in your jury room.  It that is [sic]
degree of proof which convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience.  It [sic]
that degree of proof which permits you, as a conscientious juror, to say I am
sure.

 

     There is no burden on the accused to prove his innocence.  There
is no burden on the accused to prove anything.  The burden is on the Crown to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

He [the accused] has offered an explanation for making those
statements, and you are asked to accept his explanation as true, or you are
asked to search your conscience and find that, because of his explanation, you
cannot believe the statements beyond a reasonable doubt.  And, therefore, if
you can’t believe them beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused is entitled to
the benefit of that doubt on the truth of those statements.

 

6                                  
After the jury had been charged and had retired to its deliberations,
Sulatycky J. received submissions from defence counsel on the sufficiency of
the charge.  Specifically, defence counsel was concerned about the judge’s
description of the murder weapon, and the presentation of the evidence of the
defence’s expert witness on the memory capability of the accused.  No concerns
were raised about the judge’s explanation of the reasonable doubt standard.  As
a result of these submissions, Sulatycky J. recalled and recharged the jury on
the matter of the weapon and the evidence of the expert witness.

 








7                                  
Sometime later during its deliberations, the jury submitted the
following question to Sulatycky J.: “Does the prosecutor have to prove that the
accused was sober enough to form an intent to kill?”  Sulatycky J. recalled the
jury and provided it with the following answer:

 

The answer is relatively simple, and it is “yes,” but I have to go a
little further than that.  I have to point out that “prove” in the sense that
you’re using it here means prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  So, if you have
any doubt on that issue, you have to give the benefit of the doubt to the
accused.

 

For the offence of murder, the intent may be one of
two kinds.  It may be the intent to kill, which is what you said here, or it
may be the intent to cause bodily harm, knowing that it is likely to cause
death, and being reckless, whether death ensues or not. 

 

.
. .

 

If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused had one of the two intents that are necessary to prove murder,
and if you’re satisfied the accused, in fact, shot the victim, then you must
return a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.  Does that
answer the question?  All right.

 

 

B.  Alberta
Court of Appeal (1998), 219 A.R. 19

 

(1) Hunt J.A. (Bracco J.A. concurring) 

 








8                                  
       Hunt J.A., for the majority, accepted the decisions of Lifchus,
supra, and R. v. Bisson, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 306, as authoritatively
setting out the standard of review for jury instructions on the reasonable
doubt standard of proof.  At the outset, she emphasized that the Lifchus
review did not demand that any specific wording be used in the charge.  In
addition, she noted that not every error would amount to a reversible error. 
Rather, the centre of the analysis focuses on assessing whether the jury fully
understood the requisite criminal standard of proof and, thus, considering the
charge as a whole, the question to be asked is whether there is a reasonable
likelihood that the jury misapprehended this standard of proof (para. 9).  With
these principles in mind, Hunt J.A. reviewed each of the impugned aspects of
the jury charge and ultimately held that she was not convinced that the jury
had been left with a reasonable misapprehension about the correct standard of
proof (para. 30).

 

(i)    “I use the words [reasonable doubt] in their ordinary sense and not as a
legal term having some special meaning.”

 

9                                  
Both the Lifchus and Bisson decisions involved jury
charges where the trial judge had explained that the words “proof beyond a
reasonable doubt” were to be understood in an “ordinary” or “everyday life”
sense.  While in both cases, Cory J., for the Court, held that directing a jury
to understand the criminal standard of proof in an everyday context was
misleading and constituted a reversible error (Lifchus, at para.
23; Bisson, at paras. 7-8), Hunt J.A. interpreted Lifchus
and Bisson to mean that a reversible error arose only when this
“everyday” language was used in the absence of other instructions more properly
explaining the criminal standard of proof (para. 11).  Since “a great deal more
was said to the jury about the concept of reasonable doubt” (emphasis in
original) in Sulatycky J.’s jury charge, and, since these additional instructions
were consistent with the Lifchus guidelines, they acted to cure the
inappropriate direction (paras. 12-16).  

 

(ii)   The use of the words “honest”, “fair”, and
“real” to describe the concept of “reasonable doubt”.

 








10                              
Hunt J.A. noted that Cory J. had cautioned against the use of any words
other than “reasonable” when qualifying the concept of “doubt” because
describing the requisite level of doubt with the words “serious”,
“haunting”, and “substantial” might lead to the application of a varying
standard of proof either higher or lower than the requisite criminal standard (Lifchus,
at para. 26).  Viewing the charge as a whole, Hunt J.A. held that the
qualifying words used by Sulatycky J. were far less problematic than those
identified by Cory J. and were not, therefore, fatal errors (para. 20).

  

(iii)       “A reasonable doubt is the sort of
doubt for which you can give a logical and    rational explanation, if you were
asked to do so by a fellow juror in your jury room.”   

 

11                              
On this point, Hunt J.A. was mindful of Cory J.’s statement that it is
not essential to tell jurors that a reasonable doubt is one for which a reason
can be supplied, since certain doubts are perhaps incapable of articulation (Lifchus,
at paras. 29-30).  Cory J. held that “[i]t will suffice to instruct the jury
that a reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense which must
be logically based upon the evidence or lack of evidence” (Lifchus, at
para. 30).  In Hunt J.A.’s view, Sulatycky J.’s provision of additional
instructions relating to the need for an explanation to a fellow juror did not
do “any harm”, and did not undermine the essence of what was required by Lifchus
(at paras. 21-22).

 

(iv)  “It is that degree of proof which permits
you, as a conscientious juror, to say ‘I am sure’.”

 

 

12                              
Hunt J.A. acknowledged that, without more, it was inappropriate to tell
juries that they can convict if they are “sure” or “certain”, since it is
important that a juror understand, in terms specific to the reasonable doubt
standard, how to come to the requisite certainty.  Hence, it was important that
words of “certainty” be used only after the reasonable doubt standard has been
properly outlined to the jury (citing Lifchus, at paras. 33-34). 
Hunt J.A. dismissed this ground, noting that in this case proper instructions
had been provided to this jury before the use of the word “sure” (para. 23).

 








(v)   “It is that degree of proof which convinces
the mind and satisfies the conscience.”

 

 

13                              
Hunt J.A. turned to Lifchus’s caution that the use of morally
expressive language might misdirect a jury away from an objective standard of
proof.  Cory J. had stated that “if the standard of proof is explained as
equivalent to “moral certainty”, without more, jurors may think that
they are entitled to convict if they feel “certain”, even though the Crown has
failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt” (Lifchus, at
para. 25 (emphasis added)).   Hunt J.A. applied this principle and concluded
that, reading the charge as a whole, “much more” had been said and, as a
result, the jury could not have misapprehended the standard as constituting a
moral rather than a criminal standard of proof (para. 24).

 

(vi)       The absence of an explanation of the
difference between the proof required  in a civil case (balance of probability)
and that required in a criminal case.

 

 

14                              
Cory J. specifically stated that it was important that jurors be told
that they are not to apply a probabilities standard in the context of a
criminal trial (Lifchus, supra, at para. 32).  Hunt J.A. found
that this requirement arose from Cory J.’s concern that some jurors may have
had experiences in civil cases and might inappropriately apply that standard in
the criminal context.  Hunt J.A. considered it just as likely that a number of
the jurors had no such experience and any discussion of the civil standard
might well give rise to confusion.   In any case, Hunt J.A. held that the
omission of these instructions was not serious in the context of the overall charge
(para. 26).

 

(2) Berger J.A. (dissent on reasonable doubt in the jury charge)








15                              
In reviewing the standard of review for jury instructions as to
reasonable doubt, Berger J.A. acknowledged that Major J., in R. v. Malott,
[1998] 1 S.C.R. 123, at para. 15, had stressed that the reasonable doubt charge
did not entail a “standard of perfection”.  Berger J.A. also noted it would be
inappropriate to apply the guidelines outlined in Lifchus on a “score
card” basis.  In this regard, he stressed that “[s]ome errors will more
profoundly impact upon a jury than will others”, especially if these errors are
compounded by other problematic instructions (para. 51).  Consequently, when
reviewing the charge as a whole, it is vital to consider whether other language
or instructions actually work to negate any of the “taints so as to resurrect
the charge to the requisite threshold” (para. 52).

 

16                              
Berger J.A. agreed with the majority that use of the words “real”,
“honest” and “fair” neither enhanced or diminished the validity of the jury
charge.   However, having considered (i) the cumulative effect of the errors in
this charge, and (ii) whether this cumulative level of potential misdirection
was cured by other language in the charge, Berger J.A. held that it was
reasonably likely that a jury misapprehended the requisite standard of proof. 
Specifically, he stated, at para. 56:

 

The majority would seem to agree that “without more”, the charge to the
jury would be fatally flawed.  The additional instructions, however, are
insufficient to lessen the impact of the clear direction to the jury to use the
words “reasonable doubt” in their ordinary sense.  For example, although jurors
would be expected to comply with the judge’s additional instructions to decide
the case on the evidence and to exclude imaginary or frivolous doubt from their
consideration, they would still understand that reasonable doubt had ordinary
and no special meaning.  It seems to me that the additional instructions, taken
as a whole, do not repair the flaw in the “ordinary sense” lens.  The
distortion remains. [Emphasis in original deleted.]

 

IV.  Issue

 








17                              
The question to be answered is whether the majority of the Court of
Appeal erred in finding that the instructions given by the trial judge to the
jury were in substantial compliance with the principles enunciated in Lifchus
to alleviate concerns that the jury may have misunderstood its task.  This
assessment of the sufficiency of the charge is a function primarily exercised
by courts of appeal and requires a detailed review of the charge as a whole in
the full context of the trial:  the complexity of the factual issues to be
resolved, their degree of contentiousness, the nature and quality of the
evidence tendered by the parties, their respective positions at trial, as well
as any concerns that may have been expressed by the jury in its questions after
the charge. 

 

V.   Analysis

 

18                              
In Starr, supra, this Court’s decisions in Lifchus,
supra, and Bisson, supra, were reviewed; in those cases, the
Court addressed the appropriate manner of instructing a jury on the nature of
the reasonable doubt standard.  In
affirming these decisions, the majority in Starr held that “[a] court
reviewing a pre-Lifchus jury charge must examine it to make sure that it
was in substantial compliance with the principles set out in that case” (para.
237).  The adoption of the substantial compliance test reflects the fact that Lifchus
did not introduce a formalistic approach to the review of the definition of
reasonable doubt in charges to the jury.  The Court’s objective in Lifchus
was to simplify jury charges by giving direction on the importance and
definition of reasonable doubt and the standard of evidence required to find
guilt.

 








19                              
While it is not necessary for me to re-summarize that review in these
reasons, I must emphasize the following principle, which is of great importance
in deciding this appeal.  In Lifchus, Cory J. stressed that proper
instructions on the standard of proof were a fundamental component of a fair
trial, and consequently, there are important elements that should be included
in any effective jury charge on reasonable doubt (para. 14).  In support of
this principle, Cory J. provided a number of guidelines for what should be
included and, similarly, what should be avoided in the charge (see Lifchus,
at paras. 36-37). 

 

20                              
As was noted in Starr, at paras. 241-42:

 

The criminal standard of proof has a special significance unique to the
legal process.  It is an exacting standard of proof rarely encountered in
everyday life, and there is no universally intelligible illustration of the
concept, such as the scales of justice with respect to the balance of probabilities
standard.  Unlike absolute certainty or the balance of probabilities,
reasonable doubt is not an easily quantifiable standard.  It cannot be measured
or described by analogy.  It must be explained.  However, precisely because it
is not quantifiable, it is difficult to explain.

 

In my view, an effective way to define the
reasonable doubt standard for a jury is to explain that it falls much closer to
absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities.  As stated in Lifchus,
a trial judge is required to explain that something less than absolute
certainty is required, and that something more than probable guilt is required,
in order for the jury to convict.  Both of these alternative standards are
fairly and easily comprehensible.  It will be of great assistance for a jury if
the trial judge situates the reasonable doubt standard appropriately between
these two standards.  The additional instructions to the jury set out in Lifchus
as to the meaning and appropriate manner of determining the existence of a
reasonable doubt serve to define the space between absolute certainty and proof
beyond a reasonable doubt.

                                                                                                                                                               









21                             
In the present case, as in
others in the past, the trial judge’s
instructions to the jury did not communicate the requisite standard of proof to
the letter of Lifchus.  Specifically, the jury was not told that
the standard was not one of absolute certainty, and was not told that more was
required than the probability of guilt.   Yet,
while the omission of an explanation that clarifies the requisite standard of
proof in a criminal trial constitutes a defect, on its own, it will not
necessarily cause a jury charge to fail.   As was stated in Avetysan,
supra, at para. 11, the absence of one of the required ingredients of Lifchus,
or the inclusion of one of the inappropriate elements, “will not usually be
determinative of the validity of the charge as a whole”. Rather, the instructions given by the trial judge must be considered
as a whole, and in the overall context of the case, to determine whether there
was substantial compliance with Lifchus.

 

22                              
It is also important to emphasize what Major J. states in Avetysan,
at para. 12:

 

It is worth stressing that the principles in Lifchus are to be
applied in a manner that will encourage improvements in the wording of jury
charges, but do not vitiate past charges where the language used, although no
longer preferred, meets the substantially correct test.  A jury charge given
before or after the Lifchus decision should not be faulted merely for
imprecise language.  Rather, as was stated in Starr, supra, it
should be reviewed to determine whether it substantially complies with the Lifchus
principles.  As applied in Russell, supra, and Beauchamp, supra,
the basic question remains:  Does the charge, read as a whole, give rise to a
reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct standard of
proof?  If not, the charge is adequate.

 

23                              
The appellate assessment of substantial compliance with the Lifchus
principles in cases where the trial judge did not have the benefit of that
decision, and may have used, in parts of the charge, language that will likely
be discontinued in the future or omitted parts recommended in Lifchus,
is not a mechanical task.  Rather, it is a judgment call on whether the
deficiencies in the charge fall below the Lifchus standard such as to
cause serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead to the
conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial.

  








24                              
The appellate review of substantial compliance with Lifchus is
inevitably in a transitional phase. Instructions along the lines articulated in
Lifchus, and applied in Starr,
will assist future  juries in better understanding their tasks, and will ensure
that the fact-finding process at trial truly respects the fundamental
requirements of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  In this respect, the failure
of jury charges prior to Lifchus to reflect its principles cannot be
taken to raise by that alone the spectre of an unfair trial or miscarriage of
justice.  Having said that, courts in our country have been and will continue
to be vigilant to ensure that unfair trials and miscarriages of justice do not
go unremedied.

 

25                              
In Starr, as in Avetysan,
the cumulative effect of errors that were made on issues that went to the jury
led us to the conclusion that a new trial was warranted.  In Starr, the
major issue before the Court was that, in the view of the majority, the trial
judge had improperly allowed inadmissible evidence.  In Avetysan, the
trial judge failed to warn the jury that even if it disbelieved the accused, it
could still entertain a reasonable doubt.  Here, without minimizing the
concerns expressed by Berger J.A., I  am not persuaded that there is any reason
to interfere with the majority’s disposition of the appeal, particularly when
it thoroughly addressed the elements of the Lifchus principles.  The fact that the Court of Appeal unanimously
dismissed all other grounds of appeal, and none of these other issues is before
us, distinguishes this case from Starr and Avetysan.  Consequently, I cannot say that the
accused’s trial was unfair in the sense that the integrity of the verdict was
compromised.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

Criminal law — Powers of Court of Appeal — No
subtantial wrong or miscarriage of justice — Court of Appeal dismissing
accused’s appeal from conviction — Whether Court of Appeal erred in applying
Criminal Code proviso to cure trial judge’s errors — Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C‑46 , s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 








The accused was charged with first degree murder for the shooting of a
man in the back of the head while he was sleeping.  At trial, the accused
argued that he committed the homicide in self‑defence.  His defence was
based on an overwhelming fear of the victim that he had developed over the
course of their long and difficult relationship.  A psychiatrist who was called
by the defence testified that, in his opinion, the accused was suffering from
acute anxiety at the time of the shooting.  The accused was convicted of second
degree murder.  On appeal, he challenged inter alia the
trial judge’s instructions to the jury on self‑defence, on the defence
expert’s evidence and on the evidence of the accused’s good character.  He also
challenged the trial judge’s decision to allow the Crown to ask him in cross‑examination
whether he would undergo a blood test and submit to an examination by a Crown
psychiatrist.  The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused’s
appeal.   

 

Held (Arbour J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

Per Gonthier,
Bastarache, Binnie and LeBel JJ.: When assessing whether s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  should be applied, the ultimate question is whether
there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different
absent the error.  In this case, the Court of Appeal did not err in applying
the proviso. Viewed individually or even collectively, the trial judge’s errors
did not give rise to the possibility that the jury might have acquitted in
their absence.

 








A review of the trial judge’s charge demonstrates that any errors in
the charge on the issue of self‑defence caused minimal prejudice. The trial judge’s reference to “a reasonable person . . .
in the accused’s situation” was not so incomplete as to create a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice. Taken as a whole, the charge could not have
given the jury the impression that they were to consider the reasonableness of
the accused’s perceptions from the perspective of the hypothetically neutral
reasonable man, divorced from the accused’s personal circumstances.  The
trial judge related the history of violence and fear that the accused suffered
at the hands of the victim to the reasonable person.  He then clearly directed
the jury to consider, “in light of all that”, the reasonableness of the
accused’s perception and whether an ordinary person, in the same circumstances,
would have had the same perception.  This is a proper approach to the
application of s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code .

 

 The errors in the trial judge’s summary and handling
of the expert’s  testimony also caused minimal prejudice. A review of the
charge as a whole indicates that the trial judge directed the jury to consider
the climate of fear described by the expert in their deliberations and repeated
on numerous occasions his evidence that the accused was in a state of anxiety
at the time of the shooting. By pointing to the expert’s evidence, the trial
judge ensured that his testimony would be considered during the discussion of
each of the elements of self‑defence.  While the trial judge could
have expressed himself more clearly in connecting the expert’s evidence to the
elements of self‑defence, there is no requirement that the jury be
perfectly instructed. Further, the trial judge’s insistence on what the expert
did not consider did not cause serious prejudice to the accused. A judge must
warn the jury that the more the expert relies on facts not proved in evidence,
the less weight the jury may attribute to the opinion.  The corollary is also
true: the more the expert fails to consider relevant facts, the less weight the
jury may attribute to the opinion. Lastly, although it would
have been preferable for the trial judge to expand his comments on the details
of the expert’s testimony, his failure to do so, in light of the whole charge
and the overwhelming evidence, did not result in a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.  The accused’s contention that where the defence is
difficult there is no room for error on the part of the judge is rejected.  The
curative proviso is applicable if, as here, the standard is met.

 








The verdict would have been the same if the trial
judge had properly directed the jury that the accused’s character evidence was
relevant in assessing whether he could have committed murder.  He only
mentioned this once and thereafter restricted his comments to the relation
between the evidence and the credibility of the accused.  This error is of
minor significance in the context of the charge as a whole and consequently
caused little prejudice to the accused.  The focus here is on the
reasonableness of the accused’s perception that an attack was imminent and on
his perception that there was no reasonable alternative when he approached his
sleeping victim and shot him in the back of the head at close range.  The
evidence of good character sheds little light on this question.

 

With respect to the accused’s refusal to give a blood
sample, even if this refusal had some effect on the accused’s credibility, the
effect was greatly diminished by the trial judge’s direction that no adverse
inference could be drawn from the refusal.  In light of the trial judge’s
warning, the prejudice suffered by the accused was minimal.  When considered in
the context of the defence as a whole, this issue was so removed from the heart
of the case that it had very little significance. 

 








Finally, since  the Crown  had the right to counter
the expert evidence used to support the accused’s theory that he killed in self‑defence,
it was entitled to ask the accused whether he would undergo a psychiatric
assessment. While it would have been preferable if the question acknowledged
that the Crown had previously received the accused’s refusal, that issue,
coupled with the request for a blood test, does not amount to a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice. The trial judge did not err in law by
instructing the jury that the refusal was relevant to the probative value of
the defence expert’s evidence. Even if this were not the case, this is a
situation where s. 686(1) (b)(iii) could be applied to rectify an error
since there would have been little prejudice caused to the accused.

 








Per Arbour J.
(dissenting):  At trial, without notice and in the presence of the jury, the
Crown asked the accused whether he would agree to submit to a second
psychiatric assessment by a particular expert.  The accused refused.  When an
accused relies on a psychiatric assessment in support of any defence, his
refusal to be examined for the same purposes by a Crown expert may be the
subject of an inference adverse to him and the trial judge must so instruct the
jury.  This rule is an exception to the fundamental principle of the right to
silence.  It is therefore essential that this exceptional rule be administered
fairly and equitably and in a manner consistent with its underlying principle. 
From this perspective, it is inappropriate for the Crown to invite the jury to
draw a negative conclusion from the accused’s refusal to submit to examination
by its experts, when the Crown itself led no evidence challenging the expert
opinion offered by the defence.  Before taking advantage of the exception, the
Crown must first lay the factual foundation of its assertion by challenging the
defence’s psychiatric assessment.  It may then lead evidence of the accused’s
refusal, provided it does so avoiding tactics that are unfair or unduly
prejudicial to the accused.  Because of how the Crown chose to proceed in this
case, it cannot now rely on the exception.  The Crown did not retain the
services of an expert, and did not contradict the opinion of the defence
expert.  It confined itself to putting the question here in issue to the
accused.  The question was asked in the presence of the jury, immediately
following a question of the same type which also should never have been asked. 
The cumulative effect of the accused’s refusal to provide a blood sample and
refusal to submit to a second psychiatric assessment, in rapid succession,
proved highly prejudicial, for no good reason, to the general credibility of
his defence.  Moreover, the question itself was not particularly helpful, since
it contained an inherent ambiguity regarding the specific subject-matter of the
refusal, thus making it difficult for the jury to be invited to draw any
conclusion whatsoever from that refusal.  In view of the circumstances of this
case, the judge’s instructions in his charge to the jury at the end of the
trial regarding what use could be made of the accused’s refusal failed to
remedy the original error of allowing the question to be asked.

 

As to the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii),
where an error, or a series of errors, relates to the very essence of the
defence and could influence the jury’s assessment of a question of fact that
has a very direct bearing on the accused’s guilt, it is difficult to conclude
that the rest of the evidence is sufficiently conclusive for the curative
provision to be applied.  The central issue in this case was whether, at the
time the accused shot the victim, he had a reasonable perception that his life
was in danger and that he could not otherwise escape from the threat to his
safety. The psychiatric evidence of the accused’s pathological fear of the
victim was therefore fundamental.  As well, the nature of the evidence also
required very clear instructions regarding the assessment of the reasonableness
of the accused’s beliefs.  The errors in the judge’s instructions to the jury
concerning these two issues were inevitably fatal, since it is impossible to
argue that the verdict would have been the same had it not been for those
errors.  The cumulative effect of the errors unanimously found by the Court of
Appeal to have occurred, combined with the serious and prejudicial error of
allowing the Crown to ask the accused whether he would consent to a second
psychiatric assessment by its expert, requires that the conviction be set aside
and a new trial ordered.  The majority of the Court of Appeal did not
systematically consider the requirements of that provision and, in particular,
the cumulative effect of the errors they identified.  All that the majority did
was to make several isolated references to the fact that the error committed
had not prejudiced the accused.  That approach does not meet the rigorous
requirement of the curative provision of the Code.

appeal from his conviction of second degree murder.  Appeal dismissed, Arbour
J. dissenting.

The judgment of Gonthier, Bastarache, Binnie and LeBel
JJ. was delivered by        

 

1                                  
Bastarache J. — The
appellant Patrick Charlebois was convicted of second degree murder for shooting
Éric Jetté in the back of the head while he was sleeping.  At trial, Charlebois
argued unsuccessfully that he committed the homicide in self-defence.  The
question raised in this appeal is whether the appellant is entitled to a new
trial, based on errors committed by the trial judge.  In my view, any errors
committed by the trial judge did not cause significant prejudice to the
appellant and can be cured by s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 








I.  Facts

 

2                                  
The appellant’s argument of self-defence was based on an
overwhelming fear of Jetté that he had developed over the course of their long
and difficult relationship.  The record establishes that while Charlebois and
the victim were sometimes friendly, Jetté dominated and regularly took
advantage of the more dependent Charlebois.  The appellant’s unstable and
violent childhood explains in part how Jetté was able to make him his [translation] “whipping boy”.

 

3                                  
The night of the murder, Jetté argued with his girlfriend and came over
to Charlebois’ apartment.  Shortly thereafter, while the appellant’s neighbour
Alain Lalancette was still present, Jetté flicked a knife in front of the
accused’s face and said:  [translation]  “Yea, we’re going to have some fun
tonight, you and me.”

 

4                                  
Charlebois testified that his apprehension grew after Lalancette
departed, particularly when Jetté noticed that the appellant actually had in
his possession a firearm that he had refused to sell to Jetté on the pretense
that he no longer had it.  Nevertheless, Jetté said nothing about the rifle. 
After the accused’s roommate came home, Jetté relaxed on the couch and told the
appellant to go to sleep.

 

5                                  
The appellant testified that once in his bedroom, his panic became
overwhelming.  He got up, took the rifle, approached Jetté and shot him in the
back of the head while he was sleeping.  There was no argument, skirmish or
threat.  Immediately after the shooting, the accused phoned 911 and made up the
following story about a physical altercation:

 








[translation]  . . .
I’ve just committed a murder . . . I was so afraid, I split. . . . [H]e was
completely drunk when he came to my place. . . .  So, anyways, so he knew that
I had a gun, then he took it, his girlfriend left him, so anyways, he was totally
tripping, so I tried to convince him not to do anything stupid, then we started
arguing, and the shot went off. . . .  I was really stoned eh so bang
everything happened at once oh shit. . . .

 

When he was
arrested, the accused said:  [translation]
“I’ve done something stupid.” The jury found the accused guilty of murder in
the second degree.

 

6                                  
On appeal, the accused challenged inter alia the trial judge’s
instructions to the jury on self-defence, the defence expert’s evidence, and
the evidence of the appellant’s good character.  He also challenged the trial
judge’s decision to allow the Crown to ask him in cross-examination whether he
would undergo a blood test and submit to an examination by a Crown
psychiatrist.  The Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, Fish J.A.
dissenting:  (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 414.  The accused appeals to this Court as
of right.

 

II.  Legislation

 

7                                  
Section 34 of the Code sets out the elements of
self-defence:

 

34.  (1)  Every one who is unlawfully
assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force
by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous
bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.

 

(2)  Every one who is unlawfully assaulted and who
causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if

 

(a)  he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or
grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally
made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and

 

(b)  he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot
otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.








While the
trial judge left both s. 34(1)  and s. 34(2)  with the jury, the circumstances of
the present appeal fall under subs. (2) since it is evident that the appellant
responded with force intending to cause death or grievous bodily harm.

 

8                                  
The focus of this appeal is the application of the curative provision of
the Code.  Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code reads:

 

686.  (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction . . . the court of appeal

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(b)  may dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(iii)  notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any
ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) [on a question of law] the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

 

III.  Issues

 

9                                  
The appellant argues that the Court of Appeal erred by applying s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
to four errors of the trial judge:

 

a) erring in his instructions to the jury on self-defence;

b) improperly presenting the defence expert’s evidence to the jury;

c) limiting the relevancy of the evidence of the accused’s good
character; and

d) allowing the Crown to ask whether the accused would undergo a blood
test.








 

The appellant
also argues that, contrary to the conclusion of the Court of Appeal, the trial
judge erred in law by allowing the Crown to ask him whether he would submit to
an examination by a Crown psychiatrist.  Before I address each of these errors
and this latter question, I will review the standard for the application of the
proviso.

 

IV.  Analysis

 

10                              
Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code authorizes an appeal
court to dismiss an appeal, despite the presence of an error at trial, where
the court believes there has been no “substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice”.  In Mahoney v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, at p. 852,
McIntyre J. explained how the Court is to determine whether a substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice has occurred:

 

[T]he proviso may be applied only following a legal determination that
errors have been made at trial, but that “no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice has occurred”, and then only according to a strict legal test.  The
determination of what will constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice must involve the construction of those words in the context in which
they are used in the Statute, and such statutory construction has long been
considered a matter of law.  The Court’s decision involves an analysis of
the rights accorded by law to an accused and the measurement of the impact of
the errors which were made at trial.  Once an appellant establishes in the
Court of Appeal that errors of law were made at his trial he becomes entitled
to have his appeal allowed and a new trial or an acquittal, depending on the
circumstances, unless the proviso is applied to annul those rights.  The
Court of Appeal must consider the errors against the background of the whole
trial.  While a reconsideration of the evidence is involved, clearly the
inquiry goes far beyond the determination of matters of fact.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

In Mahoney,
the Court applied the proviso to cure the trial judge’s error (instructing the
jury that an adverse inference could be drawn from the accused’s delay in
revealing his whereabouts) due to the overwhelming weight of the real evidence.








11                              
The proper application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) was recently
addressed in R. v. Brooks, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 237, 2000 SCC 11.  Writing
for the dissent, Major J. adopted his statement in R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2
S.C.R. 599, which precisely outlines the threshold for applying the proviso. 
Major J. confirmed at para. 104 that the task of the appellate court is to

 

determine whether there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict
would have been different had the error at issue not been made.

 

Implicit in my
reasons in Brooks is my acceptance of his statement as a proper
explanation of the law.  As conceded by the Crown, the proviso should only be
applied where

 

the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably
convict.  In such circumstances, depriving the accused of a proper trial is
justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable
result would be another conviction.

 

(R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 916)

 

12                              
With that in mind, I will examine each of the errors which allegedly
entitles the appellant to a new trial to determine first the extent of error,
and second, whether the proviso should be applied in the circumstances of this
case.  This latter question involves determining whether there is any
reasonable possibility that the jury would have acquitted if the errors had not
been made.

 

(1)  The
Extent of the Error in Charging the Jury on Self-defence

 








13                              
The trial judge properly identified the three elements of self-defence
for the jury:  (1) the existence of an unlawful assault; (2) a reasonable
apprehension of a risk of death or grievous bodily harm; and (3) a reasonable
belief that it is not possible to preserve oneself from harm except by killing:
see R. v. Pétel, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3.  He directed that the assessment of
each of these elements involved considering first, the accused’s perception,
and second, the view of  [translation]
“a reasonable person, an average person, in the accused’s situation”.  This is
consistent with the simultaneously subjective and objective nature of the test,
as described in Reilly v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 396, at p. 404:

 

Subsection (2) of s. 34 places in issue the
accused’s state of mind at the time he caused death.  The subsection can only
afford protection to the accused if he apprehended death or grievous bodily
harm from the assault he was repelling and if he believed he could not preserve
himself from death or grievous bodily harm otherwise than by the force he
used.  Nonetheless, his apprehension must be a reasonable one and his belief
must be based upon reasonable and probable grounds.  The subsection requires
that the jury consider, and be guided by, what they decide on the evidence was
the accused’s appreciation of the situation and his belief as to the reaction
it required, so long as there exists an objectively verifiable basis for his
perception.  [Emphasis added; underlining in original deleted.]

 

The trial
judge explained the objective aspect of the test to the jury in the following
terms:

 








[translation]  Assuming
that your deliberations lead you to answer “yes” to each of these questions
[the three elements of s. 34(2) , from a subjective point of view], you
must then determine whether the accused’s perception was reasonable.  This is
the reasonable person test.  Would a reasonable person, an average person,
in the accused’s situation have had the same perceptions?  The reasonable
person is not “superman”, but neither is he mentally incompetent.  The
reasonable person is John or Jane Doe, an average person.  So, each element
. . . perception of an unlawful assault, apprehension of the risk of
death, and the belief that it is not possible to preserve oneself from harm
except by killing the victim must first be assessed subjectively.  And by subjective
I mean from the accused’s point of view, the accused’s perception.  And second,
objectively, from the point of view of a reasonable person.  In the three
cases, in the three situations, in other words, in assessing the three elements
that are essential if a defence of self‑defence is to be available, you
must determine what the accused’s perception of the relevant facts was and
whether it was reasonable.  It therefore involves an objective assessment,
and so an honest but reasonable mistake with respect to whether there was an
attack is therefore allowed.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The Court of
Appeal held that the trial judge erred by introducing a reference to “a
reasonable person, an average person, in the accused’s situation” that was
ambiguous and unclear.  The appellant suggests that at a minimum the trial
judge should have informed the jury that the ordinary person was infused with
the appellant’s individual characteristics.

 

14                              
After reviewing the charge as a whole, I do not believe the lack of
precision in the trial judge’s reference was serious.  The trial judge related
the history of violence and fear that the appellant suffered at the hands of
the victim to the reasonable person.  When read in the context of the charge as
a whole, this part of the directions would have clearly indicated to the jury
that the appellant’s perception was to be weighed by considering whether a
reasonable person, infused with Charlebois’ experience, placed in the
circumstances of the night in question, would reasonably have had the same
perceptions.  This was not a case where the jury was misdirected to assess the
reasonableness of the appellant’s perceptions from the view of an “outsider”;
see R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, at p. 883.

 

15                              
In Pétel, supra, at p. 14, the Court,
unanimous on this point, concluded that the trial judge correctly charged the
jury by saying it should “try to determine how the accused assessed the
situation and compare that assessment with what a reasonable person placed in
the same circumstances would have thought”.  This is precisely how the trial
judge proceeded here.  The trial judge indicated that the jury should assess
the reasonableness of Charlebois’ perceptions in light of the previous violence
experienced by the accused:








 

[translation]  Would
a reasonable person, in the same circumstances, have perceived the events in
the same way?

 

I suggest that you use the same reasoning when you
consider the second element:  reasonable apprehension of a risk of death or
grievous bodily harm.  The accused used the word fear quite often in his
testimony.  Does the evidence demonstrate a history of violence between him and
Jetté?  There is certainly evidence of violence on two occasions, each one
involving a theft.  Other than that, is there reason to believe that the
accused apprehended a risk of death?  You have all sorts of evidence to help
you.  You have the testimony about Jetté.  You have testimony that he was a
violent man, an individual who was very fond of fighting.  You have his
criminal record, which, as the Crown pointed out, shows no violent crimes.  You
have the period of time for which the accused had known Jetté.  And you have
evidence of a relationship that was stormy at times and harmonious at others.

 

So, in light of all that, you will consider
whether he had a reasonable apprehension of a risk of danger under the
circumstances.  And whether a reasonable person, under the same
circumstances, would have had the same perception.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Having
completed his description of the violence between the appellant and the victim,
the trial judge quite clearly directed the jury to consider, “in light of all
that”, the reasonableness of the accused’s perception and whether an ordinary
person, in the same circumstances would have had the same perception.  In my
view, this is a proper approach to the application of s. 34(2) .

 

16                              
The appellant relies on Lavallee, supra, for support.  In
my view, that case has no application here.  In Lavallee, the Court
found that in applying the objective part of s. 34(2)  in the context of
battered woman syndrome, the reference to the “ordinary man” was inappropriate
(at p. 874):

 








If it strains credulity to imagine what the
“ordinary man” would do in the position of a battered spouse, it is probably
because men do not typically find themselves in that situation.  Some women do,
however.  The definition of what is reasonable must be adapted to circumstances
which are, by and large, foreign to the world inhabited by the hypothetical
“reasonable man”.

 

It was
conceded by the appellant that the relationship between the appellant and the
victim here is quite distinguishable from that present in Lavallee.  To
allow the appeal on this ground would be to legitimize an extension of Lavallee
that is not justified on the facts or in policy.  While we have relaxed the
requirement of imminency of the threat in the self-defence analysis particular
to battered women, on the basis of expert evidence outlining the unique
conditions they face, there is no justification for extending its scope further
on the evidence presented in this case.

 

17                              
Finally, the appellant also argues that the jury was misdirected on the
critical third element, whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief
that he had no other option except to kill.  The appellant contends that the
trial judge did not clearly set out that, if the accused’s perception was
honestly and reasonably held, it would satisfy the requirements of s. 34(2) 
even if the perception was in error.  The following passage from the charge
demonstrates that the trial judge perfectly understood his task:

 

[translation]  There
is evidence that at the moment when the accused shot the victim, he believed
that an attack was imminent.  It may be that you will find that the accused’s perception
was mistaken.  Even if the accused’s perception was mistaken, but you
believe that he still acted reasonably, he is entitled to be found not guilty,
as long as the force used meets the requirements of 34(2), that is, that he
could not otherwise preserve himself from death than by killing the victim. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

This direction
is consistent with the seminal direction given in Reilly, supra,
at p. 404:

 








Since s. 34(2) places in issue the accused’s
perception of the attack upon him and the response required to meet it, the
accused may still be found to have acted in self‑defence even if he was
mistaken in his perception.  Reasonable and probable grounds must still exist
for this mistaken perception in the sense that the mistake must have been one
which an ordinary man using ordinary care could have made in the same
circumstances.

 

The appellant
also argues that the jury should have been directed that there is no formal
obligation to retreat from one’s home.  In the precise circumstances of this
case in view of the general allegation made, I do not think it is necessary to
deal with the broader issue.  The accused and victim did not live together. 
The issue here is whether there was a reasonable possibility of retreat at the
time of the homicide.

 

18                              
A review of the trial judge’s charge demonstrates that any errors in the
charge on the issue of self-defence caused minimal prejudice and, consequently,
I would follow the lead of the majority of the Court of Appeal and apply s.
686.  I accept the respondent’s position that the reference to “a reasonable
person . . . in the accused’s situation” was not so incomplete as to
create a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  Taken as a whole, the
charge could not have given the jury the impression that they were to consider
the reasonableness of the appellant’s perceptions from the perspective of the
hypothetically neutral reasonable man, divorced from the appellant’s personal
circumstances.

 

(2)  The
Extent of the Error Related to the Expert Testimony

 








19                              
Dr. Lafleur is a psychiatrist who was called by the appellant to offer
an expert opinion that the appellant was suffering from acute anxiety at the
time of the shooting.  He was the last witness to testify.  The appellant
emphasized the failure of the trial judge to properly summarize Dr. Lafleur’s
evidence and to relate it to his defence.  Both the dissent and the majority of
the Court of Appeal were of the view that the charge was somewhat defective in
those respects.  As the following demonstrates, the majority of the Court of
Appeal very properly decided that s. 686(1) (b)(iii) should apply.

 

 

(i)  The Summary of Dr. Lafleur’s Testimony

 

20                              
The judge must squarely put before the jury the essential elements of
the evidence that can support the accused’s defence.  Here, the appellant
contends the trial judge erred in two respects:  first, in failing to summarize
Dr. Lafleur’s evidence, and second, in unfairly discounting Dr. Lafleur’s testimony
by over-emphasizing the fact that his opinion was not based on all the relevant
evidence.

 

21                              
In my view, these allegations do not reveal a serious miscarriage of
justice.  On the first complaint, a review of the charge as a whole
demonstrates that the trial judge detailed Dr. Lafleur’s evidence on several
occasions.  In fact, the charge is replete with references to his testimony,
which, I repeat, was the last one heard and fresh in the memory of the jury.  I
also do not accept that the trial judge’s insistence on what Dr. Lafleur did
not consider caused serious prejudice to the appellant.

 

22                              
The trial judge first referred to Dr. Lafleur’s testimony early in his
charge, when directing the jury on the assessment of expert evidence. 
Immediately prior to an adjournment, the trial judge summarized the basis of
Dr. Lafleur’s opinion as follows:

 








[translation]  You
must, in my view, weigh the testimony of Dr. Lafleur with great prudence
because the conclusions of Dr. Lafleur were contested during Crown arguments. 
In many cases, Dr. Lafleur alluded to statements obtained from a whole series
of persons who testified before you, but, on the other hand, there are certain
other things which he did not examine at all.  Particularly, the 911 cassette. 
I would also mention the photographs and the plan of the apartment.  Nor did he
take any interest in the position of the victim when assessing something which
went to the very heart of the argument of self-defence.  

 

I am not stating any opinion on the value of his
testimony.  That is up to you to decide, but certainly you must look not only
at the information he addressed but also at those things he did not consider in
reaching his conclusion.

 

This direction
was clearly proper.  As directed in Lavallee, supra, at p. 896,
“[t]he judge must, of course, warn the jury that the more the expert relies on
facts not proved in evidence the less weight the jury may attribute to the
opinion.”  I would add that the corollary is also true:  the more the expert
fails to consider relevant facts, the less weight the jury may attribute to the
opinion.

 

23                              
The appellant argues that the trial judge unnecessarily repeated the
shortcomings of the evidentiary foundation of Dr. Lafleur’s report.  This
contention is based on the comment made by the trial judge upon resuming, after
the above noted adjournment:

 

[translation]  Before
the adjournment, I was in the process of cautioning you that, particularly with
respect to the testimony of Dr. Lafleur, it was important that you take into
account not only what he considered, but what he failed to consider.  Dr.
Lafleur offered an opinion with respect to the state of mind of the accused at
the time the incident occurred with the aim of supporting the claim of the
accused, that he apprehended an immediate assault.  

 

The fact that Dr. Lafleur did not ask any questions as
to whether or not the victim was sleeping, whether the lights were on or off,
nor whether or not the victim was even aware of the accused’s entry.  That he
was not aware that the victim was stretched out on his stomach on the sofa. 
Nor saw the photos.  He was not aware of the “blow with the butt of the gun”. 
These are all factors which you might want to consider in deciding what weight
you wish to attach to the opinion of Dr. Lafleur relating to the perception of
the accused.

 








In my view,
the repetition of directions made before the break was unnecessary.  I note,
however, that in his first sentence, the trial judge properly warned the jury
that in assessing Dr. Lafleur’s evidence, they should consider both what he
considered and what he did not.

 

 

(ii)   The Failure to Relate Dr. Lafleur’s Testimony to the Elements
of Self-

defence

 

24                              
In R. v. G. (R.M.), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 362, at para. 9,
our Court recalled the long accepted rule that:

 

In the course of giving directions to a jury, it is
essential that the trial judge outline for them the theory or position of the
defence and refer the jury to the essential elements bearing on that defence in
such a way that it will ensure the jury’s proper appreciation of the evidence.

 

The appellant
asserts that the trial judge did not specifically relate Dr. Lafleur’s evidence
to the relevant elements of self-defence.  This was the heart of the dissent in
the court below (at p. 433):

 

. . . as my colleague notes, the judge did not review
uncontradicted expert evidence called in support of that defence.  Still less
did he relate that evidence to the component of self-defence upon which it bore
– the reasonableness of appellant’s perception that he was acting in
self-defence.

 








The trial
judge connected Dr. Lafleur’s evidence to the elements of self-defence on
several occasions, although he did not specifically announce each time that
this is what he was doing.  Even if the trial judge could have expressed
himself more clearly, “a standard of perfection is not the test when an
appellate court reviews a jury charge” (R. v. Malott, [1998] 1
S.C.R. 123, at para. 15).  In R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, our
Court recognized at para. 2 that while there is an entitlement to a properly
instructed jury, “[t]here is . . . no requirement for perfectly
instructed juries” (emphasis deleted).  One must accept that it is not
incumbent on the trial judge to make an argument for the defence or to fashion
the most favourable charge to the defence; see R. v. Dickhoff (1998),
130 C.C.C. (3d) 494 (Sask. C.A.).

 

25                              
As reproduced previously, in explaining the significance of Dr.
Lafleur’s evidence to the defence, the trial judge correlated his evidence with
the first element of self-defence, the apprehension of an immediate attack:

 

[translation] 
Dr. Lafleur offered an opinion with respect to the state of mind of the accused
at the time the incident occurred with the aim of supporting the claim of the
accused, that he apprehended an immediate assault.

 

By
highlighting that Dr. Lafleur’s assessment of the appellant’s state of mind
supported the appellant’s fear of an imminent attack, the trial judge described
the essence of the expert testimony and the defence purpose behind calling it. 
Moreover, in discussing the third element of self-defence, whether the
appellant had a reasonable belief that he had no other option but to use force,
the trial judge again referred to Lafleur’s testimony:

 

[translation]  The
belief that one cannot preserve oneself otherwise than by killing the
assailant, reasonable belief.  Did he believe that the only way to preserve
himself was to kill the victim?  That is the first question you are going to
ask yourselves.  And of course, to help you, you have the evidence that Piché
was in his room.  The Lalancettes were in apartment 3.  The door that was in
the hallway was accessible even before entering the living room.  Yes, it’s
true, Dr. Lafleur talked about a climate of fear, but do not forget his
testimony that the accused realized that killing someone was morally and
legally wrong.  There is no question in this case of a mental disorder in any
sense.








The appellant contends that in connecting Dr. Lafleur’s evidence
with the plainly irrelevant issue of mental disorder, the trial judge
improperly discounted its value.  I do not believe this narrow claim is very
significant.  In my view, the trial judge simply reminded the jury that Dr.
Lafleur’s evidence of the appellant’s fear was relevant in their consideration
of this element of self-defence.  The fact that afterwards he dismissed
irrelevant issues has little significance, especially when the charge is looked
at as a whole.

 

26                              
Finally, I note that the trial judge recognized that Dr. Lafleur’s
testimony was relevant to the presence of the premeditation required for a
conviction of first degree murder.  He stated:

 

[translation]  Perhaps
Dr. Lafleur’s testimony would be useful in this respect.  If you accept
the state of anxiety described by the accused and Dr. Lafleur in their
testimony, you will perhaps ask yourselves, could he, the accused, in that kind
of state, weigh and analyse the pros and cons of killing Jetté?

 

By finding him
guilty of second degree murder, the jury accepted that there existed a
reasonable doubt that the appellant had premeditated the murder.  The trial
judge’s reference to Dr. Lafleur’s testimony supported the appellant’s position
that it was only in his state of anxiety that he was incapable of weighing and
analyzing his decision to act.  The trial judge’s acknowledgment that Dr. Lafleur’s
evidence, if accepted, would cast doubt on the appellant’s ability to weigh
alternatives is another tie between the evidence and the third element of
self-defence.

 








27                              
The foregoing passages of the jury charge demonstrate that the errors in
the trial judge’s summary and handling of Dr. Lafleur’s testimony caused
minimal prejudice.  The trial judge directed the jury to consider the climate
of fear described by Dr. Lafleur in their deliberations and repeated on
numerous occasions his evidence that the appellant was in a state of anxiety at
the time of the shooting.  By pointing to Dr. Lafleur’s evidence, the trial
judge ensured that his testimony would be considered during the discussion of
each of the elements of self-defence.

 

28                              
That being said, I agree that it would have been preferable for the
trial judge to expand his comments on the details of Dr. Lafleur’s testimony,
as was suggested in the majority reasons of Beauregard J.A. (at p. 424):

 

[translation] 
It would have been preferable, after having stated to the jury that Charlebois
relied on self‑defence, that the judge refer the jury to the opinion of
the psychiatrist Lafleur further to which, when he pulled the trigger,
Charlebois was suffering from chronic anxiety which became acute by the arrival
of Jetté at his home, the knife incident and the presence and discovery by
Jetté of the gun in the apartment.  Thus, prior to dealing with the weak points
of the psychiatrist’s testimony, the judge could have shown the positive
aspects.

 








I agree with
Beauregard J.A. in that I remain convinced that the failure to fully detail Dr.
Lafleur’s evidence, in light of the whole charge and the overwhelming evidence,
did not cause significant prejudice to the accused.  When assessing whether the
proviso should be applied, the ultimate question is whether there is any
reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different absent the
error.  It was argued that where the defence is difficult, there is no room for
error on the part of the judge.  However, where the defence is difficult, it is
less likely that the defence would be made out.  I see no legal justification
for a different standard to be applied where the accused simply raises an
unlikely defence.  In my view, the law applies invariably in all situations. 
Absent an error in the handling of Dr. Lafleur’s evidence, the verdict would in
my view have remained the same, and hence I agree with Beauregard J.A.’s conclusion
that it did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice to the
appellant.  Thus I conclude that this is an appropriate situation for the
application of the proviso.

 

(iii)  Character Evidence

 

29                              
It is argued that the relevance of the accused’s evidence that he was
peaceful and non-violent was restricted by the trial judge to the sole issue of
supporting his credibility.  This is not entirely accurate.  The trial judge
did refer to the relation between the appellant’s good character evidence and
his defence that he was not a type of person capable of committing a murder:

 

[translation]  Mr. Bordeleau
presented evidence that was quite, through a number of witnesses, I should
rather say, evidence through a number of witnesses, as to the accused’s
morals.  Actually, it was in the nature of character evidence.  The aim of this
evidence was to present the accused as being someone who is peaceful and
non-violent.  The accused does not deny that he shot the victim, but character
evidence was presented firstly, in support of the appellant’s claim that he had
acted in self-defence, and secondly, and this is related to the first point,
that the accused was not a person of such a character that would lend itself to
committing such a crime.

 

He only
mentioned this once, however, and thereafter restricted his comments to the
relation between the evidence and the credibility of the accused.  Without
contesting the essential nature of the two uses of good character evidence in
the charge to the jury (see R. v. H. (C.W.) (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 146
(B.C.C.A.)), the Crown argues that the curative provision should be applied.

 








30                              
In my view, the application of the proviso is appropriate since this
error is of minor significance in the context of the charge as a whole and
consequently caused little prejudice to the accused.  Perhaps that explains the
fact that the appellant did not object on this point at trial, which is a fact
that can be considered when determining the gravity of the error; see Jacquard,
supra, at para. 38.  The focus here is on the reasonableness of the
accused’s perception that an attack was imminent and on his perception that
there was no reasonable alternative when he approached his sleeping victim and
shot him in the back of the head at close range.  The evidence of good
character sheds little light on this question.  This is not a case where the
actions of the accused are in doubt; rather it is only his mental state which
is under consideration.  Given the evidence, the argument that the accused
could not have committed murder because he was of good character has little
significance.  I am convinced that the verdict would have been the same if the
trial judge had properly directed the jury that the appellant’s character evidence
was relevant in assessing whether he could have committed murder.  Thus, I
would apply s. 686(1) (b)(iii) to cure the error.

 

(iv)  Blood Test

 

31                              
The Crown’s question in cross-examination which gave rise to this
complaint is only tangentially relevant to the issues in this appeal.  The
appellant testified that he had never fired, charged or discharged the firearm
before the night in question.  In order to test the veracity of this statement,
the Crown asked for a sample of the accused’s blood to see whether it matched
the blood found on Charlebois’ ammunition belt.  As I understand the Crown’s
position, evidence of a blood match would be of some use to the Crown in
demonstrating that Charlebois was lying when he testified he had never
previously fired, charged or discharged the gun.

 








32                              
Evidently, since the issue of Charlebois’ prior use of the gun is
irrelevant to this appeal, the Crown’s request was made to undermine the
appellant’s denial that he had previously used the gun and to cast doubt on his
credibility.  The appellant contends that by forcing him to assert, in front of
the jury, his constitutional right to refuse the blood test (R. v. Borden,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 145), the judge unfairly tarnished his credibility.

 

33                              
In my opinion, even if this refusal had some effect on the appellant’s
credibility, the effect was greatly diminished by the trial judge’s direction
that no adverse inference could be drawn from the refusal.  It must also be
remembered that when the appellant decided to testify, he put his credibility
on the line (R. v. Kuldip, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 618).

 

34                              
The Crown concedes that the request was inappropriate, but contends that
it is cured under s. 686(1) (b)(iii).  In light of the trial judge’s
warning, I agree that the prejudice suffered by the appellant was minimal. 
When considered in the context of the defence as a whole, it is plainly obvious
that the issue of blood on the gun belt was so removed from the heart of the
case that it had very little significance.  I have faith that the jury
recognized this fact.  In my view, this is a clear situation where the proviso
should be applied.

 

(v)  Did the Trial Judge Err by Allowing the Crown to Ask the
Appellant 

to Submit to an Examination by a Crown Psychiatrist?

 

35                              
After the request for a blood test was made, the Crown was allowed to
ask the following question:

 

[translation]  Mr.
Charlebois, over the course of the last few weeks, you met Dr. Lafleur, the
psychiatrist, with a view to preparing your defence.  Would you agree to meet
in the near future, at the request of the Crown, a psychiatric expert named
John Wolwertz so as to allow the Crown to prepare a second psychiatric opinion?

 








In his charge,
the trial judge informed the jury that the accused was within his rights to
refuse the assessment, and that while no adverse inference as to his guilt
could be drawn from that refusal, the refusal was relevant to the probative
value of the evidence relating to his apprehension on the night in question:

 

[translation]  By
refusing to undergo a psychiatric assessment at the request of the Crown, the
accused is absolutely acting within his rights and you cannot and you must not
draw any adverse conclusion as a result of this refusal.  However, given that
the accused has submitted that his apprehension of an immediate attack, or his
perception . . . his perception that he felt about to be attacked as one of
. . . he submitted as one of the cornerstones of his defence and he
called upon a “shrink” to support this claim.  Under these circumstances, his
refusal to submit to an expert assessment by a Crown expert is a relevant fact
and that is why the question was allowed. . . .  [Y]ou may, without obviously
being obliged to, take the refusal into consideration when determining the
probative value that you are going to grant to the evidence in connection with
the apprehension of the accused on the night in question.

 

It has been
argued that the trial judge erred by allowing the Crown to ask the accused
whether he would submit to an assessment by Dr. Wolwertz in the manner
chosen and by instructing the jury that the refusal was relevant to the
probative value of the evidence.  In my view the request for an assessment was
not improper as it is conceded that the Crown was entitled to call a
psychiatrist to rebut the expert evidence presented by the accused.  While it
would have been preferable if the question acknowledged that the Crown had
previously received the accused’s refusal, I reject the view that coupled with
the request for a blood test, this question amounted to a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

 








36                              
The court below was divided on the issue of whether, in discussions
between counsel and the trial judge, the accused had refused to be assessed by
Dr. Wolwertz or by any psychiatrist at all.  In my view, the question of
whether the accused’s refusal was limited to a rejection of Dr. Wolwertz or
whether it was a blanket denial of any assessment is of little significance. 
The jury was only aware that the accused refused to be assessed by Dr.
Wolwertz.  The Crown had the right to ask the accused to submit to a
psychiatric assessment conducted by an expert of its choice; it was open to
counsel for the accused to question Dr. Wolwertz’s qualifications and
impartiality.

 

37                              
In finding that the trial judge improperly allowed the question, the
dissent in the Court of Appeal acknowledged that R. v. Sweeney (1977),
35 C.C.C. (2d) 245 (Ont. C.A.), allows for the possibility that the Crown may,
in appropriate circumstances, introduce evidence of the accused’s refusal to
speak to a Crown psychiatrist; see also R. v. Stevenson (1990), 58
C.C.C. (3d) 464 (Ont. C.A.), and more recently R. v. Worth (1995), 98
C.C.C. (3d) 133 (Ont. C.A.), leave to
appeal refused, [1996] 3 S.C.R. xiv.  As recognized by Fish J.A., allowing the
evidence of the refusal is justified as a necessary exception to the accused’s
right of silence where the defence has called psychiatric evidence.  The
exception recognizes that the weight of the Crown’s evidence might be unfairly
diminished by the fact that its experts have been denied access to the accused
when the ultimate issue in question is the accused’s mental state or
condition.  In Worth, the Ontario Court of Appeal found (at pp. 140-41):

 

Having put his sanity in issue, we do not think the appellant could
preclude the jury from drawing an adverse inference from his refusal to speak
to the Crown psychiatrist.  An accused’s right to silence is not absolute.  It
is protected in the terms of s. 7 , that is, an accused cannot be deprived of
his right to silence except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.  Since the appellant put his sanity in issue and had the burden of
proving his mental disorder, we do not think that the trial judge’s comments
contravened the principles of fundamental justice.  In R. v. Stevenson .
. .  Morden J.A. specifically approved Sweeney notwithstanding s. 7 
of the Charter .  He wrote at p. 495:

 








I appreciate that the right to remain silent under
s. 7  in all its manifestations does not necessarily have the identical content
and scope of the common law right.  In the context of a case such as this,
however, I can think of no reason why the general approach in Sweeney
should not be followed.  In that case, Zuber J.A., for this court, noted at p.
251 that the rule relating to the right to remain silent was “not so rigid nor
so pervasive that it admits no exceptions nor limit”.

 

The fact that
in Sweeney the accused chose not to take the stand is not a sufficient
basis for distinguishing it from the present appeal.  Since Sweeney chose not
to testify, the Crown could not have directly asked him to undergo an
examination.  In my view, if a third party can enter the accused’s refusal in
evidence (as in Sweeney), it is not improper to allow the Crown to ask
the accused directly, where that option is available because the accused
decided to take the stand.  As my colleague suggests, the Crown might have
directly challenged Dr. Lafleur’s evidence by bringing its own expert to
observe the witnesses, including the accused.  However, I know of no authority
which obligates the Crown to retain a psychiatrist for the duration of the
proceedings.

 

38                              
In sum, the Crown had the right to counter the expert evidence used to
support the accused’s theory that he killed in self-defence, and thus the Crown
was entitled to ask the accused whether he would undergo an assessment.  The
trial judge did not err in law by instructing the jury that the refusal was
relevant to the probative value of the defence expert’s evidence.  Even if this
were not the case, this is a situation where s. 686(1) (b)(iii) could be
applied to rectify an error since there would have been little prejudice caused
to the accused.

 

V.  Conclusion

 








39                              
The trial judge did not commit any errors that would entitle the
appellant to a new trial.  I think it is plain that each of the errors alone
did not cause a miscarriage of justice that would prevent the application of s.
686(1) (b)(iii).  Even when viewed collectively, the appellant’s
objections could have had very little influence on the outcome of the
proceeding; the errors here do not give rise to the possibility that the jury
might have acquitted in their absence.

 

40                              
In sum, this is a clear case where the proviso should be applied. 
The appellant was convicted because the evidence was overwhelming.  The real
evidence established, and the appellant conceded, that he shot the helpless
victim from behind.  The argument of self-defence, which defence counsel
conceded was a difficult defence, could not be made out.  The evidence
demonstrates the unreasonableness of the appellant’s perception that there was
no alternative to shooting the victim.  The denial of a new trial is justified
here since the invariable result would be another conviction.  Accordingly, I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

English version of the reasons delivered by

 

Arbour J. (dissenting) —

 

I.  Introduction

 

41                              
The appellant, Patrick Charlebois, admits that he caused the death of
Éric Jetté.  During his trial, Charlebois testified that he had acted in self‑defence. 
He also called a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul‑André Lafleur, to testify in
support of that defence.

 








42                              
The appellant, who was deprived of affection during his
childhood, developed a dependent personality which was reflected in his
friendship with Jetté.  He was chronically afraid of Jetté, a violent
individual for whom he was a [translation] “whipping boy”.

 

43                              
On the night of the incident, Jetté came to the appellant’s home after
being kicked out by his girlfriend.  According to the appellant, Jetté waved a
knife in his face while uttering: [translation]
“Yea, we’re going to have some fun tonight, you and me.”  This incident was
corroborated by a witness, Alain Lalancette, who was present during the
incident but failed to mention it to the police investigators who questioned
him.  The appellant’s fear of Jetté was then exacerbated when he realized that
Jetté had noticed a gun in his apartment that Jetté had wanted to buy from him
but that the appellant had refused to sell him, claiming that he no longer
owned it.

 

44                              
The appellant testified that he was afraid to go to bed and went back to
his bedroom only when Jetté, who had been watching television with him, ordered
him to go to bed, since he wanted to sleep.  Jetté, who was not completely
sober, then stretched out on his stomach on the living room couch and the
appellant went to his bedroom.  A few moments later, when Jetté was apparently
asleep, the appellant approached him and shot him in the back of the head with
a shotgun.  He then called 911 and told the operator:

 

[translation] 
. . . I’ve just committed a murder. . .  I was so afraid, I split. .
. . .   [H]e was completely drunk when he came to my place. . .  So,
anyways, so he knew that I had a gun, then he took it, his girlfriend left him,
so anyways, he was totally tripping, so I tried to convince him not to do
anything stupid, then we started arguing, and the shot went off.

 

 








45                              
The appellant was of sound mind at the time of the homicide.  However,
he claims that he was anxious and felt threatened by Jetté to a point where he
could think  of no alternative but to kill him in order to escape the threat. 
In support of his defence, the appellant submitted evidence of his peaceful and
non‑violent nature, as well as psychiatric expert opinion, which was not
contradicted by the Crown.

 

46                              
The appellant was convicted of second degree murder following a jury
trial during which he claims a number of errors were made.  Although the
majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal acknowledged that certain errors did
occur during the trial, particularly in the judge’s instructions to the jury,
it found that the errors were not prejudicial to the appellant and dismissed
the appeal.  Fish J.A., dissenting, would have granted a new trial.

 

47                              
The issue before us in this appeal as of right is a narrow one.  The
appeal relates only to the question of law raised by the dissenting opinion of
Fish J.A. regarding the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , in relation to the
errors that the Court of Appeal unanimously recognized had been committed by
the trial judge.  In an appeal of this nature, there is therefore no need to
review the merits of the Court of Appeal’s decision regarding the existence of
those errors, except insofar as it is necessary to assess their impact in order
to determine whether those errors nonetheless resulted in no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 








48                              
In essence, I am in agreement with Fish J.A., and I conclude, as
did he, that the errors identified by the Court of Appeal are such that it
would be inappropriate to remedy them by applying the curative provision
contained in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.  In my view, the
majority of the Court of Appeal did not systematically consider the
requirements of that provision and, in particular, the cumulative effect of the
errors they identified.  All that the majority did was to make several isolated
references to the fact that the error committed had not prejudiced the
accused.  In my opinion, that approach does not meet the rigorous requirement
of the curative provision, which has been accurately explained by my colleague
Bastarache J., of ensuring that it is not necessary to order a new trial
despite the errors that occurred in the first trial, since the evidence as a
whole indicates that such an exercise would be futile and that a conviction
would be inevitable following a trial in which no errors occurred.

 

II.  Quebec Court of Appeal (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 414

 

49                              
In the case at bar, the Quebec Court of Appeal unanimously held that it
would have been preferable for the trial judge to draw the jury’s attention to
the opinion of the psychiatrist, Dr. Lafleur, which was tendered in
support of the defence put forward by the appellant.  However, the majority
concluded that this defect had not prejudiced the appellant, since
Dr. Lafleur’s testimony was clear and fresh in the jury’s mind.  Similarly,
the court unanimously concluded that the trial judge had been ambiguous when
presenting to the jury the requirement of a reasonable perception of the
impossibility of escaping the threat that the appellant believed to exist. 
Beauregard J.A., for the majority, concluded on that point (at p. 427):

 

[translation] 
Notwithstanding that, I am of the view that, even had the charge of the judge
on this point not been ambiguous, the result would still have been the same. 
If, in spite of the 911 telephone conversation, one can have a doubt as to
whether Charlebois actually felt threatened by Jetté, there can be no doubt
about the fact that Charlebois could not reasonably have believed that there
was no other solution other than killing Jetté.

 








50                              
As to the question of whether the Crown should have been allowed to ask
the appellant, in the presence of the jury, whether he would consent to
providing a blood sample, the majority said that while the question was perhaps
excessive, the appellant’s negative response was not prejudicial to him.

 

51                              
Last, the court unanimously found that the judge should have instructed
the jury that the evidence relating to the appellant’s good character could be
used to support the defence’s argument that the accused was not the type of man
to commit a murder.  Once again, the majority simply held that this error had
not been prejudicial to the appellant.

 

52                              
The dissenting opinion of Fish J.A. extends beyond s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
only with respect to one final point.  The majority held that the Crown was
properly allowed to ask the accused whether he would agree to undergo a
psychiatric assessment by Dr. John Wolwertz, and that the trial judge had
adequately addressed his refusal.  On this issue, Fish J.A. expressed
a dissenting view, concluding that the question should not have been allowed. 
I share that opinion.

 

III.  Issues

 

53                              
Given the scope of an appeal as of right under s. 691(1) of the
Code, it is not appropriate for this Court to review the merits of the
unanimous conclusions of the Court of Appeal, let alone, as we are invited to
do by the respondent, to accept an argument that was not raised in the Court of
Appeal, that is, that Dr. Lafleur’s testimony was not even admissible in
support of the defence of self‑defence.

 








54                              
There are therefore only two issues before this Court.  First, did the
majority of the Court of Appeal err in law in respect of the admissibility of
the question relating to a psychiatric assessment by a Crown expert; and
second, did the errors found by the Court of Appeal allow for the curative
provision to be applied?  Unlike my colleague Bastarache J., I would
answer yes to the first question and no to the second.

 

IV.  Analysis

 

A.  Psychiatric Assessment by a Crown Expert

 

55                              
It is crucial to place the analysis in its factual context from the
outset.  When the Crown closed its case at trial, and in preparation for
opening of the defence case, counsel for the parties held discussions before
the judge but in the absence of the jury.  Defence counsel told the judge that
he had informed Crown counsel that he intended to submit a defence of self‑defence
and that he had retained the services of a psychiatrist, Dr. Lafleur, in
support of that defence.  He also stated that he had refused the Crown’s
request that his client undergo a second psychiatric assessment by
Dr. Wolwertz.

 

56                              
The discussions between counsel concerning the possibility of a second
assessment were held a few weeks before the trial began.  In this regard,
defence counsel told the judge that the Crown had made no proposal to him other
than Dr. Wolwertz, and that, in his view, it was now too late, in
mid-trial and right before his client was to testify, to have his client
undergo a psychiatric assessment by anyone.  Subsequent discussions focused on
the issue of whether the Crown was entitled to request a second psychiatric
assessment in a case like this.  Finally, noting the difficulty of reaching a
decision without hearing the defence evidence, the judge decided to leave the
question open.

 








57                              
When the trial resumed, the appellant was the first witness to testify
in his defence.  In cross‑examination, Crown counsel asked him, in the
presence of the jury, whether he would consent to providing a blood sample. 
The appellant refused.  At that point, the defence asked the judge to exclude
the jury so that the admissibility of the question asked could be argued. 
After some discussion, the judge allowed the question, and told counsel that he
would immediately caution the jury as to what use it could make of the
appellant’s answer.  I will return to this point later.  Once the jury had come
back in, the following exchange took place:

 

[translation]

 

IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY

 

THE COURT:

 

So, ladies and gentlemen, after reflecting on this, I have decided that
the question put by the Crown attorney is legal.  Therefore, the objection
is overruled.

 

PATRICK CHARLEBOIS, STILL UNDER OATH.

 

CONTINUATION OF CROSS‑EXAMINATION BY MR. LECOURS

 

Crown counsel:

 

Q:  So, Mr. Charlebois, the question is as follows. 
Would you agree to provide a sample of your blood over the next weekend for the
purpose of determining blood type?

 

A:  No.

 

THE COURT:

 

So, you have heard the answer, I would now like to immediately make a
remark.  At no time is the accused obliged to provide in such a case a blood
sample for analysis by Crown experts and, as members of the jury, you cannot,
you must not draw any adverse conclusion against the accused due to the
response which you have just heard.  It is his absolute constitutional right to
say no.

 

MR. LECOURS:

 








Q:  Mr. Charlebois, over the course of the last few
weeks, you met Dr. Lafleur, the psychiatrist, with a view to preparing
your defence.  Would you agree to meet in the near future, at the request of
the Crown, a psychiatric expert named John Wolwertz so as to allow the Crown to
prepare a second psychiatric opinion?

 

A:  No.

 

MR. LECOURS:

 

On this point, my Lord, I have some case law to submit for your review
concerning the instruction which you have just given on the question of whether
a blood sample is not applicable to. . . .

 

THE COURT:

 

For the moment, that is another matter, unless you wish to address that
aspect immediately.

 

58                              
Without notice, and in the presence of the jury, the Crown then asked
the accused whether he would agree to submit to a second psychiatric assessment
by Dr. Wolwertz.  The appellant refused and the judge gave no instruction
to the jury regarding what use could be made of his refusal.  In his
charge to the jury at the end of the trial, the judge returned to this issue in
the following terms:

 

[translation]  You will
recall that at one point, the Crown prosecutor asked a question concerning a
blood sample.  And I instructed you that the accused was absolutely entitled to
refuse to provide any such sample and that you could not draw any adverse
conclusion from his refusal, and that you could not even take that into account
in your deliberations.  I will repeat now what I said then.  But you will
recall that immediately after, the Crown asked another question as to whether
the accused would consent to being examined by a psychiatrist, Dr. Wolwertz,
Crown expert witness.  And the accused gave the same answer, he said no.  I
repeat what I said, but I also have something else to add.  By refusing to
undergo a psychiatric assessment at the request of the Crown, the accused is
absolutely acting within his rights and you cannot and you must not draw any
adverse conclusion as a result of this refusal.  However, given that the
accused has submitted that his apprehension of an imminent attack, or his
perception . . . his perception was such that he felt about to be
attacked as one of . . . he submitted as one of the cornerstones of
his defence and he called upon a “shrink” to support this claim.  Under these
circumstances, his refusal to submit to an expert assessment by a Crown expert
is a relevant fact and that is why the question was allowed.  The jury may, you
may, without obviously being obliged to, take the refusal into consideration
when determining the probative value that you are going to grant to the
evidence in connection with the apprehension of the accused on the night in
question.








 

59                              
In the Court of Appeal, the parties argued the question of whether, by
his refusal, the appellant had refused any psychiatric assessment at the
request of the Crown, or had simply refused to be examined by
Dr. Wolwertz.  In my opinion, it is neither possible nor very helpful to
go beyond the evidence heard by the jury.  What is clear is that, before the
jury, the appellant unequivocally answered the question put to him, and that
question referred only to Dr. Wolwertz.  On this point, Fish J.A. wrote,
at p. 439:

 

Let me say at once that defence counsel’s advice to
his client — that he decline to be examined by Dr. Wolwertz — can hardly
be considered capricious.  In at least three separate matters, a total of eight
different members of this Court have found that Dr. Wolwertz, as a Crown
witness, had exceeded the acceptable limits governing expert testimony
(“outrepassé les limites ainsi fixées pour témoigner”) and gone much too far
(“est allé beaucoup trop loin”), thereby causing the accused irreparable
prejudice (R. v. Roy, [1988] A.Q. No. 90 (QL)
(Que. C.A.) (Beauregard, Nichols and Tyndale JJ.A.)); that he had given
evidence amounting to a diatribe devoid of any objectivity (“une diatribe
dépourvue de toute objectivité”), “flagrantly contravening” the rule that
prohibits experts from expressing their own opinion on the credibility of other
witnesses (R. v. Fortin, [1997] A.Q. No. 2887 (QL) (Proulx and
Rousseau‑Houle JJ.A. and Zerbisias J. (ad hoc)).  To the same
effect:  R. v. Demers, [1998] A.Q. No. 1667 (QL) (Rothman, Proulx
and Pidgeon JJ.A.)).

 

A little later, Fish J.A. refers to Dr. Wolwertz as an expert
“who had been found by this Court to have previously testified (and since as
well) in a tendentious and unprofessional manner” (p. 439).

 

60                              
However, Beauregard J.A., for the majority, simply concluded (at p.
429):

 

[translation]  Defence
counsel perhaps had personal reasons to doubt whether the psychiatrist selected
by the prosecution would be objective, but in the absence of any decision to
the contrary taken by the judge, it was not Charlebois’ right to require that
the prosecution retain the services of a psychiatrist other than the one they
had chosen.

 








In any event, I understand, [as did the trial
judge], from the exchanges . . . during the voir dire [that
ultimately at the trial] Charlebois refused to be assessed by any psychiatrist
whatsoever on the grounds that it was too late.  

 

61                              
The discussions during the voir dire were obviously not in
evidence before the jury, nor were the reservations expressed by numerous
judges of the Court of Appeal regarding the professionalism of
Dr. Wolwertz, which were referred to by Fish J.A.  If the jury is to
be invited to draw conclusions from the accused’s refusal to meet with
Dr. Wolwertz for the purposes of a second psychiatric opinion, the
ambiguity inserted into the question by the prosecutor who asked it should not
be resolved in the prosecution’s favour.

 

62                              
In fact, in my view, that ambiguity reflects the unsatisfactory nature
of the procedure followed in this case.  It is therefore important to establish
an appropriate procedure in the exceptional case where the Crown is permitted
to refer to the accused’s exercise of his right to silence and invite the jury
to draw conclusions unfavourable to the accused from the exercise of that
right.

 

63                              
The right of the accused to remain silent is a fundamental right:  Rothman
v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640; R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
151.  This constitutional right may be exercised at the investigation stage as
well as at the trial:  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
ss. 7  and 11 (c); Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑5 ,
s. 4(1) .

 

64                              
It follows that the accused cannot be penalized for exercising his right
to remain silent, and the exercise of that right must not be put in evidence
for inculpatory purposes.  In that regard, in R. v. Chambers, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 1293, Cory J. wrote for the majority (at p. 1316):








 

It has as well been recognized that since there is
a right to silence, it would be a snare and a delusion to caution the accused
that he need not say anything in response to a police officer’s question but
nonetheless put in evidence that the accused clearly exercised his right and
remained silent in the face of a question which suggested his guilt.

 

In fact,
attention was drawn to the importance of this principle even before the impact
of the Charter .  In R. v. Symonds (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.
C.A.), Martin J.A. wrote the following at p. 227:

 

It is fundamental that a person charged with a
criminal offence has the right to remain silent and a jury is not entitled to
draw any inference against an accused because he chooses to exercise that
right.  We think that in the absence of some issue arising in the case which
makes the statement of an accused, following the giving of a caution, that he
has nothing to say relevant to that issue, such evidence is inadmissible.  In
the present case there was no issue with respect to which the appellant’s
failure to reply was relevant and the evidence should not have been tendered. .
. .

 

65                              
It is therefore settled law that, as a general rule, the jury must not
be invited to draw inferences adverse to the accused from the mere exercise by
the accused of his right to silence.  This Court confirmed that rule in R.
v. Crawford, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 858, at para. 22, and R. v. Noble,
[1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, at paras. 71‑72.  Furthermore, s. 4(6) of
the Canada Evidence Act  expressly prohibits the drawing of unfavourable
conclusions from the fact that an accused opts to remain silent during his
trial.

 








66                              
However, the right to silence is not absolute.  In connection with
psychiatric assessments, there have been three decisions of the Ontario Court
of Appeal in which a set of exceptions to the fundamental rule stated above has
been developed.  In R. v. Sweeney (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 245, the
Ontario Court of Appeal held that the evidence of the accused’s refusal to
submit to examination by a Crown psychiatrist, even though he was tendering a
psychiatric assessment in support of his defence of insanity, was admissible
for the purpose of challenging the credibility of the assessment offered by the
defence.  On this point, Zuber J.A. said the following (at p. 252):

 

It is, after all, the accused who has raised the defence and made his
sanity an issue.  Can it be said he has the exclusive right to call psychiatric
evidence and also to deny the prosecution even the ability to explain why the
Crown has called no evidence to meet this issue?  It has been submitted that
the Crown psychiatrists can testify on a hypothetical basis, or from having
observed the accused in the court‑room.  However, the cross‑examination
of the Crown’s psychiatrists and the address to the jury by defence counsel
could not avoid emphasizing superiority of the witnesses who had examined the
accused.

 

67                              
The procedure followed in Sweeney is interesting and merits our
consideration.  At the beginning of the trial, the Crown applied for an order
allowing the accused to be interviewed by a psychiatrist chosen by the Crown. 
The judge declined to make this order and raised the issue of whether the
appellant’s refusal, if that were the case, would be admissible at trial. 
Counsel for the defence then formally informed the Court that he was going to
advise his client to refuse the second psychiatric examination proposed by the
Crown.

 

68                              
On the second day of the trial, the defence stated that the accused
would have no objection to being examined by the Crown experts, provided there
was first a conference between both parties’ psychiatrists and psychologists.  This
offer was declined by the Crown and the defence accordingly refused to allow
the accused to submit to the second psychiatric examination sought by the
Crown.

 








69                              
The defence called its psychiatric evidence at trial, during which the
accused did not testify.  In reply, the Crown was permitted to call a
psychiatrist and a psychologist, who testified that they had been present
during the trial and gave an opinion based on the facts in evidence.  They both
stated that they had not interviewed the accused, since he had refused them
access unless they consented to a preliminary conference with the defence
experts, which was unacceptable to them for professional reasons.

 

70                              
Following this evidence in reply, the defence was allowed to call
evidence in surrebuttal showing the reasons why such a conference was
necessary.  The jury thus had the benefit of the factual framework, which it
could use to draw the conclusions it considered appropriate from the defence’s
refusal to submit to a second psychiatric examination.  I would point out that
this evidence was called without the accused being personally involved in
explaining his refusal.

 

71                              
The second case of interest is R. v. Stevenson (1990), 58 C.C.C.
(3d) 464 (Ont. C.A.), in which the accused argued that he did not have the
capacity to form the requisite intent for murder.  However, he did not put
forward the defence of insanity.  In support of his defence, the accused
adduced expert psychiatric evidence.  Although he had agreed to meet with the
psychiatrist proposed by the Crown, the accused refused to discuss the
circumstances of the homicide of which he was accused with that psychiatrist,
as a result of advice from counsel.  However, he had discussed the
circumstances with the psychiatrists retained by the defence.  After referring
to the accused’s right to silence guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter ,
Morden J.A. held that the principle of the decision in Sweeney was
still applicable.  The Crown was therefore entitled to put in evidence the fact
that its experts, unlike the defence experts, had not been given the same
access to the information in the possession of the accused.  Morden J.A.
explained the consequences of this fact as follows, at p. 496:

 








I think that the jury should have been instructed that the appellant,
in not discussing the circumstances of the homicide with the Crown
psychiatrists, was exercising his right to remain silent and that no inference
of guilt could be drawn against him on this account but that, in assessing the
Crown’s expert evidence in comparison with that of the appellant’s, they could
properly take into account the accused’s refusal to discuss the homicide with
the Crown’s expert witnesses.

 

72                              
Last, in R. v. Worth (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 133 (Ont. C.A.), the
accused relied on a defence of insanity under s. 16 of the Code to
a charge of murder.  The accused did not testify at his trial.  Both the
defence and the Crown called psychiatrists on the issue of the accused’s state
of mind at the time of the homicide.  The Court of Appeal approved the trial
judge’s comments to the jury, in which he stated that the Crown psychiatrists
had been refused the opportunity to interview the accused, and that it was open
to the jury to conclude from this that his defence would not withstand such
scrutiny.

 

73                              
It therefore seems to me to be settled law that when an accused relies
on a psychiatric assessment in support of any defence, his refusal to be
examined for the same purposes by a Crown expert may be the subject of an
inference adverse to him and the trial judge must so instruct the jury.  In my
view, there is no reason to limit this rule to cases in which the defence is a
defence of mental disorder within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code. 
The principle behind this exception to the general rule of the right to silence
is one of fairness between the parties which applies in all cases where the
accused calls an expert to whom he has given exclusive access.

 








74                              
In addition, Sweeney is the only decision that addresses the
procedure to follow in the case of a refusal by the accused to submit to a
second assessment, and it does so indirectly.  In my view, the procedure
followed in Sweeney is much preferable to the procedure followed in the
present case.  The fundamental distinctions between this case and the three
cases cited above are, first, that the accused testified at his trial and,
second, that the Crown did not call any experts to rebut the expert evidence
introduced by the accused, although it had been informed some weeks before the
trial started that the defence would be introducing a psychiatric assessment. 
The Crown could have retained the services of a psychiatrist to assess the
expert evidence introduced at the trial and provide an opinion, if necessary,
to contradict the defence expert.

 

75                              
The Crown did not retain the services of an expert, and did not
contradict Dr. Lafleur’s opinion.  It confined itself to putting the
question here in issue to the appellant.  In my view, because of how the Crown
chose to proceed, it cannot now rely on the exception to the exercise of the
right to silence.

 

76                              
In fact, there are several reasons why the procedure followed in this
case should be avoided.  First, the question asked here was ambiguous and
inconclusive.  There was nothing in the evidence that showed that the accused
had previously refused to submit to a second psychiatric assessment.  In cross‑examination,
the Crown merely asked the accused: [translation]
“Would you agree to meet in the near future, at the request of the Crown, a
psychiatric expert named John Wolwertz so as to allow the Crown to prepare a
second psychiatric opinion?”  It seems to me to be quite apparent that it is a
little late to ask the accused to submit to second psychiatric assessment in
the middle of his defence during a jury trial for murder.  If that question was
being put to him for the first time, which the jury did not know, his negative
response would be completely acceptable and no negative inference should be
drawn from it.  The question also arises of how the trial should have proceeded
had the accused consented there and then.

 








77                              
In addition, it seems to me to be very inappropriate to ask the accused
to explain the reasons for his refusal in detail, and to invite him to impugn
Dr. Wolwertz’s motives.  The accused himself had no personal knowledge
regarding the professional qualifications of the psychiatrist selected by the
Crown, and could not have expressed in an appropriate and credible manner the
reasons why his counsel advised him not to agree to be examined by
Dr. Wolwertz.  Similarly, it would have been difficult for the accused to
testify concerning the discussions that had taken place between his counsel and
Crown counsel, since there is no indication that he was present at those
discussions.  At most, if the question had been put to him directly, he could
have said that he refused to meet with Dr. Wolwertz on the advice of
counsel.

 

78                              
It is greatly preferable, in my view, that the Crown establish the
accused’s refusal in one of the following two ways: either by seeking an
admission from the defence concerning the refusal, which could include the
grounds for the refusal, or by calling another witness, as was done in Sweeney,
Stevenson and Worth, in which case the defence could offer
evidence in reply if it considered it necessary to do so.

 








79                              
In light of the principles on which the exception rule is based, it
seems clear to me that the procedure adopted in this case was particularly
inappropriate.  First, the question was asked in the presence of the jury,
immediately following a question of the same type which also should never have
been asked (by the Crown’s own admission, at least in the Court of Appeal). 
The cumulative effect of the accused’s refusal to provide a blood sample and
refusal to submit to a second psychiatric assessment, in rapid succession, in
my view, proved highly prejudicial, for no good reason, to the general
credibility of his defence.  Second, the question itself was not particularly
helpful, since it contained an inherent ambiguity regarding the specific
subject-matter of the refusal, thus making it difficult for the jury to be
invited to draw any conclusion whatsoever from that refusal.

 

80                              
The bottom line on this issue is that it is important to remember that
the rule by which a conclusion unfavourable to the accused may be drawn from
his refusal to submit to a second psychiatric assessment is an exception to the
fundamental principle of the right to silence, which is itself rooted not only
in the common law but also in the Charter .  It is essential that this
exceptional rule be administered fairly and equitably and in a manner
consistent with its underlying principle.  From this perspective, it seems to
me to be particularly inappropriate for the Crown to invite the jury to draw a
negative conclusion from the accused’s refusal to submit to examination by its
experts, when the Crown itself led no evidence challenging the expert opinion
offered by the defence.  Before taking advantage of the exception, the Crown
must first lay the factual foundation of its assertion by challenging the
defence’s psychiatric assessment.  It may then lead evidence of the accused’s
refusal, provided it does so accurately and in a manner consistent with the
facts, that is, avoiding tactics that are unfair or unduly prejudicial to the
accused.

 

81                              
In view of the circumstances of this case, the judge’s instructions to
the jury on the issue failed to remedy the original error of allowing the
question to be asked.

 

B.  Application of Section 686(1) (b)(iii)

 








82                              
I would note that the Court of Appeal unanimously concluded that the
trial judge committed errors in his instructions to the jury, specifically in
the summary of the testimony of the defence’s expert witness
(Dr. Lafleur), the characterization of the evidence of good character
submitted by the appellant, the outline of the facts of the case that were
relevant to the theory put forward by the defence, and the description of the
application of s. 34(2) of the Code, and more particularly the
reference to the reasonable man in connection with how the perceptions
associated with self‑defence are formed.  This is the starting point from
which I shall now consider the applicability of the curative provision.

 

83                              
The curative provision set out in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the
Code applies in exceptional situations where the evidence is so
overwhelming that the trier of fact would inevitably find an accused guilty
despite the errors committed during the trial: R. v. B. (F.F.),
[1993] 1 S.C.R. 697.

 

84                              
Very recently, in R. v. Brooks, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 237, 2000 SCC 11,
at para. 104, this Court adopted Major J.’s statement in R. v. Bevan,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, in which he provided a reminder, at pp. 616‑17, of
the exact nature of the test that the Crown must meet pursuant to
s. 686(1) (b)(iii):

 

The question to be asked in determining whether
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice as a result of a
trial judge’s error is whether “the verdict would necessarily have been the
same if such error had not occurred”: see Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965]
S.C.R. 739, per Cartwright J. (as he then was), at p. 744; Wildman
v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 328‑29.  This test has
also been expressed in terms of whether there is any possibility that if the
error had not been committed, a judge or properly instructed jury would have
acquitted the accused: see Colpitts, per Spence J., at
p. 756; R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, per Sopinka
J., at p. 919; R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at p. 620; R.
v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, per Iacobucci J. at pp. 736‑37. 
I do not interpret these two approaches as being intended to convey different
meanings.  Under either approach, the task of an appellate court is to
determine whether there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would
have been different had the error at issue not been made.

 

 








85                              
Where more than one error was committed during the trial, whether
regarding the admissibility of evidence, the judge’s instructions to the jury
or otherwise, the cumulative effect of those errors, however minimal they may
be when taken individually, must be taken into account for the purposes of
applying s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 

86                              
Where an error, or a series of errors, relates to the very essence of
the defence and could influence the jury’s assessment of a question of fact
that has a very direct bearing on the accused’s guilt, it is difficult to
conclude that the rest of the evidence is sufficiently conclusive for the
curative provision to be applied.

 

87                              
In the present case, the central issue was whether, at the time the
appellant shot the victim, he had a reasonable perception that his life was in
danger and that he could not otherwise escape from the threat to his safety.

 

88                              
Some of the errors found by the Court of Appeal related to secondary
matters and, taken in isolation, could have been excused by applying the
curative provision.  For example, I am of the view, as was the Court of Appeal, 
that the question put to the accused by the Crown asking him whether he would
consent to providing a blood sample “went too far”.  It is difficult to see the
relevance of this question, which was asked in a prejudicial manner and
followed by an instruction which did little to remedy that prejudice.  However,
that error, taken alone, would not in my opinion have vitiated the trial to the
point that the curative provision could not be applied.

 








89                              
On other hand, the psychiatric evidence of the accused’s pathological
fear of the victim was fundamental.  As well, the nature of the evidence also
required very clear instructions regarding the assessment of the reasonableness
of the accused’s beliefs.  In my view, the errors in the judge’s instructions
to the jury concerning these two issues were inevitably fatal, since it is
impossible to argue that the verdict would have been the same had it not been
for those errors.  Such a conclusion would amount to rejecting the defence out
of hand, and thus to usurping the decision‑making authority of the jury.

 

90                              
The appellant killed a defenceless sleeping man whom he had known for
years, who was violent towards him and of whom he was chronically afraid.  He
was entitled to have a jury determine his guilt in accordance with properly
explained and applied rules of law.  This was not the case here, and it is not
for appellate courts to dismiss a defence on which an appropriately instructed
jury has not expressed a view.

 

91                              
In my view, the cumulative effect of the errors unanimously found by the
Court of Appeal to have occurred, combined with the serious and prejudicial
error of allowing the Crown to ask the accused whether he would consent to a
second psychiatric assessment by Dr. Wolwertz, requires that the conviction
be set aside and a new trial ordered.

 

92                              
I would therefore allow the appeal and order a new trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

Criminal law — Charge to jury — Reasonable doubt —
Accused convicted of second degree murder — Whether pre-Lifchus charge on
reasonable doubt in substantial compliance with principles set out in Lifchus.

 








The accused was charged with second degree murder. 
The trial judge,  who did not have the benefit of this Court’s decision in Lifchus,
referred to the expression “moral certainty” in describing reasonable doubt in
her charge to the jury.  The accused was convicted and the majority of the
Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal from conviction.  The majority noted that this
Court had disapproved in Lifchus of the use of the expression “moral
certainty” when describing reasonable doubt, but concluded that,
notwithstanding certain references to expressions which should have been
avoided in the formulation of the instructions, the essence of the notion of
reasonable doubt had properly been conveyed to the jury such that it could not
have misapprehended the applicable standard of proof.  The sole issue raised in
this appeal as of right  is whether the majority of the Court of Appeal erred
in finding that the trial judge’s charge to the jury was in substantial
compliance with the principles enunciated in Lifchus.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 








In reviewing a trial judge’s instructions to the jury
on the reasonable doubt standard, the criterion remains one of “substantial
compliance” with the principles set out in Lifchus.  An appellate court
must assess whether the essential elements of a fair and accurate instruction
on reasonable doubt are present and have been properly explained, such that
there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the proper
burden and standard of proof.  Assessing substantial compliance is not a
mechanical task.  Rather, it is a judgment call on whether any deficiencies in
the charge fall below the Lifchus standard such as to cause serious
concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead to the conclusion
that the accused did not have a fair trial.  Appellate review of substantial
compliance is inevitably in a transitional phase and the failure of pre-Lifchus
jury charges to reflect the Lifchus principles cannot alone be taken to
raise the spectre of an unfair trial or miscarriage of justice.  At the same
time, Canadian courts have been and will continue to be vigilant to ensure that
unfair trials and miscarriages of justice do not go unremedied.  In this case,
there is no reason to intervene in the majority of the Court of Appeal’s
finding that the trial judge’s charge to the jury was in substantial compliance
with the principles enunciated in Lifchus.

I.  Introduction

 








1         
The appellant, Alain Beauchamp, was arrested on August 21, 1994 for the
murder of Élaine Cormier.  He was convicted at trial before a judge and jury of
second degree murder.  His conviction rested entirely on circumstantial
evidence, including extrajudicial statements made by the appellant before and
after his arrest.  This appeal was taken as of right from the decision of the
Quebec Court of Appeal which  dismissed the appellant’s appeal from his
conviction, and allowed the appeal with respect to his sentence.  Fish J.A.,
dissenting, would have allowed the appeal from conviction and ordered a new
trial.  In his view, the trial judge’s charge to the jury, when read as a
whole, gave rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the
applicable standard of proof required for conviction.  

 

2         
The sole issue raised by this appeal is whether as reviewed by the
Quebec Court of Appeal the trial judge’s instructions to the jury, considered
as a whole, resulted in a charge which might reasonably be thought to have
misled the jurors with respect to their ability to understand and apply the
standard of proof “beyond a reasonable doubt”.  At the outset, it should be
noted that this appeal was dismissed by judgment released December 8, 1999,
with reasons to follow. 

 

3         
By way of summary, I am in general agreement with the reasons of
Philippon J. (ad hoc), writing for the majority of the Quebec Court of
Appeal.  I see no reason to interfere with the reasons of the majority and
consequently would dismiss the appeal. 

 

II.  Factual
Background

 








4         
On August 13, 1994, the naked body of Élaine Cormier was found on a 
wooded countryside lot which belonged to the appellant’s grandparents.  Despite
an autopsy, the cause of death could not be determined owing to the corpse’s
advanced state of decay.  There were two highly putrefied orifices on the body,
one on the abdomen, the other, in the area of the perineum and pubis.

 

5         
The appellant and the victim had been acquainted only briefly.  They had
spent the evening of July 20, 1994 together.  Police investigators were unable
to identify anyone having seen the victim subsequent to the night in question. 
After the disappearance of the victim was announced, but before the body was
found, the appellant told his sister that he would be [translation] “in deep shit” if the corpse were found.  

 

6         
The appellant also stated that, in all likelihood, he would be arrested
for the murder of Élaine Cormier since he had no doubt that it was her body
that had been found.  This statement was articulated before the name or sex of
the victim was released.  In response to a question concerning the place where
the body might have been found, the appellant answered: [translation] “I put her there”.

 








7         
On July 21, the appellant arrived at his sister’s house at approximately
1:00 a.m. (though he alleged arriving between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. of the night
before).  He asked for a garbage bag, allegedly to clean out a cooler that he
had used camping.  But, according to a witness, this cooler had already been
emptied out.  The appellant’s sister did not find the garbage bag in front of
her house, where the appellant had claimed to have placed it.  But a similar
bag, containing a pair of blue jeans, was found in front of the neighbouring
house.  Evidence established that the neighbours did not dispose of such a
piece of clothing, and that the bag did not belong to them.  Testimonial
evidence as to what the victim was wearing the day on which she was last seen
was contradictory.  However, it was established that she owned a similar pair
of jeans which were not found amongst her personal belongings during the
investigation.  Statements made by the appellant to investigators about his
comings and goings and certain things he did after leaving Ms. Cormier revealed
inconsistencies.

 

 

III.  Judicial
History

 

8         
Because the sufficiency of the  trial judge’s charge to the jury is the
only issue that forms the basis of this appeal, the summary of the judgments
below is limited to this aspect.

 

A.  Superior
Court

 

9         
In her instructions to the jury, Zerbisias J. emphasized the presumption
of innocence and explained the relationship between this fundamental principle
and the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  She stated that the onus
of proving guilt rests upon the prosecution throughout the trial and never
shifts to the accused.  She stressed that the accused is presumed innocent and
continues to be unless, after considering all the evidence, the jury is
satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
is guilty.  Zerbisias J. then defined the reasonable doubt standard in the
following terms:

 

[translation]  I
will now discuss the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt.  The presumption of innocence is the fundamental
principle of Canadian criminal law:  an accused person is presumed innocent
until proven guilty by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

An accused person does not have to prove he is
innocent.  You must presume the accused is innocent throughout your
deliberations.  You may find him guilty only if, after considering all the
evidence, you are satisfied the Crown has made its case beyond a reasonable
doubt.

 








The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has to
do not with the details or the various pieces of evidence considered separately
but with the evidence as a whole on which the Crown’s case is based.  It is
always up to the Crown to prove the accused guilty, and this onus does not
shift; the accused does not have to prove anything.

 

You must find the accused not guilty if, after
reviewing all the evidence, there is a reasonable doubt in your minds.

 

What, then, is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? There
is no simple answer:  a reasonable doubt could arise from the evidence, from
conflicting evidence or from a lack of evidence.  A reasonable doubt is based
on reason, it is not an imaginary doubt, it is the type of doubt for which you
could give a logical and reasonable explanation if you were asked.  If you are
morally certain or feel sure the accused committed the offence with which he
was charged, you do not have a reasonable doubt.  If you think the accused is
probably guilty, you still have a reasonable doubt; you must give the benefit
of this doubt and render a verdict of not guilty.

 

On the other hand, you must not consider the Crown’s
onus of proof to be a standard of absolute certainty, you must be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty, beyond a reasonable
doubt.  I will read you the definition approved by our higher courts and even
our highest Court.  I believe it is explained well.  It means, and I quote:

 

What is meant by reasonable doubt is the state of mind
of a reasonable person who, after having considered the factual evidence,
cannot be morally certain that the accused is guilty.  It is therefore up to
the prosecution, through its witnesses, the exhibits or the admissions in the
record, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt — not mathematically, which is
always impossible in a trial, as there is no absolute certainty — so it is
always up to the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is
guilty of the offence with which he is charged.  If a reasonable
doubt. . . .

 

And this is important.

 

. . . not a fanciful, capricious or
emotional doubt, but a truly reasonable doubt remains, not in your imagination
but in your mind, in your reason, it is your duty to give the accused the benefit
of this reasonable doubt about him and find him not guilty.

 

In other words, if, after hearing all the evidence,
after reviewing the exhibits that have been entered, and in light of my
comments and instructions on the law, you reach the conclusion that the
prosecution has failed to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, a
real doubt, a serious doubt, it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of
the reasonable doubt and find him not guilty of the offence with which he has
been charged.

 








There have been many attempts to define “reasonable
doubt”; some naysayers have even suggested that if judges did not try so hard
to explain what it meant, jurors would understand it better.  In any event, a
reasonable doubt is a doubt that arises out of an individual’s reason, it is a
serious, real doubt, not an imaginary, fanciful or theoretical doubt, and
certainly not a doubt for the sake of shirking or avoiding your
responsibilities as jurors.

 

The only question, and the key question, each and
every one of you must ask yourself is the following: has the prosecution
morally convinced me that the accused is guilty, am I morally certain of that? 
That is the question.  The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
applies to each essential element of the offence.  The Crown must prove that
the accused committed each of the elements of the offence.  So when I use the
words “the Crown must prove” or “the Crown must establish” or “the Crown must
show” or “you must be convinced”, please understand that these expressions all
mean proof by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

B.  Quebec Court of Appeal, [1998] Q.J. No. 3682 (QL)

 

                   (1) Philippon
J. (ad hoc) (Robert J.A. concurring)  

 

10     
On the issue of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on the
applicable standard of proof, Philippon J. recognized that some of the
expressions to which the trial judge had referred should have been avoided. 
However, Philippon J. found that the charge as a whole was acceptable in so far
as, on the one hand, all of the critical elements relating to the applicable burden and standard of
proof as set out in R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, had been
explained, and on the other hand, the few expressions mentioned by the trial
judge which should have been avoided could not have had the effect of
misleading the jurors.  According to Philippon J., the shortcomings in the
impugned charge fell short of the instructions which had justified judicial
intervention in other cases.

 








11     
Philippon J. noted that this Court, while disapproving of the use of the
expression “moral certainty” in Lifchus, recognized that such expression
had once been considered a meaningful way of describing reasonable doubt. 
Moreover, Philippon J. reiterated that according to Lifchus, the use of
recently prohibited expressions will not affect the verdict if the charge, when
read as whole, does not give rise to the reasonable likelihood that the jury
misapprehended the correct standard of proof.  A review of the trial judge’s
instructions led Philippon J. to conclude that the charge taken in its entirety
satisfied this requirement.

 

12     
Notwithstanding certain references to expressions which should have been
avoided in the formulation of the instructions, Philippon J. found that the
trial judge had correctly explained all of the essential elements of reasonable
doubt, namely:  (1) the connection between the standard of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt and the principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the
presumption of innocence; (2) the requirement that the burden of proof rests on
the prosecution throughout the entire trial and never shifts to the accused;
(3) the principle that a reasonable doubt is not one based upon sympathy or
prejudice, nor is it a frivolous or imaginary doubt, but rather, is based upon
reason; (4) that absolute certainty is not required; and (5) finally, the
requirement that the Crown must prove more than mere probability of guilt and
that where the jury concludes that the
accused is probably guilty, he must be acquitted.  Furthermore, Philippon J.
found that the trial judge had properly avoided describing the phrase
“reasonable doubt” as an ordinary expression without any special meaning in the
criminal law context.  Consequently, Philippon J. concluded that the essence of
the notion of reasonable doubt had properly been conveyed to the jury, such
that it could not have misapprehended the applicable standard of proof.

 

(2) Fish J.A. (dissenting)

 








13     
Fish J.A. held that the trial judge, who did not have the benefit of Lifchus,
erred in her instructions to the jury concerning the meaning of the criminal
standard of proof.  Fish J.A. reviewed some of the principles which were
articulated in Lifchus, namely, that trial judges should not qualify the
word “doubt” with adjectives other than “reasonable”, nor should they instruct
the jury, before giving it a proper definition of the standard of proof, that
it may convict if it is “sure” that the accused committed the crime.  He added
that instructions should not be given which would limit “reasonable doubt” to a
doubt for which a reason can be supplied.  Fish J.A. then reviewed the trial
judge’s corresponding errors.

 

14     
However, Fish J.A. held that the most troubling error related to the trial judge’s references to “moral
certainty”.  While he recognized that referring to “moral certainty” in a jury
charge was not necessarily fatal, he found that Lifchus prohibited any
equation between “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” and “proof to a moral
certainty”.  According to Fish J.A., the trial judge’s references to moral
certainty amounted to the prohibited equation.  In light of this error and of
the other flaws mentioned, Fish J.A. concluded that the charge, as a whole,
gave rise to the reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the criminal
standard of proof.  Fish J.A. would have consequently ordered a new trial.

 

 

IV.  Issue

 

15     
As already stated, this is an appeal as of right and the only issue
raised is whether the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal erred in finding
that the trial judge’s charge to the jury was in substantial compliance with
the principles enunciated in Lifchus.

 

V.  Analysis








16     
In R. v. Starr, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 2000 SCC 40, and R. v.
Russell, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731, 2000 SCC 55, and R. v. Avetysan,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, 2000 SCC 56, released concurrently herewith, the
principles set out by this Court in Lifchus, supra, on the
appropriate manner of instructing a jury on the reasonable doubt standard were
applied.  As noted in Starr, Avetysan and Russell, the
criterion, in reviewing a trial judge’s instructions to the jury, remains one
of “substantial compliance” with the principles set out in Lifchus (Starr,
supra, at paras. 237 and 243).  An appellate court must assess whether
“the essential elements of a fair and accurate instruction on reasonable doubt
are present and have been properly explained” (Starr, supra, at
para. 233), such that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury
misapprehended the proper burden and standard of proof. The charge in this case
was delivered prior to Lifchus.  However, it was reviewed by the Quebec
Court of Appeal after Lifchus.

          

17     
At the outset, it is important to emphasize that, as Starr, Russell
and Avetysan have noted, Lifchus was aimed at improving a trial
judge’s jury instructions on reasonable doubt.  Major J.’s words in Avetysan,
at para. 12, bear repeating here:

 

It is worth stressing that the principles in Lifchus are to be
applied in a manner that will encourage improvements in the wording of jury charges,
but do not vitiate past charges where the language used, although no longer
preferred, meets the substantially correct test.  A jury charge given before or
after the Lifchus decision should not be faulted merely for imprecise
language.  Rather, as was stated in Starr, supra, it should be
reviewed to determine whether it substantially complies with the Lifchus
principles.  As applied in Russell, supra, and Beauchamp, supra,
the basic question remains:  Does the charge, read as a whole, give rise to a
reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct standard of
proof?  If not, the charge is adequate.

                                


          








18     
As was stated in Russell (at paras. 23 and 24), since we are
dealing with the Court of Appeal’s review of a trial judge’s jury charge on
reasonable doubt, the following points must be kept in mind.

 

The appellate assessment of substantial compliance
with the Lifchus principles in cases where the trial judge did not have
the benefit of that decision, and may have used, in parts of the charge,
language that will likely be discontinued in the future or omitted parts
recommended in Lifchus, is not a mechanical task.  Rather, it is a judgment
call on whether the deficiencies in the charge fall below the Lifchus
standard such as to cause serious concern about the validity of the jury’s
verdict, and lead to the conclusion that the accused did not have a fair
trial.  

 

The appellate review of substantial compliance with Lifchus
is inevitably in a transitional phase. Instructions along the lines articulated
in Lifchus, and applied in Starr, will assist future  juries in
better understanding their tasks, and will ensure that the fact-finding process
at trial truly respects the fundamental requirements of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.  In this respect, the failure of jury charges prior to Lifchus
to reflect its principles cannot be taken to raise by that alone the spectre of
an unfair trial or miscarriage of justice.  Having said that, courts in our
country have been and will continue to be vigilant to ensure that unfair trials
and miscarriages of justice do not go unremedied.

 

 

 

19     
Applying the foregoing observations to the majority decision of the
Court of Appeal, I can find no reason to intervene in the majority’s holding
that, in effect, there was substantial compliance with the Lifchus
principles.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for newfoundland

 

Criminal law -- Charge to jury -- Reasonable doubt
-- Accused convicted of assault and extortion -- Whether pre-Lifchus charge on
reasonable doubt in substantial compliance with principles set out in Lifchus.

 

Criminal law -- Charge to jury -- Reasonable doubt
-- Different versions of events -- Whether trial judge adequately charged jury
on how to deal with conflicting evidence. 

 








The appellant and another man were jointly tried for
assault and extortion.  At trial, the testimony given by the complainant and by
both accused as to the events giving rise to the charges was contradictory.  In
his charge, the trial judge, who did not have the benefit of this Court’s
decision in Lifchus, described reasonable doubt as being “real”,
“serious”, “doubt that is reasonable” and  “not an imaginary doubt or a
fictitious doubt”.  When dealing with the competing evidence, the trial judge
described the evidence in global terms, asking the jury to “assess the
evidence, all of the evidence” and he presented the jury with two options:  it
could acquit if a reasonable doubt remained, or convict if all of the evidence
satisfied the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  He also explained that he had
compared the two versions of events given in testimony.  The appellant was
convicted and the majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal from
conviction.  While acknowledging that the charge on reasonable doubt did not
mimic Lifchus, the majority held that the standard was one of adequacy
and that this charge would not have misled the jury on the standard of proof
required.  The majority also held that the jury was adequately charged on how
to deal with competing evidence.  The issue raised by this appeal as of right
was whether the jury was properly instructed on these two points.

  

Held
(Bastarache J. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and a new trial
ordered.

 








Per Major, Binnie,
Arbour and LeBel JJ.:  In considering a pre-Lifchus charge, the test is
whether there was substantial compliance with the principles set out in Lifchus. 
A charge should not be faulted merely for imprecise language.    The principles
in Lifchus and Starr are to be applied in a manner that will
encourage improvements in the wording of jury charges, but do not vitiate past
charges where the language used, although no longer preferred, meets the
substantially correct test.  The basic question remains: does the charge, read
as a whole, give rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended
the correct standard of proof?  Here the charge was  defective.  The jury was
not told clearly  that the standard of proof was more than a balance of
probabilities but less than absolute certainty.  Likewise, the jury was not told
that it was required to acquit if it concluded only that the accused men were
“probably guilty”.  As well, the jury was not told that “proof beyond a
reasonable doubt” is a special concept with a specific meaning in criminal
law.  Further, there is also a risk that the  words used by the trial judge to
describe “reasonable doubt”  did not convey to the jurors that they are to
remain objective in determining whether the evidence amounts to proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.  On an ancillary point, the charge did not warn the jury that
the burden of proof never shifts from the Crown.  Further, while counsel’s
errors can be corrected by the trial judge in his charge, submissions by
counsel cannot remedy a defective charge.

  

The charge, when discussing how to deal with
conflicting evidence, suggested that the jury had to resolve the factual
question of what happened and may have left the jury with the impression that
it had to choose between the two versions of events.  The trial judge should
have focussed the jury’s attention on a third alternative given in W. (D.) --
that the accused men could be acquitted even if their evidence was not believed
but a reasonable doubt remained as to their guilt.  The jury as well should
have been warned not to convict automatically if it found the testimony of the
complainant was more credible than that of the accused men.  There was some
risk that the jury misapprehended the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt in relation to the two irreconcilable versions of events.  The admonition
to consider “all of the evidence” does not correct this failing.

 








Per Bastarache J.
(dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed for substantially the same
reasons as given by the majority of the Court of Appeal.  A failure by the
trial judge to follow W. (D.) does not amount to a reversible
error, as long as the trial judge does not expressly instruct the jury that it
must choose between the accused’s evidence and the other version.  The
determinative question is whether the jury understood that, even if it
disbelieved the accused, it could still acquit if it found the Crown had not
proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  While it is preferable to give an
explicit direction that the accused could be acquitted even if his evidence was
not believed, there is no obligation to do so, as long as the trial judge does
not suggest that one version of events must be accepted by the jury.  Here, a
review of the charge demonstrates that the jury understood that disbelief of
the accused men was not sufficient grounds for conviction.  The jury was never
told that it had to pick between two versions of events and the charge made it
clear to the jury that if the defence evidence leaves the jury in a state of
doubt after considering it in the context of the whole of the evidence, then
the jury is to acquit.  Finally, there is no reason to overturn the majority of
the Court of Appeal on the application of Lifchus.

The judgment of Major, Binnie, Arbour and LeBel JJ.
was delivered by

 

1                                  
Major J. – This appeal
once again raises the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury and the
standard applied by the court of appeal in reviewing it.   Trial judges’
charges to juries vary.  No particular magical incantation is required.  Judges
properly have a wide discretion in what they tell the jury but there are,
depending on the offence alleged, certain things that the jury must be told. 
The language used to obtain the result is left to the trial judge.  If the
charge adequately informs the jury what it must consider, appeal courts will
not interfere simply because they feel the charge could have been better.

 








2                                  
In Canada, the courts of appeal dispose of the vast majority of criminal
and civil appeals.  In assessing the conclusions of courts of appeal, this
Court will not interfere if they have determined,  following paras. 23 and 24
of R. v. Russell, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731, 2000 SCC 55, that regardless of
the language used the instructions were in substantial compliance with the
existing law.  Only if the court of appeal has departed from established
principles will further review by this Court be triggered.

 

3                                  
In this appeal there were two challenges to the jury charge.  They fall
into the subject matter covered in R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320,
and R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  Lifchus is authority on
what the jury must be told on the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
W. (D.) dictates what instructions are necessary when the jury is faced
with competing evidence on “what happened”.  It is significant that here we are
dealing with a case similar to R. v. Starr, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 2000
SCC 40, in that the charge is challenged on a number of fronts, as contrasted
with Russell, supra, and R. v. Beauchamp, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
720, 2000 SCC 54, where all that was at issue was the definition of reasonable
doubt given by the trial judge.  In this appeal, both errors relate to the
directions given to the jury and must have had an impact on the jury’s
assessment of whether a reasonable doubt existed; therefore, at issue is the
charge in its entirety.  If the jury was properly instructed, the specific
words in the charge need not mimic Lifchus and W. (D.).

 

4                                  
In my respectful opinion, the charge in this case is flawed and a new
trial is necessary.

 

I.    Facts

 








5                                  
The appellant, Arthur Avetysan, was convicted of extortion and
assault.   Avetysan was tried jointly with Oleg Velitchko, who was convicted of
the same offences and who discontinued his appeal to this Court before the
release of this decision.  Slivko Paval Valerievich (“the complainant”) was a
Russian citizen seeking refugee status in St. John’s, Newfoundland.  He
testified that the appellant and Velitchko entered his apartment on October 17,
1996, and assaulted him over the course of two or three hours.  According to
the complainant, the appellant and Velitchko demanded that he pay $1,000 within
three days; they threatened to kill him and harm his wife and child in Russia
if he did not comply. 

 

6                                  
The appellant and Velitchko, however, described a completely different
version of events.  In their account, they were invited into the apartment
where they had a friendly conversation about immigration, sports and
unemployment.  The appellant and Velitchko said no assault took place and no
threats were made.  The jury convicted the appellant and Velitchko.

 

7                                  
The trial judge’s charge to the jury was given prior to the 1997 Lifchus decision. 
He told the jury:

 

The presumption of innocence — In a criminal case
in this country, the accused is presumed to be innocent until the Crown has
proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is not the responsibility of the
accused to establish or demonstrate or prove their innocence.  If the Crown
fails to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, you must acquit the accused. 
What is reasonable doubt?  A reasonable doubt is just that, a doubt that is
reasonable.  I usually describe it as a real doubt, if you got a real doubt, a
serious doubt.  It is not an imaginary doubt or a fictitious doubt which is
used by a person to avoid their responsibility.  

 

Later in his
charge, the trial judge said:

 








So the evidence, members of the jury, is fairly — It’s not a complex
matter.  It’s fairly simple and straightforward.  What it boils down to, are
you satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this man was threatened and
assaulted in his apartment that evening?  You assess the evidence, all of the
evidence.  It’s not a case of picking little pieces here and there.  It’s a
case of, I suggest to you — You take all of the evidence.  You take the whole
evidence and you look at it and you determine on the whole of the evidence
whether or not you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of
these two accused persons.  If you have a reasonable doubt, then you must
resolve it in favour of the two accused.  If, however, you are satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt as to their guilt that they assaulted and attempted to
extort monies from Mr. Slivko, it is your duty to convict the accused.  

 

8                                  
On appeal, the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (Court of Appeal) concluded
that the trial judge’s charge to the jury was sufficient:  (1999), 174 Nfld.
& P.E.I.R. 34.  The majority acknowledged that the charge did not mimic Lifchus
in its description of the concept of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”. 
However, they said the standard is one of adequacy, and this charge would not
have misled the jury on the standard of proof required.  On the second issue,
the majority likewise concluded that the jury was adequately charged as to how
to consider two different versions of events.  Green J.A. dissented; this is an
appeal as of right.

 

II.    Analysis

 

9                                  
The approach to explaining reasonable doubt in a jury charge is, as a
result of Lifchus, supra, settled.  The trial judge has
flexibility in instructing the jury on reasonable doubt, and no particular
language is necessary.  The same can be said of the W. (D.) instruction
on conflicting evidence.  Appeal courts will not interfere when a jury has been
adequately instructed.  But adequate instructions require that certain
standards be met.

 

A.    The
Jury Charge on Reasonable Doubt

 








10                              
This Court has applied the principles of Lifchus in a number of
appeals:  Starr, supra; Russell, supra; and Beauchamp,
supra.  Cory J. summarized the necessary ingredients of a jury charge in
Lifchus, at paras. 36-38.  It should be explained to the jury, in
substance, that:

 

·           
the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably
intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the
presumption of innocence;

 

·           
the burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the trial and
never shifts to the accused;

 

·           
a reasonable doubt is not a doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice;

 

·           
rather, it is based upon reason and common sense;

 

·           
it is logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence;

 

·           
it does not involve proof to an absolute certainty; it is not proof
beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt; and

 

·           
more is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty — a jury
which concludes only that the accused is probably guilty must acquit.

 

On the other hand, certain references to the
required standard of proof should be avoided.  For example:

 

·           
describing the term “reasonable doubt” as an ordinary expression which
has no special meaning in the criminal law context;

 

·           
inviting jurors to apply to the task before them the same standard of
proof that they apply to important, or even the most important, decisions in
their own lives;

 

·           
equating proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” to proof “to a moral
certainty”;

 

·           
qualifying the word “doubt” with adjectives other than “reasonable”,
such as “serious”, “substantial” or “haunting”, which may mislead the jury; and

 

·           
instructing jurors that they may convict if they are “sure” that the
accused is guilty, before providing them with a proper definition as to the
meaning of the words “beyond a reasonable doubt”.

 








A charge which is consistent with the principles
set out in these reasons will suffice regardless of the particular words used
by the trial judge.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

11                              
The review of the charge for compliance with these principles is not a
mechanical exercise but one of substance.  The fact that one of the items
mentioned in the first group was absent from the charge, or that an item from
the second group was included in it, will not usually be determinative of the
validity of the charge as a whole.

 

12                              
Starr, supra, stated that in considering a jury charge
given prior to the release of Lifchus, the test is whether there was
substantial compliance with the principles set out in that case.  It is worth
stressing that the principles in Lifchus are to be applied in a manner
that will encourage improvements in the wording of jury charges, but do not
vitiate past charges where the language used, although no longer preferred,
meets the substantially correct test.  A jury charge given before or after the Lifchus
decision should not be faulted merely for imprecise language.  Rather, as
was stated in Starr, supra, it should be reviewed to determine
whether it substantially complies with the Lifchus principles.  As
applied in Russell, supra, and Beauchamp, supra,
the basic question remains:  Does the charge, read as a whole, give rise to a
reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct standard of
proof?  If not, the charge is adequate.

 








13                              
It is settled that the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a
special standard.  It requires more than proof on a balance of probabilities,
or probable guilt, but less than absolute certainty on the part of jurors.  In Lifchus,
at para. 14, Cory J. held that jurors “must be aware that the standard of proof
is higher than the standard applied in civil actions ... yet less than proof to
an absolute certainty”.  In that same passage, he highlighted the importance of
this principle, stating:  “No matter how exemplary the directions to the jury
may be in every other respect if they are wanting in this aspect the trial must
be lacking in fairness”.  See also Starr, at paras. 241-42.  (In
situating the criminal standard of proof, “it falls much closer to absolute
certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities”:  Starr, at para.
242, per Iacobucci J.)

 

14                              
The charge in this case was defective.  The jury was not clearly told
that the standard of proof was more than a balance of probabilities but less
than absolute certainty.  Likewise, the jury was not told that it was required
to acquit if it concluded only that the accused men were “probably guilty”, a
standard that Cory J. in Lifchus found could affect the fairness of
trial.

 

15                              
As well, Lifchus is emphatic that the standard of proof required
to convict a person of a criminal offence is a special one and it must be
described as such.  It is not an ordinary standard and should not be explained
in a manner that directs jurors to apply the standard they employ for everyday
— or even important — decisions:  see R. v. Bisson, [1998] 1 S.C.R.
306.  The charge here failed to convey the special character of the criminal
standard of proof.  The jury was not told that “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt” is a special concept with a specific meaning.  The jury was told that “A
reasonable doubt is just that, a doubt that is reasonable”.  This phrase
implied that the words were used in an everyday, ordinary sense, rather than as
a special phrase with a specific meaning in criminal law.  That being so, I
conclude that the jury charge was defective in that it did not clearly convey
that the terms reasonable doubt have special meaning in criminal law.

 








16                              
Lifchus also states that the charge should tell the jurors that
they are to remain objective in determining whether the evidence amounts to
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is, jurors should not be invited to
supply an individual meaning for the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
This is related to the point that the standard is a special one.  It is also
related to the idea that jurors must not determine guilt based on an individual
sense of morality rather than on a dispassionate review of the evidence:  Lifchus,
at para. 25.  In this case, the suggestion that the words “reasonable doubt”
were used in their ordinary sense risked the possibility that jurors would then
supply an individual meaning to the content of this standard of proof.  In
addition, the trial judge used adjectives to modify “doubt”, such as “serious”
and “real”.  Such modifiers were disproved of in Lifchus because they
could produce variance among jurors as to what the standard requires.

 

17                              
On an ancillary point, the trial judge’s charge to the jury linked the
standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the presumption of innocence,
but it did not warn that the burden of proof never shifts from the Crown.

 

B.          
The Charge on Credibility and Resolving the Factual Mystery of “What 
Happened”

 

18                              
The appellant takes issue with the jury charge for a second reason:  he
says it failed to explain properly to the jury how it should assess
credibility, in a situation where there were two irreconcilable versions of
events described in testimony.

 

19                              
Cory J. addressed this situation in two separate but similarly named
cases:  W. (D.), supra, and R. v. S. (W.D.), [1994] 3
S.C.R. 521.  In W. (D.), at pp. 757-58, he  said:

 








In a case where credibility is important, the trial
judge must instruct the jury that the rule of reasonable doubt applies to that
issue.  The trial judge should instruct the jury that they need not firmly
believe or disbelieve any witness or set of witnesses.  Specifically, the trial
judge is required to instruct the jury that they must acquit the accused
in two situations.  First, if they believe the accused.  Second, if they do not
believe the accused’s evidence but still have a reasonable doubt as to his
guilt after considering the accused’s evidence in the context of the evidence
as a whole. . . .

 

A trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of
credibility along these lines:

 

First, if you believe the evidence of the accused,
obviously you must acquit.

 

Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the
accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.

 

Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the
evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the
evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by
that evidence of the guilt of the accused. [Emphasis in original.]

 

In the other
case, S. (W.D.), at p. 533, Cory J. pointed out that such instructions
need not  be given “word for word as some magic incantation”.  The question is
really whether, in substance, the trial judge’s instructions left the jury with
the impression that it had to choose between the two versions of events.

 








20                              
This appeal parallels W. (D.), in the sense that the jury was
left with two contradictory versions of events.  The complainant testified that
he was assaulted and threatened over a two- or three-hour duration by the
appellant and Velitchko.  The appellant and Velitchko both testified that they
merely had a friendly conversation in the complainant’s apartment.  These
versions were diametrically opposed but the W. (D.) instruction was not
given to the jury.  The trial judge described the evidence in global terms,
asking the jury to “assess the evidence, all of the evidence”.  Elsewhere in
his charge, the trial judge remarked that the jury had heard “two versions” of
events.  He reviewed the two versions and plainly expressed his preference for
the evidence of the complainant, whom he referred to as “a straightforward
witness”.  He presented the jury with two options:  it could acquit if a
reasonable doubt remained, or convict if the evidence satisfied the jury beyond
a reasonable doubt.  He also explained his own reasoning by saying that he had
“compare[d] the evidence of the accused and the evidence of [the
complainant]”.  This last explanation suggested that the jury, too, should
“compare” the two versions of events and choose one.

 

21                              
I agree with Green J.A. that the charge on this point fell into the trap
of suggesting that the jury had to resolve the factual question of what
happened.  The jury was faced with two irreconcilable versions of events.  It
may have seemed to the jury that it bore the responsibility for figuring out
“which version” to believe.  It may logically have seemed an “either/or”
proposition.  It was important that the trial judge focus the jury’s attention
on the third alternative given in W. (D.) — that the accused men could
be acquitted even if their evidence was not believed but a doubt remained.  The
jury may have been left with the impression that it had to choose which
competing version of events it would accept.  The jurors should have had the
third option of W. (D.) left to them.

 

22                              
The jury should have been told that it could acquit even if it did not
believe the testimony of the two accused men provided it was left with
reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused on the evidence that it
accepted.  The jury should have been warned not to convict automatically if it
found the testimony of the complainant was more credible than that of the
appellant and Velitchko.  There was some risk that the jury misapprehended the
requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the two
irreconcilable versions of events.  The admonition to consider “all of the
evidence” does not correct this failing:  S. (W.D.), at p. 535.

 

III.     Conclusion








23                              
The jury charge in this case, when read as a whole, left open the
likelihood that the jury misapprehended the meaning of “proof beyond a
reasonable doubt” and its application to the two versions of events. 
Ultimately, there remains a risk of conviction on a standard of proof other
than “beyond a reasonable doubt”.

 

24                              
The respondent Crown argued that submissions by Crown counsel during the
trial, with respect to the reasonable doubt standard, might have remedied the
defective charge.  That argument fails.  The fact that Crown counsel might have
described the reasonable doubt standard properly will not correct the trial
judge’s failure to do so.  The long-established rule is that the trial judge
instructs the jury on questions of law.  The trial judge bears that
responsibility, and while counsel’s errors can be corrected by the trial judge
in his charge, the opposite is not true. 

 

25                              
The case law is clear that a new trial will be necessary when the jury
may have been under a misapprehension as to the correct standard of proof and
the correct approach to conflicting evidence.  The rationale has its source in
the principle of trial fairness.  See Lifchus, per Cory J. at
para. 13:

 

The Marshall, Morin and Milgaard cases serve as a constant reminder
that our system, with all its protections for the accused, can still make
tragic errors.  A fair trial must be the goal of criminal justice.  There
cannot be a fair trial if jurors do not clearly understand the basic and
fundamentally important concept of the standard of proof that the Crown must
meet in order to obtain a conviction.

 

IV.    Disposition

 

26                              
The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered.

 








The following are the reasons delivered by

 

27                              
Bastarache J. (dissenting)
—  In this appeal, the appellant asks this Court to overturn his convictions
for assault and extortion based on the retrospective application of R. v.
Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, and an extension of the holding in R. v.
W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  I would dismiss the appeal, for
substantially the same reasons as the majority of the Court of Appeal.

 

28                              
In W. (D.), Cory J. describes, at pp. 757-58, how a jury
should handle two diametrically opposed versions of events given in testimony:

 

In a case where credibility is important, the trial
judge must instruct the jury that the rule of reasonable doubt applies to that
issue.  The trial judge should instruct the jury that they need not firmly
believe or disbelieve any witness or set of witnesses.  Specifically, the trial
judge is required to instruct the jury that they must acquit the accused
in two situations.  First, if they believe the accused.  Second, if they do not
believe the accused’s evidence but still have a reasonable doubt as to his
guilt after considering the accused’s evidence in the context of the evidence
as a whole. . . .

 

A trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of
credibility along these lines:

 

First, if you believe the evidence of the accused,
obviously you must acquit.

 

Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the
accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.

 

Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the
evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the
evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by
that evidence of the guilt of the accused.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Nonetheless, the failure to use such language is
not fatal if the charge, when read as a whole, makes it clear that the jury
could not have been under any misapprehension as to the correct burden and
standard of proof to apply:  R. v. Thatcher, [[1987] 1 S.C.R. 652]. 
[Emphasis in original.]








In asserting
that the trial judge must follow this procedure where the evidence pits the
accused’s version of a story against a competing version, the appellant seems
to overlook the final paragraph reproduced above.  It quite clearly indicates
that a failure by the trial judge to follow W. (D.) does not amount
to a reversible error, as long as the trial judge does not expressly instruct
the jury that it must choose between the accused’s evidence and the other version. 
In R. v. S. (W.D.), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, at p. 533, Cory J.
affirmed that the W. (D.) procedure was not meant to be followed
“word for word as some magic incantation”.  In my view, the determinative
question is whether the jury understood that, even if it disbelieved the
accused, it could still acquit if it found the Crown had not proved its case
beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

29                              
A review of the charge demonstrates that the jury understood that
disbelief of the accused was not sufficient grounds for conviction.  At the
outset of his charge, the trial judge:

 

(1)   established that the accused was presumed
innocent;

 

(2)   stated the accused had no responsibility to
establish, demonstrate, or prove his innocence;

 

(3)   stated that if the Crown failed to prove
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused must be acquitted;

 

(4)   stated that it was open to the jury to
accept only a part of a witness’s testimony and to reject other parts.

 








He then stated
that “two versions” of the meeting were in evidence and proceeded to summarize
each of these.  He concluded by saying:

 

So the evidence, members of the jury . . .  – It’s not a complex
matter.  It’s fairly simple and straightforward.  What it boils down to, are
you satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this man was threatened and
assaulted in his apartment that evening?  You assess the evidence, all of the
evidence.  It’s not a case of picking little pieces here and there.  It’s a
case of, I suggest to you -- You take all of the evidence.  You take the whole
evidence and you look at it and you determine on the whole of the evidence
whether or not you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of
these two accused persons.  If you have a reasonable doubt, then you must
resolve it in favour of the two accused.  If, however, you are satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt as to their guilt that they assaulted and attempted to
extort monies from Mr. Slivko, it is your duty to convict the accused.

 

The appellant
argues that the jury should have been told that it could acquit even if it did
not believe the testimony of the two accused men.  While this specific
instruction was not given in express terms by the trial judge, I am confident
that it was quite clear to the jury from the context of the charge as a whole. 
Hence, there was no danger that the jury would automatically convict if it
concluded that the complainant was more credible than the appellant or
Velitchko.  The trial judge presented the question clearly:  it could acquit if
a reasonable doubt remained, or convict if the evidence satisfied the jury
beyond a reasonable doubt.  There is nothing amiss with this direction.

 








30                              
The charge here did not suggest that the jury had to resolve a factual
mystery as to what happened.  The jury was never told that it had to pick
between two versions of events and consequently, when the charge is viewed as a
whole, there is little risk that the jury would have believed it bore the
responsibility for figuring out “which version” it should believe.  While I
accept that it is preferable to give an explicit direction that the accused
could be acquitted even if his or her evidence were not believed, there is no
obligation to do so, as long as the trial judge does not suggest that one
version of events must be accepted by the jury.

 

31                              
In my view,  the difference in facts between the present case and S. (W.D.)
easily distinguishes this case.  First, in that case, the error in the charge
occurred in direct response to a question from the jury, magnifying the
prejudice to the accused; see W. (D.), supra.  Second, the
direction in S. (W.D.) to choose between the two versions was quite
explicit while here there was no specific suggestion that a choice had to be
made.  Third, the direction to consider the existence of a reasonable doubt in
the context of  “all of the evidence” was meaningful here since, unlike in S. (W.D.),
there was corroborating evidence.  Thus, the instruction to consider whether, on
“all of the evidence”, the Crown had proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
mitigated the trial judge’s general reference to “two versions” of events (see S. (W.D.),
supra, at p. 535).

 

32                              
In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge’s failure to follow
the exact phraseology of W. (D.) is not a reversible error since
the charge as a whole established the proper burden and standard of proof.  The
crucial error that motivated a response in W. (D.) (the instruction
that the jury must choose between the accused’s and complainant’s evidence) was
not present here.  On the charge as a whole the burden and standard were
sufficiently clear, thus satisfying the passage in W. (D.) at
issue.  The warning set out by McLachlin J. (as she then was) in S. (W.D.),
supra, at pp. 544-45, bears repeating:

 








. . .when scholars of the criminal law themselves argue about
how the second branch of the W. (D.) test should be phrased, it
would be wrong to reverse a conviction merely because a particular formula was
not repeated verbatim.  We must remember that jurors are laypeople, not
lawyers, and do not hear and interpret each and every word of the judge’s
charge with all the legal baggage that a career in the law may engender.  An
overly legalistic focus on the strict text of the judge’s charge does not take
this courtroom reality into account, nor accommodate the fact that the judge
may have to formulate his or her remarks in various ways in order to make the
jury understand that it must acquit regardless of what evidence it may accept
or reject if it is left with a reasonable doubt when considering that evidence
as a whole.  What is required, to quote Sopinka J. in R. v. Morin,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 362, is that the “charge alerts [the jury] to the
fact that, if the defence evidence leaves them in a state of doubt after
considering it in the context of the whole of the evidence, then they are to
acquit”.

 

Here the
charge made it clear to the jury that if the defence evidence leaves it in a
state of doubt after considering it in the context of the whole of the
evidence, then it is to acquit.

 

Disposition

 

33                              
Because I find no reason to overturn the majority of the Court of Appeal
on the application of Lifchus (as in the unanimous decision of our Court
in R. v. Russell, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731, 2000 SCC 55, released
concurrently), and for the reasons expressed above with regard to the
application of W. (D.), I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the
conviction.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 








Criminal law — Sentencing — Conditional sentences —
Accused pleading guilty to unlawful possession of an explosive substance and
possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and
receiving conditional sentence plus probation — Conditions of sentence and
probation order requiring accused to reside in a psychiatric treatment unit —
Whether conditional sentence could be imposed on facts of this case — Whether
court can require that a conditional sentence be served in a secure mental
health institution — Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 742.1 .

 








The accused has a lengthy history of mental
illness and of dangerous handling of explosives.  He also has a long history of
treatment, and received out‑patient psychiatric treatment as a
requirement of a probation order in force against him between 1993 and 1996
because of an incident where he had taken a firearm to work with the intent of
shooting a co‑worker, for which he received a conditional discharge,
three years’ probation, and a 10‑year firearms prohibition.  In 1998 the
accused pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of an explosive substance and to
possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to
ss. 100(12)  and 87  of the Criminal Code .  The police had found in
the accused’s vehicle and in his apartment an arsenal capable of causing mass
destruction to property, death and serious injury to persons in the area.  At
the sentencing hearing the defence called two forensic psychiatrists in support
of its request that a conditional sentence be imposed, under the terms of which
the accused would reside in a secure mental health institution, under the care
and supervision of psychiatrists.  After hearing the submissions of the
parties, the trial judge imposed a conditional sentence of two years less a day
followed by three years of probation.  Both the sentence and the probation
order required the accused to reside in a locked psychiatric treatment unit at the
hospital where he was receiving treatment, until a consensus of psychiatric professionals made a decision to transfer him from that locked unit.  It was further
stipulated that if he were transferred from the locked unit, the accused was to
reside at such treatment facility as directed by his attending physician or her
successor or designate.  The Court of Appeal set aside the conditional sentence
and substituted a period of incarceration of two years less a day, to be
followed by a three‑year period of probation on substantially the same terms as those imposed by
the trial judge.

 

Held (L’Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier, Iacobucci and Bastarache JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be
allowed. 

 








Per McLachlin C.J.
and Major, Binnie, Arbour and LeBel JJ.:  The sentence imposed by the
trial judge should be restored.  The trial judge was entitled to conclude that
“serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the
community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of
sentencing”, in accordance with s. 742.1 (b) of the Criminal Code . 
That provision does not exclude “dangerous offenders” from access to
conditional sentences.  Rather the focus of the analysis at this point should
be on the risk posed by the individual offender while serving his sentence in
the community.  The danger to the community is evaluated by reference to:  (1) the
risk of re‑offence; and (2) the gravity of the damage in the event of re‑offence. 
In the present case the gravity of the damage in the event of re‑offence
could be extreme.  Although the accused did not set off any explosive
substance, he was in possession, in extremely dangerous circumstances, of
substances that could easily ignite and even accidentally explode, thereby
causing extremely serious personal injury and death.  If the conditions imposed
by the trial judge are taken into account, however, the risk that the accused
would re‑offend while serving his conditional sentence is reduced to a
point that it is no greater than the risk that he would re‑offend while
incarcerated in a penal institution.  The sentence fashioned by the trial judge
provided that the accused would be in a locked, secure psychiatric facility, in
the care and custody of forensic psychiatrists who were well aware of his
history, and who by no means minimized his dangerousness.  They would have been
vested with the authority to determine the pace and method of his gradual
release and reintegration into society, ultimately through the probation
order.  In contrast, the accused’s incarceration in a penal institution,
subject as it is to the provisions of the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act , could require his earlier release, or, in any event, would
most likely leave him considerably less well prepared for facing his renewed
liberty.  Assuming that the conditions imposed by the trial judge were
available to him as a matter of law, it was open to him to conclude that the
condition precedent expressed in s. 742.1 (b) was met.

 








The order that the accused serve his conditional
sentence in a secure residential setting, not only with his consent but at his
request, is not precluded under ss. 742.1 and 742.3 of the Code. 
Conditional sentences were designed by Parliament as a desirable alternative to
incarceration.  A distinction must be made between incarceration or
imprisonment in either prisons or penitentiaries and other custodial or
residential arrangements which may form an acceptable alternative to
incarceration.  The conditions that may be attached to a conditional sentence
under the Code are not exhaustively enumerated and call for a large
measure of discretion.  Assuming that the conditions precedent to the
imposition of a conditional sentence are met, nothing in s. 742.3
precludes resorting to community‑based facilities, even
residential ones, simply because they have a custodial aspect, as long as they
can be seen as a genuine alternative to incarceration.  The alternative to
incarceration that Parliament contemplates is the alternative not to a
particular place or building, but to a regime of detention, program and release
governed by legislation such as the Corrections and Conditional Release Act . 
In the case of a conditional sentence, a regime uniquely suited to the offender
is put in place by the terms of the order under which the conditional sentence
is imposed.  It is tailored to take into account the needs of the offender and
those of the community into which he will need to be reintegrated.  This includes
taking full advantage of all community‑based services, including residential programs, and including residential
programs that may have a compulsory residential element, as long as the
programs serve the ends expressed in s. 718 of the Code.  The
sentence imposed by the trial judge in this case was legal and fit and was the
one that best served the objectives of sentencing expressed in s. 718 of
the Code.  Moreover, it was the sentence that best ensured that the
dangerousness of the accused would be curtailed for the longest period of time,
with both short‑term and long‑term benefits to the community at
large.

 

Per Iacobucci J.
(dissenting):  There is agreement with the majority’s view that, generally
speaking, a conditional sentencing order can be made under the Criminal Code 
requiring an offender to undergo treatment in a closed psychiatric facility,
provided that such an order is reasonable in the circumstances, and consistent
with the purpose and principles of sentencing.  In such a situation, the
discretion afforded to sentencing judges under s. 742.3(2)(f) of the Code
is wide enough to include sentences that require psychiatric care in a
hospital setting.  As found by the minority, however, a conditional sentence
was not an appropriate order in this case  since the accused did not satisfy
the test for dangerousness set out in Proulx.

 

Per L’Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and Bastarache JJ. (dissenting):  The Court of Appeal was correct
in overturning the conditional sentence in this case.  The sentence was
inappropriate both because the precondition that the accused not endanger the
safety of the community was not satisfied and because the conditional
sentencing regime does not contemplate serving a sentence in a locked
psychiatric unit of a hospital.

 








In assessing whether the accused is a danger to the
community, the court must consider the following two factors:  (1) the risk of
the offender re‑offending; and (2) the gravity of the damage that could
ensue in the event of re‑offence.  In assessing the risk of re‑offence
in this case, the accused’s history of weapons offences must be considered. 
The record demonstrates that the accused was already subject to a prohibition
from possessing firearms, ammunition and explosives at the time that he
committed the offences in question.  Nevertheless, by the time the accused was
apprehended, he had amassed a large arsenal of highly volatile explosives
capable of injuring many people and leading to substantial property damage. 
The medical evidence also establishes that the accused has been engaged in dangerous
activity in the past even while undergoing treatment.  Unfortunately, whether
the accused is sentenced to a prison term or treated at a psychiatric hospital,
he will likely remain a danger even when his sentence is complete.  While the
accused would be subject to supervision during the term of his conditional
sentence, the evidence points to a risk of re‑offending despite such
supervision and the availability of programs.  Moreover, the sentence order did
not ensure that the accused remained under maximum security at the hospital
throughout the entire period of his sentence.  The accused was to reside in a
locked psychiatric treatment unit of the hospital until a consensus was reached
among psychiatrists that he could be transferred into other treatment
facilities.  Since no evidence was tendered regarding the level of security at
those other facilities, there is no way of ensuring that there would not be a
risk of re‑offence once the accused was released.  Further, even if it
were accepted that the risk of re‑offence is only minimal, the gravity of
the potential harm that would ensue if the accused were to re‑offend
precludes a conditional sentence in and of itself.

 








While persons in psychiatric hospitals continue to be
members of the community, “community” in s. 742.1 of the Code must
be interpreted as also including the general public.  The community with which
a sentencing judge must be concerned  consists of all persons who could be at
risk of being harmed by the offender.  If there is a danger to any person by
the offender serving the sentence in the community, whether that person be a
resident of the psychiatric hospital or in the public at large, then a
conditional sentence should not be imposed.

 








Even if it were to be concluded that the accused does
not represent a danger to the community, the conditional sentencing regime does
not contemplate serving a sentence in a locked psychiatric unit as a condition
of the sentence.  A conditional sentence which confines an offender to a
psychiatric institution is distinct from a treatment order envisioned in
s. 742.3(2)(e).  Nor can s. 742.3(2)(f), under which
the court may impose “such other reasonable conditions as the court considers
desirable”,  be used to confine an individual to a psychiatric hospital.  While
the conditional sentence may incorporate some  restrictive conditions such as
house arrest and curfews with non‑custodial measures, offenders serving a
conditional sentence are not confined to an institution but are meant to
continue working, attending school, and participating in treatment programs. 
This Court’s decision in Proulx makes it evident that conditional
sentences are meant as an alternative to incarceration and not as a sentence to
any type of locked institution subsequent to which the offender would have to
be reintegrated into the community.  This view of the philosophy behind the
conditional sentencing regime is buttressed by the recent appellate decisions
which hold that “blended” sentences, where the first part of the sentence is
served in custody and the latter part is a conditional sentence under
supervision in the community, are illegal and contrary to the underlying
purpose of the conditional sentencing regime.  A review of the legislative
history of the conditional sentencing provisions also suggests that Parliament
intended that conditional sentences be non‑institutional in nature and
that supervision in the community was not meant to be equivalent to confinement
in an institution.  The usual methods of confining a person to a hospital in
the criminal context are as a condition of parole, or through a ruling that the
person is not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder.  Unlike a
person held not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, a person
with a mental disability who is being sentenced is criminally responsible for
his or her actions.  The principle of “proportionality”, codified in
s. 718.1 of the Code, dictates that the sentence must be
proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of
the offender.  Here the accused possessed a culpable state of mind, and his
sentence should reflect this.

I.  Introduction

 

 

1                                  
This appeal lies at the often ambiguous crossroads between the criminal
justice and the mental health care systems.  

 








2                                  
On November 3, 1998, the appellant pleaded guilty to having in his
possession an explosive substance while prohibited from doing so, contrary to
then s. 100(12)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  The matter was remanded to December 15, when the
accused pleaded guilty to the further offence of having in his possession a
weapon  for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to then s. 87  of the Criminal Code .  A
detailed agreed statement of facts was read into the record, and the matter
proceeded to a sentencing hearing in which the defence called two forensic
psychiatrists in support of its request that a conditional sentence be imposed,
under the terms of which the appellant would reside in a secure mental health
institution, under the care and supervision of psychiatrists.  After hearing
the submissions of the parties, the trial judge imposed a conditional sentence 
followed by three years of probation.  The conditions of both the two-year
sentence and the probation order required the appellant to reside in a psychiatric treatment unit at the Alberta Hospital Edmonton.   

 

3                                 
On March 2, 1999, upon appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal ((1999),  232 A.R. 289) set aside the
conditional sentence and substituted a period of incarceration of two years
less a day, to be followed by a three-year period
of probation on substantially the same terms as those imposed by the trial
judge.  On October 21, 1999, the appellant was granted full parole also with
similar conditions.  He was moved to the
Alberta Hospital Edmonton where he is required, as a resident of the Hospital,
to attend its rehabilitation program.  The appellant currently resides at the
Hospital.  

 

4                                  
The issue before us is to determine whether the seven months’ hiatus,
during which the continued residential psychiatric treatment of the appellant
at the Alberta Hospital Edmonton was interrupted,  is required by law.  The
legality of the conditional sentence originally imposed by the trial judge must therefore be examined.  That, in turn,
rests on two issues.  First, whether a
conditional sentence could be imposed on the facts of this case, and
second, whether the court can require that a conditional sentence be served in a secure mental health institution.  

 

5                                  
In my view, both questions must be answered in the affirmative.  As a
result, I would allow the appeal and restore the sentence imposed by the trial
judge. 

 

II.  Chronology
of Events 

 








6                                  
The accused has a long history of
mental illness, as well as a  lengthy history of dangerous handling of
explosives.  The combination of both makes him potentially extremely dangerous
to himself and to others.  As a matter of
fact, the psychiatrists were unanimous that the appellant’s criminal conduct was causally linked to his mental
disorder.  The appellant’s illness
goes back to his early childhood.  He received some psychiatric attention as a
child and continued to experience mental distress throughout his adolescence
and adult life.  Dr. Tweddle, a forensic psychiatrist at the Alberta Hospital
Edmonton, testified that the appellant presents an unusual case of longstanding
deeply ingrained personality difficulties with features of obsessive
compulsiveness and depression.  He  has fantasies about violent matters.  He
has had an interest in weapons, and his preoccupation with explosives is
related to his wanting to overcome his feelings of being overwhelmed, rejected
and belittled.  Moreover, he obviously does not just keep these ideas to
fantasies, but has operationalized them
and as a result was diagnosed by Dr. Tweddle as potentially extremely
dangerous.  Dr. Tweddle concluded that he would be best treated in a hospital
setting, where he can be both medicated
and involved in long term psychotherapy, as
well as in occupational and social skills training, with a view to enhancing
his self-awareness and self-control and laying the groundwork for his eventual
reintegration into the community.  

 








7                                  
The appellant also has a long history of treatment.  In recent years, he
received out-patient psychiatric treatment as a requirement of a probation
order in force against him between 1993 and 1996 as a result of his conditional
discharge  for the offence of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to
the public peace, contrary to then s.
87  of the Criminal Code .  His treating psychiatrist, Dr. Otakar Cadsky, testified that his attendance, in
compliance with that order, was not perfect, but was “for mentally ill patients
about as good as you can expect”.  He
missed five appointments and attended 45 sessions.  Dr. Cadsky testified that
his attendance for treatment is considerably more satisfactory when it is the
result of a compulsory court order. 
Dr. Cadsky was treating the appellant, on an
out-patient basis, at Forensic Assessment and Community Services, the out-patient
department of the Alberta Hospital Edmonton’s Forensic Service.  In the course
of that therapy, the appellant was certified by Dr. Cadsky and admitted to the
hospital for a six-week period in 1994.  Once again, in June of 1996, the
appellant was certified and hospitalized, with a diagnosis of major
depression.  After the expiration of the probation order, Dr. Cadsky continued
to see the appellant on an out-patient basis until June of 1997, at which time
the appellant ceased his treatment.  In February 1998, following an accident
with a detonator device, in which the appellant injured
his finger, the appellant sought treatment again from Dr. Cadsky, whom
he saw twice as an out-patient before again ceasing treatment.  

 

8                                  
The appellant was arrested on the current charges on July 22, 1998.  He
was immediately admitted to the Alberta Hospital Edmonton pursuant to an assessment order directing an
evaluation of his fitness to stand trial.  With his consent, his “remand
status” was extended at the request of the attending psychiatrist, Dr. Vijay
Singh.  A further extension was requested on September 16 and finally, on
October 22, 1998, the appellant was
certified under the Alberta Mental
Health Act, S.A. 1988, c. M-13.1.  

 

9                                  
The appellant overtly supported the proposed course of treatment. 
Overall, he remained at the Alberta Hospital Edmonton under residential
psychiatric care for the five months prior to his appearance before Chrumka
Prov. Ct. J. for sentencing.  

 








10                              
At the sentencing hearing, the two forensic psychiatrists called to
testify advocated a continued psychiatric residential treatment program under
court order.  The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a conditional sentence
of two years less a day followed by a three-year probation period.  The salient
condition of his conditional sentence was that the appellant was to reside at
the Alberta Hospital Edmonton in a locked secure psychiatric treatment unit where he was currently receiving treatment,
until a consensus of psychiatric professionals
made a decision to transfer him from that locked unit.  The condition
further stipulated that if he were transferred from that locked unit, the
appellant was to reside at such treatment facility as directed by Dr. Tweddle
or her successor or designate. 

 

11                              
The terms of his probation for three years also required that the
appellant reside at such treatment facility as directed by Dr. Tweddle, and
that he enter into and diligently pursue any treatment, counselling or therapy as directed by his probation officer,
including attendance at Forensic Assessment.  

 

12                              
The appellant remained under residential psychiatric care at the Alberta
Hospital Edmonton until the Court of Appeal reversed the conditional sentence
imposed by the trial judge and ordered his incarceration for two years less a
day with the recommendation that it be served at Fort Saskatchewan Provincial
Correctional Institute, where the court felt that the appellant would be able
to access treatment opportunities and facilities similar to the ones that he
had already experienced.  That decision was made on March 2, 1999.  Seven months later, the appellant was granted
full parole by the National Parole Board.  As a condition of his parole, he was
moved to the Alberta Hospital Edmonton where he resumed his residential
treatment.  The National Parole Board’s pre-release decision indicates that he
is eligible for leave with the permission of the ward psychiatrist or delegate,
in consultation with the community parole officer. 

 








13                              
It is argued that the
conditional sentence imposed by the trial judge is not permissible under the Criminal Code  because of the
appellant’s dangerousness, and because it requires that the appellant be kept
in the custody of an institution. 

 

14                              
In order to examine these issues, I now turn to the factual elements
that illustrate the conceded dangerousness of this offender. 

 

III.  Factual
Background

 

15                              
In support of the guilty plea, a lengthy agreed statement of facts was
introduced at trial and was summarized as follows by the Court of Appeal, at pp. 290-91: 

 








The [appellant Knoblauch] was employed by the City
of Edmonton, Department of Transportation.  On July 21, 1998 the [appellant]
approached a co‑worker and apologized for a remark that he had made the
previous day. He stated that he thought about getting a dog and blowing it up
because it might calm him down. He pulled a gym bag from his car and opened it.
Inside was a litre size jar with wires extending from it, that appeared,
to the co‑worker, to be a bomb. The jar contained a fluid and was three‑quarters
full. The following day, when the [appellant] did not appear for work, the
police were notified. The police responded to his residence and noted that the
apartment was in state of disarray with PVC pipes, electrical components, wires
and transistors on the livingroom floor and kitchen table. A search warrant was
obtained. The apartment contained numerous electrical component systems, parts,
and an electronic technician‑type workbench complete with tools and
diagnostic equipment. In addition, there was literature relating to the
construction and preparation of explosive devices and literature on the
Oklahoma City bombing and Waco, Texas armed standoff.

 

In the [appellant]'s
vehicle was a suicide bomb. The only requirement for the device to deploy was
the movement of the switch by the operator or victim. In the car were explosive
substances, including two 500 ml bottles containing nitro‑methane and
picric acid, chemicals, which are extremely unstable in nature. Also located in
the vehicle was a duffle bag with a container of 37% formaldehyde; 500 ml of
sodium nitrate; 500 grams of sulphuric acid; 500 ml of lead  nitrate;
and 500 ml of picric acid; and 150 ml of glycerine and various other chemicals.
The chemicals found in the vehicle have capability on their own, or in
combination, to form highly explosive substances and could have been used to
create an arsenal of devices.

 

Similar chemicals were
located inside the residence, including two 80 lb bags of ammonia nitrate and
two pipe bombs. Three detonators were seized including one that had been
exploded.

 








The bomb inside the
vehicle, if detonated, would have destroyed the vehicle and killed the person
activating the device. The debris would have caused damage to cars, buildings
and injured anyone within a 75 metre radius. The two 80 lb bags of ammonia
nitrate, if mixed with fuel oil and detonated in the [appellant]'s suite, would
have damaged the suites two to three floors above and two to three on either
side, as well as cars parked along the street and houses across the street.
Anyone in the area would be killed or seriously injured.

 

The [appellant] had in
his vehicle and in his apartment an arsenal capable of causing mass destruction
to property, death and serious injury to persons in the area indiscriminately.
After viewing the contents of the vehicle and the apartment, the police
requested the assistance of the Edmonton Emergency Response Department
Dangerous Goods team and a private chemical disposal firm. The firm declined to
assist with some of the chemicals due to the unstable explosive nature and
toxicity of the chemicals.

 

The
[appellant], at the time of the offences, was prohibited from  being in
possession of weapons and explosives. [He] received a conditional discharge and
three years’ probation plus a firearms prohibition for ten years on November
29, 1993 for a charge under [then] s. 87  of the Criminal
Code . This charge arose when [the appellant] brought a gun to work
intending to shoot a co‑worker.

 

 








16                              
Before turning to an examination of the applicable law, I wish to stress
two important aspects of this case.  The first one is that it is beyond dispute that the appellant is
potentially extremely dangerous.  The second is that it is equally beyond
dispute that the appropriate sentence for this appellant, in all of the
circumstances, is a sentence of two years less a day, whether it is served in a
penal institution or in a mental health hospital.  These are critical facts to
keep in mind.  There is no mechanism in criminal law to remove dangerous people
from society merely in anticipation of
the harm that they may cause.  The limit of the reach of the criminal sanction
is to address what offenders have
done.  At that stage, dangerousness is but one
factor to be considered in the assessment of the appropriate sentence.  Even
extreme dangerousness cannot, in and of itself, justify imposing the maximum
punishment in order to elevate the protection of society above all other
considerations.  That explains why in this case both the trial judge and
the Court of Appeal were of the view, which has not been disputed before us,
that considering all the circumstances, the appropriate punishment for this
offender would have been a sentence of three years of incarceration which was
properly reduced to two years less a day to take into account the period spent
in pre-trial custody.  

 

17                              
It is in this context that we
must embark upon an analysis of the framework contemplated by the Criminal Code  to fashion an appropriate, just, fair
and intelligent sentence for the appellant.

 

IV.  The
Conditional Sentence Regime

 

18                              
For ease of reference, I have attached as an appendix to these reasons the  relevant Criminal Code 
provisions, including the unproclaimed sections dealing with  hospital orders.


 

19                              
The principles governing the imposition of conditional sentences are set
out in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5.  Neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal had the
benefit of that decision.  Lamer C.J. introduced his extensive reasons in Proulx, at para. 1, by the
following:

 








By passing the Act to amend the Criminal Code
(sentencing) and other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill
C-41”), Parliament has sent a clear
message to all Canadian judges that too many people are being sent to prison. 
In an attempt to remedy the problem of overincarceration, Parliament has
introduced a new form of sentence, the conditional sentence of imprisonment.

 

 

20                              
Before that, in R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, Cory and
Iacobucci JJ. underlined the significance of the enactment of the major reform
of sentencing principles which included the novel mechanism of conditional
sentences.  They also underlined, at para. 48, the two principal objectives
pursued by Parliament in this important sentencing reform: to reduce the use of imprisonment and to increase recourse to restorative justice
principles in sentencing.

 

21                              
Section 742.1 of the Code, which provides for the imposition of
conditional sentences, is therefore a core provision to the sentencing reform
of 1995 and is linked to other provisions which command restraint in the use of incarceration, such as s. 718.2(d) and (e), as well
as to the fundamental purpose of sentencing expressed in s. 718 of the Code,
which is to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a
just, peaceful and safe society.

 

22                              
Section 742.1  of the Criminal Code  provides as follows:  

 

742.1 Where a person is convicted of an
offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment, and the court

 

(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,
and

 

(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community
would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to
718.2,

 








the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender's behaviour
in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,
subject to the offender's complying with the conditions of a conditional
sentence order made under section 742.3.

 

23                              
Expanding on the nature of conditional sentences, Lamer C.J. in Proulx,
supra, said the following, at paras. 21
and 22: 

 

The conditional sentence was specifically enacted
as a new sanction designed to achieve both of Parliament’s objectives.  The
conditional sentence is a meaningful alternative to incarceration for less
serious and non-dangerous offenders.  The offenders who meet the criteria of s.
742.1  will serve a sentence under strict surveillance in the community instead
of going to prison.  These offenders’ liberty will be constrained by conditions
to be attached to the sentence, as set out in s. 742.3 of the Code.  In
case of breach of conditions, the offender will be brought back before a judge,
pursuant to s. 742.6.  If an offender cannot provide a reasonable excuse for
breaching the conditions of his or her sentence, the judge may order him
or her to serve the remainder of the sentence in jail, as it was
intended by Parliament that there be a real threat of incarceration to increase
compliance with the conditions of the sentence. 

 

The conditional sentence incorporates some elements
of non-custodial measures and some others of incarceration.  Because it is
served in the community, it will generally be more effective than incarceration
at achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations to the victim
and community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender. 
However, it is also a punitive sanction capable of achieving the objectives
of denunciation and deterrence.  It is this punitive aspect that
distinguishes the conditional sentence from probation, and it is to this issue that I now turn. [Emphasis in
original.]

 

 

24                              
Having distinguished conditional sentences from probation, Lamer C.J.
then turned to the differences between conditional sentences and
incarceration.  He said, at para. 41: 

 

This is not to say that the conditional sentence is
a lenient punishment or that it does not provide significant denunciation and
deterrence, or that a conditional sentence can never be as harsh as incarceration.  As this Court stated in Gladue,
supra, at para. 72: 

 

... in our view a sentence focussed on restorative justice is not
necessarily a “lighter” punishment.  Some proponents of restorative justice
argue that when it is combined with probationary conditions it may in some circumstances impose a greater
burden on the offender than a custodial sentence. 

 








A conditional sentence may be as onerous as, or perhaps even more
onerous than, a jail term, particularly in circumstances where the offender is
forced to take responsibility for his or her actions and make reparations to
both the victim and the community, all the while living in the community under
tight controls. 

 

25                              
It is against this background that we must now turn to the availability
of a conditional sentence in the present case.  There is no dispute, as I
indicated earlier, that a sentence of two years less a day was a fit and
appropriate sentence in all the circumstances.  The first criterion in s. 742.1
of the Code having been satisfied, it remains only to be decided whether
the trial judge was entitled to conclude that “serving the sentence in the
community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be
consistent with the fundamental purpose and
principles of sentencing”, in accordance with s. 742.1 (b).  

 

26                              
This condition was also examined in some detail in Proulx, albeit
without this particular factual scenario in mind.  The Court held that s.
742.1 (b) was a prerequisite to any conditional sentence, in the sense
that alternatives to incarceration 
must be abandoned if the judge is not satisfied that the safety of the
community can otherwise be preserved.  The criterion of the safety to the
community is therefore a condition precedent to the determination of whether a
conditional sentence  serves the general purposes of sentencing expressed in ss. 718 to 718.2.  On this point, I think it
is important to stress that the section does not exclude “dangerous offenders”
from access to conditional sentences.  Rather, as expressed by Lamer C.J. in Proulx, at para. 68,  “the focus of the analysis at this point should clearly be on the
risk posed by the individual offender while serving his sentence in the
community” (emphasis added).  The
danger to the community is then evaluated by reference to: (1) the risk  of
re-offence; and (2) the gravity of the damage in the event of re-offence.  See Proulx,
at para. 69.








 

27                              
I think it is fair to say that in the present case the gravity of the
damage  in the case of re-offence could be extreme.  Although the appellant did
not set off any explosive substance, he was in possession, in extremely
dangerous circumstances, including in his car, of substances that could easily
ignite and even accidentally explode, thereby causing extremely serious
personal injury and death.  In such a case, I am of the view that the risk of
re-offending while under conditional sentence should be no greater than if the appellant was
incarcerated in a penal institution
before the two branches of the test
could safely be met.  I now turn to the risk of re-offence.  Here I believe the
decision in Proulx is again of great assistance.  At para. 72, Lamer
C.J. said: 

 

The risk of re-offence should also be assessed in
light of the conditions attached to the sentence. Where an offender might pose
some risk of endangering the safety of the community, it is possible that this
risk be reduced to a minimal one by the imposition of appropriate conditions to
the sentence: see Wismayer, supra, at p. 32; Brady,
supra, at para. 62; Maheu, supra, at p. 374 C.C.C.  Indeed, this is contemplated by s.
742.3(2)(f), which allows the
court to include as optional conditions “such other reasonable conditions as
the court considers desirable... for securing the good conduct of the offender
and for preventing a repetition by the offender of the same offence or the
commission of other offences”.  For example, a judge may wish to impose a
conditional sentence with a treatment order on an offender with a drug
addiction, notwithstanding the fact that the offender has a lengthy criminal
record linked to this addiction, provided the judge is confident that there is
a good chance of rehabilitation and
that the level of supervision will be sufficient to ensure that the offender
complies with the sentence.

 

 








28                              
In my view, if the conditions contemplated by the trial judge are taken
into account in evaluating the risk that the appellant would re-offend while
serving his conditional sentence, that risk is reduced to a point that it is no
greater than the risk that the appellant would re-offend while incarcerated in
a penal institution.  The sentence fashioned by the trial judge provided that
the appellant would be in a locked, secure psychiatric facility, in the care
and custody of forensic psychiatrists who were well aware of his history, and
who by no means minimized his dangerousness.  They would have been vested with
the authority to determine the pace and method of his gradual release and
reintegration into society, ultimately through the probation order.  

 

29                              
In contrast, his incarceration in a penal institution, subject as it is
to the provisions of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C.
1992, c. 20 , could require his earlier release, or, in any event, would most
likely leave him considerably less well prepared for facing his renewed
liberty.  Therefore, it seems to me that whether the appellant is incarcerated
in a penal institution, subject to the release power of the Parole Board, or
whether he is made to reside in a locked secure psychiatric facility, subject
to the supervisory release authority of a
consensus of psychiatrists, it cannot be said that he would be a greater
danger to the community during that time under one regime rather than the other.

 

30                              
The dangerousness of the appellant is a product of the combined effect
of his mental illness and his ability to acquire and make use of explosive
materials and devices.  Incarceration precludes the latter, but does little to address his mental illness.

 








31                              
Conditions of a sentence to be served outside a prison, that address
both sources of the appellant’s dangerousness, in my view reduce his being a
danger to the community as much as if not more
than a sentence of incarceration would, both while the sentence is in place, and even more so afterwards. 
The fact, underscored and relied upon by the Court of Appeal, at pp. 293-94, as
the basis for varying the sentence imposed by
Chrumka Prov. Ct. J., that at large, untreated and unsupervised the
appellant is an “extreme danger to the
community” is wide off the mark.  Under the conditions imposed by the trial
judge, the appellant is no more a threat to the community while serving his
conditional sentence  than he would be if incarcerated.  In the long term, a conditional sentence becomes even more
clearly the preferable course of action.  There was uncontradicted evidence before Chrumka Prov. Ct.  J. that not only
would incarceration be unlikely to address the causes of the appellant’s
dangerousness, but the carceral environment was likely to aggravate his
condition.  Dr. Tweddle said: 

 

The other aspect, the other thing that actually concerns me very much about Mr.
Knoblauch is the environment in a gaol.  The very situations that make him
worse, the areas that make him ruminate and — and want to get back at the world are day to day activities and —
and the — you know the regular atmosphere in a gaol, particularly penitentiary
where it’s an extremely hostile place, where the men are very abusive to one
another, where they’re both verbally and physically abusive, they’re very
competitive with their — their sort of weight lifting and — and the sort of the
epitome of the — at least the external appearance of macho behaviour. 

 

And of course it’s a very authoritative place.  He
would be — he would be told and ordered to do things on a day to day, minute by
minute basis and I think these are the very things that have been the triggers,
the areas of difficulty that have created the problems within Mr. Knoblauch and
— and that he then takes into himself and ruminates on endlessly until he — he
thinks of ways to fight back and regain a perceived power over what is — what is happening to him.

 

Q: Can you express an opinion
as to how you think he would respond to that environment? 

 

A: My — my opinion is that —
that it would likely make him worse.  I think — I think it would be a very
destructive environment for him.  I think he would find it extremely difficult
to — to cope in that environment and it would, in a sense feed into all of the
prejudices that he has.  It would confirm that — that authority is controlling
people and belittling people and so I think it would actually be a very poor
environment for him. 

 








32                              
Assuming that the conditions
imposed by the trial judge were available to him as a matter of law, I believe
that it was open to him to conclude that the condition precedent expressed in
s. 742.1 (b) was met.  The critical
issue is therefore to determine whether it was open to the trial judge to
impose the type of restriction on the liberty of the appellant that he did in
order to reduce the risk of re-offence to the minimal level.  It is to this
issue that I now turn.

 

V.  Custodial
v. Non-Custodial Sentences

 

33                              
The respondent submits that conditional sentences were intended by
Parliament to be non-custodial and that a conditional sentence to be served in
the secure area of a psychiatric hospital is contrary to the principles
involved in the conditional sentence provisions of the Code.  There is
support in Proulx for the view that a conditional sentence is an
alternative to a custodial one, and not only to strict imprisonment.  In
particular, at para. 40, it is suggested that conditional sentences are
designed to be served in non-institutional settings: 

 

Although a conditional sentence is by statutory
definition a sentence of imprisonment, this Court . . . [has] recognized that
there “is a very significant difference between being behind bars and
functioning within society while on conditional release”. . . . Indeed,
offenders serving a conditional sentence in the community are only partially
deprived of their freedom.  Even if their liberty is restricted by the
conditions attached to their sentence, they are not confined to an
institution and they can continue to attend to their normal employment or
educational endeavours.  They are not deprived of their private life to the
same extent.  Nor are they subject to a regimented schedule or an institutional
diet. [Emphasis added.] 

 

 

See also Proulx,
at para. 95.  

 








34                              
The issue was not squarely raised in Proulx.  The passage quoted
was part of the analysis under which Lamer C.J. was contrasting conditional
sentences with probation orders on the
one hand, and incarceration on the other.  However,
Lamer C.J. did not have to decide, as we do in this case, whether the
order that the accused serve all or
part of his conditional sentence in a secure residential setting, not only with
his consent but indeed at his request, was precluded under ss. 742.1  and
742.3 .  In my view it is not.  

 

35                              
As indicated earlier, conditional sentences were designed by Parliament
as a desirable alternative to incarceration.  In my opinion, one must
distinguish between incarceration or imprisonment in either prisons or
penitentiaries, and other custodial or residential arrangements, whether secure
or not, and whether consensual or compulsory, but which may form an acceptable
alternative to incarceration.  

 

36                              
The conditions that may be attached to a conditional sentence under the Criminal
Code  are not exhaustively enumerated and call for a large measure of
discretion.  Some are compulsory, as provided by s. 742.3(1) .  In addition,
broad discretion is conferred upon the sentencing court by s. 742.3(2) (f). 
Assuming that the conditions precedent to the imposition of a conditional
sentence are met, nothing in s. 742.3  precludes resorting to community-based facilities, even residential ones, simply
because they have a custodial aspect, as long as they can be seen as a genuine
alternative to incarceration. 

 

37                              
The alternative to incarceration that Parliament contemplates is the
alternative not to a particular place or building, but to a regime of
detention, program and release, governed by legislation
such as the Corrections and Conditional Release Act .  In my view,
that is the only way of distinguishing between
incarceration and conditional sentences.

 








38                              
Incarceration or imprisonment is a form of punishment governed by the  Corrections
and Conditional Release Act .  Under that legislation, the degree of
restriction on freedom of movement imposed on an inmate varies depending on the
classification of the offender (s. 30 ) and the type of institution in which he
or she will be incarcerated.  A person incarcerated in a minimum security
institution has  considerable freedom.  Yet that person is incarcerated,
serving a term of imprisonment within the meaning of the Criminal Code ,
and may be found guilty of being unlawfully at large if he or she disobeys the
constraints imposed upon him or her.  

 

39                              
Under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act , a “penitentiary” is a facility operated for the
care and control of inmates by the
Correctional Service of Canada and may include any prison, or any hospital,
so designated by order of the Commissioner and any other place so designated by
the Governor in Council (s. 2(1)).  Under the Act, temporary absences may be
authorized (s. 17 ).  This in my view makes abundantly clear that incarceration
or imprisonment as a form of punishment is a regime that may not require a
total restriction on freedom of movement. 

 

40                              
If one were to capture the essence of imprisonment, it might be best
done by emphasizing the involuntary constraints than by pointing out the actual
degree of confinement.  In R. v. Degan (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 293 (Sask. C.A.),
the court held that a person who is required by the terms of a probation order
to reside in a community training residence
designated as a “correctional facility” under the then Corrections Act,  R.S.S. 1978, c. C-40, s. 2(f), is
not imprisoned.  Vancise J.A., speaking
for the court, said at pp. 299-300: 

 








In the present circumstances, the provincial court
judge placed the appellant on probation and imposed a residential restriction,
that is a requirement that he live at the Saskatoon Training Residence.  The
appellant was, at the time of sentencing, represented by counsel and at the
time the sentence was imposed, impliedly, if not expressly, agreed or at the very least acquiesced to the terms and
conditions of the probation order imposed by the provincial court judge. 
Specifically he agreed or acquiesced in the residency requirement.  His living
voluntarily at the Saskatoon Training Residence has a strong element of choice
in the sense that he could have chosen to have the judge sentence him instead
of suspending the passing of sentence.  Imprisonment carries with it a complete
lack of choice.  There must be an involuntary element to the confinement before
it can be said to be a restraint on the personal liberty or freedom of the
appellant. 

 

 

41                              
In the case of a conditional sentence, a regime uniquely suited to the
offender is put in place by the terms of the order under which the conditional
sentence is imposed.  It is tailored to take into account the needs of the
offender and those of the community into which he will need to be reintegrated.  In my view, this includes
taking full advantage of all community-based
services, including residential programs, and including residential programs
that may have a compulsory residential element, as long as the programs serve
the ends expressed in s. 718  of the Criminal Code .  When properly viewed
as an alternative to incarceration as previously defined, conditional sentences
do not preclude the resort to community-based facilities, some of which are
residential, simply because they have a custodial aspect.  Mental health facilities exist within our
communities, and some of them offer residential programs which can clearly be
an optional condition under s. 742.3(2) (f).  The intent of s. 742.1  is
to invite courts to draw on all available services in the community to act as
an alternative to imprisonment in penal institutions. 

 








42                              
As the present case illustrates, a person may be confined in a locked
secure  mental health facility under various legal provisions.  The person may
have been the subject of a civil committal under the provisions of an
applicable provincial mental health legislation, he or she may have been
remanded by a criminal court for assessment, or he or she may have entered such
programs voluntarily.  The person may
be there as part of the terms of a probation order, or under conditions set out
by the National Parole Board.  As indicated earlier, a person may also be there
serving a term of imprisonment, if that part of the hospital has been
designated a penitentiary within the meaning of the Corrections and
Conditional Release Act .  In my view, the person may also be there under a condition of a conditional sentence,
at least one to which he or she consented. 

 

43                              
I stress that in this case the accused not only agreed to but advocated the terms that were imposed
upon him by the sentencing judge, which included his confinement in a locked
mental health institution.  Whether a lock-up in a mental institution for two
years against the will of an accused would have
any therapeutic value, and  whether it would be permissible under the Code, should be left for another
day. 

 








44                              
Referring to the unproclaimed hospital orders provisions of Bill C-41, the respondent submits that the
legislative history of that bill reveals that Parliament did not intend s.
742.3(2) to empower sentencing judges to “allow a person to, in effect, be
sentenced to a mental hospital” (respondent’s factum, at para. 52).  The respondent
relies on the fact that provisions were included in  Bill C-41 (ss. 747-747.8, 
reproduced in the appendix) that, it claims, dealt specifically with the
type of sentencing order made by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J., and that these
provisions were never proclaimed.  I do not agree.  Had these provisions been
enacted, I do not believe that they would have had any bearing on the
availability of residential treatment in a psychiatric facility under the terms of a conditional sentence.  Section
747.1(1), for example, would have empowered a court to order that “an offender be detained in a treatment
facility as the initial part of a sentence of imprisonment [i.e., not a
conditional sentence]” (emphasis added).  Further, s. 747.1(1) would limit a
court’s authority to make such  orders to situations where the offender’s mental disorder was in an “acute phase”, such that “immediate
treatment” was “urgently required to prevent further significant deterioration”
or “to prevent the offender from causing serious bodily harm to any person”. 
As well, “a single period of treatment” could not exceed 60 days (s. 747.1(2)).

 

45                              
As these prerequisites and
limits reveal, the hospital orders
provisions were designed to prepare an
offender, for whom a conditional sentence was inappropriate, for a lengthy stay
in a penitentiary, and not to realize some or all of the restorative justice
objectives which underlie and inform the conditional sentence regime.  

 

46                              
Finally, the respondent argues
that the use of conditional sentences to confine persons to psychiatric
hospitals will have serious resource implications for the provinces.  There is
nothing in the material before us, in which only the Alberta Mental Health
Board intervened, to suggest that the interpretation given by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. to ss.
742.1 and 742.3 of the Code
would create a non-manageable drain on resources.  If successful, the
alternative measures to incarceration will reduce the rate at which offenders
are imprisoned and particularly will
reduce the rate of incarceration in provincial
correctional facilities where sentences under two years are served, obviously creating a substantial saving of public
funds.  

 

47                              
In Proulx, supra,
this Court directed that sentencing judges consider the available resources
in the community in which the sentence is to be served before imposing
conditions that draw on community resources. 
This is what Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. did in this case.

 

 

VI.  Conclusion

 








48                              
I would allow the appeal and
restore the sentence imposed by the trial judge.  This was a legal and fit
sentence and the one that best served the objectives of sentencing expressed in
s. 718  of the Criminal Code .  Moreover, it was the sentence that best
ensured that the dangerousness of the appellant would be curtailed for the
longest period of time, with both
short-term and long-term benefits to the community at large.

I.  Introduction

 








49                              
The introduction of the conditional sentence in
1996 allows for certain offenders who would normally have been sentenced to
prison to serve their sentences in the community.  The central issue in this
case is whether the existing conditional sentencing scheme permits a
sentencing judge to impose a conditional sentence to be served in a locked
psychiatric institution.  The more narrow issue to be decided is whether the
preconditions at s. 742.1  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
for imposing a conditional sentence, were met in the circumstances of this
case.  I caution at the outset that, in attempting to resolve these issues, the
question is not whether we would agree with the sentencing judge that the
appellant is better off receiving psychiatric care in a locked psychiatric ward
than in prison but whether such a condition can even form the basis of a
conditional sentencing order.

 

50                              
I have concluded that the Court of Appeal was correct in overturning the
conditional sentence in this case.  The conditional sentence was inappropriate
both because the precondition that the appellant not endanger the safety of the
community was not satisfied and because the conditional sentencing regime does
not contemplate serving a sentence in a locked psychiatric unit of a hospital.

 

II.  Factual
Background

 








51                              
The appellant is a mentally ill offender who constructed elaborate
explosive devices which could have caused mass destruction to property, serious
injury to persons or death.  On July 20, 1998, the appellant stated to a
co-worker at Edmonton’s Department of Transportation that he had thought about
blowing up a dog to calm himself.  The next day, while apologizing to the
co-worker, the appellant pulled a gym bag from his car to show the co-worker
its contents.  Inside the bag was a jar filled with fluid and wires which the
co-worker believed to be a bomb.  The following day, the appellant was absent
from work and the police were notified.

 

52                              
The police went to the appellant’s apartment and found it in disarray
with PVC pipes, electrical components, wires and transistors in the living room
and in the kitchen.  A search warrant was obtained and the police found
electrical components, systems, tools and diagnostic equipment, as well as
literature pertaining to the construction and preparation of explosive devices,
on the Oklahoma City bombing and on the Waco, Texas armed standoff.  The police
also found two pipe bombs, two unused detonators, one used detonator and enough
ammonia nitrate to damage the appellant’s apartment and apartments two to three
stories above and two or three away to the sides of his apartment.  A suicide
bomb, capable of destroying the vehicle and injuring people and damaging
property within a 75-metre radius, was also found in the appellant’s vehicle
along with extremely unstable explosive substances and toxic chemicals.  The
sole requirement for the suicide bomb to deploy was the movement of a switch by
the operator or a victim.  All persons in the surrounding area would have been
killed or seriously injured.

 

53                              
The appellant was charged with two offences:  unlawful possession of an
explosive substance contrary to s. 100(12) of the Code, and unlawful
possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary to
s. 87 of the Code.  The appellant entered a guilty plea to both
charges.  He was held in a secured psychiatric unit of the Alberta Hospital
Edmonton (the “Alberta Hospital”) while awaiting sentencing.

 








54                              
At the sentencing hearing, it was revealed that the appellant was
subject to a prohibition order at the time these offences were committed,
prohibiting him from possessing firearms, ammunition and explosives because of
a 1993 incident where he brought a firearm to work with the intent of shooting
a co-worker.  He was charged under s. 87 of the Code and received a
conditional discharge, three years’ probation, and a 10-year firearms
prohibition.  In January 1998, the appellant had also injured his finger while
building a detonator device.

 

55                              
At the sentencing hearing, the appellant’s attending physician testified
that the appellant suffers from depression and a personality disorder with
obsessive compulsive and paranoid features.  The medical evidence also
established that the appellant was engaged in dangerous activity in the past
even while undergoing treatment and that he had previously been an in-patient
at the Alberta Hospital.  Pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Code, Judge
Chrumka, of the Alberta Provincial Court, ordered a conditional sentence of two
years less a day to be served in a locked psychiatric treatment unit of the
Alberta Hospital until a consensus was reached among psychiatrists that the
appellant could be transferred out of the locked unit.  The Court of Appeal
substituted a sentence of three years in a penitentiary, which it reduced to
two years less a day in recognition of the time the appellant had already spent
in custody.  It also ordered a three-year probation period subject to
substantially the same terms and conditions imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J.

 

56                              
The appellant has already served eight months of the penitentiary
sentence ordered by the Court of Appeal and is currently on parole.  One of the
conditions of his parole order is that he reside at the psychiatric unit of the
Alberta Hospital where his movements will be tightly controlled.

IV.  Judicial
History

 

A.  Alberta
Provincial Court

 

58                              
Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. held that a conditional sentence was suitable on
the basis that the appellant’s behaviour was linked primarily to his mental
illness.  He concluded that the appellant would not pose a danger to the
community, provided the term “community” was defined as the secure psychiatric
unit of the Alberta Hospital.  He imposed a conditional sentence of two years
less a day, to which he attached the following conditions:

-      that the community be defined as the
Alberta Hospital;








 

-      that the appellant report immediately to
the Director of Forensic Services or his or her deputy at the Alberta Hospital;

 

-      that he remain within the jurisdiction of
the court, absent written permission from the court or his supervisor to leave
the jurisdiction;

 

-      that he notify the court or his supervisor
of any change in address or employment;

 

-      that he remain in a locked, secure
psychiatric treatment unit of the Alberta Hospital until a consensus of
psychiatric professionals decides to transfer him from the locked unit;

 

-      if transferred from the locked unit of the
Alberta Hospital, that he reside at such treatment facility as directed by Dr.
Tweddle, his attending physician, or her designate or successor;

 

-      that he comply with all treatment programs
and take all medications prescribed by Dr. Tweddle, or her designate or
successor;

 

-      that he abstain from consuming alcohol or
other intoxicating substances; and

 

-      that he abstain from possessing firearms,
ammunition or explosive substances.

 








59                              
Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. also ordered that the appellant be placed on three
years’ probation following the completion of his conditional sentence, to which
he attached a number of conditions, including:

 

-      that he pursue any treatment, counselling
or therapy as directed by his probation officer, including attendance at
Forensic Assessment;

 

-      that he reside at any address directed by
Dr. Tweddle or her designate or successor if allowed to leave the locked unit;

 

-      that he refrain from the use of alcohol and
intoxicating substances; and

 

-      with the appellant’s consent, Chrumka Prov.
Ct. J. imposed a lifetime prohibition against the possession of any firearms,
ammunition or explosive substances.

 

 

 

 

 

 

B.  Alberta
Court of Appeal (1999), 232 A.R. 289

 

(a)  Nash J.A. (Cairns and O’Leary JJ.A. concurring)

 








60                              
Nash J.A. held that the sentencing judge erred in granting a conditional
sentence since the condition precedent, that the appellant not endanger the
safety of the community, had not been met.  Nash J.A. cited the testimony of
two forensic psychiatrists, Dr. Singh and Dr. Tweddle, who described the
appellant as depressed, delusional, obsessive compulsive, angry, blaming,
vengeful, lacking in social restraint, preoccupied with death, with violent
thoughts of destruction and persecution, and with deeply ingrained personality
difficulties.  Dr. Singh testified that the appellant’s mental illness coupled
with his interest in explosives do not bode well for future public safety.  Dr.
Tweddle testified that the appellant had “operationalized” fantasies of being
powerful and this made him potentially dangerous.  She admitted that prior
attempts at treating the appellant had failed and that his behaviour had
escalated.  Nash J.A. also referred to the opinion of a third doctor, Dr.
Cadsky, who maintained that the appellant posed a danger whether treated or
not, and that his condition had deteriorated while undergoing treatment.

 

61                              
Nash J.A. noted that there was evidence of the
appellant’s non-compliance with a past court order, that the
appellant had been undergoing psychiatric treatment while he was acquiring his
arsenal of explosives, and that treatment was also available in a prison
setting.  Finding that all psychiatric witnesses had testified that the
appellant posed a danger to the public, Nash J.A. concluded
that the appellant was potentially very dangerous and that the best that could
be predicted was that, with treatment, he might become less so.  For
this reason, the safety condition precedent was not satisfied and a conditional
sentence was not an available sentence.  The Court of Appeal conveyed this as
follows, at p. 294:

 

The evidence either viva voce or by way of reports all confirm
unequivocally that [the appellant] is an extreme danger to the community.  The
criminal justice system must balance the treatment of an accused with the
protection of the public.  However, the desire to rehabilitate the accused must
not be allowed to distort the sentencing process.

 








(b)  O’Leary J.A. (Cairns and Nash JJ.A
concurring), on the substituted

sentence

 

62                              
In determining an appropriate sentence, O’Leary J.A. noted the following
aggravating factors:  the quantity, variety and potential destructive capacity
of the explosives; the appellant’s apparent purpose for having the explosives;
the evidence that the appellant had progressed to an “operational stage”; the
danger of the material he possessed; his accumulation of explosive materials
over a long period of time, during which he was subject to a firearms
prohibition and undergoing psychiatric treatment; and his dangerousness, as
testified to by expert witnesses.

 

63                              
O’Leary J.A. then considered the following mitigating factors:  a timely
guilty plea; cooperation with authorities; willingness to undergo treatment;
willingness to abide by a probation order and the time he had already spent in
custody.  He held that a three-year term of incarceration would be appropriate,
but that this should be reduced because of the time that the appellant had
already spent in the locked unit.  He accordingly imposed a sentence of two
years less a day and recommended Fort Saskatchewan Provincial Correctional
Institute so that the appellant could access treatment opportunities and
facilities with which he was already familiar.  In addition, he imposed a
three-year term of probation subject to the same terms enunciated by Chrumka
Prov. Ct. J., adding that the appellant must reside in a place specified by Dr.
Tweddle and that he must voluntarily consent to a search of his person,
vehicle, residence or place of occupation on reasonable suspicion by police
that he has in his possession any firearms, explosives or ammunition.

 

V.  Issues

 








64                              
The following are the central issues to be determined for the
disposition of this appeal:

 

A.   Did the trial judge err in finding that the
precondition was met that the appellant serving his sentence in the community
“would not endanger the safety of the community” as it appears at s. 742.1  of
the Criminal Code ?

B.    Does the conditional sentencing regime
contemplate serving a sentence in a locked psychiatric unit of a hospital as a
condition of the sentence?

 

VI.  Analysis

 

A.  Would
the Appellant Serving His Sentence in the Community Endanger the Safety of

      the
Community?

 

1.  Preconditions for the Imposition of a Conditional Sentence

 

65                              
Subsequent to the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in the case at
bar, this Court released its reasons in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5.  Neither Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. nor the Court of Appeal had
the benefit of Proulx when they considered the new conditional
sentencing scheme.  I note at the outset of these reasons that, notwithstanding
the parties’ submissions, I prefer to decide this case not on a so-called
narrow or broad definition of the term “community”, but rather on the
principles laid down by this Court in Proulx as well as on the
philosophy behind the enactment of the conditional sentencing scheme.

 

66                              
Section 742.1 of the Code lists the following four criteria to be
considered before imposing a conditional sentence (see Proulx, at para.
46):








 

(1) the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable
by a minimum term of imprisonment;

 

(2) the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two
years;

 

(3) the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender
serving the sentence in the community; and

 

(4) a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental
purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718  to 718.2 .

 

67                              
At para. 47 of Proulx, the first three of the above criteria are
described as prerequisites to whether or not a conditional sentence is even
possible in the circumstances.  The central point of contention between the
appellant and the respondent relates to the third criterion of safety to the
community, which is a sine qua non to the assessment of whether a
conditional sentence would be a fit and proper sanction in the circumstances. 
I now turn to the appropriate test in determining whether this condition has
been met.

 

2.  Test Applicable to Evaluating Danger to the Safety of the
Community

 

68                              
While certain offenders who would normally have been sentenced to prison
may now serve their sentences in the community, it must be emphasized that the
conditional sentence is available only to that “subclass of
non-dangerous offenders” who would have been sentenced to a term of
incarceration of less than two years for offences with no minimum term of
imprisonment (Proulx, at paras. 12, 30 and 87).

 








69                              
In assessing whether the appellant is a danger to the community, the
Court must consider the following two factors outlined in Proulx, at
para. 69:  (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and (2) the gravity of
the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence.  I will examine these
factors in turn, ultimately concluding that this condition precedent, entitling
the appellant to a conditional sentence, has not been satisfied.

 

(a)  Risk of Re-offending

 

70                              
When considering whether there is a risk of re-offence, one must take
into consideration, inter alia, the nature of the offence, the relevant
circumstances surrounding the offence, the profile of the accused, whether the
sentence will work, the offender’s conduct following the commission of the
offence, whether the offender has previously complied with court orders,
whether the offender has a criminal record, and the danger the accused
represents for the community (R. v. Brady (1998), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 504
(Alta. C.A.), at paras. 117-27; Proulx, at para. 70; R. v. Maheu
(1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 361 (Que. C.A.), at p. 374).

 

71                              
In addition, Lamer C.J. states in Proulx that the conditions
attached to the sentence should be considered when weighing the risk of
re-offence.  He conveys this as follows, at para. 72:

 

The risk of re‑offence should also be
assessed in light of the conditions attached to the sentence.  Where
an offender might pose some risk of endangering the safety of the community, it
is possible that this risk be reduced to a minimal one by the imposition of
appropriate conditions to the sentence. . . .  For example, a judge
may wish to impose a conditional sentence with a treatment order on an offender
with a drug addiction, notwithstanding the fact that the offender has a lengthy
criminal record linked to this addiction, provided the judge is confident that
there is a good chance of rehabilitation and that the level of supervision will
be sufficient to ensure that the offender complies with the sentence.

 








72                              
The above passage suggests that the risk of re-offence should be
determined in light of the conditions imposed.  In my opinion, taking this
approach to the risk determination beyond what was intended would result in a
circular process whereby a sentencing judge would endeavour to come up with a
condition incompatible with the conditional sentencing regime prior to
determining whether the criterion that the appellant not endanger the safety of
the community has been satisfied.  It is my belief that this passage was not
meant to allow the sentencing judge to craft any possible condition under which
there would no longer be a danger to the community.  Since I will be dealing
with this in the next section of these reasons, where I hold that sentencing an
offender to a locked psychiatric ward is not a condition envisaged under the
conditional sentencing scheme, I will accept for the purposes of this part of
the analysis that all of the conditions imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. were to
be considered when assessing the risk of re-offence.  Nevertheless, for the
reasons that follow, I conclude that, even accepting the conditions he imposed,
Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. erred in his determination that the appellant no longer
posed a danger to the community.

 

73                              
The intervener Alberta Mental Health Board (“AMHB”) asserts that
assessing the risk posed by mentally ill offenders, without reference to their
mental health status or the availability of supports, has the potential to seriously
disadvantage this group on the basis of perceived risk, stigma and stereotype. 
I would agree with the intervener that the offender’s mental state must be
considered as well as available supervision and programs in the community. 
However, contrary to the AMHB, I do not think that the danger posed by Mr.
Knoblauch was overestimated in this case on the basis of perceived risk or
stigma or without considering available support services.  On the contrary, the
medical evidence in this case is undisputed that the appellant poses a very
real danger to the public.








 

74                              
In assessing the risk of re-offence in this case, the appellant’s
history of weapons offences must be considered.  The record demonstrates that
the appellant was already subject to a prohibition from possessing firearms,
ammunition and explosives at the time that he committed the offences in
question.  Nevertheless, by the time the appellant was apprehended, he had
amassed a large arsenal of highly volatile explosives capable of injuring many
people and leading to substantial property damage.  The medical evidence also
establishes that the appellant has been engaged in dangerous activity in the
past even while undergoing treatment.  The appellant had previously been an
in-patient at the Alberta Hospital, although he was never in the psychiatric
unit for a lengthy period of time.

 

75                              
Dr. Tweddle testified that, even with treatment, the appellant would
always remain potentially dangerous due to his fragile personality.  Dr. Singh
described the appellant as:

 

. . . an angry, blaming, vengeful person, one who dwells on
the felt transgressions of others and one who lacks the usual social
restraints.  This unfortunate combination in conjunction with a well
established interest in and experience with explosives does not bode well for
future public safety.

 

76                              
Unfortunately, whether the appellant is sentenced to a prison term or
treated at a psychiatric hospital, he will likely remain a danger even when his
sentence is complete.  His condition previously deteriorated while he was
undergoing treatment and his dangerous behaviour escalated.  Based on the
psychiatric expert reports and testimonies, the most that can be said about the
appellant is that with treatment he may pose “less of a danger”.

 








77                              
While it is important to consider that, during the term of his
conditional sentence, the appellant would be subject to supervision, in my
opinion, despite such supervision and the availability of programs, the
evidence points to a risk of re-offending.  Moreover, when considering all of
the conditions imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J., it must be emphasized that the
sentence order did not ensure that the appellant remained under maximum
security at the Alberta Hospital throughout the entire period of his sentence. 
Rather, the sentence imposed contemplated release into the general community. 
Indeed, the appellant was to reside in a locked psychiatric treatment unit of
the Alberta Hospital until a consensus was reached among psychiatrists that the
appellant could be transferred out of the locked unit and into other treatment
facilities.  Implicit in Chrumka Prov. Ct. J.’s sentence was therefore a
delegation to the appellant’s physicians to decide when and under what
conditions the appellant would be released from the locked psychiatric ward.  There was no evidence regarding the level of security at those
other facilities.  In fact, the appellant tendered no evidence regarding the
security of these other treatment facilities, the extent to which they may
afford contact with members of the public, or how long a period the appellant
would remain in the locked unit prior to being released to these other
facilities.  There is thus no way of ensuring that there would not be a risk of
re-offence once the appellant was released.  Dr. Cadsky testified that,
although this had not been the appellant’s style in the past, if the appellant
were in the community, it is possible that he might re-offend before Dr. Cadsky
would have an opportunity to intervene.  Thus, I am unable to accept the
appellant and the AMHB’s submissions that the appellant has been disadvantaged
solely on the basis of perceived risk, stigma or stereotype.  The evidence in
this case demonstrates, to the contrary, that the risk is not “perceived” at
all but very real.

 








78                              
Even if I were to accept, taking into account the condition that the
appellant was required to reside in a locked and secure psychiatric ward, that
the first prong of the “dangerousness” test has been passed in that the risk of
re-offence is only minimal, the gravity of the potential harm that would ensue
if the appellant were to re-offend could preclude a conditional sentence in and
of itself.  In certain cases, even a minimal risk of re-offending will be
offset by the gravity of the damage that might ensue in the event of a
re-offence (Proulx, at para. 69).  At this second stage in
evaluating dangerousness, I see another insurmountable impediment to holding
that the safety of the community would not be endangered by allowing the appellant
to serve a conditional sentence.

 

(b)  The Gravity of the Damage in the Event of Re-offence

 

79                              
The two stages for determining dangerousness are analytically
separated.  Once the judge finds that the risk of recidivism is minimal, the
second factor to consider is the gravity of the potential damage in the event
of re-offence (Proulx, at para. 74).  Where the
offender represents an extreme danger to the physical or psychological safety
of persons, a conditional sentence is not appropriate.  As professed by Lamer
C.J. in Proulx, at para. 74, “[p]articularly in the case of violent
offenders, a small risk of very harmful future crime may well warrant a
conclusion that the prerequisite [that the safety of the community would not be
endangered] is not met”.  Thus, even with a minimal risk of re-offence,
potentially very serious consequences may bar the imposition of a conditional
sentence.  In my opinion, this is one of those cases.








80                              
In determining which offenders should benefit from the conditional
sentence regime, one must stress that the criterion that serving the sentence
in the community would not endanger the safety of the community is a condition
precedent to the imposition of a conditional sentence rather than a continuing
and overarching consideration in the process of determining whether a
conditional sentence is appropriate (Proulx, at para.
65).  Consequently, no matter how effective a conditional sentence might
be over time and no matter how important the goals of rehabilitation and reintegration,
the possibility that an offender might explode a bomb with very grave
consequences might bar any possibility of such a sentence.  This is consistent
with Parliament’s intention that the conditional sentence be used as an
alternative for less serious and non-dangerous offenders.

 

81                              
Keeping in mind the above principles and that the conditional
sentence is reserved solely for a “subclass of non-dangerous offenders”, the
record demonstrates that the potential harm that could be inflicted should the
appellant re-offend would be devastating.  The appellant had in his vehicle and
in his apartment an arsenal capable of causing mass destruction to property,
death and serious injury to persons in the area indiscriminately.  The device
found in the appellant’s vehicle was described as presenting greater safety
concerns for the Edmonton bomb unit than the unit had previously experienced. 
When one considers that the materials in the appellant’s car
were equivalent to 13 percent of the materials used in the Oklahoma City
bombing, it is hard to conceive of the damage in the event of re-offence as
anything but grave.

 

82                              
Thus, even if the risk of re-offence was minimal, the gravity of the
damage in the event of a re-offence is extreme.  The appellant could not refute
the fact that there is at least a small risk of very harmful future crime in
this case.  For this reason, I conclude that, even taking into account the
conditions of the sentence, the appellant continues to represent a danger to
the safety of the community.

 

3.  Definition of “Community”








 

83                              
There is one final issue which should be addressed before
proceeding to the broader issue of whether a conditional sentence may be served
in a locked psychiatric institution.  There has been much discussion in this
case over the proper construction of the word “community” as it relates to
establishing the prerequisite that a conditional sentence not endanger the
“safety of the community” in s. 742.1 of the Code.  The
appellant argues that the term “community” in s. 742.1  refers to the location
in which a sentence is served and is thus limited in this case to the hospital
setting.  By contrast, the respondent submits that the “community” must be
defined broadly as the public at large.

 

84                              
Section 742.1 provides no definition for the term “community”. 
While the Court’s recent decision in Proulx undertakes a comprehensive
examination of the conditional sentencing scheme and provides guidance as to
its interpretation, the Court’s reasons in Proulx do not explicitly
signal whether the “community” in s. 742.1  includes a hospital or other
psychiatric institution.  As I stated above, I prefer not to reach my decision
in this case on rules of statutory interpretation and on whether one should
adopt a so-called “narrow” or “broad” definition of the term community. 
Nevertheless, there are several comments I wish to make in this regard.

 








85                              
I believe that both the parties and Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. confuse  the
uses of the word “community” in s.742.1  by attributing different meanings to
the same term.  Section 742.1  speaks of the offender “serving the
sentence in the community”, of the court being satisfied that he would not
“endanger the safety of the community”, and of the court imposing conditions
“for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community”. 
The term is therefore used in relation to establishing “safety of the
community”, as well as noting that a conditional sentence is a sentence “served
in the community”.  Although this word is used in different contexts both
within s.742.1  as well as within other sections of the Code, I do not
believe it is necessary or wise to attribute different meanings to this same
term.

 

86                              
In my opinion, neither the appellant nor the respondent are
entirely correct in their submissions on this issue of the proper construction
of the term “community”.  First, I stress that I accept the
appellant’s assertion that persons in psychiatric hospitals continue to be
members of the “community”.  However, I am unable to accept the appellant’s
arguments that the term “community” should be limited to that segment of the
community when assessing dangerousness to the community.  On the contrary,
“community” in s. 742.1  must be interpreted as also including the general
public.  A purposeful and contextual interpretation of the word “community” in
the safety context of s. 742.1  reveals Parliament’s intent that the term should
be interpreted broadly.  Moreover, an examination of other Criminal Code 
provisions relating to safety supports the view that safety concerns are placed
in the broadest, most public context.  For example, additional conditions of a
probation order, at s. 732.1(3) (h), include “such other reasonable
conditions as the court considers desirable . . . for protecting
society and for facilitating the offender’s successful reintegration into the
community”.  In this context, it would be absurd to limit the term “community”
to the community in which the sentence is served.  If community referred to the
context in which the sentence was served, there would be no point or need for
reintegration.

 








87                              
We must also consider together the English and French versions of the
legislation.  In French, the legislature used the term “collectivité”,
which corresponds in Le Nouveau Petit Robert to “communauté, groupe,
société”.  By definition, “collectivité” does not refer to a
narrowly defined community, such as an institution.  It would be illogical to
refer to “la collectivité de l’hôpital”, for example.  Principles of
statutory interpretation dictate that, where the versions of bilingual
legislation do not necessarily have the same meaning, they should be reconciled
and the meaning that is shared by both should be adopted (Driedger on the
Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), by R. Sullivan, at p. 220).  In
this case, only a definition of “community” that is not restricted to the
psychiatric unit would be consistent with both the French and English versions
of the legislation.

 

88                              
One can also look to Part XX.1 of the Code and to the s. 753(1)
dangerous offender provision which are focussed primarily on the goal of
protecting the public.  In effect, a review of the statutory scheme on
sentencing points to a broad interpretation of “community”, equating it with
the public at large.  Section 718 of the Code makes this abundantly
clear.  The principles of sentencing include, inter alia:  providing
reparations for harm done to victims or to the community, promoting a sense of
responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims
and to the community.  In this context, it would be nonsensical to interpret
“community” as the community in which the conditional sentence is to be
served.  That particular community would not necessarily have been harmed by
the offender’s acts.  I recognize the unfortunate reality that persons in need
of mental health support are often the subject of stereotypes and biassed
perceptions.  I disagree, however, that the best means of dealing with these
attitudes is to limit the scope of their “community”.  If anything, limiting
the scope of the community of mentally disordered persons serves to further
isolate and disempower these individuals.

89                              
Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. seems to have confused the proper approach for
determining whether the safety of the community would be endangered if the
appellant was to serve his sentence in the community.  This is evident from the
following exchange where he questioned Crown counsel about the safety of the
“public” within the penitentiary if the appellant was sentenced to
incarceration:








 

The Court:  What of the public safety within penitentiaries, if
he’s sent to the penitentiary?

 

Ms. Hughson:  While he’s within the penitentiary?

 

The Court:  Members of the penitentiary are public.

 

Ms. Hughson:  Oh.

 

The Court:  They are part of the public, they have to be
protected.  What is there — how is their safety going to be resolved the same
as yours and mine if he’s released into our community rather than to the prison
penitentiary community?

 

The above
passage demonstrates that the sentencing judge considered those in the prison
setting to be part of the public.  In so doing, he acknowledged that
“community” also includes the public.  However, the whole conditional
sentencing regime posits community versus prisons and a sentencing judge should
not be considering the safety of those in prison when determining whether the
conditions precedent for the imposition of a conditional sentence have been
met.  As I stated earlier, the question to be addressed in this case is not whether
the appellant and the public would be better off if the appellant’s sentence is
served in a hospital, but whether the conditions for the imposition of a
conditional sentence have been satisfied in the circumstances of this case.

 








90                              
Thus, while I would not deny that the hospital is also a part of our
community, I cannot conclude that one can look solely to the community where
the offender is to reside when determining whether the condition precedent is
satisfied.  In my view, the community with which a sentencing judge must be
concerned consists of all persons who could be at risk of being harmed by the
offender.  In light of the Proulx decision, I conclude that if there is
a danger to any person by the offender serving the sentence in the community,
whether that person be a resident of the psychiatric hospital or in the public
at large, then a conditional sentence should not be imposed.

 

91                              
Moreover, as explained above, the facts in the case at bar do not
support a definition of “community” that is limited to the psychiatric unit of
the Alberta Hospital.  In fact, the order imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J.
contemplated the appellant’s release into the general community upon a
consensus of his psychiatrists to transfer him out of the locked unit.  There
was thus a delegation to the appellant’s physicians to decide when and under
what conditions the appellant would be released into the community “at large”. 
At para. 33 of his factum, the appellant admits that the conditions of his
sentence allow for “controlled contact” with the general public.  Thus, the
conditions imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. did anticipate that the offender
would, at some undetermined period, have broad and independent contact with the
community at large.  Therefore, factually, the “community” that the sentencing
judge would be responsible for having in mind in his safety assessment would
include both those persons residing in the psychiatric ward
and those of the general public.

 

92                              
Once we accept that the appellant may be released into the
general public at any time upon consensus of his physicians, the risk of
re-offence coupled with the gravity of the damage in the event of re-offence
leads to the inevitable conclusion that the appellant is not one of that
subclass of offenders who should benefit from a conditional sentence.  It is clear that there is at least a risk of serious danger to the
community that could result from the appellant serving a conditional sentence
in this case.

4.  Conclusion on the Condition that the Safety of
the Community Not Be

      Endangered

 








93                              
We must keep in mind that it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to modify the analysis of the first three preconditions for a
conditional sentence at s. 742.1  on the basis of sentencing principles such as
rehabilitation and reintegration which have yet to come into full play at this
stage.  As Lamer C.J. stated in Proulx, at para. 65, “[i]t is only once
the judge is satisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered
. . . that he or she can examine whether a conditional sentence
‘would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing
set out in sections 718  to 718.2 ’”.  Thus, notwithstanding the
fact that several experts have testified that the appellant’s “dangerousness”
has a greater likelihood of being reduced following treatment, this does not
satisfy the statutory precondition that the community would not be endangered. 
Even taking into account the conditions of the sentence, the safety condition
has not been met.

 

94                              
While I have concluded that the appellant represents a danger to the
community and was thus not entitled to a conditional sentence, I nevertheless
turn to what I consider the broader and more critical issue in this appeal,
namely, whether confining an offender to a locked psychiatric institution is in
conformity with the conditional sentence scheme in the first place.  I note
that since the Alberta Court of Appeal concluded that the appellant never passed
the condition that he would not endanger the safety of the community, it did
not go on to consider this broader question.

 

 

 

B.  Does
the Conditional Sentencing Regime Contemplate Serving a Sentence in a

     
Locked Psychiatric Unit as a Condition of the Sentence?

 








1.  Optional Conditions of a Conditional Sentence Order

 

95                              
In addition to the compulsory conditions a sentencing judge is required
to impose under a conditional sentence order, pursuant to s. 742.3(2) of the Code
the sentencing judge may impose optional conditions.  Of particular relevance
to this appeal are ss. 742.3(2)(e) and (f), which provide as
follows:

 

742.3  . . .

 

(2)  The court may prescribe, as additional
conditions of a conditional sentence order, that the offender do one or more of
the following:

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(e)  attend a treatment program approved by the province; and

 

(f)  comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court
considers desirable . . . for securing the good conduct of the
offender and for preventing a repetition by the offender of the same offence or
the commission of other offences.

 








96                              
Even if one were to conclude that the appellant does not
represent a danger to the community, one question which must be addressed is
whether locking up an offender in a psychiatric unit of a hospital constitutes
a reasonable condition under the above provisions.  The respondent contends
that a conditional sentence which confines an offender to a psychiatric
institution is distinct from a treatment order envisioned at s. 742.3(2)(e). 
The respondent also submits that s. 742.3(2)(f) cannot be used to
confine an individual to a psychiatric hospital.  I agree with the respondent. 
In addressing these arguments, it is important to consider the legislative
scheme as a whole as well as its legislative history.  As professed by this
Court in Proulx, at para. 13, it is important to situate the conditional
sentence in the broader context of the comprehensive sentencing reforms enacted
in the Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other Acts in
consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill C-41”).
 In my view, it is when attempting to do so that it becomes
clear that it was not Parliament’s intention that the conditional sentence be
used as it has been by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. in this case.

 

2.  Distinction Between Institutional and
Non-Institutional Sentences

 

97                              
Writing for the Court in Proulx, Lamer C.J. highlights a critical
distinction between a prison sentence and a conditional sentence, namely, that
a conditional sentence is not one where an offender is confined to an
institution (at para. 40):

 

Although a conditional sentence is by statutory
definition a sentence of imprisonment, this Court, in R. v. Shropshire,
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 21, recognized that there “is a very significant
difference between being behind bars and functioning within society while on
conditional release”. . . .  These comments are equally applicable to
the conditional sentence.  Indeed, offenders serving a conditional sentence
in the community are only partially deprived of their freedom.  Even if their
liberty is restricted by the conditions attached to their sentence, they are
not confined to an institution and they can continue to attend to their normal
employment or educational endeavours.  They are not deprived of their private
life to the same extent.  Nor are they subject to a regimented schedule or an
institutional diet.  [Emphasis added.]

 

While the
conditional sentence may incorporate some restrictions on free movement with
non-custodial measures (Proulx, at para. 22), clearly, the above passage
indicates that offenders serving a conditional sentence are not confined to an
institution but are meant to continue working, attending school, and
participating in treatment programs.

 








98                              
In Proulx, the Court suggests that treatment orders might be
appropriate even where the offender has a criminal record, provided the judge
is confident that there is a good possibility of rehabilitation and a
sufficient level of supervision (at para. 72).  Later, at para. 110, the Court
states that there are any number of conditions that a sentencing judge may
impose in order to rehabilitate an offender and the Court cites as examples
mandatory treatment orders such as psychological counselling and alcohol and
drug rehabilitation.  However, what the sentencing judge has imposed in the
case at bar is not a “treatment program” which is permitted under s. 742.3(2)(e)
but a type of custodial order in a locked psychiatric institution.  I recognize
that the psychiatric unit of a hospital is obviously not the same thing as a
prison.  Nevertheless, a sentence in such an institution shares many of the
attributes of a custodial sentence.  Like prison, an offender who is detained
in a hospital would be segregated from other members of the community in a
significant manner.  She would also be subject to severe restrictions on her
liberty and considerable intrusions on her privacy.  Restrictive conditions
such as house arrest and curfews may be the norm under conditional sentences (Proulx,
at para. 36).  However, there remains a distinction between custodial and
non-custodial sentences; see Proulx, at para. 43 and specially para. 56,
where Lamer C.J. speaks of non-custodial disposition in the context of the
conditional sentencing regime.  Even under house arrest, being confined to
one’s home allows greater freedom than confinement in an institution.  One can
hardly compare sleeping in one’s own bed, amidst one’s family, to confinement
in a locked psychiatric unit.  Clearly, confining an offender to this setting
prevents the offender from attending to his or her normal employment or
educational endeavours.

 








99                              
At para. 43 of Proulx, Lamer C.J. suggests that a parolee may
even be subject to stricter conditions than those under a conditional sentence
since the parolee can be assigned to a community-based residential facility
pursuant to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act  and Regulations. 
In making this statement, the Court clearly did not consider locking an
offender up in a psychiatric ward for an indefinite period of time to be a
reasonable condition of a conditional sentence since one can hardly consider
such a sentence less severe than assignment to a community-based residential
facility.  Moreover, pursuant to s. 742.3(2) (d), a sentencing judge is
restricted to ordering a maximum number of 240 hours of community service under
a conditional sentence.  I find it very difficult to comprehend that Parliament
would permit a sentencing judge to order complete confinement in a locked
psychiatric institution for two years or more but that a sentencing judge is
prevented from ordering 300 hours of community service.

 

100                          
In his discussion on the distinctions between incarceration and
conditional sentences, Lamer C.J. speaks of there being no way of reducing a
conditional sentence through parole since the offender is never actually
incarcerated under a conditional sentence and there is therefore no need for
him or her to be reintegrated into society (Proulx, at para. 43).  Thus,
separating an offender from society is not a relevant sentencing goal
with respect to conditional sentences since the prerequisite to a conditional
sentence is that the offender not pose a danger to the community (Proulx,
at para. 108).  Thus, Proulx makes it evident that conditional sentences
are meant as an alternative to incarceration and not as a sentence to
any type of locked institution subsequent to which the offender would have to
be reintegrated into the community.  Sentencing an offender to a locked
psychiatric facility for potentially a two-year period or longer contravenes
these principles.  Clearly, the sentence imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. was
not consistent with Proulx in this regard.  Indeed, the record in this
case is replete with references to a slow process of reintegration into the
community subsequent to the appellant being released from the psychiatric ward
which could occur at any time upon consensus of the appellant’s physicians.








101                          
This view of the philosophy behind the conditional sentencing regime is
buttressed by the recent appellate decisions which hold that “blended”
sentences, where the first part of the sentence is served in custody and the
latter part is a conditional sentence under supervision in the community, are
illegal and contrary to the underlying purpose of the conditional sentencing
regime; see, for example, R. v. Fisher (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 397 (C.A.); R.
v. Hirtle (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 419 (N.S.C.A.); R. v. Wey (1999),
142 C.C.C. (3d) 556 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Monkman (1998), 132 C.C.C. (3d)
89 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Maynard, [1999] M.J. No. 8 (QL) (C.A.); and R.
v. Kopf (1997), 6 C.R. (5th) 305 (Que. C.A.).  Notwithstanding that
sentencing judges in these cases sought to be creative in tailoring what they
considered appropriate sentences in the circumstances, the conditional sentence
is not meant to be served in custody which, in my opinion, includes
institutional settings such as being locked in a psychiatric ward.

 

102                          
A review of the legislative history of the conditional sentencing
provisions also suggests that Parliament intended that conditional sentences be
non-institutional in nature and that supervision in the community was not meant
to be equivalent to confinement in an institution.  In introducing the second
reading of the Bill amending the Criminal Code  to include the new Part
XXIII, then Minister of Justice Allan Rock stated (House of Commons Debates,
vol. 133, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., September 20, 1994, at p. 5873):

 

Where a court imposes a sentence
of imprisonment of less than two years and where the court is satisfied that
serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of
society as a whole, the court may order that the offender serve the sentence in
the community rather than in an institution.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

It seems to me that such an
approach would promote the protection of the public by seeking to separate the
most serious offenders from the community while providing that less serious
offenders can remain among other members of society. . . .  [Emphasis
added.]

 








103                          
Included within Bill C-41 were ss. 747 to 747.8, dealing with hospital
orders.  The Law Reform Commission had recommended that a system of hospital
orders be instituted to permit judges to order treatment in hospitals.  These
provisions were drafted as a result of lengthy study, consultation and
consensus.  Sections 747 to 747.8 empower a court to order an offender who
suffers from a mental disorder to serve up to 60 days of his prison sentence in
a hospital or other treatment facility.  The hospital order provisions were
enacted at the same time as the conditional sentencing scheme, but have not yet
come into force.  Similar provisions were included in the 1992 amendments to
the Criminal Code ; they too were never proclaimed into force.

 

104                          
These hospital order provisions included extensive guidelines and were
to be available only in very limited circumstances.  For example, detainment in
a treatment facility was limited to the initial part of a sentence of
imprisonment where the offender was “in an acute phase” of a mental disorder,
for a period not exceeding 60 days, where the court finds that immediate
treatment is “urgently required” to prevent further deterioration of the
offender’s condition, or to prevent him or her from causing serious physical
harm to another person.  In addition, no hospital order was to be made unless
the offender and the person in charge of the treatment facility consented to
the order.  The offender could also not be a dangerous offender pursuant to s.
753.  Initially, there was to be no 60-day limit to the hospital orders. 
However,

 

within the federal government concern was expressed that to start with
a full-blown scheme might be too ambitious, not only from the standpoint of
cost but also the availability of appropriate treatment facilities.  The
proposal was therefore pared down to one that would allow the court to order
treatment for a period not exceeding 60 days where, at the time of sentencing,
“the offender is suffering from a serious mental disorder that is not likely to
be substantially improved unless the offender receives treatment in a hospital
or other place, other than a prison . . .”  [Emphasis added.]

 








(E. A. Tollefson and B. Starkman, Mental Disorder in Criminal
Proceedings (1993), at pp. 143-44.)

 

105                          
While I recognize that these hospital order provisions were
limited in scope, this examination of what was to be included under the
hospital order provisions supports a more cautious approach to ordering
psychiatric treatment under the conditional sentencing regime.  Where the
legislature intended that a sentencing judge be permitted to confine an
offender to a treatment facility, it provided extensive guidelines, most
notably with respect to consent and duration of the order.  If s. 742.3(2)(f)
could be used to sentence a person to a psychiatric hospital, there would be
serious problems in the practical application and administration of such
conditional sentence orders.  As it stands, there are no guidelines as to how
such sentences might be implemented.  Many questions are left unanswered such
as the evidence required upon sentencing, whether the court may delegate
decisions regarding the gradual release of the offender to medical
professionals, and whether the consent of the offender and the institution are
required.  Thus, had s. 742.1  and the conditional sentence been intended as a
mechanism allowing for the detainment of offenders in treatment facilities,
especially for extended periods of time, one can only assume that similar guidelines
would have been set as well, especially since the Minister of Justice described
Bill C-41 as providing the courts with [translation] “clear guidelines”; see House of Commons Debates, supra,
at p. 5871, and Brady, supra, at para. 9.  It is also difficult
to understand why Parliament would want to limit the availability of hospital
detentions to persons convicted to terms of imprisonment of less than two years
if such detentions were meant to rehabilitate all offenders and to reduce
recidivism.

 








106                          
Section 718.2(e) of
the Code directs a court to consider all available sanctions other than
imprisonment, “with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal
offenders”.  Parliament has thus chosen to
single out aboriginal offenders for distinct sentencing treatment in order to
address the serious problem of over-incarceration of aboriginal offenders in
Canada (R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 44 and 50; R. v.
Wells, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, 2000 SCC 10, at para. 37).  While, unfortunately, the mentally ill, like aboriginals, are sadly
over-represented in the prison population, there are no similar provisions in
force which address the particular situation of the mentally ill.  A similar
conclusion can be reached from the following passage from Gladue, at para. 44:

 

There is also sentencing jurisprudence which holds, for example, that a
court must consider the unique circumstances of offenders who are battered
spouses, or who are mentally disabled.  Although the validity of the principles
expressed in this latter jurisprudence is unchallenged by the 1996 sentencing
reforms, one does not find reference to these principles in Part
XXIII.  If Part XXIII were indeed a codification of principles
regarding the appropriate method of sentencing different categories of
offenders, one would expect to find such references.  The wording of
s. 718.2(e), viewed in light of the absence of similar stipulations in
the remainder of Part XXIII, reveals that Parliament has chosen to single out
aboriginal offenders for particular attention.

 








107                          
If treatment of mentally ill offenders was to be “the” or at least “a”
paramount concern under the conditional sentencing scheme, there would, in my
opinion, at least have been some mention of this in the Criminal Code . 
In my view, where the legislature left open s. 742.3(2) (f) for the court
to impose “other reasonable conditions” as it considers desirable, it was not
meant to confer a discretion to impose any sentence whatsoever under the guise
of a conditional sentence.  Had Parliament intended to permit sentences such as
the one imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. in this case, it would not have left
such a void.  It would be illogical if the only portion of Bill C-41 that deals
specifically with mentally ill persons has not been proclaimed, yet the
proclaimed portions, which do not specifically deal with these individuals,
were meant to allow them to be sentenced to a hospital for up to five years
(two years plus three years’ probation).  If Parliament had intended that the
conditional sentence was to bring about an entirely different approach to the
sentencing of mentally ill offenders, it would have been far more specific and
far more clear.

 

3.  Usual Methods of Confining Offenders to Treatment Facilities

 

108                          
The usual methods of confining a person to a hospital in the criminal
context are as a condition of parole, or through a ruling that he or she is not
criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (“NCR”) under s. 16  and
Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code .  I will briefly address each of these
methods.

 








109                          
In the case at bar, the appellant has been transferred to the
psychiatric unit of the Alberta Hospital as one of his conditions of parole to
undergo treatment as an in-patient.  The National Parole Board order dated
October 21, 1999, which allowed the appellant to be moved from the Fort
Saskatchewan Provincial Correctional Institute to the Alberta Hospital, stated
that the appellant’s movements must be “tightly controlled in order to protect
the public”.  It is clear from the facts of this case that the Parole Board has
explicit legislative authorization to transfer offenders to hospitals as a
condition of their parole.  Indeed, the relevant legislation which sets out the
responsibilities of the correctional systems normally provides for treating
mentally ill offenders in hospitals and other treatment facilities.  For
example, in Alberta, s. 9 of the Corrections Act, R.S.A. 1980, c. C-26,
and ss. 14-19 of the Correctional Institution Regulations, Alta. Reg.
138/77, provide for the transfer of inmates who require treatment to hospitals
pursuant to the Mental Health Act, S.A. 1988, c. M-13.1.  In addition,
in Canada, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c.
20 , allows for federal-provincial agreements for the confinement in hospitals
of persons sentenced to penitentiaries as well as transfers to hospitals. 
While there is a need for greater cooperation between correctional authorities
and mental health authorities, at least there has been some cooperation between
them in this case as evidenced by the Parole Board having transferred the
appellant to the Alberta Hospital.

 

110                          
I also note that prior to transferring offenders from prisons to
treatment facilities, treatment is available to mentally ill offenders within
the correctional system itself.  I recognize, however, that such treatment may
be inadequate and that the appellant would not have access to the same range of
programs there as he would at the Alberta Hospital for example (testimony of
Dr. Tweddle).  Nevertheless, it is important to note that O’Leary J.A.
recommended Fort Saskatchewan Provincial Correctional Institute in the first
place so that the appellant could access treatment opportunities and facilities
with which he was already familiar (p. 295).

 








111                          
A second method of confining a person to a hospital in the criminal
context is through a s. 16  NCR ruling.  Once an accused is found not criminally
responsible on account of his or her mental disorder, he or she comes within
the jurisdiction of a Review Board which is granted the power under s. 672.54
to make one of the following dispositions:  an absolute discharge (where the
accused would not be a significant threat to the safety of the public), a
conditional discharge, or a custodial order that the accused be detained in a
hospital.  The goals of this alternative system are to protect the public and
to treat mentally disabled offenders fairly and appropriately.  The majority of
the Court affirmed in Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric
Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at para. 41, that a disposition under s.
672.54 is not punitive in nature but is intended to provide the accused with
treatment opportunities.  The idea is that both the accused and society are
better served by stabilizing the accused’s mental condition, thereby reducing
the threat to public safety (Winko, at para. 39).  The restrictions on
the accused’s liberty are legitimate if the accused poses a significant danger
to the safety of the community.  In fact, the unit of the Alberta Hospital,
where the appellant was sentenced to reside, is a maximum security facility
which also houses patients who have been found not criminally responsible by
reason of mental disorder.

 

112                          
Unlike a person held not criminally responsible on account of mental
disorder, a person with a mental disability who is being sentenced is
criminally responsible for his or her actions.  Indeed, the record in the case
at bar demonstrates that, although the appellant suffers from a mental
disorder, he appreciated the nature and quality of his acts and, for that
reason, no s. 16  request was made.  In fact, the appellant was described by Dr.
Tweddle as “not Section 16  material”.  The conditional sentencing provisions
form part of a package of amendments to Part XXIII of the Criminal Code . 
These amendments included for the first time a statement of the purpose and
objectives of sentencing.  One fundamental principle of sentencing is the
principle of “proportionality” which dictates that the sentence must be
proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of
the offender.  This principle was codified at s. 718.1 of the Code.  The
appellant was not found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder
and, while conditional sentences were designed to permit the accused to avoid
imprisonment, they were not designed to avoid punishment.  The appellant
possessed a culpable state of mind.  Sentencing should reflect this.

 

 

 

VII.  Conclusion
and Disposition

 








113                          
According to the approach the appellant proposes, once it is determined
that an offender is extremely dangerous, if conditions could be crafted which
include the possibility of locking up an offender in an institution or in his
or her house for 24 hours a day, a conditional sentence would then become
appropriate since there would no longer be a danger to the community.  I am
unable to agree that those were the types of restrictions that Parliament
envisioned could be imposed as a conditional sentence.  When a sentencing judge
is at the initial stage of determining whether a conditional sentence would be
appropriate, he or she should not engage in a circular analysis by deciding
first that the offender is dangerous but then searching for conditions which
could be crafted to alleviate the danger such that a conditional sentence may
become appropriate.  One cannot take the end result of minimizing the danger
and feed it back into whether a conditional sentence is appropriate in the
first place.

 

114                          
While it has been suggested that this case should be restricted to its
particular facts, we must keep in mind that the application of the
dangerousness test applies to all offenders and would not be limited to the
mentally ill.  Thus, if the appellant’s arguments were to succeed, any
offender, dangerous or not, could serve his or her sentence in a locked
institution or under house arrest with an armed guard for two years and, under
such restrictions, he or she would not endanger the safety of the community. 
However, the conditional sentence is designed as an alternative to
incarceration which is available only for “less serious and non-dangerous
offenders” (Proulx, at para. 21).  In cases where the experts have
decided that the appellant is extremely dangerous, then surely the appellant
represents a danger to the community.  If a sentencing judge must resort to
locking up an offender in a psychiatric institution in order to satisfy the
“dangerousness” precondition, then this offender is not suited to the
conditional sentencing regime.  In such cases, Parliament has said that the
conditional sentence is not available.








 

115                          
Thus, while I believe that Chrumka Prov. Ct. J. had the best intentions
when he sought to craft an appropriate sentence in a difficult case, I have
concluded that the Court of Appeal was correct in overturning the conditional
sentence he imposed, both on the basis that the appellant continues to
represent a danger to the safety of the community and because the type of
sentence he imposed was not contemplated under the conditional sentencing
scheme.  Notwithstanding this result, I find it very unfortunate that there are
inadequate resources to treat the mentally ill in most of Canada’s correctional
facilities and that there is a void in the Criminal Code  in its lack of
provision of treatment for mentally disabled offenders.  It is particularly
unfortunate that medical order provisions have not been proclaimed and that the
treatment needs of mentally ill offenders, and ultimately the safety of the
public when the offenders are released from prison, have been sacrificed
because of intergovernmental financial disputes.  The evidence in this case
indicates that there is already an insufficient number of beds for the number
of people who could benefit from care at the Alberta Hospital.

 








116                          
There is no doubt that an appropriate scheme to provide for the treatment
of mentally ill offenders which takes into account the reality of offenders who
suffer from mental disorders should be in force.  Moreover, recognizing the
importance of treating mentally ill offenders also begs the question of why
such treatment should be limited to those eligible for a conditional sentence. 
If our emphasis is on treating mentally ill offenders, such orders should not
be restricted to offenders who receive a sentence of less than two years with
no minimum term of imprisonment.  This would lead to a situation where those
mentally ill offenders who are sentenced to longer terms of imprisonment, but
who would also be “better off” with medical treatment than a prison sentence,
would not be entitled.  Sadly, I believe that many offenders currently serving
prison sentences would meet the description of the appellant as possessing
“deeply ingrained personality difficulties” (testimony of Dr. Tweddle).

 

117                          
Persons with mental disabilities should never be sentenced on the basis
of bias, prejudice or stereotypes.  All available information should be before
the sentencing judge regarding both the offender and available programs and
facilities.  Where the conditions precedent have been satisfied, mentally ill
offenders should never be excluded from the benefits of the conditional
sentencing regime.  However, like any other offender who does not meet the
prerequisites for a conditional sentence, the appellant has not done so in this
case.  While I do consider this an unfortunate situation, as they stand, the
sentencing provisions cannot legitimately be construed to allow for a sentence
of the type imposed by Chrumka Prov. Ct. J.  While there is a pressing need to
address the sentencing regime and its application to psychiatrically disordered
offenders, the legislation should not be judicially rewritten in order to do
so.

 

118                          
I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 








119                          
Iacobucci J. (dissenting)
— I have read the lucid reasons of Bastarache J. and Arbour J.  I find myself
in agreement with the view of Arbour J. that, generally speaking, a conditional
sentencing order can be made under the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , requiring an offender to undergo treatment in a closed psychiatric
facility, provided that such an order is reasonable in the circumstances, and
consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing.  In such a situation,
I am of the view that the discretion afforded to sentencing judges under s.
742.3(2)(f) of the Code is wide enough to include sentences that
require psychiatric care in a hospital setting.  On these points, I agree with
Arbour J.

 

120                          
Having said this, I agree with Bastarache J.’s finding that a
conditional sentence was not an appropriate order in the case before us.  More
specifically, I share his view that the appellant did not satisfy the test for
dangerousness set out in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5,
which held that, before a conditional sentence may be ordered, the risk of the
offender’s re-offending and the gravity of the damage that such re-offence
could entail must be considered.  I agree with Bastarache J. that these
conditions were not met in this case.

 

121                          
Accordingly, I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by Bastarache J.

The accused faced multiple charges related to their
cocaine‑trafficking ring.  Much of the Crown’s evidence against them was
gleaned from information captured through wiretapping.  The Crown had obtained ex
parte authorizations for its wiretaps from a judge by submitting a 130‑page
affidavit, prepared and signed by R, a member of the RCMP.  The affidavit
contained information from 10 confidential sources denoted “A” through “J”. 
Information from these sources came to R by way of other officers who were
their handlers.  On a voir dire at trial, R was cross‑examined on
the affidavit.  After confused attempts at explaining inconsistencies in the
affidavit, R admitted that in several places the affidavit referred erroneously
to source “E”, rather than to source “F”.  He later testified that the
reference should have been to source “C”.  R admitted that he had known about
this error several weeks before the trial.  He affirmed that he had forgotten
about the matter, but suddenly remembered it during the cross‑examination. 
The trial judge indicated that R’s lack of credibility “permeate[d] the issue
of reasonable and probable grounds”, one of the preconditions to the
authorization, and concluded that the affidavit should fall in its entirety. 
The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittals of the accused and ordered a new
trial.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 

The Court of Appeal had jurisdiction under
s. 676(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  to hear the Crown’s
appeal.  The Court of Appeal examined the combined interpretation and
application of the legal standard of investigative necessity.  It also
discussed the interpretation and application of the standard of review for a
judge reviewing a wiretap authorization.  The interpretation or application of
a legal standard has been recognized as a question of law.

 








Under s. 186(1)(b) of the Code,
wiretapping may be accepted as an appropriate investigative tool  where  “other
investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed”.  The correct interpretation
of s. 186(1) (b)’s investigative necessity requirement must be based
on the text of the provision read with a simultaneous awareness of two
potentially competing considerations: enabling criminal investigations and
protecting privacy rights.  Wiretapping is highly intrusive and a judge should
protect citizens against unwanted fishing expeditions by the state and its law
enforcement agencies by granting an authorization only as far as need is
demonstrated by the material submitted by the applicant.  In order to meet the
investigative necessity requirement, the applicant must establish in the
affidavit that,  practically speaking, there is no other reasonable alternative
method of investigation, in the circumstances of the particular criminal
inquiry.  Here, the Court of Appeal applied a standard inconsistent with the
words of the Criminal Code .  In concluding that “in the case at bar,
there is no reason to impeach the choice of investigative techniques”, the court
applied an “efficiency” rather than a “necessity” standard.   This approach is
wrong in law and has the potential to subvert the safeguards of privacy
interests that are an essential component of the regulation of wiretapping in
the Code.  Using the efficiency standard, wiretapping would always be
available to the police and would replace a standard of necessity with one of
opportunity at the discretion of law enforcement bodies.  However, the
application of the proper test supports the conclusion reached by the Court of
Appeal that the authorizing judge could properly have issued an authorization
based on the facts disclosed in the affidavit.  The facts as set out in the
affidavit met the investigative necessity standard.  The affidavit attested to the
failure of police efforts in spite of the use of physical surveillance and
search warrants.  It also provided evidence as to why the use of informants or
undercover agents trying to infiltrate the drug ring would be ineffective and
potentially dangerous.  There was thus evidence in the affidavit to negate
arguments for other investigative techniques and to make the case that
wiretapping was, practically speaking, the only reasonable alternative, taking
into account the nature and purpose of this particular investigation.  The
objective of a police investigation ‑‑ to bring the higher‑ups
in a drug ring to justice ‑‑ rightly informs the investigative
necessity analysis.  The police had more need for wiretapping given that they
were trying to move up the chain and catch the higher‑ups in the
operation.

 

As a practical matter, in seeking permission to use
wiretapping, the police should submit an affidavit that sets out the facts
fully and frankly for the authorizing judge in order that he or she can make an
assessment of whether these rise to the standard required in the legal test for
the authorization.  In addition, an affidavit should be clear and concise.  It
should never attempt to trick its readers.  On this point, the use of boiler‑plate
language should be avoided. Finally, the affidavits should be gathered from
those with the best firsthand knowledge of the facts.  This would strengthen
the material by making it more reliable.








The trial judge did not correctly apply the standard
of review for a wiretap authorization.  A reviewing judge does not conduct a
rehearing of the application for the wiretap.  The test is whether there was
reliable evidence that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the
authorization could have issued.  In considering the evidence, the reviewing
judge must exclude erroneous information.  Amplification may correct such
information where the police had the requisite reasonable and probable grounds
and demonstrated investigative necessity but, in good faith, made some minor,
technical error in the drafting of their affidavit material.  There is no need
to seek to amplify the record if sufficient reliable material remains even
after excising the erroneous material.  In this case, although the trial judge
found R to lack credibility on the issue of why he had not disclosed a minor
drafting mistake, there is no suggestion that there was ever any untruthfulness
in the substance of the information in the affidavit itself.  In these
circumstances, a global finding against the entire affidavit was
unreasonable.   Even without the information from sources “C” and “E”, the
affidavit would have provided ample evidence to an issuing judge and evidenced
the existence of probable grounds and investigative necessity.  Moreover,
amplification would allow for the reading of the information from the now
correctly attributed sources “C” and “E” as well.  The Court of Appeal was
correct in upholding the issuing judge’s authorization.

LeBel J. – 

 

I.       Introduction

 

1                                  
This appeal involves the electronic interception of private
communications, popularly known as “wiretapping”.  Under what circumstances can
the police satisfy the investigative necessity requirement in s. 186(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and obtain an authorization to intercept
private communications by electronic means?  On what basis can a trial judge
review the decision to issue such an authorization?  These questions at the
heart of this appeal have given rise to controversy and varying appellate court
approaches since our Court last considered them.  The reasons that follow will
outline what I consider to be the proper approach to these issues.

 

2                                  
It should be noted that these reasons will not discuss the new s. 186(1.1)
and related amendments adopted in 1997 which target criminal organizations. 
These amendments were not invoked or examined in the case at bar.   The
interpretation of the investigative necessity requirement in s. 186(1)  and the
issue of the standard of review on a wiretap authorization are significant
enough issues, which will affect many people.

 








3                                  
The answers of our Court to these questions may have a substantial
impact on the privacy rights of a number of Canadians.  Although we suggest
dismissing the appeal on the facts before our Court and affirm the Court of
Appeal’s decision to order a new trial, the language used in the Court of
Appeal’s reasons could lead courts to permit undue infringements on privacy in
other factual circumstances. These reasons must then discuss the nature and
interpretation of the investigative necessity requirement before turning to an
examination of the function of the reviewing judge at trial.  These reasons
will also offer some suggestions as to how the police and other participants in
the justice system can avoid some of the problems of the sort that have given
rise to this appeal.     

 

II.       Factual
Background

 

4                                  
The appellants faced multiple trafficking, possession, conspiracy, and
weapons charges related to their cocaine-trafficking ring.  Much of the Crown’s
evidence against the appellants was gleaned, directly or indirectly, from
information captured through a wiretap.  As is usual, the Crown had obtained ex
parte authorizations for its wiretaps by submitting affidavit material to
an authorizing judge.  The main material in support of the application was a
long affidavit of some 130 pages, prepared and signed by a member of the RCMP,
Constable Rosset.  This affidavit was largely based on information gathered by
Rosset from the handlers of ten police informers.  No affidavits were obtained
from these handlers.  

 








5                                  
According to the affidavit material, a number of sources had identified
the appellants as running a drug-trafficking operation in Victoria with
possible connections to a major, violent cocaine-trafficking gang operating in
Vancouver and the Lower Mainland.  The appellants, who were the primary targets
of the potential wiretap, allegedly trafficked cocaine in quantities up to the kilogram
range.  The police had conducted previous investigations and executed warrants
against some of the appellants.  They had also conducted a substantial
surveillance operation on the appellants.  There was evidence that some of the
appellants were engaging at times in counter-surveillance tactics to throw
investigators off their tails.  There was also reason to believe that standard
investigative procedures on their own would not be likely to catch the
higher-ups in the drug operation.  In seeking an authorization for wiretapping,
the police hoped to use wiretaps in conjunction with other investigative
techniques in order to pursue the higher-ups in the trafficking ring and to be
able to gather evidence on not only trafficking and possession charges but also
on laundering and conspiracy offences.

 

6                                  
At trial, when the Crown brought forth its authorizations under Part VI
of the Criminal Code  for gathering wiretap evidence, counsel for the
accused cross-examined Constable Rosset in the voir dire, challenging the
validity of the wiretap. During cross-examination by defence counsel, it
emerged then that there were some serious problems with the affidavit submitted
to obtain the first authorization.  It became clear that the affidavit
contained a number of errors of varying importance.  In  a number of places,
boiler-plate language used in the affidavit might have created a mistaken
impression that certain statements had been confirmed in ways that they had
not.  However, the most important problem with the affidavit concerned
references to some of the sources.  

 








7                                  
The affidavit contained information from ten confidential sources
denoted “A” through “J”.  Information from these sources came to Constable
Rosset by way of other officers who were their handlers.  There had been no
direct contact between Rosset and the informers.  In the second day of
cross-examination, after repeated denials and confused attempts at explaining
inconsistencies in the affidavit and in his own evidence, Constable Rosset had to
admit that in several places the affidavit referred erroneously to source “E”,
rather than to source “F”.   Later, during the same cross-examination,
Constable Rosset testified that the reference should have been to source “C”. 
Rosset admitted then that he had known about this error several weeks before
the trial, but had not mentioned it either to his superiors or to the Crown
prosecutor.  In his testimony, he affirmed that he had forgotten about the
matter, but suddenly remembered it during the cross-examination.  The trial
judge, Filmer Prov. Ct. J., did not believe him.  This finding of fact on the
credibility of Constable Rosset during the voir dire had a catastrophic
impact on the Crown’s case and played a major role in the dismissal of the
charges against the appellants.

 

III.      Judicial
History

 

A.  British
Columbia Provincial Court

 

8                                  
In his factual findings at the voir dire, the trial judge found
that the mistake of Constable Rosset had been inadvertent but that his failure
to reveal it earlier had cast a “pall over Officer Rosset’s credibility”.  
Filmer Prov. Ct. J. would then go on to extend his finding on Constable Rosset’s
credibility to the entire affidavit, although he accepted that the police
officer had become aware of the error only well after the submission of the
affidavit.  He stated, “[c]ross-examination of the deponent here has led to
testimony which tends to discredit the existence of one of the preconditions to
the authorization: to wit, the existence of reasonable and probable grounds”. 
Filmer Prov. Ct. J. considered that Constable Rosset’s credibility “permeates
the issue of reasonable and probable grounds” and thus concluded that the
affidavit should fall in its entirety.  In his opinion, the testimony of
Constable Rosset tainted the whole affidavit and rendered it unreliable.

 








9                                  
Although he considered this sufficient reason to invalidate the authorization,
Filmer Prov. Ct. J. also discussed two other arguments.  First, he criticized
the boiler-plate language in the affidavit, calling it potentially confusing
but not characterizing it as so confusing as to call for rejecting the
authorization if it had been the sole problem.  Second, he considered that the
authorization had not been necessary because the investigative necessity had
not been made out, especially given the possibility that the police might have
conducted specifically directed surveillance with a special investigative team
of the RCMP, the Special Operations Group.  Thus, he decided that the
authorization should be rejected.

 

10                              
In the end, because he was of the opinion that the police had acted in
bad faith and because the courts cannot condone such conduct, Filmer Prov. Ct.
J. was prepared to exclude all evidence coming directly or indirectly from the
wiretaps.  As a result, there was no evidence against the accused, and Filmer
Prov. Ct. J. acquitted the accused.

 

B.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 315

 

11                              
The Court of Appeal unanimously set aside the acquittals and ordered a
new trial.  In a judgment by Braidwood J.A., it rejected Filmer Prov. Ct. J.’s
application of the standard of review to the wiretap authorization and of the
investigative necessity test.

 








12                              
According to Braidwood J.A., the trial judge had erred in applying an
inappropriate standard of review to the authorization.  In his opinion, the
trial judge had failed to consider the nature of the errors, their impact on
the affidavit as a whole and whether there remained any further evidence left
on the basis of which the authorization could have been granted.  As Braidwood
J.A. viewed it, the correct standard of review was “whether, on the evidence,
there was any basis on which the authorization could have been
granted . . .” (para. 10 (emphasis in original)).  In the circumstances, the
error in denoting the sources was easily remedied by reading the correct
letters on review (para. 22).  An inadvertent mechanical error, even in
combination with a non-credible explanation of why the error was not corrected,
did not take away from the existence of reasonable and probable grounds that
existed at the time the police sought the authorization and that continued to
exist at the time of the review (para. 23). 

 

13                              
Braidwood J.A. went on to reject the trial judge’s conclusion that the
affidavit had not satisfied the requirements of investigative necessity.  Based
on previous case law from the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Braidwood J.A.
considered that “the key issue was whether or not the authorizing judge could
have concluded that the most efficacious way of fully investigating all
those involved was to permit the police to employ wiretapping along with other
investigative techniques” (para. 30 (italics in original; underlining added)). 
On this standard, there was “no reason to impeach the choice of investigative
techniques given the nature and background of the numerous investigations, the
prior experience with a number of the accused, the counter-surveillance
employed by some of the accused, and the extent of the investigations in terms
of time and resources” (para. 33).  He held that the trial judge had erred in
applying the correct legal test,  that the authorization could have been
granted and that it should not have been disturbed.

 

14                              
Braidwood J.A. thus was of the view that the trial judge had erred in
law by not applying the appropriate test to the facts on the voir dire
and that the Court of Appeal should allow the appeal, set aside the acquittals,
and order a new trial. 

 

IV.      Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

15                              
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 








 

186. (1) An authorization under this section
may be given if the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied 

 

(a) that it would be in the best interests of the administration
of justice to do so; and 

 

(b) that other investigative procedures have been tried and have
failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the urgency
of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures.

 

V.       Issues

 

16                              
There are several issues on this appeal, which will be considered
successively.  First, there is one preliminary issue: (A) whether there was a
jurisdictional bar to the Crown’s appeal to the Court of Appeal.  Second, there
are two main issues: (B) whether the factual circumstances revealed in the
affidavit met the s. 186(1)  requirement of investigative necessity; and (C)
whether the trial judge applied correctly the standard of review for a wiretap
authorization, including the correct approach on amplification.

 

VI.       Analysis

 

A.  Was
There a Jurisdictional Bar to the Crown’s Appeal to the Court of Appeal?

 

17                              
Before considering the central issues in this appeal, a  preliminary
argument must be addressed.  The appellants have argued that the Crown’s appeal
to the British Columbia Court of Appeal did not raise a question of law and
that, therefore, the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction under s. 676(1)(a)
of the Code to hear the appeal.                  








18                              
It is clear that this argument must fail.  The interpretation of a legal
standard has always been recognized as a question of law: R. v. Ewanchuk,
[1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at para. 21.  Moreover, our Court has recently recognized
that if a question is about the application of a legal standard, that is enough
to make it a question of law: R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, 2000
SCC 15, at para. 23.  In the case before us, the Court of Appeal examined the
combined interpretation and application of the legal standard of investigative
necessity.  It also discussed the interpretation and application of the
standard of review for a judge reviewing a wiretap authorization.  There is no
question that the Court of Appeal was dealing with questions of law.  Thus,
there was no jurisdictional bar to the Crown’s appeal.    

 

 

B.  Did the
Factual Circumstances Revealed in the Affidavit Meet the Section 186(1)        
Requirement of Investigative Necessity?

 

 

19                              
The first major issue in the case at bar is whether the factual
circumstances revealed in the affidavit even met the s. 186(1)  requirement of
investigative necessity.  This is a facial validity question.  On the face of
the affidavit material, could the contents of the affidavit support an
authorization?  In order to answer this question, the meaning of the investigative
necessity requirement must be explored in order to determine whether the
factual circumstances revealed in the affidavit met this standard.

 








20                              
As will appear below, this case does not raise a question of
interpretation of s. 186(1) (a), which requires that the issue of an
authorization be in the interest of the administration of justice.  Courts have
found that this requirement meant that in accordance with s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  there had to be reasonable and probable
grounds on which to believe that an offence had been committed (Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
1421; and R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30).  It is not in dispute that
this first basic requirement was satisfied when the wiretap authorization was
issued.  On the other hand, the investigative necessity standard remains at the
heart of the present appeal.

 

1.  The Meaning of the Investigative Necessity Requirement

 

21                              
The meaning of the investigative necessity requirement is of critical
importance by reason of the conflict between the privacy interests involved in
wiretapping operations and the needs of law enforcement agencies in their
difficult fight against some forms of sophisticated and dangerous criminality. 
Wiretapping is highly intrusive.  It may affect human relations in the sphere
of very close, if not intimate communications, even in the privacy of the
home.  La Forest J. was alert to the importance of the societal values involved
in wiretapping and the risks to essential privacy interests.  Writing for the
Court, in Duarte, supra, at p. 44, La Forest J. emphasized the
potential danger to privacy rights arising from the use of such modern
investigative techniques:

 








The reason for this protection is the realization
that if the state were free, at its sole discretion, to make permanent
electronic recordings of our private communications, there would be no
meaningful residuum to our right to live our lives free from surveillance.  The
very efficacy of electronic surveillance is such that it has the potential, if
left unregulated, to annihilate any expectation that our communications will
remain private.  A society which exposed us, at the whim of the state, to the
risk of having a permanent electronic recording made of our words every time we
opened our mouths might be superbly equipped to fight crime, but would be one
in which privacy no longer had any meaning.  As Douglas J., dissenting in United
States v. White, supra, put it, at p. 756:  “Electronic surveillance
is the greatest leveler of human privacy ever known”.  If the state may
arbitrarily record and transmit our private communications, it is no longer
possible to strike an appropriate balance between the right of the individual
to be left alone and the right of the state to intrude on privacy in the
furtherance of its goals, notably the need to investigate and combat crime.

An appropriate balance must be found between the need to safeguard privacy
interests and the realities and difficulties of law enforcement.  The
investigative necessity requirement found in s. 186(1) (b) has proved to
be a critical but delicate component of the legal framework set up to regulate
wiretapping in order to strike this appropriate but often elusive balance
between the  interests of the State and those of its citizens.

 

23                              
This Court has not issued a definitive statement on the meaning of the
investigative necessity requirement in s. 186(1) .  The closest that it has come
is in La Forest J.’s reasons in Duarte, supra.  In considering a
problem of surveillance conducted with the consent of one party, La Forest J.
referred in passing, at p. 55, to the investigative necessity requirement for
wiretapping:

 

. . . authorizations for electronic surveillance are only to be given
on a showing that there is no real practical alternative (s. 178.13(1)); in
other words, as put by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Playford
(1987), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 142, at p. 185: “. . . it is treated as a last resort
investigative mechanism”, and can only be obtained for investigation of the
most serious offences in the Code (s. 178.1);

 

 

However, this obiter
comment did not distinguish between a “last resort” test and a “no real
practical alternative” test.  

 








24                              
Our Court has remained divided between these two descriptions of the
test: see R. v. Commisso, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 121 (in which the dissent of
Dickson J. (as he then was) used a “last resort” standard at p. 135); R. v.
Thompson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1111 (in which La Forest J.’s dissent referred to
a “last resort” standard at p. 1160); and R. v. Lachance, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 1490 (in which an obiter reference at p. 1502 of Sopinka J.’s
judgment implied that the standard was “the only practical investigative
technique available”).  Thus, our Court has left open the question of the exact
nature of the test of investigative necessity.

 

25                              
Over the years, other Canadian courts seem not to have been entirely
sure which strand of this case law they should use.  Sometimes, they have
approved of words such as “last resort” to describe the degree of necessity
required to meet the standard: e.g., R. v. Finlay (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d)
48 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 69; R. v. Playford (1987), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 142
(Ont. C.A.), at p. 185; and R. v. Smyk  (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 63 (Man.
C.A.), at p. 81, per Twaddle J.A.  Other times, they have talked more
about reasonable practical alternatives or similar practical tests: e.g.,
Smyk, supra, at p. 73, per Philp J.A.; R. v. Barbeau (1996),
110 C.C.C. (3d) 69 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Grant (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 53
(Man. C.A.).

 








26                              
The correct interpretation of s. 186(1) ’s investigative necessity
requirement must be based on the text of the provision read with a simultaneous
awareness of two potentially competing considerations.  First, as stated by E.
A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, as
affirmed by our Court (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998]
1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21), and as accepted in the analogous context of
interpreting the search warrant provisions of the Criminal Code  (CanadianOxy
Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743, at para.
14), “Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an
Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act,
and the intention of Parliament.”  In other words, we need to give the section
a fair and liberal reading as part of our country’s criminal justice
legislation.  Second, however, we must not forget that the text of s. 186(1) 
represents a type of constitutional compromise.  In particular, the
investigative necessity requirement embodied in s. 186(1)  is one of the
safeguards that made it possible for this Court to uphold these parts of the Criminal
Code  on constitutional grounds (Duarte, supra, at p. 45; Garofoli,
supra, at p. 1444).  As a result, s. 186(1)  must be read with a
simultaneous awareness of the competing values of enabling criminal
investigations and protecting privacy rights. 

 

27                              
With a proper awareness of these values, I must turn to the text of s.
186(1) (b).  This provision states that wiretapping may be appropriate as
where “other investigative procedures have been tried and have
failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the
urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures”
(emphasis added).  With the use of the disjunctive “or”, the text of the
section makes clear that there are three kinds of circumstances in which
wiretapping may be accepted as an appropriate investigative tool (see, e.g., Smyk,
supra, at pp. 70-71).  The third branch of the subsection seems to refer to
an emergency situation, and the first branch refers to a true “last resort”
situation where other investigative methods “have been tried and have failed”. 
These branches not having been argued, it is the second branch, which speaks of
the likelihood of success of other investigative procedures, that must be
considered in the case before us.  

 








28                              
The words of the second branch ought not to be read in a vacuum.  The
disjunctive nature of the three branches does not remove the need to read the
subsection together as a whole (see R. v. Madsen, [1988] N.W.T.R. 82
(S.C.), at p. 86).  Indeed, the nature of the other branches properly
emphasizes the gravity of wiretapping and suggests that we should not read the
term “unlikely” in the second branch in a weak way.  But, ultimately, it is
sufficient to satisfy one branch of s. 186(1) (b).  Also, the words ought
properly to be read in their context in light of the values that were
acknowledged at the outset and how any particular investigation meshes with
these values.

 








29                              
In the final analysis, the potentially competing values in this area
must be acknowledged.  The words of the Code must be read with some
common sense having regard both to the nature and purpose of the particular
investigation which the police  wish to undertake.  A pure last resort test
would turn the process of authorization into a formalistic exercise that would
take no account of the difficulties of police investigations targeting
sophisticated crime.  But the authorizing judge must look with attention at the
affidavit material, with an awareness that constitutional rights are at stake
and carefully consider whether the police have met the standard.  All this must
be performed within a procedural framework where certain actions are authorized
on an ex parte basis.   Thus, the authorizing judge stands as the
guardian of the law and of the constitutional principles protecting privacy
interests.  The judge should not view himself or herself as a mere rubber
stamp, but should take a close look at the material submitted by the
applicant.  He or she should not be reluctant to ask questions from the
applicant, to discuss or to require more information or to narrow down the
authorization requested if it seems  too wide or too vague.  The authorizing
judge should grant the authorization only as far as need is demonstrated by the
material submitted by the applicant.  The judge should remember that the
citizens of his country must be protected against unwanted fishing expeditions
by the state and its law enforcement agencies.  Parliament and the courts have
indeed recognized that the interception of private communications is a serious
matter, to be considered only for the investigation of serious offences, in
the presence of probable grounds, and with a serious testing of the need for
electronic interception in the context of the particular investigation and its
objects (cf. Smyk, supra, at p. 74).  There must be,
practically speaking, no other reasonable alternative method of
investigation, in the circumstances of the particular criminal inquiry.

 

30                              
This approach is consistent with much of the Canadian  jurisprudence
analyzing the investigative necessity requirement: e.g., R. v. Todoruk
(1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 145; Smyk, supra, at
p. 74; R. v. McCreery, [1996] B.C.J. No. 2405 (QL) (S.C.), at paras.
47-53; Barbeau, supra, at pp. 84-85; R. v. Shalala (2000),
224 N.B.R. (2d) 118 (C.A.), at para. 87. 

 

31                              
 Moreover, although I am wary of applying our southern neighbour’s quite
different Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in the Canadian context, I note that American
courts have approached their almost identical legislation governing the use of
wiretapping not on the basis of an absolutist “last resort” theory but in a
similarly commonsensical fashion.

 

32                              
Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968,
18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998), implements the standards for
the use of electronic surveillance as required by the Fourth Amendment,
according to the United States Supreme Court decisions in Berger v. New York,
388 U.S. 41 (1967), and Katz v. U.S., 389 U.S. 347 (1967).  This
legislation includes a necessity requirement not unlike that found in s.
186(1) .  A judge may issue a court order authorizing a wiretap only if he or
she has determined “on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that .
. . normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or
reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous”:
18 U.S.C. § 2518(3)(c).

 








33                              
Recent jurisprudence has confirmed that such language is to be
interpreted in a practical commonsense fashion, so that courts may issue
wiretap orders even when the government has not pursued all other investigative
techniques.  Courts have found a variety of grounds for allowing that normal
investigative techniques are unlikely to succeed.  These include: a showing by
the government that those techniques would not reveal key information (U.S.
v. London, 66 F.3d 1227 (1st  Cir. 1995), at p. 1237); when it can be shown
that those techniques are ineffective against a large-scale crime organization
(U.S. v. Torres, 901 F.2d 205 (2d Cir. 1990), at p. 232; U.S. v.
Commito, 918 F.2d 95 (9th Cir. 1990), at p. 98), a close-knit family (U.S.
v. Guerra-Marez, 928 F.2d 665 (5th Cir. 1991), at p. 670) or a drug conspiracy
(U.S. v. Milton, 153 F.3d 891 (8th Cir. 1998), at  pp. 897-98); or when
counter-surveillance methods employed by the defendants made such methods
unlikely to succeed (U.S. v. Smith, 31 F.3d 1294 (4th Cir. 1994), at p.
1299; U.S. v. Green, 40 F.3d 1167 (11th Cir. 1994), at p. 1172).

 

34                              
Canadian jurisprudence has reflected this approach.  Writing for the
Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Hiscock, [1992] R.J.Q. 895, 72 C.C.C.
(3d) 303, leave to appeal refused, [1993] 1 S.C.R. vi, I asserted the relevance
of the actual text of s. 186(1)  as follows (at p. 325 C.C.C.):

 

 

[translation] . . . s.
186  does not require that all alternative investigative techniques have been
tried. It is not simply a recourse of last resort. It is a technique
which must not be used in the absence of serious, probable grounds, but which
can be employed not only when the other methods have failed, but also, when
they appear to have little chance of  success or when the urgency of the matter
would otherwise render the investigation unsuccessful.  [Emphasis added.]

 

But, in so
doing, I also recognized the importance of giving meaning to the requirements
for a wiretap authorization (at p. 319 C.C.C.):

 








[translation]  In his
role, and in order to avoid inadmissible intrusions into the private lives
of citizens, the authorizing judge must ensure that the application is
based on reasonable and probable cause. It must not constitute a mere fishing
expedition based on pure suspicion. He must also be convinced that it is necessary
to have recourse to this particular investigative technique.  [Emphasis added.]

 

35                              
This approach is founded on statutory interpretation and supported by a
strong strand of case law.  Through this combination of text and context, it
allows judges to apply in a balanced way the requirement of investigative
necessity for wiretapping.  In so doing, the judge must keep important values
of Canadian society in sight and look seriously at whether there is,
practically speaking, no other reasonable alternative method of investigation.

 

2.  Application of the Standard to the Case at Bar

 

36                              
How, then, should this approach be applied in the context of the case at
bar?  There are two aspects of this application to consider.  First, we must
determine whether the reasoning used by the British Columbia Court of Appeal
strays too far from the text of the Criminal Code  and the important
constitutional values that this text protects, thereby endangering privacy
interests in other contexts.  Second, when applying the correct test, we must
consider whether the Court of Appeal nevertheless correctly concluded that the
authorizing judge could properly have issued an authorization based on the
facts disclosed in the affidavit.

 








37                              
The proper test, as I have set out above, concerns whether, practically
speaking, there is no other reasonable means of investigation.  The judgment
from the British Columbia Court of Appeal does not follow this language and,
indeed, seems to use a far laxer standard.  The approach taken by the Court of
Appeal has the potential to subvert the safeguards of privacy interests that
are an essential component of the regulation of wiretapping in the Criminal
Code .

 

38                              
In concluding that “in the case at bar, there is no reason to impeach
the choice of investigative techniques” (para. 33 (emphasis added)),
Braidwood J.A. reasoned, based on earlier British Columbia Court of Appeal
precedents, that the question was whether the authorizing judge “despite the
fact that other investigative techniques may have had promise . . . could
have concluded that the most efficacious way of fully investigating
all those involved was to permit the police to employ wiretapping along with
other investigative techniques” (para. 30 (italics in original; underlining
added); see also para. 32).  The British Columbia Court of Appeal’s decisions
have gradually moved in this direction, with prior precedents each lowering the
bar another notch (see R. v. Paulson (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 344; and R.
v. Cheung (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 507).  The question essentially becomes
one of whether wiretapping is a more effective, rather than necessary, means of
investigation, in the context of the particular criminal investigation.

 

39                              
This approach is wrong in law.  A standard of “most efficacious” strays
far from the text of s. 186(1) (b) and the privacy rights that it protects. 
Such language does not match with the test enunciated above.  Indeed, in the
end, one might well argue, using such an efficiency standard, that wiretapping
should always be available to the police, since it might often help catch more
criminals.  Such a result  would rightly send a chill down the spine of every
freedom-loving Canadian.  We would replace a standard of necessity with one of
opportunity at the discretion of law enforcement bodies.  The British Columbia
Court of Appeal’s test must thus be rejected as inconsistent with the very
words of the Criminal Code .

 








40                              
Nevertheless, this disagreement with the approach of the Court of Appeal
does not mean that the appeal must succeed on this point.  On the contrary, we
must apply the proper test to the circumstances of the case at bar in order to
ascertain whether its application would support the conclusion reached by the
Court of Appeal.  More precisely, the question is whether the factual
circumstances revealed in the affidavit could have provided a sufficient basis
for the issuance of the authorization.  

41                              
The facts as set out in the affidavit met this standard.  Catching the
ringleaders in drug rings and conspiracies is never an easy task.  This is
particularly so when, as here, they use counter-surveillance measures and
behave in a clandestine fashion.  The affidavit attested to the failure of the
police efforts in spite of the use of  physical surveillance and search
warrants.  It also provided evidence as to why the use of informants or undercover
agents trying to infiltrate the drug ring would be ineffective and potentially
dangerous.  There was, in my view, evidence in the affidavit to negate
arguments for other investigative techniques and to make the case that
wiretapping was, practically speaking, the only reasonable alternative, taking
into account the nature and purpose of this particular investigation.  

 








42                              
The appellants made much of arguments that the cross-examination on the
affidavit seemed to reveal the availability of another surveillance team, the
Special Operations Group, that the police could have used.  The availability of
another surveillance team was, in reality, of little consequence in the
circumstances of the case at bar.  The fact is that the police had done
extensive surveillance.  By doing so, they obtained some information.  But
their surveillance efforts were occasionally met by counter-surveillance, whose
presence can obviously affect the effectiveness of investigative methods, and
by the clear reality that surveillance efforts alone would not bring them into
contact with higher-ups in the drug organization.  Indeed, I am quite uncertain
how surveillance alone would ever have given good proof of laundering and
conspiracy.  By showing that the police were already conducting surveillance
and that this was not accomplishing everything required, the affidavit
materials established investigative necessity.

 

43                              
The objective of the police investigation here was to bring the
higher-ups in a drug ring to justice, not simply to remove a few replaceable
street dealers.  Among their various arguments, the  appellants challenged the
right of the police to define the objectives of their investigation, alleging
that the police could manipulate the objectives in order to get the chance to
use a wiretap.  However, it is clear that the police here had probable grounds
to investigate the serious crimes that they were investigating.  This part of
the test for wiretapping –  probable grounds for believing that serious crimes
would likely occur – removes the need for concern about the kinds of suspicions
that the appellants raise.  If the police have probable grounds to investigate
a serious crime, then they may use wiretapping to do so, provided they meet the
investigative necessity requirement.  There is nothing pernicious about the
fact that the objective of their investigation rightly informs the
investigative necessity analysis.  Here, the police had more need for
wiretapping given that they were trying to move up the chain and catch the
higher-ups in the operation.  This rightly reinforces the investigative
necessity made plain by the affidavit materials.     

 

44                              
The facts set out in the affidavit in the case at bar establish
investigative necessity on the required standard.  Any argument that an
authorization could not have issued based on the facts set out in the
affidavits must fail.  On its face, the affidavit was sufficient to support an
authorization.

 








45                              
This being said, it is clear that the affidavit was not perfect, even on
its face.  Prior to moving on to the subfacial review required by the last
issue in the case at bar, it may be useful to discuss some practical
suggestions about the form of affidavits on an application for a wiretap
authorization in order to reduce needless litigation on similar matters and in
better serving the interests of all parties.

 

46                              
Looking at matters practically in order to learn from this case for the
future, what kind of affidavit should the police submit in order to seek
permission to use wiretapping?  The legal obligation on anyone seeking an ex
parte authorization is full and frank disclosure of material
facts: cf. Dalglish v. Jarvie (1850), 2 Mac. & G. 231, 42 E.R.
89; R. v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners, [1917] 1 K.B. 486 (C.A.);
Re Church of Scientology and The Queen (No. 6) (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d)
449 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 528; United States of America v. Friedland,
[1996] O.J. No. 4399 (QL) (Gen. Div.), at paras. 26-29, per Sharpe
J.  So long as the affidavit meets the requisite legal norm, there is no need
for it to be as lengthy as À la recherche du temps perdu, as lively as
the Kama Sutra, or as detailed as an automotive repair manual.  All that
it must do is set out the facts fully and frankly for the authorizing judge in
order that he or she can make an assessment of whether these rise to the
standard required in the legal test for the authorization.  Ideally, an
affidavit should be not only full and frank but also clear and concise. 
It need not include every minute detail of the police investigation over a
number of months and even of years.

 








47                              
A corollary to the requirement of an affidavit being full and frank is
that it should never attempt to trick its readers.  At best, the use of
boiler-plate language adds extra verbiage and seldom anything of meaning; at
worst, it has the potential to trick the reader into thinking that the
affidavit means something that it does not.  Although the use of boiler-plate
language will not automatically prevent a judge from issuing an authorization
(there is, after all, no formal legal requirement to avoid it), I cannot stress
enough that judges should deplore it.  There is nothing wrong – and much right
– with an affidavit that sets out the facts truthfully, fully, and plainly. 
Counsel and police officers submitting materials to obtain wiretapping
authorizations should not allow themselves to be led into the temptation of
misleading the authorizing judge, either by the language used or strategic
omissions.  

 

48                              
Finally, while there is no legal requirement for it, those gathering
affidavit material should give consideration to obtaining affidavits directly
from those with the best firsthand knowledge of the facts set out therein, like
the police officers carrying on the criminal investigation or handling the
informers.  This would strengthen the material by making it more reliable.  In
the present case, it might have prevented this case from turning into the mess
it is now, still in appeal, after years of litigation on preliminary matters,
without any final judgment on the guilt or innocence of the appellants.  

 

49                              
This brings me to the adverse credibility finding against the affiant in
the case at bar.  Practically speaking, these issues and much of the resulting
litigation could have been largely avoided if the police had taken the simple
step of having each of the handlers sign an affidavit on those matters within
his or her particular knowledge.  This would almost certainly have ensured a
more careful verification of the facts sworn in the affidavit material,
potentially avoiding some of the needless errors that the affidavit ended up
containing, and would also have made the application for an authorization less
tied to the credibility of the one officer who ultimately attested to
everything in it.

 








C.  Did the
Trial Judge Apply Correctly the Standard of Review for a
Wiretap                 Authorization, Including Amplification?

 

 

50                              
Given that the police did not take such steps that might have prevented
these problems from ever arising, I must now focus on the arguments that
challenge the affidavit from a subfacial perspective.  Subfacial challenges to
an affidavit go behind the form of the affidavit to attack the reliability of
its content.  The issue here is whether the trial judge correctly applied the
standard of review for a wiretap authorization in the face of the subfacial
challenge that arose through cross-examination on the affidavit.

 

51                              
The reviewing judge does not stand in the same place and function as the
authorizing judge.  He or she does not conduct a rehearing of the application
for the wiretap.  This is the starting place for any reviewing judge, as our
Court stated in Garofoli, supra, at p. 1452:

 

The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her
view for that of the authorizing judge.  If, based on the record which was
before the authorizing judge as amplified on the review, the reviewing judge
concludes that the authorizing judge could have granted the
authorization, then he or she should not interfere.  In this process, the
existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are
all relevant, but, rather than being a prerequisite to review, their sole
impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the
decision of the authorizing judge.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

 








As I noted as
a judge at the Quebec Court of Appeal in Hiscock, supra, at p.
326 C.C.C., even a basis that is schematic in nature may suffice.  However, as
our Court has recognized, it must be a basis founded on reliable information.
In R. v. Bisson, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1097, at p. 1098, the requirement was
described as  “sufficient reliable information to support an
authorization” (emphasis added).  The Court concluded that this requirement had
still been met despite the excision of retracted testimony.  In looking for
reliable information on which the authorizing judge could have granted the
authorization, the question is simply whether there was at least some
evidence that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the
authorization could have issued.

 

52                              
In oral argument, counsel for the appellant Grandmaison made much of a
passage in R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, at p. 251, where Sopinka J.
explained the test applicable on a review of a search warrant when some of the
information  supporting the warrant had been obtained in violation of the
Constitution.  Sopinka J. wrote that “it is necessary for reviewing courts to
consider whether the warrant would have been issued had the improperly
obtained facts been excised from the information sworn to obtain the warrant: Garofoli,
supra” (emphasis added).  In using the word “would”, Sopinka J. did not set
out to alter the test that comes from Garofoli, given that he cited this
judgment in the same sentence.  I take the word in this context not as setting
a different standard of review but simply as suggesting the sincerity of the
inquiry that a reviewing judge should undertake.  As this Court confirmed in Bisson,
supra, the reviewing judge must carefully consider the existence of
sufficient reliable information, that is, information that may
reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could have issued.

 








53                              
Other appellate court jurisprudence confirms this understanding.  In the
context of reviewing a search warrant, appellate courts have looked to whether
the authorization could have issued: e.g., Mitton v. British Columbia
Securities Commission (1999), 123 B.C.A.C. 263; R. v. Allain (1998),
205 N.B.R. (2d) 201 (C.A.), at p. 217; and R. v. Krist (1998), 113
B.C.A.C. 176, at p. 179.  But they look at this in context.  For example, in R.
v. Monroe (1997), 8 C.R. (5th) 324 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 333, Esson J.A. stated
that, after looking for whether there was sufficient grounds on which the judge
could have authorized a warrant, “The judge was then required to
assess the evidence placed before the justice, in the light of the evidence
brought out at trial, in order to determine whether, after expunging any
misleading or erroneous information, sufficient reliable information
remained to support the warrant” (emphasis added).

 

54                              
The authorities stress the importance of a contextual analysis.  The
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, while reviewing the cases from our Court cited
above, explains this in a judgment dealing with problems arising out of errors
committed in good faith by the police in the material submitted to the
authorizing justice of the peace:

 

These cases stress that errors, even fraudulent errors, do not
automatically invalidate the warrant. 

 

This does not mean that errors, particularly
deliberate ones, are irrelevant in the review process.  While not leading to
automatic vitiation of the warrant, there remains the need to protect the prior
authorization process.  The cases just referred to do not foreclose a reviewing
judge, in appropriate circumstances, from concluding on the totality of the
circumstances that the conduct of the police in seeking prior authorization
was so subversive of that process that the resulting warrant must be set aside
to protect the process and the preventive function it serves.  [Emphasis added.]

 

(R. v. Morris (1998), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 539, at p. 553) 

 

 

 

An approach
based on looking for sufficient reliable information in the totality of the
circumstances appropriately balances the need for judicial finality and the
need to protect prior authorization systems.  Again, the test is whether there
was reliable evidence that might reasonably be believed on the basis of
which the authorization could have issued, not whether in the opinion of
the reviewing judge, the application should have been granted at all by the
authorizing judge.








55                              
Of course, this statement of the test does not fully explain the matter
of which evidence the reviewing judge should consider in a situation where some
of the original information was erroneous and there is an attempt to amplify it
on review, a possibility which Sopinka J. in Garofoli, supra, at
p. 1452, but briefly mentioned.  The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Morris,
supra, at pp. 555-69, undertakes a careful examination of these questions
based on our Court’s analyses in R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, and Bisson,
supra. 

 

56                              
In Plant, supra, our Court considered a situation where
the information on a search warrant application compressed two parts of the
police investigation by stating that an informant had supplied the police with
a particular address when the informant actually supplied a precise description
of the house that enabled the police to identify its address.  The address
itself would be excised from the information on review, but Sopinka J., at pp.
298-99, allowed for the amplification of the information obtained from the
informant and concluded that, given that there was no deliberate attempt to
mislead, the information concerning the description of the house and the fact
that the police had found such a house at the address in question could still
contribute to the existence of reasonable and probable grounds.  As Morris,
supra, at p. 556 notes, only erroneous information “needs to be excluded
from consideration and that material, provided it is not part of a deliberate
attempt to mislead the Justice of the Peace, may be amplified by evidence on
review showing the true facts”.

 








57                              
In Bisson, supra, at p. 1098, our Court gave very short
reasons but also affirmed the reasons of Proulx J.A. in the Quebec Court of
Appeal, [1994] R.J.Q. 308, 87 C.C.C. (3d) 440.  In his judgment, Proulx J.A.
was clear that a court must look at non-disclosure of any material fact [translation] “with respect to the
affidavit considered as a whole, or even with respect to the remaining parts of
it” (p. 455 C.C.C.).  He quoted at p. 457 C.C.C. from the Ontario Court of
Appeal in Church of Scientology, supra, at pp. 528-29:
“[T]he function of the reviewing judge is to determine whether there is any
evidence remaining, after disregarding the allegations found to be false and
taking into consideration the facts found to have been omitted by the informant,
upon which the justice could be satisfied that a search warrant should issue”
(emphasis added) also affirmed in Morris, supra, at p. 558. 
Again, erroneous information is properly excised.  In Bisson, supra,
of course, the recanted information obviously had to be excised entirely and
the remaining information then assessed in the totality of the circumstances. 
Where the erroneous information results from a simple error and not from a
deliberate attempt to mislead the authorizing judge, amplification may be in
order.  Nonetheless, there would be no need to seek to amplify the record if
sufficient reliable material remains even after excising the erroneous
material. 

 

58                              
Thus, in looking for evidence that might reasonably be believed on the
basis of which the authorization could have issued, the reviewing court must
exclude erroneous information.  However, if it was erroneous despite good faith
on the part of the police, then amplification may correct this information.  

 








59                              
When using amplification, courts must strike a balance between two
fundamental principles of search and seizure law that come into a rather unique
tension in these kinds of situations: see Morris, supra, at
pp. 567-68.  As a result of this tension, the cases disclose divergent
attitudes to incomplete or incorrect affidavits and amplification thereof: see Morris,
at pp. 560-67; cf. R. v. Madrid (1994), 48 B.C.A.C. 271, at pp. 285-90,
and R. v. Harris (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 23 and 27
(leave to appeal refused, [1987] 2 S.C.R. vii).  The danger inherent in
amplification is that it might become a means of circumventing a prior
authorization requirement.  Since a prior authorization is fundamental to the
protection of everyone’s privacy interests (Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra,
at p. 160), amplification cannot go so far as to remove the requirement that
the police  make their case to the issuing judge, thereby turning the
authorizing procedure into a sham.  On the other hand, to refuse amplification
entirely would put form above substance in situations where the police had the
requisite reasonable and probable grounds and had demonstrated investigative
necessity but had, in good faith, made some minor, technical error in the
drafting of their affidavit material.  Courts must recognize (along with
investigative necessity) the two principles of prior authorization and probable
grounds, the verification of which may require a close examination of the
information available to the police at the time of the application for a
wiretap, in considering the jurisprudence on amplification.  The approach set
out earlier to erroneous information in an affidavit on a wiretap application
attempts to reconcile these principles.  Courts should take a similar approach
to amplification.  

 








60                              
In this case, any credibility issue related to the police officer was
temporally and logically far removed from the affidavit itself.  More than a
year after the swearing of the affidavit, Constable Rosset was found to lack
credibility on the issue of why he had not disclosed a drafting mistake, perhaps
a very minor typographical error.  There is no suggestion that there was ever
any untruthfulness in the substance of the information in the affidavit itself:
see the Court of Appeal judgment at para. 23.  In these circumstances, a global
finding against the entire affidavit was unreasonable.  That there were some
errors of a typographical nature in a 130-page affidavit is not even entirely
surprising.  The trial judge accepted that these errors were inadvertent. 
Although it is regrettable that the police did not adopt procedures as outlined
above that might have lessened the possibility of these kinds of errors, that
they did not do so does not provide grounds for jettisoning all the results of
a careful and lengthy investigation.  

 

61                              
Even without the information from sources “C” and “E”, the affidavit
would have provided ample evidence to an issuing judge and evidenced the
existence of probable grounds and investigative necessity.  Moreover,
amplification would allow for the reading of the information from the now
correctly attributed sources “C” and “E” as well, which could make only slight
differences on the weight given to small pieces of the evidence.  There was
still ample evidence in the rest of the affidavit to suggest that the
appellants were trafficking substantial quantities of cocaine.  Thus, given
that the affidavit met the requisite investigative necessity requirement, as it
was established above, there was no basis on which to overturn the
authorization.  The Court of Appeal was correct in upholding the issuing
judge’s authorization.          

 

VII.      Conclusion

 

62                              
For these reasons, which differ in part from those of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.  In the result, the
judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new
trial would thus be upheld.

Criminal law -- Search and seizure -- Search
warrants -- Criminal Code authorizing issuance of warrants to search for “evidence
with respect to the commission of an offence” -- Whether provision authorizes
granting of warrants to search for and seize evidence of negligence going to
defence of due diligence -- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
s. 487(1) (b).

 

A plant operated by the respondents discharged a
quantity of chlorine into the adjacent waters, killing a number of fish.  This
incident occurred during a power outage at the plant, which resulted from a
power line being struck by a tree.  The respondents reported the discharge to
the authorities and an investigation followed.  Five months after the
discharge, a fishery officer swore an information and obtained a warrant to
search the plant for a range of documents.  He later obtained an order for a
new warrant to reseize several items which had been returned and which were
relevant to the investigation.  The respondents were charged with offences
under the Fisheries Act  and the Waste Management Act.  They
subsequently brought a motion to quash the warrants, alleging that
s. 487(1)  of the Criminal Code , which provides for the issuance of
search warrants pertaining to “evidence with respect to the commission of an
offence”,  had been exceeded.  The chambers judge ruled that the documents
seized pertaining to the issue of due diligence were not documents with respect
to the commission of this particular offence and quashed both warrants.  The
Court of Appeal, in a majority decision, upheld the ruling.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 








Statutory provisions should be read to give the words
their most obvious ordinary meaning which accords with the context and purpose
of the enactment in which they occur.  On a plain reading, the phrase “evidence
with respect to the commission of an offence” is a broad statement,
encompassing all materials which might shed light on the circumstances of an
event which appears to constitute an offence.  Anything relevant or rationally
connected to the incident under investigation, the parties involved, and their
potential culpability falls within the scope of the warrant.  It can be assumed
that Parliament chose not to limit s. 487(1) to evidence establishing an
element of the Crown’s prima facie case.  To conclude otherwise would
effectively delete the phrase “with respect to” from the section.  While
s. 487(1) is broad enough to authorize the search in question even absent
this phrase, the inclusion of these words plainly supports the validity of
these warrants.  Although s. 487(1) is part of the Criminal Code ,
and may occasion significant invasions of privacy, the public interest requires
prompt and thorough investigation of potential offences.  It is with respect to
that interest that all relevant information and evidence should be located and
preserved as soon as possible.  This interpretation accords with the purposes
underlying the Criminal Code  and the demands of a fair and expeditious
administration of justice.  Furthermore, denying the Crown the ability to
gather evidence in anticipation of a defence would have serious consequences on
the functioning of our justice system.  While the broad powers contained in
s. 487(1)  do not authorize investigative fishing expeditions, nor do they
diminish the proper privacy interests of individuals or corporations, in this
case the specific terms of the warrant were not at issue, as the respondents
challenged only the underlying authority to grant warrants for the purpose of
investigating the presence of negligence.  Both a plain reading of the relevant
section and consideration of the role and obligations of state investigators
support the conclusion that s. 487(1)  authorized the granting of the
warrants in question.

//Major J.//  

 

1                                  
Major J. --  This appeal
raises the question of whether search warrants issued under s. 487(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , authorize investigators to
search for and seize evidence of negligence in the investigation of strict
liability offences.  At the conclusion of argument the question was answered in
the affirmative and the appeal was allowed with reasons to follow.

 

I.   Facts

 

2                                  
On October 13, 1994 a chlor-alkali plant operated by the respondents
(collectively referred to as “CanadianOxy”) in North Vancouver, British
Columbia discharged a quantity of chlorine into the waters of Burrard Inlet,
killing a number of fish.  This incident occurred during a three and a half
hour power outage at the plant, as a result of one of two B.C. Hydro 60 kv
power lines servicing the plant being struck by a tree.  

 








3                                  
The company reported the discharge to the authorities and an
investigation by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans followed.  Fishery
Officer Robert Tompkins went to the plant that night, spoke with the Plant
Chemist, and seized a number of documents.  He also seized samples of dead fish
recovered in the vicinity of the plant by the Harbour Master’s patrol vessel. 
He advised the Plant Manager that he had reasonable grounds to believe that an
offence had been committed under the Fisheries Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.
F-14 . 

 

4                                  
Over a short time  Tompkins made three further visits to the plant,
formally interviewed the Plant Chemist, was shown the valve which the company
had identified as the cause of the discharge and was provided with certain
documents.  His request to interview additional employees was refused.  

 

5                                  
Tompkins subsequently made a written request to CanadianOxy’s counsel
for additional technical information believed relevant for Environment Canada’s
Pollution Abatement Division to assess whether the discharge had been
preventable.  Only a few of these questions were answered. 

 

6                                  
On March 16, 1995, five months after the discharge, Tompkins swore an
information and obtained a warrant to search the respondents’ plant for a range
of documents relating to process records, plant maintenance, employee training,
discipline, and general plant operations.  In the information, Tompkins
described the reasons for seeking this information:

 

The business records . . . are required to establish and prove that
CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. . . .  operate a chlor‑alkali plant that
discharges effluent to the waters of Burrard Inlet near North Vancouver, B.C.,
that the release of effluent with a chlorine concentration exceeding 10 ppm,
which I know would be acutely lethal to fish, occurred on October 13, 1994, and
that the company could have taken additional reasonable measures to prevent the
release of a deleterious substance into water frequented by fish.... 

 








. . . I have reasonable grounds to believe that correspondence had been
generated by company personnel in January 1994, and that maintenance was
performed in March 1994, and again in October 1994, and that the company
conducted their own investigation, prepared reports, and provided information
regarding the incident until February 1995. . . .

 

It is necessary to examine effluent discharge records, effluent water
quality sampling and analysis records, mechanical and instrument maintenance
records, environmental control records, instrument calibration records and flow
rate calculation records covering an extended period of time before and after
October 13, 1994.  This will . . . permit analysis of the maintenance programs
undertaken by CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd.

 

It is necessary to examine company personnel records covering the
period between January 1, 1994 and February 28, 1995 . . . to determine if any
company employees have been disciplined in any manner as a result of this
incident. . . .

 

7                                  
The warrant was executed on March 17, 1995.  In total 139 items were
seized pursuant to the warrant, and 73 additional items were seized under the
investigators’ understanding of the “plain view” doctrine.  Following the
search, Tompkins learned by coincidence of an adverse ruling by a British
Columbia Provincial Court judge on the validity of a similar seizure in an
unrelated case.  As a result, he sought legal advice with respect to a number
of the items taken. 

 

8                                  
On April 26, 1995, Tompkins made two applications to a Justice of the
Peace, one for an order to return the documents which had been improperly
seized under the first warrant, and the second for a new warrant to re-seize 13
of the items returned which were relevant to the investigation.   These orders
were granted and executed the same day.   

 

9                                  
On June 15, 1995 the respondents were charged with:

 

(a)   depositing, or permitting the deposit, of a
deleterious substance in waters frequented by fish, contrary to ss. 36(3)  and
40(2)  of the Fisheries Act ; and 








(b)   introducing, or causing or allowing the
introduction of waste into the environment, contrary to ss. 3(1.1) and 34(3) of
the Waste Management Act, S.B.C. 1982, c. 41 (now R.S.B.C. 1996, c.
482).

 

10                              
The respondents subsequently brought a motion to quash the warrants
alleging that s. 487(1)  of the Criminal Code  had been exceeded.  The
warrants were broad enough to authorize a search for evidence of negligence
which if found would negate a defence of due diligence.

 

II.   Judicial
History

 

A.  British
Columbia Supreme Court (1996), 138 D.L.R. (4th) 104

 

11                              
Sigurdson J. felt bound by Re Domtar Inc.  (1995), 18 C.E.L.R.
(N.S.) 106 (B.C.S.C.), which held that a s. 487 warrant could not be used to
search for and seize evidence of negligence going to the defence of due diligence. 
As a result, he ruled that the documents seized pertaining to the issue of due
diligence were not documents with respect to the commission of this particular
offence and quashed both warrants.

 

B.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1997), 145 D.L.R. (4th) 427

 

12                              
In dismissing the appeal, Goldie J.A. (Carrothers J.A. concurring) held
that the appellant had failed to demonstrate on any reasonable construction
that s. 487(1) (b) authorizes the issuance of a warrant that includes a
search for evidence with respect to due diligence in a regulatory offence.  In
dissent, Southin J.A. concluded that a warrant can issue upon proper evidence
to search for and seize things relating to the question of due diligence. 








 

III.   Analysis


 

13                              
At issue is whether search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487(1)  of the Criminal
Code  are limited only to evidence relevant to an element of the offence
which is part of the Crown’s prima facie case, or whether such warrants
encompass evidence that may relate to potential defences, such as due
diligence, which may or may not be raised at the trial.  The relevant section
of the Code provides:

 

487. (1)  A justice who is satisfied by
information on oath in Form 1 that there are reasonable grounds to believe that
there is in a building, receptacle or place

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(b) anything that there are reasonable grounds to believe will
afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence, or will
reveal the whereabouts of a person who is believed to have committed an
offence, against this Act or any other Act of Parliament,

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

may at any time issue a warrant under his hand authorizing a person
named therein or a peace officer 

 

(d) to search the building, receptacle or place for any such
thing and to seize it . . .  [Emphasis added.]

 

14                              
Statutory provisions should be read to give the words their most obvious
ordinary meaning which accords with the context and purpose of the enactment in
which they occur; Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27,
at paras. 21-22.  It is only when genuine ambiguity arises between two or more
plausible readings, each equally in accordance with the intentions of the
statute, that the courts need to resort to external interpretive aids.  In our
opinion there is no such ambiguity in s. 487(1) .

 








A.  The
Ordinary Meaning of the Words

 

15                              
On a plain reading, the phrase “evidence with respect to the commission
of an offence” is a broad statement, encompassing all materials which might
shed light on the circumstances of an event which appears to constitute an
offence.  The natural and ordinary meaning of this phrase is that anything
relevant or rationally connected to the incident under investigation, the
parties involved, and their potential culpability falls within the scope of the
warrant. 

 

16                              
This reading is supported by Dickson J.’s interpretation of almost
identical language in Nowegijick v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29, at p.
39: 

 

The words “in respect of” are, in my opinion, words
of the widest possible scope.  They import such meanings as “in relation
to”, “with  reference to” or “in connection with”.  The phrase “in respect of”
is probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection
between two related subject matters.  [Emphasis added.]

 

17                              
We can assume that Parliament chose not to limit s. 487(1) to evidence
establishing an element of the Crown’s prima facie case.  To conclude
otherwise would effectively delete the phrase “with respect to” from the
section.  While s. 487(1) is broad enough to authorize the search in question
even absent this phrase, the inclusion of these words plainly supports the
validity of these warrants.

 








18                              
The respondents urged that s. 487(1) be given a restrictive reading in
accordance with the principle that an ambiguous penal statute should be
interpreted in a manner most favourable to an accused:  see R. v. McIntosh,
[1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at para. 39.  That argument was rejected as, in our
opinion, this section is neither ambiguous, nor the type of penal provisions to
which the rule should apply.  Instead, s. 487 should be given a liberal and
purposive interpretation; Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , s.
12 .

 

19                              
While s. 487(1) is part of the Criminal Code , and may occasion
significant invasions of privacy, the public interest requires prompt and
thorough investigation of potential offences.  It is with respect to that
interest that all relevant information and evidence should be located
and preserved as soon as possible.  This interpretation accords with the
purposes underlying the Criminal Code  and the demands of a  fair and
expeditious administration of justice.  

 

B.  Purpose
of the Search Warrant Provisions of the Criminal Code

 

20                              
A primary, though not exclusive, purpose of the Criminal Code ,
and penal statutes in general, is to promote a safe, peaceful and honest
society,   This is achieved by providing guidelines prohibiting unacceptable
conduct, and providing for the just prosecution and punishment of those who
transgress these norms.  The prompt and comprehensive investigation of
potential offences is essential to fulfilling that purpose.  The point of the
investigative phase is to gather all the relevant evidence in order to allow a
responsible and informed decision to be made as to whether charges should be
laid.

 

21                              
At the investigative stage the authorities are charged with determining
the following:  What happened?  Who did it?  Is the conduct criminally culpable
behaviour?  Search warrants are a staple investigative tool for answering those
questions, and the section authorizing their issuance must be interpreted in
that light. 

 








22                              
The purpose of s. 487(1) is to allow the investigators to unearth and
preserve as much relevant evidence as possible.  To ensure that the authorities
are able to perform their appointed functions properly they should be able to
locate, examine and preserve all the evidence relevant to events which may have
given rise to criminal liability.  It is not the role of the police to
investigate and decide whether the essential elements of an offence are made
out  –  that decision is the role of the courts.  The function of the police,
and other peace officers, is to investigate incidents which might be criminal,
make a conscientious and informed decision as to whether charges should be
laid, and then present the full and unadulterated facts to the prosecutorial
authorities.  To that end an unnecessary and restrictive interpretation of s.
487(1) defeats its purpose.  See Re Church of Scientology and the Queen (No.
6) (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 449, p. 475:

 

Police work should not be frustrated by the
meticulous examination of facts and law that is appropriate to a trial process.
. . .  There may be serious questions of law as to whether what is asserted
amounts to a criminal offence. . . .   However, these issues can hardly be
determined before the Crown has marshalled its evidence and is in a position to
proceed  with the prosecution. 

 

23                              
Moreover, extrinsic factors such as the accused’s motive or the failure
to exercise due diligence are often relevant to determining whether the event
which triggered the investigation in the first place is criminally culpable. 
Everyone, including accused persons, who lacks the means of obtaining and
preserving evidence prior to trial has an interest in seeing that these facts
are brought to light.  It would be undesirable if a narrow reading of s. 487(1)
resulted in either inculpatory or exculpatory evidence being lost because of
the investigators’ inability to secure it.  See R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1
S.C.R. 241, per Cory J., at p. 254:

 

The essential role of the police is to investigate crimes.  That role
and function can and should continue after they have made a lawful arrest.  The
continued investigation will benefit society as a whole and not infrequently
the arrested person.  It is in the interest of the innocent arrested person
that the investigation continue so that he or she may be cleared of the charges
as quickly as possible.








24                              
It is important that an investigation unearth as much evidence as
possible. It is antithetical to our system of justice to proceed on the basis
that the police, and other authorities, should only search for evidence which
incriminates their chosen suspect.  Such prosecutorial “tunnel vision” would
not be appropriate:  see The Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul
Morin: Report, vol. 1 (1998), per the Honourable F. Kaufman
at pp. 479-82.  

 

25                              
In Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, Lamer J. (later
C.J.C.) stated for the majority that: 

 

Traditionally the Crown Attorney has been described as a “minister of
justice” and “ought to regard himself as part of the Court rather than as an
advocate”. (Morris Manning, “Abuse of Power by Crown Attorneys”, [1979] L.S.U.C.
Lectures 571, at p. 580, quoting Henry Bull, Q.C.)  As regards the proper
role of the Crown Attorney, perhaps no more often quoted statement is that of
Rand J. in Boucher v. The Queen,  [1955] S.C.R. 16, at pp. 23‑24:

 

It cannot be over‑emphasized that the purpose
of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a
jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is
alleged to be a crime.  Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal
proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its
legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly.  The role of prosecutor
excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public
duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal
responsibility.

 

26                              
The majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal found that the word
“commission” in s. 487(1) restricted its application to evidence that the
accused had done those acts, or allowed those omissions, which constitute the
elements of the offence.  The criminal justice system is not solely concerned
with whether a prima facie case can be made out against an accused, but
whether he or she is ultimately guilty.  The dissenting reasons of
Southin J.A. are persuasive on both the purpose and meaning of s. 487(1).  At
para. 63 she stated:








 

. . .  I would translate the words in issue to mean “touching upon
whether a breach of the law involving a penal sanction has occurred”.  Whether
or not there can be said to have been such a breach depends upon whether there
can be a penal sanction and there can be no sanction without a conviction.

 

27                              
In addition, as pointed out by the intervener Attorney General of
Ontario, denying the Crown the ability to gather evidence in anticipation of a
defence would have serious consequences on the functioning of our justice
system.  In order to be fair, the criminal process must “enable the trier of
fact to ‘get at the truth and properly and fairly dispose of the case’ while at
the same time providing the accused with the opportunity to make a full
defence”; R. v. Levogiannis, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475, at p. 486.  This
reciprocal fairness demands that the Crown be able to fairly seek and obtain
evidence rebutting the accused’s defences.  If the respondents’ submission on
the interpretation of s. 487(1) were accepted, a search warrant would never be
available for this purpose.  This narrow interpretation would frustrate the
basic imperative of trial fairness and the search for truth in the criminal
process.

 

C.   Privacy
Concerns

 








28                              
There is no doubt that search warrants are highly intrusive, and that an
investigation bearing on the issue of due diligence could, as Shaw J. pointed
out in Re Domtar, supra, at p. 119, “entail a detailed inquiry
into the affairs of a corporation over a period of several years”.  This Court
has endorsed the importance of privacy and the need to constrain search powers
within reasonable limits: Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R.
145; Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, at p. 889;  Thomson
Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Research and Investigation, Restrictive
Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at pp. 520-22; Baron
v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at pp. 436-37.

 

29                      The broad powers contained in s. 487(1) do not authorize
investigative fishing expeditions, nor do they diminish the proper privacy
interests of individuals or corporations.  This is particularly true with
respect to personnel records which may contain a great deal of highly personal
information unrelated to the investigation at hand.  Judges and magistrates
should continue to apply the standards and safeguards which protect privacy
from unjustified searches and seizures.   

 

29                              
In this case, however, the specific terms of the warrant were not at
issue, as the respondents challenged only the underlying authority to grant
warrants for the purpose of investigating the presence of negligence.  In our
opinion both a plain reading of the relevant section and consideration of the
role and obligations of state investigators support the conclusion that s.
487(1) authorized the granting of the warrants at issue.

Criminal law ‑‑ Sentencing ‑‑
Aboriginal offenders ‑‑ Accused sentenced to three years’
imprisonment after pleading guilty to manslaughter ‑‑ No special

The accused, an aboriginal woman, pled guilty to
manslaughter for the killing of her common law husband and was sentenced to
three years’ imprisonment.  On the night of the incident, the accused was
celebrating her 19th birthday and drank beer with some friends and family
members, including the victim.  She suspected the victim was having an affair with
her older sister and, when her sister left the party, followed by the victim,
the accused told her friend, “He’s going to get it.  He’s really going to get
it this time”.  She later found the victim and her sister coming down the
stairs together in her sister’s home.  She believed that they had been engaged
in sexual activity.  When the accused and the victim returned to their
townhouse, they started to quarrel.  During the argument, the accused
confronted the victim with his infidelity and he told her that she was fat and
ugly and not as good as the others.  A few minutes later, the victim fled their
home.  The accused ran toward him with a large knife and stabbed him in the
chest. When returning to her home, she was heard saying “I got you, you fucking
bastard”.  There was also evidence indicating that she had stabbed the victim
on the arm before he left the townhouse.  At the time of the stabbing, the
accused had a blood‑alcohol content of between 155 and 165 milligrams of
alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.

 








At the sentencing hearing, the judge took into account
several mitigating factors.  The accused was a young mother and, apart from an
impaired driving conviction, she had no criminal record.  Her family was
supportive and, while on bail,  she had attended alcohol abuse counselling and
upgraded her education.  The accused was provoked by the victim’s insulting
behaviour and remarks.  At the time of the offence, the accused had a
hyperthyroid condition which caused her to overreact to emotional situations. 
She showed some signs of remorse and entered a plea of guilty.  The sentencing
judge also identified several aggravating circumstances.  The accused stabbed
the deceased twice, the second time after he had fled in an attempt to escape. 
From the remarks she made before and after the stabbing it was clear that the
accused intended to harm the victim.  Further, she was not afraid of the
victim; she was the aggressor. The judge considered that the principles of
denunciation and general deterrence must play a role in the present
circumstances even though specific deterrence was not required.  He also
indicated that the sentence should take into account the need to rehabilitate
the accused.  The judge decided that a suspended sentence or a conditional
sentence of imprisonment was not appropriate in this case. He noted that there
were no special circumstances arising from the aboriginal status of the accused
and the victim that he should take into consideration.  Both were living in an
urban area off‑reserve and not “within the aboriginal community as
such”.  The sentencing judge concluded that the offence was a very serious one,
for which the appropriate sentence was three years’ imprisonment.  The majority
of the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused’s appeal of her sentence.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

The considerations which should
be taken into account by a judge sentencing an aboriginal offender have been
summarized at para. 93 of the reasons for judgment. The following is a reflection
of that summary.

 








Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  codifies
the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing and the factors that
should be considered by a judge in striving to determine a sentence that is fit
for the offender and the offence.  In that Part, s. 718.2(e)
mandatorily requires sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions
other than imprisonment and to pay particular attention to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders. The provision is not simply a codification of existing
jurisprudence.  It is remedial in nature and is designed to ameliorate the
serious problem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people in prisons, and to
encourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to
sentencing. There is a judicial duty to give the provision’s remedial purpose
real force.  Section 718.2 (e) must be read in the context of the
rest of the factors referred to in that section and in light of all of
Part XXIII.  In determining a fit sentence, all principles and factors set
out in that Part must be taken into consideration.  Attention should be paid to
the fact that Part XXIII, through certain provisions,  has placed a new
emphasis upon decreasing the use of incarceration.

 








Sentencing is an individual process and in each case
the consideration must continue to be what is a fit sentence for this accused
for this offence in this community.  The effect of s. 718.2(e),
however, is to alter the method of analysis which sentencing judges must use in
determining a fit sentence for aboriginal offenders.  Section 718.2(e)
directs judges to undertake the sentencing of such offenders individually, but
also differently, because the circumstances of aboriginal people are unique. 
In sentencing an aboriginal offender, the judge must consider:  (a) the unique
systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the
particular aboriginal offender before the courts; and (b) the types of
sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the
circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal
heritage or connection.  In order to undertake these considerations the
sentencing judge will require information pertaining to the accused.  Judges may
take judicial notice of the broad systemic and background factors affecting
aboriginal people, and of the priority given in aboriginal cultures to a
restorative approach to sentencing.  In the usual course of events, additional
case‑specific information will come from counsel and from a pre‑sentence
report which takes into account the systemic or background factors and the
appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions, which in turn may come from
representations of the relevant aboriginal community.  The offender may waive
the gathering of that information. The absence of alternative sentencing
programs specific to an aboriginal community does not eliminate the ability of
a sentencing judge to impose a sanction that takes into account principles of
restorative justice and the needs of the parties involved.  

 

If there is no alternative to incarceration the length
of the term must be carefully considered.  The jail term for an aboriginal
offender may in some circumstances be less than the term imposed on a non‑aboriginal
offender for the same offence. However,  s. 718.2(e) is not to be
taken as a means of automatically reducing the prison sentence of aboriginal
offenders; nor should it be assumed that an offender is receiving a more
lenient sentence simply because incarceration is not imposed.  It is also
unreasonable to assume that aboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance
of traditional sentencing goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and
separation, where warranted.  In this context, generally, the more serious and
violent the crime, the more likely it will be as a practical matter that the
terms of imprisonment will be the same for similar offences and offenders,
whether the offender is aboriginal or non‑aboriginal.

 

Section 718.2(e) applies to all aboriginal
persons wherever they reside, whether on‑ or off‑reserve, in a
large city or a rural area.  In defining the relevant aboriginal community for
the purpose of achieving an effective sentence, the term “community” must be
defined broadly so as to include any network of support and interaction that
might be available, including one in an urban centre.  At the same time, the
residence of the aboriginal offender in an urban centre that lacks any network
of support does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to try to
find an alternative to imprisonment.

 








In this case, the sentencing judge  may have erred in
limiting the application of s. 718.2(e) to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders living in rural areas or on‑reserve. Moreover, he
does not appear to have considered the systemic or background factors which may
have influenced the accused to engage in criminal conduct, or the possibly
distinct conception of sentencing held by the accused, by the victim’s family,
and by their community.  The majority of the Court of Appeal, in dismissing the
accused’s appeal, also does not appear to have considered many of the relevant
factors.  Although  in most cases such errors would be sufficient to justify
sending the matter back for a new sentencing hearing, in these circumstances it
would not be in the interests of justice to order a new hearing in order to
canvass the accused’s circumstances as an aboriginal offender.  Both the
sentencing judge and all members of the Court of Appeal acknowledged that the
offence was a particularly serious one.  For that offence by this offender a
sentence of three years’ imprisonment was not unreasonable. More importantly,
the accused was granted,  subject to certain conditions,  day parole after she
had served six months in a correctional centre and, about a year ago, was
granted full parole with the same conditions.  The results of the sentence with
incarceration for six months and the subsequent controlled release were in the
interests of both the accused and society.

Cory and Iacobucci JJ.--
On September 3, 1996, the new Part XXIII of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , pertaining to sentencing came into force.  These
provisions codify for the first time the fundamental purpose and principles of
sentencing.  This appeal is particularly concerned with the new s. 718.2 (e). 
It provides that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.  This appeal
must consider how this provision should be interpreted and applied.








 

I.  Factual Background

 

2                                  
The appellant, one of nine children, was born in McLennan, Alberta in
1976.  Her mother, Marie Gladue, who was a Cree, left the family home in 1987
and died in a car accident in 1990.  After 1987, the appellant and her siblings
were raised by their father, Lloyd Chalifoux, a Metis.  The appellant and the
victim Reuben Beaver started to live together in 1993, when the appellant was
17 years old.  Thereafter they had a daughter, Tanita.  In August 1995, they
moved to Nanaimo.  Together with the appellant’s father and two of her
siblings, Tara and Bianca Chalifoux, they lived in a townhouse complex.  By
September 1995, the appellant and Beaver were engaged to be married, and the
appellant was five months pregnant with their second child, a boy, whom the
appellant subsequently named Reuben Ambrose Beaver in honour of his father.

 

3                                  
In the early evening of September 16, 1995, the appellant was
celebrating her 19th birthday.  She and Reuben Beaver, who was then 20, were
drinking beer with some friends and family members in the townhouse complex. 
The appellant suspected that Beaver was having an affair with her older sister,
Tara.  During the course of the evening she voiced those suspicions to her
friends.  The appellant was obviously angry with Beaver.  She said, “the next
time he fools around on me, I’ll kill him”. The appellant told one of her
friends that she wanted to test Beaver, and asked her friend to “hit on Reuben
to see if he would go with her”, but the friend refused.

 








4                                  
The appellant’s sister Tara left the party, followed by Beaver.  After
he had left, the appellant told her friend, “He’s going to get it.  He’s really
going to get it this time.”  The appellant, on several occasions, tried to find
Beaver and her sister.  She eventually located them coming down the stairs
together in her sister’s suite.  The appellant suspected that they had been
engaged in sexual activity and confronted her sister, saying, “You’re going to
get it.  How could you do this to me?”

 

5                                  
The appellant and Beaver returned separately to their townhouse and they
started to quarrel.  During the argument, the appellant confronted him with his
infidelity and he told her that she was fat and ugly and not as good as the
others.  A neighbour, Mr. Gretchin, who lived next door was awakened by
some banging and shouting and a female voice saying “I’m sick and tired of you
fooling around with other women.”  The disturbance was becoming very loud and
he decided to ask his neighbours to calm down.  He heard the front door of the
appellant’s residence slam.  As he opened his own front door, he saw the
appellant come running out of her suite.  He also saw Reuben Beaver banging
with both hands at Tara Chalifoux’s door down the hall saying, “Let me in.  Let
me in.”

 

6                                  
Mr. Gretchin saw the appellant run toward Beaver with a large knife in
her hand and, as she approached him, she told him that he had better run.  Mr.
Gretchin heard Beaver shriek in pain and saw him collapse in a pool of blood. 
The appellant had stabbed Beaver once in the left chest, and the knife had
penetrated his heart.  As the appellant went by on her return to her apartment,
Mr. Gretchin heard her say, “I got you, you fucking bastard.”  The appellant
was described as jumping up and down as if she had tagged someone.  Mr. Gretchin
said she did not appear to realize what she had done.  At the time of the
stabbing, the appellant had a blood‑alcohol content of between 155 and
165 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.

 








7                                  
On June 3, 1996, the appellant was charged with second degree murder. 
On February 11, 1997, following a preliminary hearing and after a jury had been
selected, the appellant entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter.

 

8                                  
There was evidence which indicated that the appellant had stabbed Beaver
before he fled from the apartment.  A paring knife found on the living room
floor of their apartment had a small amount of Beaver’s blood on it, and a
small stab wound was located on Beaver’s right upper arm.

 

9                                  
There was also evidence that Beaver had subjected the appellant to some
physical abuse in June 1994, while the appellant was pregnant with their
daughter Tanita.  Beaver was convicted of assault, and was given a 15‑day
intermittent sentence with one year’s probation.  The neighbour, Mr. Gretchin,
told police that the noises emanating from the appellant’s and Beaver’s
apartment suggested a fight, stating: “It sounded like someone got hit and
furniture was sliding, like someone pushed around” and “The fight lasted five
to ten minutes, it was like a wrestling match.”  Bruises later observed on the
appellant’s arm and in the collarbone area were consistent with her having been
in a physical altercation on the night of the stabbing.  However, the trial
judge found that the facts as presented before him did not warrant a finding
that the appellant was a “battered or fearful wife”.

 








10                              
The appellant’s sentencing took place 17 months after the stabbing. 
Pending her trial, she was released on bail and lived with her father.  She
took counselling for alcohol and drug abuse at Tillicum Haus Native Friendship
Centre in Nanaimo, and completed Grade 10 and was about to start Grade 11. 
After the stabbing, the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from a hyperthyroid
condition, which was said to produce an exaggerated reaction to any emotional
situation.  The appellant underwent radiation therapy to destroy some of her
thyroid glands, and at the time of sentencing she was taking thyroid
supplements which regulated her condition.  During the time she was on bail,
the appellant pled guilty to having breached her bail on one occasion by
consuming alcohol.

 

11                              
At the sentencing hearing, when asked if she had anything to say, the
appellant stated that she was sorry about what happened, that she did not
intend to do it, and that she was sorry to Beaver’s family.

 

12                              
In his submissions on sentence at trial, the appellant’s counsel did not
raise the fact that the appellant was an aboriginal offender but, when asked by
the trial judge whether in fact the appellant was an aboriginal person, replied
that she was Cree.  When asked by the trial judge whether the town of McLennan,
Alberta, where the appellant grew up, was an aboriginal community, defence
counsel responded: “it’s just a regular community”.  No other submissions were
made at the sentencing hearing on the issue of the appellant’s aboriginal
heritage. Defence counsel requested a suspended sentence or a conditional
sentence of imprisonment.  Crown counsel argued in favour of a sentence of
between three and five years’ imprisonment.

 

13                              
The appellant was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and to a
ten-year weapons prohibition.  Her appeal of the sentence to the British
Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed.

 

 

 

II.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 








14                              
It may be helpful at this stage to set out ss. 718 , 718.1  and 718.2 
of the Criminal Code  as well as s. 12  of the Interpretation Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. I‑21 .

 

Criminal
Code 

 

                                       Purpose
and Principles of Sentencing

 

718.  [Purpose]  The fundamental
purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention
initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and
safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a)   to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b)   to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

 

(c)   to separate offenders from society, where necessary;

 

(d)   to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

 

(e)  to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 

(f)  to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

 

718.1   [Fundamental principle]  A
sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender.

 

718.2  [Other sentencing principles]  A
court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following
principles:

 

(a)        a sentence should be increased or reduced to account
for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the
offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

 

(i)     evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or
hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex,
age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar
factor,

 

(ii)    evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused
the offender’s spouse or child,

 

(iii)    evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused
a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or

 








(iv)   evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at
the direction of or in association with a criminal organization

 

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

 

(b)  a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on
similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

 

(c)    where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined
sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;

 

(d)   an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less
restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and

 

(e)   all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

12.  Every enactment is deemed remedial, and
shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as
best ensures the attainment of its objects.

 

III.  Judicial History

 

A.  Supreme Court of British Columbia

 








15                              
In his reasons, the trial judge took into account several mitigating
factors.  The appellant was only 20 years old at the time of sentence, and
apart from an impaired driving conviction, she had no criminal record.  She had
two children and was expecting a third although he considered her pregnancy a
neutral factor.  Her family was supportive and she was attending alcohol abuse
counselling and upgrading her education.  The appellant was provoked by the
deceased’s insulting behaviour and remarks.  At the time of the offence, the
appellant had a hyperthyroid condition which caused her to overreact to
emotional situations.  The appellant showed some signs of remorse and entered a
plea of guilty.

 

16                              
On the other hand, the trial judge identified several aggravating
circumstances.  The appellant stabbed the deceased twice, the second time after
he had fled in an attempt to escape.  Also, the offence was of particular
gravity.  From the remarks she made before and after the stabbing it was very
clear that the appellant intended to harm the deceased.  Further, the appellant
was not afraid of the deceased; indeed, she was the aggressor.

 

17                              
The trial judge considered that specific deterrence was not required in
the circumstances of this case.  However, in his opinion the principles of
denunciation and general deterrence must play a role.  He was of the view that
the sentence should also take into account the need to rehabilitate the
appellant and give her some insight both into her conduct and the effect of her
propensity to drink.  The trial judge decided that in this case it was not
appropriate to suspend the passing of sentence or to impose a conditional
sentence.

 

18                              
The trial judge noted that both the appellant and the deceased were
aboriginal, but stated that they were living in an urban area off-reserve and
not “within the aboriginal community as such”.  He found that there were not
any special circumstances arising from their aboriginal status that he should
take into consideration.  He stated that the offence was a very serious one,
for which the appropriate sentence was three years’ imprisonment with a
ten-year weapons prohibition.

 








B.  Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1997), 98
B.C.A.C. 120

 

19                              
The appellant appealed her sentence of three years’ imprisonment, but
not the ten-year weapons prohibition.  She appealed on four grounds, only one
of which is directly relevant, namely whether the trial judge failed to give
appropriate consideration to the appellant’s circumstances as an aboriginal
offender.  The appellant also sought to adduce fresh evidence at her appeal
regarding her efforts since the killing to maintain links with her aboriginal
heritage.  The fresh evidence showed that the appellant had applied to become a
full status Cree, and that she had obtained that status for her daughter
Tanita.  She had also maintained contact with Beaver’s mother, who is a status
Cree, and who was in turn assisting the appellant with the status applications.

 

20                              
The Court of Appeal unanimously concluded that the trial judge had erred
in concluding that s. 718.2 (e) did not apply because the appellant
was not living on a reserve.  However, Esson J.A. (Prowse J.A. concurring)
found no error in the trial judge’s conclusion that, in this case, there was no
basis for giving special consideration to the appellant’s aboriginal
background.  Esson J.A. noted that the appellant’s actions involved
deliberation, motivation, and “an element of viciousness and persistence in the
attack”, and that the killing constituted a “near murder” (p. 138).  He found that,
on the facts presented in this case, it could not be said that the sentence, if
a fit one for a non‑aboriginal person, would not also be fit for an
aboriginal person.  Esson J.A. concluded therefore that the trial judge did not
err in not giving effect to the principle set out in s. 718.2 (e) of
the Criminal Code  and dismissed the appeal.  Although it is not entirely
clear from the reasons of Esson J.A., he appears also to have dismissed the
appellant’s application to adduce fresh evidence regarding her efforts to
maintain links with her aboriginal heritage.

 








21                              
Rowles J.A. (dissenting) reviewed many reports and parliamentary debates
and determined that the mischief that s. 718.2 (e) was designed to
remedy was the excessive use of incarceration generally, and the
disproportionately high number of aboriginal people who are imprisoned, in
particular.  She stated that s. 718.2 (e) invites recognition and
amelioration of the impact which systemic discrimination in the criminal
justice system has upon aboriginal people.  She referred to the importance of
acknowledging and implementing the different conceptions of criminal justice
and of appropriate criminal sanctions held by many aboriginal peoples,
including, in particular, the conception of criminal justice as involving a
strong restorative element.

 

22                              
In this case, Rowles J.A. agreed that the crime committed by the
appellant was serious.  The circumstances surrounding the offence were tragic
for everyone, including the appellant’s children.  Yet, the circumstances of
the offence included provocation, superimposed on an undiagnosed medical
problem affecting the appellant’s emotional stability.  The offender was young
and emotionally immature.  She had an alcohol problem but no history of other
criminal conduct or acts of violence.  The success the appellant enjoyed while
on bail awaiting trial showed that she was likely to be a good candidate for
further rehabilitation.  Rowles J.A. also referred favourably to the fresh
evidence which showed that the appellant was taking steps to maintain links
with her aboriginal heritage.

 

23                              
Rowles J.A. concluded that a sentence of three years’ imprisonment was
excessive.  The principles of general deterrence and denunciation had to be
reflected in the sentence, but the sentence could have been designed to advance
the appellant’s rehabilitation through a period of supervised probation. 
Rowles J.A. would have allowed the appeal and reduced the sentence to two years
less a day to be followed by a three-year period of probation.








 

IV.  Issue

 

24                              
The issue in this appeal is the proper interpretation and application to
be given to s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code .  The provision
reads as follows:

 

718.2  A court that imposes a sentence shall
also take into consideration the following principles:

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(e)  all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are
reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

 

The question
to be resolved is whether the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
erred in finding that, in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge
correctly applied s. 718.2 (e) in imposing a sentence of three
years’ imprisonment.  To answer this question, it will be necessary to
determine the legislative purpose of s. 718.2 (e), and, in
particular, the words “with particular attention to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders”.  The appeal requires this Court to begin the process of
articulating the rules and principles that should govern the practical
application of s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code  by a trial
judge.

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Introduction

 








25                              
As this Court has frequently stated, the proper construction of a
statutory provision flows from reading the words of the provision in their
grammatical and ordinary sense and in their entire context, harmoniously with
the scheme of the statute as a whole, the purpose of the statute, and the
intention of Parliament.  The purpose of the statute and the intention of
Parliament, in particular, are to be determined on the basis of intrinsic and
admissible extrinsic sources regarding the Act’s legislative history and the context
of its enactment: Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27,
at paras. 20‑23; R. v. Chartrand, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, at
p. 875; E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at
p. 87; Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), by
R. Sullivan, at p. 131.

 

26                              
Also of importance in interpreting federal legislation is s. 12 of
the federal Interpretation Act , which provides:

 

12.  Every enactment is deemed
remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and
interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.

 

27                              
Section 718.2(e) has already received judicial consideration in
several provincial appellate court decisions:  see, e.g., R. v. McDonald
(1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 418 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. J. (C.) (1997), 119
C.C.C. (3d) 444 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Wells (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 129
(Alta. C.A.); R. v. Hunter (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 121 (Alta. C.A.); R.
v. Young (1998), 131 Man. R. (2d) 61 (C.A.).  This is the first occasion on
which this Court has had the opportunity to construe and apply the provision.

 








28                              
With this introduction, we now wish to discuss the wording of
s. 718.2 (e) and the scheme of Part XXIII of the Criminal
Code , as well as the legislative history and the context behind
s. 718.2 (e), with the aim of determining and describing the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders.  This discussion is followed by a
framework for the sentencing judge to use in sentencing an aboriginal
offender.  The reasons then deal with the specific facts and sentence in this
case.

 

B.  The Wording of Section 718.2 (e) and the Scheme of
Part XXIII

 

29                              
The interpretation of s. 718.2 (e) must begin by considering
its words in context.  Although this appeal is ultimately concerned only with
the meaning of the phrase “with particular attention to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders”, that phrase takes on meaning from the other words of
s. 718.2 (e), from the purpose and principles of sentencing set out
in ss. 718 ‑718.2, and from the overall scheme of Part XXIII.

 

30                              
The respondent observed that some caution is in order in construing
s. 718.2 (e), insofar as it would be inappropriate to prejudge the
many other important issues which may be raised by the reforms but which are
not specifically at issue here.  However, it would be equally inappropriate to
construe s. 718.2 (e) in a vacuum, without considering the
surrounding text which gives the provision its depth of meaning.  To the extent
that the broader scheme of Part XXIII informs the proper construction to
be given to s. 718.2 (e), it will be necessary to draw at least some
general conclusions about the new sentencing regime.

 








31                              
A core issue in this appeal is whether s. 718.2 (e) should be
understood as being remedial in nature, or whether s. 718.2 (e),
along with the other provisions of ss. 718  through 718.2, are simply a
codification of existing sentencing principles.  The respondent,
although acknowledging that s. 718.2 (e) was likely designed to
encourage sentencing judges to experiment to some degree with alternatives to
incarceration and to be sensitive to principles of restorative justice, at the
same time favours the view that ss. 718 ‑718.2 are largely a
restatement of existing law.  Alternatively, the appellant argues strongly that
s. 718.2 (e)’s specific reference to aboriginal offenders can have
no purpose unless it effects a change in the law.  The appellant advances the
view that s. 718.2 (e) is in fact an “affirmative action” provision
justified under s. 15(2)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

32                              
Section 12  of the Interpretation Act  deems the purpose of the
enactment of the new Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  to be remedial
in nature, and requires that all of the provisions of Part XXIII,
including s. 718.2(e), be given a fair, large and liberal
construction and interpretation in order to attain that remedial objective. 
However, the existence of s. 12  does not answer the essential question of
what the remedial purpose of s. 718.2 (e) is.  One view is that the
remedial purpose of ss. 718 , 718.1  and 718.2  taken together was precisely
to codify the purpose and existing principles of sentencing to provide more
systematic guidance to sentencing judges in individual cases. Codification,
under this view, is remedial in and of itself because it simplifies and adds
structure to trial level sentencing decisions: see, e.g., McDonald, supra,
at pp. 460‑64, per Sherstobitoff J.A.

 








33                              
In our view, s. 718.2(e) is more than simply a re‑affirmation
of existing sentencing principles.  The remedial component of the provision
consists not only in the fact that it codifies a principle of sentencing, but,
far more importantly, in its direction to sentencing judges to undertake the
process of sentencing aboriginal offenders differently, in order to endeavour
to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in the particular case.  It should
be said that the words of s. 718.2(e) do not alter the fundamental
duty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is fit for the offence
and the offender.  For example, as we will discuss below, it will generally be
the case as a practical matter that particularly violent and serious offences
will result in imprisonment for aboriginal offenders as often as for
non-aboriginal offenders.  What s. 718.2(e) does alter is the
method of analysis which each sentencing judge must use in determining the
nature of a fit sentence for an aboriginal offender.  In our view, the scheme
of Part XXIII of the Criminal Code , the context underlying the
enactment of s. 718.2 (e), and the legislative history of the
provision all support an interpretation of s. 718.2 (e) as having
this important remedial purpose.

 

34                              
In his submissions before this Court, counsel for the appellant
expressed the fear that s. 718.2(e) might come to be interpreted
and applied in a manner which would have no real effect upon the day‑to‑day
practice of sentencing aboriginal offenders in Canada.  In light of the tragic
history of the treatment of aboriginal peoples within the Canadian criminal
justice system, we do not consider this fear to be unreasonable.  In our view,
s. 718.2(e) creates a judicial duty to give its remedial purpose
real force.

 

35                              
Let us consider now the wording of s. 718.2(e) and its place
within the overall scheme of Part XXIII of the Criminal Code .

 

36                              
Section 718.2(e) directs a court, in imposing a sentence, to
consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in
the circumstances for all offenders, “with particular attention to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders”.   The broad role of the provision is
clear.  As a general principle, s. 718.2(e) applies to all
offenders, and states that imprisonment should be the penal sanction of last
resort.  Prison is to be used only where no other sanction or combination of sanctions
is appropriate to the offence and the offender. 

 








37                              
The next question is the meaning to be attributed to the words “with
particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders”.  The phrase
cannot be an instruction for judges to pay “more” attention when sentencing
aboriginal offenders.  It would be unreasonable to assume that Parliament
intended sentencing judges to prefer certain categories of offenders over
others.  Neither can the phrase be merely an instruction to a sentencing judge
to consider the circumstances of aboriginal offenders just as she or he would
consider the circumstances of any other offender.  There would be no point in
adding a special reference to aboriginal offenders if this was the case. 
Rather, the logical meaning to be derived from the special reference to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders, juxtaposed as it is against a general
direction to consider “the circumstances” for all offenders, is that sentencing
judges should pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal
offenders because those circumstances are unique, and different from
those of non‑aboriginal offenders.  The fact that the reference to
aboriginal offenders is contained in s. 718.2(e), in particular,
dealing with restraint in the use of imprisonment, suggests that there is
something different about aboriginal offenders which may specifically make
imprisonment a less appropriate or less useful sanction.

 








38                              
The wording of s. 718.2(e) on its face, then, requires both
consideration of alternatives to the use of imprisonment as a penal sanction
generally, which amounts to a restraint in the resort to imprisonment as a
sentence, and recognition by the sentencing judge of the unique circumstances
of aboriginal offenders.  The respondent argued before this Court that this
statutory wording does not truly effect a change in the law, as some courts
have in the past taken the unique circumstances of an aboriginal offender into
account in determining sentence.  The respondent cited some of the recent
jurisprudence dealing with sentencing circles, as well as the decision of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Fireman (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 82,
in support of the view that s. 718.2(e) should be seen simply as a
codification of the state of the case law regarding the sentencing of
aboriginal offenders before Part XXIII came into force in 1996.  In a
similar vein, it was observed by Sherstobitoff J.A. in McDonald, supra,
at pp. 463‑64, that it has always been a principle of sentencing
that courts should consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment
that are reasonable in the circumstances.  Thus the general principle of
restraint expressed in s. 718.2(e) with respect to all offenders
might equally be seen as a codification of existing law.

 

39                              
With respect for the contrary view, we do not interpret s. 718.2(e)
as expressing only a restatement of existing law, either with respect to the
general principle of restraint in the use of prison or with respect to the
specific direction regarding aboriginal offenders.  One cannot interpret the
words of s. 718.2(e) simply by looking to past cases to see if they
contain similar statements of principle.  The enactment of the new
Part XXIII was a watershed, marking the first codification and significant
reform of sentencing principles in the history of Canadian criminal law. Each
of the provisions of Part XXIII, including s. 718.2(e), must
be interpreted in its total context, taking into account its surrounding
provisions.

 

40                              
It is true that there is ample jurisprudence supporting the principle
that prison should be used as a sanction of last resort.  It is equally true,
though, that the sentencing amendments which came into force in 1996 as the new
Part XXIII have changed the range of available penal sanctions in a
significant way.  The availability of the conditional sentence of imprisonment,
in particular, alters the sentencing landscape in a manner which gives an
entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should be resorted to
only where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the circumstances.  The
creation of the conditional sentence suggests, on its face, a desire to lessen
the use of incarceration.  The general principle expressed in s. 718.2(e)
must be construed and applied in this light.

 








41                              
Further support for the view that s. 718.2(e)’s expression
of the principle of restraint in sentencing is remedial, rather than simply a
codification, is provided by the articulation of the purpose of sentencing in
s. 718 .

 

42                              
Traditionally, Canadian sentencing jurisprudence has focussed primarily
upon achieving the aims of separation, specific and general deterrence,
denunciation, and rehabilitation.  Sentencing, like the criminal trial process
itself, has often been understood as a conflict between the interests of the
state (as expressed through the aims of separation, deterrence, and
denunciation) and the interests of the individual offender (as expressed
through the aim of rehabilitation).  Indeed, rehabilitation itself is a
relative late‑comer to the sentencing analysis, which formerly favoured
the interests of the state almost entirely.

 

43                              
Section 718 now sets out the purpose of sentencing in the following
terms:

 

718.  The fundamental purpose of
sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to
respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by
imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

 

(a)        to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b)        to deter the offender and other persons from
committing offences;

 

(c)         to separate offenders from
society, where necessary;

 

(d)        to assist in rehabilitating
offenders;

 

(e)         to provide reparations for harm done to victims
or to the community; and

 

(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.  [Emphasis
added.]

 








Clearly,
s. 718 is, in part, a restatement of the basic sentencing aims, which are
listed in paras. (a) through (d).  What are new, though, are
paras. (e) and (f), which along with para. (d) focus upon
the restorative goals of repairing the harms suffered by individual victims and
by the community as a whole, promoting a sense of responsibility and an
acknowledgment of the harm caused on the part of the offender, and attempting
to rehabilitate or heal the offender.  The concept of restorative justice which
underpins paras. (d), (e), and (f) is briefly discussed
below, but as a general matter restorative justice involves some form of
restitution and reintegration into the community.  The need for offenders to
take responsibility for their actions is central to the sentencing process: D.
Kwochka, “Aboriginal Injustice: Making Room for a Restorative Paradigm” (1996),
60 Sask. L. Rev. 153, at p. 165.  Restorative sentencing goals do not usually
correlate with the use of prison as a sanction.  In our view, Parliament’s
choice to include (e) and (f) alongside the traditional
sentencing goals must be understood as evidencing an intention to expand the
parameters of the sentencing analysis for all offenders.  The principle of
restraint expressed in s. 718.2(e) will necessarily be informed by
this re‑orientation.

 








44                              
Just as the context of Part XXIII supports the view that
s. 718.2(e) has a remedial purpose for all offenders, the scheme of
Part XXIII also supports the view that s. 718.2(e) has a
particular remedial role for aboriginal peoples.  The respondent is correct to
point out that there is jurisprudence which pre‑dates the enactment of
s. 718.2(e) in which aboriginal offenders have been sentenced
differently in light of their unique circumstances.  However, the existence of
such jurisprudence is not, on its own, especially probative of the issue of
whether s. 718.2(e) has a remedial role.  There is also sentencing
jurisprudence which holds, for example, that a court must consider the unique
circumstances of offenders who are battered spouses, or who are mentally
disabled.  Although the validity of the principles expressed in this latter
jurisprudence is unchallenged by the 1996 sentencing reforms, one does not find
reference to these principles in Part XXIII.  If Part XXIII were
indeed a codification of principles regarding the appropriate method of
sentencing different categories of offenders, one would expect to find such
references.  The wording of s. 718.2(e), viewed in light of the
absence of similar stipulations in the remainder of Part XXIII, reveals
that Parliament has chosen to single out aboriginal offenders for particular
attention.

 

C.  Legislative History

 

45                              
Support for the foregoing understanding of s. 718.2(e) as
having the remedial purpose of restricting the use of prison for all offenders,
and as having a particular remedial role with respect to aboriginal peoples, is
provided by statements made by the Minister of Justice and others at the time
that what was then Bill C‑41 was before Parliament.  Although these
statements are clearly not decisive as to the meaning and purpose of
s. 718.2(e), they are nonetheless helpful, particularly insofar as
they corroborate and do not contradict the meaning and purpose to be derived
upon a reading of the words of the provision in the context of Part XXIII
as a whole:  Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes, supra, at paras. 31 and 35.

 

46                              
For instance, in introducing second reading of Bill C‑41 on
September 20, 1994 (House of Commons Debates, vol. IV, 1st Sess., 35th
Parl., at pp. 5871 and 5873), Minister of Justice Allan Rock made the
following statements regarding the remedial purpose of the bill:

 

Through this bill, Parliament provides the
courts with clear guidelines . . . .

 

                                                                   .
. .

 








The bill also defines various sentencing
principles, for instance that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity
of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility.  When
appropriate, alternatives must be contemplated, especially in the case of
Native offenders. 

 

                                                                   . . .

 

A general principle that runs throughout Bill C‑41
is that jails should be reserved for those who should be there.  Alternatives
should be put in place for those who commit offences but who do not need or
merit incarceration.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Jails and prisons will be there for those who
need them, for those who should be punished in that way or separated from
society. . . .  [T]his bill creates an environment which encourages
community sanctions and the rehabilitation of offenders together with
reparation to victims and promoting in criminals a sense of accountability for
what they have done.  

 

It is not simply by being more harsh that we
will achieve more effective criminal justice.  We must use our scarce resources
wisely.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The Minister’s
statements were echoed by other Members of Parliament and by Senators during
the debate over the bill: see, e.g., House of Commons Debates, vol. V,
1st Sess., 35th Parl., September 22, 1994, at p. 6028 (Mr. Morris Bodnar);
Debates of the Senate, vol. 135, No. 99, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., June 21,
1995, at p. 1871 (Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman).

 

47                              
In his subsequent testimony before the House of Commons Standing
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs (Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence,
Issue No. 62, November 17, 1994, at p. 62:15), the Minister of Justice
addressed the specific role the government hoped would be played by s. 718.2(e):

 








[T]he reason we referred specifically there to aboriginal persons is
that they are sadly overrepresented in the prison populations of Canada.  I
think it was the Manitoba justice inquiry that found that although aboriginal
persons make up only 12% of the population of Manitoba, they comprise over 50%
of the prison inmates.  Nationally aboriginal persons represent about 2% of
Canada’s population, but they represent 10.6% of persons in prison.  Obviously
there’s a problem here.

 

What we’re trying to do, particularly having
regard to the initiatives in the aboriginal communities to achieve community
justice, is to encourage courts to look at alternatives where it’s consistent
with the protection of the public ‑‑ alternatives to jail ‑‑
and not simply resort to that easy answer in every case.  [Emphasis added.]

 

48                              
It can be seen, therefore, that the government position when Bill C‑41
was under consideration was that the new Part XXIII was to be remedial in
nature. The proposed enactment was directed, in particular, at reducing the use
of prison as a sanction, at expanding the use of restorative justice principles
in sentencing, and at engaging in both of these objectives with a sensitivity
to aboriginal community justice initiatives when sentencing aboriginal
offenders.

 

D.  The Context of the Enactment of Section 718.2(e)

 

49                              
Further guidance as to the scope and content of Parliament’s remedial
purpose in enacting s. 718.2(e) may be derived from the social
context surrounding the enactment of the provision.  On this point, it is worth
noting that, although there is quite a wide divergence between the positions of
the appellant and the respondent as to how s. 718.2(e) should be
applied in practice, there is general agreement between them, and indeed
between the parties and all interveners, regarding the mischief in response to
which s. 718.2(e) was enacted.

 








50                              
The parties and interveners agree that the purpose of s. 718.2(e)
is to respond to the problem of overincarceration in Canada, and to respond, in
particular, to the more acute problem of the disproportionate incarceration of
aboriginal peoples.  They also agree that one of the roles of s. 718.2(e),
and of various other provisions in Part XXIII, is to encourage sentencing
judges to apply principles of restorative justice alongside or in the place of
other, more traditional sentencing principles when making sentencing
determinations.  As the respondent states in its factum before this Court,
s. 718.2(e) “provides the necessary flexibility and authority for
sentencing judges to resort to the restorative model of justice in sentencing
aboriginal offenders and to reduce the imposition of jail sentences where to do
so would not sacrifice the traditional goals of sentencing”.

 

51                              
The fact that the parties and interveners are in general agreement among
themselves regarding the purpose of s. 718.2(e) is not
determinative of the issue as a matter of statutory construction.  However, as
we have suggested, on the above points of agreement the parties and interveners
are correct.  A review of the problem of overincarceration in Canada, and of
its peculiarly devastating impact upon Canada’s aboriginal peoples, provides
additional insight into the purpose and proper application of this new
provision.

 

(1)  The Problem of
Overincarceration in Canada

 








52                              
Canada is a world leader in many fields, particularly in the areas of
progressive social policy and human rights.  Unfortunately, our country is also
distinguished as being a world leader in putting people in prison.  Although
the United States has by far the highest rate of incarceration among
industrialized democracies, at over 600 inmates per 100,000 population,
Canada’s rate of approximately 130 inmates per 100,000 population places it
second or third highest: see  Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers
Responsible for Justice, Corrections Population Growth: First Report on
Progress (1997), Annex B, at p. 1; Bulletin of U.S. Bureau of Justice
Statistics, Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 1998 (March 1999); The
Sentencing Project, Americans Behind Bars: U.S. and International Use of
Incarceration, 1995 (June 1997), at p. 1.  Moreover, the rate at
which Canadian courts have been imprisoning offenders has risen sharply in
recent years, although there has been a slight decline of late: see Statistics
Canada, “Prison population and costs” in Infomat: A Weekly Review
(February 27, 1998), at p. 5.  This record of incarceration rates
obviously cannot instil a sense of pride.

 

53                              
The systematic use of the sanction of imprisonment in Canada may be
dated to the building of the Kingston Penitentiary in 1835.  The penitentiary
sentence was itself originally conceived as an alternative to the harsher
penalties of death, flogging, or imprisonment in a local jail.  Sentencing
reformers advocated the use of penitentiary imprisonment as having effects
which were not only deterrent, denunciatory, and preventive, but also
rehabilitative, with long hours spent in contemplation and hard work
contributing to the betterment of the offender:  see Law Reform Commission of Canada,
Working Paper 11, Imprisonment and Release (1975), at p. 5.

 

54                              
Notwithstanding its idealistic origins, imprisonment quickly came to be
condemned as harsh and ineffective, not only in relation to its purported
rehabilitative goals, but also in relation to its broader public goals.  The
history of Canadian commentary regarding the use and effectiveness of
imprisonment as a sanction was recently well summarized by Vancise J.A.,
dissenting in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in McDonald, supra,
at pp. 429‑30:

 

A number of inquiries and commissions have been
held in this country to examine, among other things, the effectiveness of the
use of incarceration in sentencing.  There has been at least one commission or
inquiry into the use of imprisonment in each decade of this century since 1914.
. . .

 








. . . An examination of the recommendations of
these reports reveals one constant theme: imprisonment should be avoided if
possible and should be reserved for the most serious offences, particularly
those involving violence.  They all recommend restraint in the use of
incarceration and recognize that incarceration has failed to reduce the crime
rate and should be used with caution and moderation.  Imprisonment has
failed to satisfy a basic function of the Canadian judicial system which was
described in the Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections entitled:
“Toward Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections” (1969) as “to protect society
from crime in a manner commanding public support while avoiding needless injury
to the offender”.  [Emphasis added; footnote omitted.]

 

55                              
In a similar vein, in 1987, the Canadian Sentencing Commission wrote in
its report entitled Sentencing Reform:  A Canadian Approach, at
pp. xxiii‑xxiv:

 

Canada does not imprison as high a portion of its
population as does the United States.  However, we do imprison more people than
most other western democracies.  The Criminal Code  displays an apparent
bias toward the use of incarceration since for most offences the penalty
indicated is expressed in terms of a maximum term of imprisonment.  A number of
difficulties arise if imprisonment is perceived to be the preferred sanction
for most offences.  Perhaps most significant is that although we regularly
impose this most onerous and expensive sanction, it accomplishes very little
apart from separating offenders from society for a period of time.  In the
past few decades many groups and federally appointed committees and commissions
given the responsibility of studying various aspects of the criminal justice
system have argued that imprisonment should be used only as a last resort
and/or that it should be reserved for those convicted of only the most serious
offences.  However, although much has been said, little has been done to move
us in this direction.  [Emphasis added.]

 

56                              
With equal force, in Taking Responsibility (1988), at p. 75,
the Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General stated:

 

It is now generally recognized that imprisonment
has not been effective in rehabilitating or reforming offenders, has not been
shown to be a strong deterrent, and has achieved only temporary public
protection and uneven retribution, as the lengths of prison sentences handed
down vary for the same type of crime.

 

Since imprisonment generally offers the public
protection from criminal behaviour for only a limited time, rehabilitation of
the offender is of great importance.  However, prisons have not generally
been effective in reforming their inmates, as the high incidence of recidivism
among prison populations shows.








The use of imprisonment as a main response to a
wide variety of offences against the law is not a tenable approach in practical
terms.  Most offenders are neither violent nor dangerous.  Their behaviour
is not likely to be improved by the prison experience.  In addition, their
growing numbers in jails and penitentiaries entail serious problems of expense
and administration, and possibly increased future risks to society.  Moreover,
modern technology may now permit the monitoring in the community of some
offenders who previously might have been incarcerated for incapacitation or
denunciation purposes.  Alternatives to imprisonment and intermediate
sanctions, therefore, are increasingly viewed as necessary developments.
[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

 

The Committee
proposed that alternative forms of sentencing should be considered for those
offenders who did not endanger the safety of others.  It was put in this way,
at pp. 50 and 54:

 

[O]ne of the primary foci of such alternatives must be on techniques
which contribute to offenders accepting responsibility for their criminal
conduct and, through their subsequent behaviour, demonstrating efforts to
restore the victim to the position he or she was in prior to the offence and/or
providing a meaningful apology.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[E]xcept where to do so would place the community at undue risk, the
“correction” of the offender should take place in the community and
imprisonment should be used with restraint.

 

57                              
Thus, it may be seen that although imprisonment is intended to serve the
traditional sentencing goals of separation, deterrence, denunciation, and
rehabilitation, there is widespread consensus that imprisonment has not been
successful in achieving some of these goals.  Overincarceration is a
long-standing problem that has been many times publicly acknowledged but never
addressed in a systematic manner by Parliament.  In recent years, compared to
other countries, sentences of imprisonment in Canada have increased at an
alarming rate.  The 1996 sentencing reforms embodied in Part XXIII, and
s. 718.2(e) in particular, must be understood as a reaction to the
overuse of prison as a sanction, and must accordingly be given appropriate
force as remedial provisions.








 

(2)  The Overrepresentation of
Aboriginal Canadians in Penal Institutions

 

58                              
If overreliance upon incarceration is a problem with the general
population, it is of much greater concern in the sentencing of aboriginal
Canadians.  In the mid-1980s, aboriginal people were about 2 percent of the
population of Canada, yet they made up 10 percent of the penitentiary
population.  In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, aboriginal people constituted
something between 6 and 7 percent of the population, yet in Manitoba they
represented 46 percent of the provincial admissions and in Saskatchewan 60 percent: 
see M. Jackson, “Locking Up Natives in Canada” (1988-89), 23 U.B.C. L. Rev.
215 (article originally prepared as a report of the Canadian Bar Association
Committee on Imprisonment and Release in June 1988), at pp. 215‑16. 
The situation has not improved in recent years.  By 1997, aboriginal peoples
constituted closer to 3 percent of the population of Canada and amounted to 12
percent of all federal inmates: Solicitor General of Canada, Consolidated
Report, Towards a Just, Peaceful and Safe Society: The Corrections and
Conditional Release Act  -- Five Years Later (1998), at pp. 142‑55. 
The situation continues to be particularly worrisome in Manitoba, where in 1995‑96
they made up 55 percent of admissions to provincial correctional facilities,
and in Saskatchewan, where they made up 72 percent of admissions.  A similar,
albeit less drastic situation prevails in Alberta and British Columbia:
Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Adult Correctional Services in
Canada, 1995‑96 (1997), at p. 30.

 








59                              
This serious problem of aboriginal overrepresentation in Canadian
prisons is well documented.  Like the general problem of overincarceration
itself, the excessive incarceration of aboriginal peoples has received the
attention of a large number of commissions and inquiries: see, by way of
example only, Canadian Corrections Association, Indians and the Law
(1967); Law Reform Commission of Canada, The Native Offender and the Law
(1974), prepared by D. A. Schmeiser; Public Inquiry into the
Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People, Report of the Aboriginal
Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, vol. 1, The Justice System and Aboriginal
People (1991); Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Bridging the
Cultural Divide (1996).

 

60                              
In “Locking Up Natives in Canada”, supra, at pp. 215‑16,
Jackson provided a disturbing account of the enormity of the disproportion:

 

Statistics about crime are often not well
understood by the public and are subject to variable interpretation by the
experts.  In the case of the statistics regarding the impact of the criminal
justice system on native people the figures are so stark and appalling that the
magnitude of the problem can be neither misunderstood nor interpreted away. 
Native people come into contact with Canada’s correctional system in numbers
grossly disproportionate to their representation in the community.  More than
any other group in Canada they are subject to the damaging impacts of the
criminal justice system’s heaviest sanctions.  Government figures ‑‑
which reflect different definitions of “native” and which probably
underestimate the number of prisoners who consider themselves native ‑‑
show that almost 10% of the federal penitentiary population is native
(including 13% of the federal women’s prisoner population) compared to about 2%
of the population nationally. . . .  Even more disturbing, the
disproportionality is growing.  In 1965 some 22% of the prisoners in Stony
Mountain Penitentiary were native; in 1984 this proportion was 33%.  It is
realistic to expect that absent radical change, the problem will intensify due
to the higher birth rate in native communities.

 

Bad as this situation is within the federal system,
it is even worse in a number of the western provincial correctional systems.
. . .  A study reviewing admissions to Saskatchewan’s correctional
system in 1976‑77 appropriately titled “Locking Up Indians in
Saskatchewan”, contains findings that should shock the conscience of everyone
in Canada.  In comparison to male non‑natives, male treaty Indians were
25 times more likely to be admitted to a provincial correctional centre while
non‑status Indians or Métis were 8 times more likely to be admitted.  If
only the population over fifteen years of age is considered (the population
eligible to be admitted to provincial correctional centres in Saskatchewan),
then male treaty Indians were 37 times more likely to be admitted, while male
non‑status Indians were 12 times more likely to be admitted.  For women
the figures are even more extreme: a treaty Indian woman was 131 times more
likely to be admitted and a non‑status or Métis woman 28 times more
likely than a non‑native.

 








The Saskatchewan study brings home the implications
of its findings by indicating that a treaty Indian boy turning 16 in 1976 had a
70% chance of at least one stay in prison by the age of 25 (that age range
being the one with the highest risk of imprisonment).  The corresponding figure
for non‑status or Métis was 34%.  For a non‑native Saskatchewan boy
the figure was 8%.  Put another way, this means that in Saskatchewan, prison
has become for young native men, the promise of a just society which high
school and college represent for the rest of us.  Placed in an historical
context, the prison has become for many young native people the contemporary
equivalent of what the Indian residential school represented for their parents. 
[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

 

61                              
Not surprisingly, the excessive imprisonment of aboriginal people is
only the tip of the iceberg insofar as the estrangement of the aboriginal
peoples from the Canadian criminal justice system is concerned.  Aboriginal
people are overrepresented in virtually all aspects of the system.  As this
Court recently noted in R. v. Williams, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128, at para. 58,
there is widespread bias against aboriginal people within Canada, and “[t]here
is evidence that this widespread racism has translated into systemic
discrimination in the criminal justice system”.

 

62                              
Statements regarding the extent and severity of this problem are
disturbingly common.  In Bridging the Cultural Divide, supra, at
p. 309, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples listed as its first
“Major Findings and Conclusions” the following striking yet representative
statement:

 

The Canadian criminal justice system has failed the Aboriginal peoples
of Canada ‑‑ First Nations, Inuit and Métis people, on‑reserve
and off‑reserve, urban and rural ‑‑ in all territorial and
governmental jurisdictions.  The principal reason for this crushing failure is
the fundamentally different world views of Aboriginal and non‑Aboriginal
people with respect to such elemental issues as the substantive content of
justice and the process of achieving justice.

 








63                              
To the same effect, the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba described
the justice system in Manitoba as having failed aboriginal people on a “massive
scale”, referring particularly to the substantially different cultural values
and experiences of aboriginal people: The Justice System and Aboriginal
People, supra, at pp. 1 and 86. 

 

64                              
These findings cry out for recognition of the magnitude and gravity of
the problem, and for responses to alleviate it.  The figures are stark and
reflect what may fairly be termed a crisis in the Canadian criminal justice
system.  The drastic overrepresentation of aboriginal peoples within both the
Canadian prison population and the criminal justice system reveals a sad and
pressing social problem.  It is reasonable to assume that Parliament, in
singling out aboriginal offenders for distinct sentencing treatment in
s. 718.2(e), intended to attempt to redress this social problem to
some degree.  The provision may properly be seen as Parliament’s direction to
members of the judiciary to inquire into the causes of the problem and to
endeavour to remedy it, to the extent that a remedy is possible through the
sentencing process.

 








65                              
It is clear that sentencing innovation by itself cannot remove the
causes of aboriginal offending and the greater problem of aboriginal alienation
from the criminal justice system.  The unbalanced ratio of imprisonment for
aboriginal offenders flows from a number of sources, including poverty,
substance abuse, lack of education, and the lack of employment opportunities
for aboriginal people.  It arises also from bias against aboriginal people and
from an unfortunate institutional approach that is more inclined to refuse bail
and to impose more and longer prison terms for aboriginal offenders.  There are
many aspects of this sad situation which cannot be addressed in these reasons. 
What can and must be addressed, though, is the limited role that sentencing
judges will play in remedying injustice against aboriginal peoples in Canada. 
Sentencing judges are among those decision‑makers who have the power to
influence the treatment of aboriginal offenders in the justice system.  They
determine most directly whether an aboriginal offender will go to jail, or
whether other sentencing options may be employed which will play perhaps a
stronger role in restoring a sense of balance to the offender, victim, and
community, and in preventing future crime.

 

E.  A Framework of Analysis for the Sentencing Judge

 

(1)  What Are the “Circumstances of
Aboriginal Offenders”?

 

66                              
How are sentencing judges to play their remedial role?  The words of
s. 718.2(e) instruct the sentencing judge to pay particular
attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders, with the implication
that those circumstances are significantly different from those of non‑aboriginal
offenders.  The background considerations regarding the distinct situation of
aboriginal peoples in Canada encompass a wide range of unique circumstances,
including, most particularly:

 

(A)  The unique systemic or background factors
which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender
before the courts; and

 

(B)  The types of sentencing procedures and
sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender
because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection.

 

(a)  Systemic and Background
Factors

 








67                              
The background factors which figure prominently in the causation of
crime by aboriginal offenders are by now well known.  Years of dislocation and
economic development have translated, for many aboriginal peoples, into low
incomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or
irrelevance of education, substance abuse, loneliness, and community
fragmentation.  These and other factors contribute to a higher incidence of
crime and incarceration.  A disturbing account of these factors is set out by
Professor Tim Quigley, “Some Issues in Sentencing of Aboriginal Offenders”, in Continuing
Poundmaker and Riel’s Quest (1994), at pp. 269‑300.  Quigley ably
describes the process whereby these various factors produce an
overincarceration of aboriginal offenders, noting (at pp. 275-76) that “[t]he
unemployed, transients, the poorly educated are all better candidates for
imprisonment.  When the social, political and economic aspects of our society
place Aboriginal people disproportionately within the ranks of the latter, our
society literally sentences more of them to jail.”

 

68                              
It is true that systemic and background factors explain in part the
incidence of crime and recidivism for non‑aboriginal offenders as well. 
However, it must be recognized that the circumstances of aboriginal offenders
differ from those of the majority because many aboriginal people are victims of
systemic and direct discrimination, many suffer the legacy of dislocation, and
many are substantially affected by poor social and economic conditions. 
Moreover, as has been emphasized repeatedly in studies and commission reports,
aboriginal offenders are, as a result of these unique systemic and background
factors, more adversely affected by incarceration and less likely to be
“rehabilitated” thereby, because the internment milieu is often culturally
inappropriate and regrettably discrimination towards them is so often rampant
in penal institutions.

 








69                              
In this case, of course, we are dealing with factors that must be
considered by a judge sentencing an aboriginal offender.  While background and
systemic factors will also be of importance for a judge in sentencing a non‑aboriginal
offender, the judge who is called upon to sentence an aboriginal offender must
give attention to the unique background and systemic factors which may have
played a part in bringing the particular offender before the courts.  In cases
where such factors have played a significant role, it is incumbent upon the
sentencing judge to consider these factors in evaluating whether imprisonment
would actually serve to deter, or to denounce crime in a sense that would be
meaningful to the community of which the offender is a member.  In many
instances, more restorative sentencing principles will gain primary relevance
precisely because the prevention of crime as well as individual and social
healing cannot occur through other means.

 

(b)  Appropriate Sentencing
Procedures and Sanctions

 

70                              
Closely related to the background and systemic factors which have
contributed to an excessive aboriginal incarceration rate are the different
conceptions of appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions held by
aboriginal people.  A significant problem experienced by aboriginal people who
come into contact with the criminal justice system is that the traditional
sentencing ideals of deterrence, separation, and denunciation are often far
removed from the understanding of sentencing held by these offenders and their
community.  The aims of restorative justice as now expressed in paras. (d),
(e), and (f) of s. 718  of the Criminal Code  apply to
all offenders, and not only aboriginal offenders.  However, most traditional
aboriginal conceptions of sentencing place a primary emphasis upon the
ideals of restorative justice.  This tradition is extremely important to the
analysis under s. 718.2 (e).

 








71                              
The concept and principles of a restorative approach will necessarily
have to be developed over time in the jurisprudence, as different issues and
different conceptions of sentencing are addressed in their appropriate
context.  In general terms, restorative justice may be described as an approach
to remedying crime in which it is understood that all things are interrelated
and that crime disrupts the harmony which existed prior to its occurrence, or
at least which it is felt should exist.  The appropriateness of a particular
sanction is largely determined by the needs of the victims, and the community, as
well as the offender.  The focus is on the human beings closely affected by the
crime. See generally, e.g., Bridging the Cultural Divide, supra,
at pp. 12‑25; The Justice System and Aboriginal People, supra,
at pp. 17‑46;  Kwochka, supra; M. Jackson, “In Search of the
Pathways to Justice: Alternative Dispute Resolution in Aboriginal Communities”,
[1992] U.B.C. L. Rev. (Special Edition) 147.

 

72                              
The existing overemphasis on incarceration in Canada may be partly due
to the perception that a restorative approach is a more lenient approach to
crime and that imprisonment constitutes the ultimate punishment.  Yet in our
view a sentence focussed on restorative justice is not necessarily a “lighter”
punishment.  Some proponents of restorative justice argue that when it is
combined with probationary conditions it may in some circumstances impose a
greater burden on the offender than a custodial sentence.  See Kwochka, supra,
who writes at p. 165:

 

At this point there is some divergence among
proponents of restorative justice.  Some seek to abandon the punishment
paradigm by focusing on the differing goals of a restorative system.  Others,
while cognizant of the differing goals, argue for a restorative system in terms
of a punishment model.  They argue that non‑custodial sentences can have
an equivalent punishment value when produced and administered by a restorative
system and that the healing process can be more intense than incarceration. 
Restorative justice necessarily involves some form of restitution and
reintegration into the community.  Central to the process is the need for
offenders to take responsibility for their actions.  By comparison,
incarceration obviates the need to accept responsibility.  Facing victim and
community is for some more frightening than the possibility of a term of
imprisonment and yields a more beneficial result in that the offender may
become a healed and functional member of the community rather than a bitter
offender returning after a term of imprisonment.

 








73                              
In describing in general terms some of the basic tenets of traditional
aboriginal sentencing approaches, we do not wish to imply that all aboriginal
offenders, victims, and communities share an identical understanding of
appropriate sentences for particular offences and offenders.  Aboriginal
communities stretch from coast to coast and from the border with the United
States to the far north.  Their customs and traditions and their concept of
sentencing vary widely.  What is important to recognize is that, for many if
not most aboriginal offenders, the current concepts of sentencing are
inappropriate because they have frequently not responded to the needs,
experiences, and perspectives of aboriginal people or aboriginal communities.

 

74                              
It is unnecessary to engage here in an extensive discussion of the
relatively recent evolution of innovative sentencing practices, such as healing
and sentencing circles, and aboriginal community council projects, which are
available especially to aboriginal offenders.  What is important to note is
that the different conceptions of sentencing held by many aboriginal people
share a common underlying principle: that is, the importance of community‑based
sanctions.  Sentencing judges should not conclude that the absence of
alternatives specific to an aboriginal community eliminates their ability to
impose a sanction that takes into account principles of restorative justice and
the needs of the parties involved.  Rather, the point is that one of the unique
circumstances of aboriginal offenders is that community‑based sanctions
coincide with the aboriginal concept of sentencing and the needs of aboriginal
people and communities.  It is often the case that neither aboriginal offenders
nor their communities are well served by incarcerating offenders, particularly
for less serious or non-violent offences.  Where these sanctions are reasonable
in the circumstances, they should be implemented.  In all instances, it is
appropriate to attempt to craft the sentencing process and the sanctions
imposed in accordance with the aboriginal perspective.

 








(2)  The Search for a Fit Sentence

 

75                              
The role of the judge who sentences an aboriginal offender is, as for
every offender, to determine a fit sentence taking into account all the
circumstances of the offence, the offender, the victims, and the community. 
Nothing in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  alters this fundamental
duty as a general matter.  However, the effect of s. 718.2 (e),
viewed in the context of Part XXIII as a whole, is to alter the method of
analysis which sentencing judges must use in determining a fit sentence for
aboriginal offenders.  Section 718.2 (e) requires that sentencing
determinations take into account the unique circumstances of aboriginal
peoples.

 

76                              
In R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p. 567, Lamer
C.J. restated the long-standing principle of Canadian sentencing law that the
appropriateness of a sentence will depend on the particular circumstances of
the offence, the offender, and the community in which the offence took place. 
Disparity of sentences for similar crimes is a natural consequence of this
individualized focus.  As he stated:

 

It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a
uniform sentence for a particular crime. . . . Sentencing is an
inherently individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate
sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a
fruitless exercise of academic abstraction.  As well, sentences for a
particular offence should be expected to vary to some degree across various
communities and regions of this country, as the “just and appropriate” mix of
accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of
and in the particular community where the crime occurred.

 








77                              
The comments of Lamer C.J. are particularly apt in the context of
aboriginal offenders.  As explained herein, the circumstances of aboriginal
offenders are markedly different from those of other offenders, being
characterized by unique systemic and background factors.  Further, an
aboriginal offender’s community will frequently understand the nature of a just
sanction in a manner significantly different from that of many non‑aboriginal
communities.  In appropriate cases, some of the traditional sentencing
objectives will be correspondingly less relevant in determining a sentence that
is reasonable in the circumstances, and the goals of restorative justice will
quite properly be given greater weight.  Through its reform of the purpose of
sentencing in s. 718 , and through its specific directive to judges who
sentence aboriginal offenders, Parliament has, more than ever before, empowered
sentencing judges to craft sentences in a manner which is meaningful to
aboriginal peoples.

 

78                              
In describing the effect of s. 718.2(e) in this way, we do
not mean to suggest that, as a general practice, aboriginal offenders must
always be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight to the principles
of restorative justice, and less weight to goals such as deterrence,
denunciation, and separation.  It is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal
peoples themselves do not believe in the importance of these latter goals, and
even if they do not, that such goals must not predominate in appropriate
cases.  Clearly there are some serious offences and some offenders for which
and for whom separation, denunciation, and deterrence are fundamentally
relevant.

 

79                              
Yet, even where an offence is considered serious, the length of the term
of imprisonment must be considered.  In some circumstances the length of the
sentence of an aboriginal offender may be less and in others the same as that
of any other offender.  Generally, the more violent and serious the offence the
more likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for
aboriginals and non‑aboriginals will be close to each other or the same,
even taking into account their different concepts of sentencing.

 








80                              
As with all sentencing decisions, the sentencing of aboriginal offenders
must proceed on an individual (or a case-by-case) basis:  For this
offence, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this
community, what is the appropriate sanction under the Criminal Code ? 
What understanding of criminal sanctions is held by the community?  What is the
nature of the relationship between the offender and his or her community?  What
combination of systemic or background factors contributed to this particular
offender coming before the courts for this particular offence?  How has the
offender who is being sentenced been affected by, for example, substance abuse
in the community, or poverty, or overt racism, or family or community
breakdown?  Would imprisonment effectively serve to deter or denounce crime in
a sense that would be significant to the offender and community, or are crime
prevention and other goals better achieved through healing?  What sentencing
options present themselves in these circumstances?

 








81                              
The analysis for sentencing aboriginal offenders, as for all offenders,
must be holistic and designed to achieve a fit sentence in the circumstances. 
There is no single test that a judge can apply in order to determine the
sentence.  The sentencing judge is required to take into account all of the
surrounding circumstances regarding the offence, the offender, the victims, and
the community, including the unique circumstances of the offender as an
aboriginal person.  Sentencing must proceed with sensitivity to and
understanding of the difficulties aboriginal people have faced with both the
criminal justice system and society at large.  When evaluating these
circumstances in light of the aims and principles of sentencing as set out in
Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  and in the jurisprudence, the judge
must strive to arrive at a sentence which is just and appropriate in the
circumstances.  By means of s. 718.2 (e), sentencing judges have
been provided with a degree of flexibility and discretion to consider in appropriate
circumstances alternative sentences to incarceration which are appropriate for
the aboriginal offender and community and yet comply with the mandated
principles and purpose of sentencing.  In this way, effect may be given to the
aboriginal emphasis upon healing and restoration of both the victim and the
offender.

 

(3)  The Duty of the Sentencing
Judge

 

82                              
The foregoing discussion of guidelines for the sentencing judge has
spoken of that which a judge must do when sentencing an aboriginal offender.  This
element of duty is a critical component of s. 718.2(e).  The
provision expressly provides that a court that imposes a sentence should
consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in
the circumstances, and should pay particular attention to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders.  There is no discretion as to whether to
consider the unique situation of the aboriginal offender; the only discretion
concerns the determination of a just and appropriate sentence.

 

83                              
How then is the consideration of s. 718.2(e) to proceed in
the daily functioning of the courts?  The manner in which the sentencing judge
will carry out his or her statutory duty may vary from case to case.  In all
instances it will be necessary for the judge to take judicial notice of the
systemic or background factors and the approach to sentencing which is relevant
to aboriginal offenders.  However, for each particular offence and offender it
may be that some evidence will be required in order to assist the sentencing
judge in arriving at a fit sentence.  Where a particular offender does not wish
such evidence to be adduced, the right to have particular attention paid to his
or her circumstances as an aboriginal offender may be waived.  Where there is
no such waiver, it will be extremely helpful to the sentencing judge for
counsel on both sides to adduce relevant evidence.  Indeed, it is to be
expected that counsel will fulfil their role and assist the sentencing judge in
this way.

 








84                              
However, even where counsel do not adduce this evidence, where for
example the offender is unrepresented, it is incumbent upon the sentencing
judge to attempt to acquire information regarding the circumstances of the
offender as an aboriginal person.  Whether the offender resides in a rural
area, on a reserve or in an urban centre the sentencing judge must be made
aware of alternatives to incarceration that exist whether inside or outside the
aboriginal community of the particular offender.  The alternatives existing in
metropolitan areas must, as a matter of course, also be explored.  Clearly the
presence of an aboriginal offender will require special attention in pre‑sentence
reports.  Beyond the use of the pre‑sentence report, the sentencing judge
may and should in appropriate circumstances and where practicable request that
witnesses be called who may testify as to reasonable alternatives.

 

85                              
Similarly, where a sentencing judge at the trial level has not engaged
in the duty imposed by s. 718.2(e) as fully as required, it is
incumbent upon a court of appeal in considering an appeal against sentence on
this basis to consider any fresh evidence which is relevant and admissible on
sentencing.  In the same vein, it should be noted that, although s. 718.2(e)
does not impose a statutory duty upon the sentencing judge to provide reasons,
it will be much easier for a reviewing court to determine whether and how
attention was paid to the circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal person
if at least brief reasons are given.

 

(4)  The Issue of “Reverse
Discrimination”

 








86                              
Something must also be said as to the manner in which s. 718.2(e)
should not be interpreted.  The appellant and the respondent diverged
significantly in their interpretation of the appropriate role to be played by
s. 718.2(e).  While the respondent saw the provision largely as a
restatement of existing sentencing principles, the appellant advanced the
position that s. 718.2(e) functions as an affirmative action
provision justified under s. 15(2)  of the Charter .  The respondent
cautioned that, in his view, the appellant’s understanding of the provision
would result in “reverse discrimination” so as to favour aboriginal offenders
over other offenders.

 

87                              
There is no constitutional challenge to s. 718.2(e) in these
proceedings, and accordingly we do not address specifically the applicability
of s. 15  of the Charter .  We would note, though, that the aim of
s. 718.2 (e) is to reduce the tragic overrepresentation of
aboriginal people in prisons.  It seeks to ameliorate the present situation and
to deal with the particular offence and offender and community.  The fact that
a court is called upon to take into consideration the unique circumstances
surrounding these different parties is not unfair to non‑aboriginal people. 
Rather, the fundamental purpose of s. 718.2 (e) is to treat
aboriginal offenders fairly by taking into account their difference.

 








88                              
But s. 718.2(e) should not be taken as requiring an automatic
reduction of a sentence, or a remission of a warranted period of incarceration,
simply because the offender is aboriginal.  To the extent that the appellant’s
submission on affirmative action means that s. 718.2(e) requires an
automatic reduction in sentence for an aboriginal offender, we reject that
view.  The provision is a direction to sentencing judges to consider certain
unique circumstances pertaining to aboriginal offenders as a part of the task
of weighing the multitude of factors which must be taken into account in
striving to impose a fit sentence.  It cannot be forgotten that s. 718.2(e)
must be considered in the context of that section read as a whole and in the
context of s. 718 , s. 718.1 , and the overall scheme of
Part XXIII.  It is one of the statutorily mandated considerations that a sentencing
judge must take into account.  It may not always mean a lower sentence for an
aboriginal offender.  The sentence imposed will depend upon all the
factors which must be taken into account in each individual case.  The weight
to be given to these various factors will vary in each case.  At the same time,
it must in every case be recalled that the direction to consider these unique
circumstances flows from the staggering injustice currently experienced by
aboriginal peoples with the criminal justice system.  The provision reflects
the reality that many aboriginal people are alienated from this system which
frequently does not reflect their needs or their understanding of an
appropriate sentence.

 

(5)  Who Comes Within the Purview
of Section 718.2(e)?

 

89                              
The question of whether s. 718.2(e) applies to all
aboriginal persons, or only to certain classes thereof, is raised by this
appeal.  The following passage of the reasons of the judge at trial appears to
reflect some ambiguity as to the applicability of the provision to aboriginal
people who do not live in rural areas or on a reserve:

 

The factor that is mentioned in the Criminal
Code  is that particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal
offenders should be considered.  In this case both the deceased and the accused
were aboriginals, but they are not living within the aboriginal community as
such.  They are living off a reserve and the offence occurred in an urban
setting.  They [sic] do not appear to have been any special
circumstances because of their aboriginal status and so I am not giving any
special consideration to their background in passing this sentence.

 








It could be
understood from that passage that, in this case, there were no special
circumstances to warrant the application of s. 718.2(e), and the fact
that the context of the offence was not in a rural setting or on a reserve was
only one of those missing circumstances.  However, this passage was interpreted
by the majority of the Court of Appeal as implying that, “as a matter of
principle, s. 718.2(e) can have no application to aboriginals ‘not
living within the aboriginal community’” (p. 137).  This understanding of the
provision was unanimously rejected by the members of the Court of Appeal.  With
respect to the trial judge, who was given little assistance from counsel on
this issue, we agree with the Court of Appeal that such a restrictive
interpretation of the provision would be inappropriate.

 

90                              
The class of aboriginal people who come within the purview of the
specific reference to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders in
s. 718.2(e) must be, at least, all who come within the scope of s. 25 
of the Charter  and s. 35  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  The
numbers involved are significant.  National census figures from 1996 show that
an estimated 799,010 people were identified as aboriginal in 1996.  Of this
number, 529,040 were Indians (registered or non‑registered), 204,115
Metis and 40,220 Inuit.

 

91                              
Section 718.2(e) applies to all aboriginal offenders wherever
they reside, whether on- or off-reserve, in a large city or a rural area. 
Indeed it has been observed that many aboriginals living in urban areas are
closely attached to their culture.  See the Royal Commission on Aboriginal
Peoples, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples,
vol. 4, Perspectives and Realities (1996), at p. 521:

 

Throughout the Commission’s hearings, Aboriginal
people stressed the fundamental importance of retaining and enhancing their
cultural identity while living in urban areas.  Aboriginal identity lies at the
heart of Aboriginal peoples’ existence; maintaining that identity is an
essential and self‑validating pursuit for Aboriginal people in cities.

 

And at
p. 525:

 

Cultural identity for urban Aboriginal people is
also tied to a land base or ancestral territory.  For many, the two concepts
are inseparable.... Identification with an ancestral place is important to
urban people because of the associated ritual, ceremony and traditions, as well
as the people who remain there, the sense of belonging, the bond to an
ancestral community, and the accessibility of family, community and elders.








92                              
Section 718.2(e) requires the sentencing judge to explore
reasonable alternatives to incarceration in the case of all aboriginal
offenders.  Obviously, if an aboriginal community has a program or tradition of
alternative sanctions, and support and supervision are available to the
offender, it may be easier to find and impose an alternative sentence. 
However, even if community support is not available, every effort should be
made in appropriate circumstances to find a sensitive and helpful alternative. 
For all purposes, the term “community” must be defined broadly so as to include
any network of support and interaction that might be available in an urban
centre.  At the same time, the residence of the aboriginal offender in an urban
centre that lacks any network of support does not relieve the sentencing judge
of the obligation to try to find an alternative to imprisonment.

 

VI.  Summary

 

93                              
Let us see if a general summary can be made of what has been discussed
in these reasons. 

 

1.    Part XXIII of the Criminal Code 
codifies the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing and the factors
that should be considered by a judge in striving to determine a sentence that
is fit for the offender and the offence.

 

2.    Section 718.2(e) mandatorily requires
sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment
and to pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

 








3.    Section 718.2(e) is not simply a
codification of existing jurisprudence. It is remedial in nature.  Its purpose
is to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people
in prisons, and to encourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative
approach to sentencing.  There is a judicial duty to give the provision’s
remedial purpose real force.

 

4.    Section 718.2(e) must be read
and considered in the context of the rest of the factors referred to in that
section and in light of all of Part XXIII.  All principles and factors set
out in Part XXIII must be taken into consideration in determining the fit
sentence.  Attention should be paid to the fact that Part XXIII, through ss.
718 , 718.2 (e), and 742.1, among other provisions, has placed a new emphasis
upon decreasing the use of incarceration.

 

5.    Sentencing is an individual process and in
each case the consideration must continue to be what is a fit sentence for this
accused for this offence in this community.  However, the effect of
s. 718.2(e) is to alter the method of analysis which sentencing
judges must use in determining a fit sentence for aboriginal offenders.

 

6.    Section 718.2(e) directs sentencing
judges to undertake the sentencing of aboriginal offenders individually, but
also differently, because the circumstances of aboriginal people are unique. 
In sentencing an aboriginal offender, the judge must consider:

 








(A)        The unique systemic or background
factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender
before the courts; and

 

(B)        The types of sentencing procedures and
sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender
because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection.

 

7.    In order to undertake these considerations
the trial judge will require information pertaining to the accused.  Judges may
take judicial notice of the broad systemic and background factors affecting
aboriginal people, and of the priority given in aboriginal cultures to a
restorative approach to sentencing.  In the usual course of events, additional
case‑specific information will come from counsel and from a pre‑sentence
report which takes into account the factors set out in #6, which in turn may
come from representations of the relevant aboriginal community which will
usually be that of the offender.  The offender may waive the gathering of that
information.

 

8.    If there is no alternative to incarceration
the length of the term must be carefully considered.

 

9.    Section 718.2(e) is not to be taken
as a means of automatically reducing the prison sentence of aboriginal
offenders; nor should it be assumed that an offender is receiving a more
lenient sentence simply because incarceration is not imposed.

 








  10.    The absence of alternative sentencing
programs specific to an aboriginal community does not eliminate the ability of
a sentencing judge to impose a sanction that takes into account principles of
restorative justice and the needs of the parties involved.

 

  11.    Section 718.2(e) applies to all
aboriginal persons wherever they reside, whether on- or off-reserve, in a large
city or a rural area.  In defining the relevant aboriginal community for the
purpose of achieving an effective sentence, the term “community” must be
defined broadly so as to include any network of support and interaction that
might be available, including in an urban centre.  At the same time, the
residence of the aboriginal offender in an urban centre that lacks any network
of support does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to try to
find an alternative to imprisonment.

 

  12.    Based on the foregoing, the jail term for
an aboriginal offender may in some circumstances be less than the term imposed
on a non‑aboriginal offender for the same offence.

 

  13.    It is unreasonable to assume that
aboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional sentencing
goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where warranted.  In
this context, generally, the more serious and violent the crime, the more
likely it will be as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment will be
the same for similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is aboriginal
or non‑aboriginal.

 








VII.  Was There an Error Made in This Case?

 

94                     
From the foregoing analysis it can be seen that the sentencing judge,
who did not have the benefit of these reasons, fell into error.  He may have
erred in limiting the application of s. 718.2(e) to the
circumstances of aboriginal offenders living in rural areas or on-reserve. 
Moreover, and perhaps as a consequence of the first error, he does not appear
to have considered the systemic or background factors which may have influenced
the appellant to engage in criminal conduct, or the possibly distinct
conception of sentencing held by the appellant, by the victim Beaver’s family,
and by their community.  However, it should be emphasized that the sentencing
judge did take active steps to obtain at least some information regarding the
appellant’s aboriginal heritage.  In this regard he received little if any
assistance from counsel on this issue although they too were acting without the
benefit of these reasons.

 








95                     
The majority of the Court of Appeal, in dismissing the appellant’s
appeal, also does not appear to have considered many of the factors referred to
above.  However, the dissenting reasons of Rowles J.A. discuss the relevant
factors in some detail.  The majority also appears to have dismissed the
appellant’s application to adduce fresh evidence.  The majority of the Court of
Appeal may or may not have erred in ultimately deciding to dismiss the fresh
evidence application.  The correctness of its ultimate decision depends largely
upon the admissibility of the fresh evidence and its relevance to the weighing
of the various sentencing goals.  However, assuming admissibility and
relevance, it was certainly incumbent upon the majority to consider the
evidence, and especially so given the failure of the trial judge to do so.  Moreover,
if the fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal was itself insufficient to
inform the court adequately regarding the circumstances of the appellant as an
aboriginal offender, the proper remedy would have been to remit the matter to
the trial judge with instructions to make all the reasonable inquiries
necessary for the sentencing of this aboriginal offender.

 

96                     
In most cases, errors such as those in the courts below would be
sufficient to justify sending the matter back for a new sentencing hearing.  It
is difficult for this Court to determine a fit sentence for the appellant
according to the suggested guidelines set out herein on the basis of the very
limited evidence before us regarding the appellant’s aboriginal background. 
However, as both the trial judge and all members of the Court of Appeal
acknowledged, the offence in question is a most serious one, properly described
by Esson J.A. as a “near murder”.  Moreover, the offence involved domestic
violence and a breach of the trust inherent in a spousal relationship.  That
aggravating factor must be taken into account in the sentencing of the
aboriginal appellant as it would be for any offender.  For that offence by this
offender a sentence of three years’ imprisonment was not unreasonable.

 

97                     
More importantly, the appellant was granted day parole on August 13,
1997, after she had served six months in the Burnaby Correctional Centre
for Women.  She was directed to reside with her father, to take alcohol and
substance abuse counselling and to comply with the requirements of the
Electronic Monitoring Program.  On February 25, 1998, the appellant was
granted full parole with the same conditions as the ones applicable to her
original release on day parole. 

 

98                     
In this case, the results of the sentence with incarceration for six
months and the subsequent controlled release were in the interests of both the
appellant and society.  In these circumstances, we do not consider that it
would be in the interests of justice to order a new sentencing hearing in order
to canvass the appellant’s circumstances as an aboriginal offender.








 

99                     
In the result, the appeal is dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

Criminal law -- Abuse of process -- Stay of
proceedings -- Reverse sting operation involving police “sale” of illegal drugs
to drug organization executives -- Whether reverse sting operation abuse of
process -- Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985,
c. N-1, ss. 2 “traffic”, 4 -- Narcotic Control Regulations,
C.R.C., c. 1041, s. 3(1) -- Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. R-10 , s. 37 .

 








Evidence -- Privilege -- Solicitor-client privilege
-- Reverse sting operation involving police “sale” of illegal drugs to drug
organization executives -- RCMP officer consulting Department of Justice lawyer
as to legality of planned reverse sting operation -- Claim made that reverse
sting operation predicated on its being considered legal -- Defence wanting to
test disclosure of legal advice received by RCMP -- Whether communications
between RCMP and Department of Justice lawyer should be disclosed.

 

The RCMP were alleged to have violated the Narcotic
Control Act by selling a large quantity of hashish to senior “executives”
in a drug trafficking organization as part of a reverse sting operation.  The
appellants, as purchasers, were charged with conspiracy to traffic in cannabis
resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for that purpose.  The trial
judge found the appellants guilty as charged but, before sentencing, heard
their motion for a stay of any further steps in the proceeding.  The appellants
argued that the reverse sting constituted illegal police conduct which “shocks
the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper
administration of justice that it warrants judicial intervention”.  The stay
was refused by the courts below.

 

As part of their case for a stay the appellants
sought, but were denied, access to the legal advice provided to the police by
the Department of Justice on which the police claimed to have placed good faith
reliance.  The Crown’s position implied that the RCMP acted in accordance with
legal advice.

 

At issue here is the effect, in the context of the
“war on drugs”, of alleged police illegality on the grant of a judicial stay of
proceedings, and related issues regarding the solicitor-client privilege
invoked by the RCMP and pre-trial disclosure of solicitor-client communications
to which privilege has been waived.

 








Held:  The appeal should be allowed in part.

 

At this stage of the proceedings, the door is finally
and firmly closed against both appellants on the question of guilt or innocence
notwithstanding the contention of one appellant that the conspiracy alleged by
the Crown, and encompassed in the indictment, was a larger agreement than his
demonstrated involvement.  The appellant was clearly able to ascertain the
conspiracy alleged against him from a plain reading of the indictment as was
required by the jurisprudence.

 

The effect of police illegality on an application for
a stay of proceedings depends very much on the facts of a particular case. 
This case-by-case approach is dictated by the requirement to balance factors
which are specific to each fact situation.  Here, the RCMP acted in a manner
facially prohibited by the Narcotic Control Act.  Their motive in doing
so does not matter because, while motive may be relevant for some purposes, it
is intent, not motive, that is an element of a full mens rea offence.

 

A police officer investigating a crime occupies a
public office initially defined by the common law and subsequently set out in
various statutes and is not acting as a government functionary or as an agent. 
Here, the only issue was the status of an RCMP officer in the course of a
criminal investigation and in that regard the police are independent of the
control of the executive government. 

 








Even if the police could be considered agents of the
Crown for some purposes, and even if the Crown itself were not bound by the Narcotic
Control Act, in this case the police stepped outside the lawful ambit of
their agency, and whatever immunity was associated with that agency was lost. 
Parliament made it clear that the RCMP must act “in accordance with the law”
and that illegality by the RCMP is neither part of any valid public purpose nor
necessarily “incidental” to its achievement.  If some form of public interest
immunity is to be extended to the police to assist in the “war on drugs”, it
should be left to Parliament to delineate the nature and scope of the immunity
and the circumstances in which it is available.

 

Even if it should turn out here that the police acted
contrary to the legal advice provided by the Department of Justice, there would
still be no right to an automatic stay.  The trial judge would still have to
consider any other information or explanatory circumstances that emerge during
the inquiry into whether the police or prosecutorial conduct “shocks the
conscience of the community”.  A police force that chooses to operate outside
the law is not the same thing as a police force that made an honest mistake on
the basis of erroneous advice.  There was no reason to think the RCMP ignored
the advice it was given, but as the RCMP did make an issue of the legal advice
it received in response to the stay applications, the appellants were entitled
to have the bottom line of that advice corroborated.

 








The RCMP must be able to obtain professional legal
advice in connection with criminal investigations without the chilling effect
of potential disclosure of their confidences in subsequent proceedings.  Here,
the officer’s consultation with the Department of Justice lawyer fell squarely
within this functional definition, and the fact that the lawyer worked for an
“in-house” government legal service did not affect the creation or character of
the privilege.  Whether or not solicitor-client privilege attaches in any of
these situations depends on the nature of the relationship, the subject matter
of the advice and the circumstances in which it is sought and rendered.

 

An exception to the principle of confidentiality of
solicitor-client communications exists where those communications are criminal
or else made with a view to obtaining legal advice to facilitate the commission
of a crime.  Here, the officer sought advice as to whether or not the operation
he had in mind was lawful.  The privilege is not automatically destroyed if the
transaction turns out to be illegal.

 

Destruction of the solicitor-client privilege takes
more than evidence of the existence of a crime and proof of an anterior
consultation with a lawyer.  There must be something to suggest that the advice
facilitated the crime or that the lawyer otherwise became a “dupe or
conspirator”.  The RCMP, by adopting the position that the decision to proceed
with the reverse sting had been taken with the participation and agreement of
the Department of Justice, belatedly brought itself within the “future crimes”
exception and put in question the continued existence of its privilege. 

 

Another exception to the rule of confidentiality of
solicitor-client privilege may arise where adherence to that rule would have
the effect of preventing the accused from making full answer and defence. 
Although the entire jeopardy of the appellants remained an open issue until
disposition of the stay application, the appellants were not providing “full
answer and defence” to the stay application.  They were the moving parties of
an application being defended by the Crown.  The appellants’ initiative in
launching a stay application does not, of itself, authorize a fishing expedition
into solicitor-client communications to which the Crown is a party.








The RCMP put the officer’s good faith belief in the
legality of the reverse sting in issue, and asserted its reliance upon his
consultations with the Department of Justice to buttress that position.  The
RCMP thus waived the right to shelter the contents of that advice behind
solicitor-client privilege.  It is not always necessary for the client actually
to disclose part of the contents of the advice in order to waive privilege to
the relevant communications of which it forms a part.  It was sufficient in
this case for the RCMP to support its good faith argument by undisclosed advice
from legal counsel in circumstances where, as here, the existence or
non-existence of the asserted good faith depended on the content of that legal
advice.  Non-disclosure of information clearly relevant to the good faith
reliance issue here cannot properly be disposed of by adverse inferences.  The
appellants were entitled to disclosure of legal advice with respect to:  (1)
the legality of the police posing as sellers of drugs to persons believed to be
distributors of drugs; (2) the legality of the police offering drugs for sale
to persons believed to be distributors of drugs; and (3) the possible
consequences to the members of the RCMP who engaged in one or both of the
above, including the likelihood of prosecution.   If there is a dispute
concerning the adequacy of disclosure, the disputed documents or information
should be provided by the Crown to the trial judge for an initial determination
whether this direction has been complied with.  The trial judge should then
determine what, if any, additional disclosure should be made to the appellants.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

//Binnie J.//

 

1                                  
Binnie J. –  In this
appeal the Court is asked to consider some implications of the constitutional
principle that everyone from the highest officers of the state to the constable
on the beat is subject to the ordinary law of the land.  Here the police were
alleged to have violated the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1,
by selling a large quantity of hashish (cannabis resin) to senior “executives”
in a drug trafficking organization as part of what counsel called a “reverse
sting” operation.  The appellants, as purchasers, were charged with conspiracy
to traffic in cannabis resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for that
purpose.  The trial judge found the appellants guilty as charged but, before
sentencing, heard the appellants’ motion for a stay of any further steps in the
proceeding.  The appellants argued that the reverse sting constituted illegal
police conduct which “shocks the conscience of the community and is so
detrimental to the proper administration of justice that it warrants judicial
intervention” (see R. v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 615).  The
stay was refused by the courts below.

 








2                                  
As part of their case for a stay the appellants sought, but were denied,
access to the legal advice provided to the police by the Department of Justice
on which the police claimed to have placed good faith reliance.  The Crown
indicated that the undisclosed advice assured the police, rightly or wrongly,
that sale of cannabis resin in the circumstances of a reverse sting was
lawful.  The appellants argue that the truth of this assertion can only be
tested by a review of the otherwise privileged communications.

 

3                                  
We are therefore required to consider in the context of the “war on
drugs”, the effect of alleged police illegality on the grant of a judicial stay
of proceedings, and related issues regarding the solicitor-client privilege
invoked by the RCMP and pre-trial disclosure of solicitor-client communications
to which privilege has been waived.

 

Facts

 








4                                  
In the autumn of 1991, the RCMP initiated a reverse sting operation
involving undercover officers posing as large-scale hashish vendors.  This operation
was undertaken after Corporal Richard Reynolds of the RCMP became aware of the
decision of the Quebec Superior Court in R. v. Lore (an unreported
decision of Pinard J., March 8, 1991, No. 500-01-013926-891) which, in
Cpl. Reynolds’ view, gave implicit approval to a reverse sting operation in
which police offered to sell narcotics to suspected drug traffickers.  Cpl.
Reynolds contacted Mr. James Leising, an experienced senior lawyer employed by
the Department of Justice in Toronto, to obtain professional advice as to the
legality of a reverse sting operation.  Seven or eight meetings were held
between Cpl. Reynolds and the Department of Justice lawyer in relation to the
proposed operation.  In September of 1991, approval by senior RCMP officers was
given to initiate the reverse sting.  Using the help of a police informant, the
police contacted two groups of potential purchasers through the appellant
Shirose.  Negotiations with these groups included showing the hashish to
prospective purchasers.  However, the RCMP was careful not to provide any
samples, despite requests to do so.  The hashish remained under the control of
the RCMP at all times.  The appellant Campbell eventually participated in the
negotiations as a financier for one of the two groups and in January 1992, the
appellant Campbell, with the help of the appellant Shirose, agreed to pay
$270,000 for 50 kilograms of cannabis resin.  The retail value of these drugs
at street level, as found by the trial judge, was close to $1 million. 
Instead of receiving the expected 50 kilograms of cannabis resin in exchange
for payment, however, the appellants were arrested and charged with conspiracy
to traffic in cannabis resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for the
purpose of trafficking.

 








5                                  
In advance of the trial, to support their submission that if convicted,
the proceedings should be stayed, the appellants sought to subpoena Mr. Leising
from the Department of Justice to testify about the communications that had
occurred with Cpl. Reynolds with respect to the legality of the reverse
sting operation.  The trial judge quashed the subpoena on the grounds that the
communications were protected by solicitor-client privilege and did not fall
within one of the recognized exceptions.  Subsequently, during the application
to stay the proceedings, counsel for the appellants sought to examine Cpl.
Reynolds on the content of his communications with the Department of Justice. 
Again the trial judge upheld the assertion of solicitor-client privilege and
denied the appellants’ application to force disclosure of these
communications.  Based on the admissible evidence, the trial judge then
dismissed the stay of proceedings application.  The appellant Shirose was
sentenced to six years in penitentiary.  The appellant Campbell was sentenced
to nine years in penitentiary, plus forfeiture of the purchase price paid to
the police.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants’ appeal except to
remit the issue of forfeiture to the trial judge to await an application by the
Attorney General, if he sees fit to make it, for forfeiture of the purchase
price under s. 462.37  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

Evidence of
Police “Good Faith”

 

6                                  
On the return of the stay motion, the Crown set out to establish that
the police had at all stages acted in good faith and in the belief that the
reverse sting was legal.  At the application for a stay of proceedings hearing,
counsel for the Crown questioned Cpl. Reynolds as follows:

 

Q. Was your project [the reverse sting operation]
tailored on the outlines of the project or [sic] the Lore case?

 

A. Yes, sir.

 

Q. And it was your understanding as a result of the
Lore case that that was lawful behaviour?

 

A. Yes, sir.

 

 

It emerged
that Cpl. Reynolds had consulted the Department of Justice about the legality
of the reverse sting.  Appellants’ counsel pursued this issue with Cpl.
Reynolds as follows:

Q. So to return then, based upon this [Lore]
decision coming to your attention, did you also obtain any other advice
regarding any concerns you might have had about this type of an operation?

 

A. Sought legal advice.

 

Q. And from whom did you seek legal advice?

 

A. The Department of Justice, Toronto.

 

Q. And was it one individual or more than one
individual?

 








A. One individual.

 

Q. And who was that?

 

A. Mr. Leising. 

 

 

The precise
purpose of obtaining this legal advice came out under further questioning from
appellants’ counsel, as follows:

 

Q. Now that you know what I am reading from sir,
what I asked was, “The issues for which advice was sought concerned the
propriety of the police posing as sellers of drugs to persons believed to be
distributors of drugs.”  Is that accurate?

 

A. That’s correct.

 

Q. “The propriety of the police offering hashish
for sale to persons believed to be distributors of hashish.”  Is that correct?

 

A. Yes, sir.

 

Q. “The release of a sample of hashish to certain
of those persons.”  Is that correct?

 

A. Yes, sir.

 

Q. “The possible consequences to the members who
engaged in such conduct.”  Is that correct?

 

A. Yes, sir.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Q. When you went to Mr. Leising, were you concerned
about any of the members of your force who did engage in this operation, being
prosecuted?

 

A. That would have been one of the issues.

 

Q. And then to return to Officer Plomp’s
certificate, the last thing he said is, “and the issue of entrapment.” Was that
one of the items on the agenda with Mr. Leising?

 

A. Yes, sir. 

 

 








The Crown successfully
objected to counsel for the appellants questioning Cpl. Reynolds with respect
to the actual advice given because of the claim of solicitor-client privilege. 
The appellants’ counsel then attempted to use this objection to narrow the
potential ambit of the Crown’s “good faith” argument:

 

So it is my respectful submission that the Crown certainly cannot argue
that the police acted in good faith because they acted on legal advice, because
we don’t know what legal advice they got.  We don’t know what qualifications or
conditions were attached.  We don’t know whether they were told, ‘This is going
to be illegal and you’re on your own.  You’re at risk.’ We don’t know if they
were told, ‘It’s illegal but don’t worry, we’ll never prosecute you.’

 

So, with respect, I certainly don’t want to hear the argument that,
‘Oh well, the police acted in good faith because they acted on legal advice.’
because then I would like to know what that advice was so I can see whether
that’s true or not.  So in my submission, if they are going to rely on
solicitor/client privilege, then that issue has to drop completely out of the
case.

 

THE COURT: Well I am sure the Crown will have something to say about
that.

 

MR. GOLD: Well my suspicion is that they probably won’t because they
might be aware that that might open the door to further proceedings to an
argument for disclosure of it, but I guess I will have to wait and see Your
Honour. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

Judgments

 

Ontario
Court (General Division), [1995] O.J. No. 431 (QL)

 

Ruling on Application for Stay of Proceedings

 








7                                  
Caswell J. divided her analysis of the stay application into two parts. 
In the first part, she dealt with the issue of entrapment as a sub-issue of the
abuse of process doctrine.  In the second part, she dealt with prosecutorial
conduct more generally as giving rise to potential abuses of process.

 

8                                  
In discussing entrapment, Caswell J. considered the judgment of this
Court in R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, in which Lamer J. (as he then
was) pointed out that a stay of proceedings is not to be considered as a method
of disciplining the police or the prosecution, but rather, that the Court is
concerned with the larger issue of maintenance of public confidence in the
judicial process.  The trial judge noted that entrapment may be established
where (a) the authorities provide an opportunity to persons to commit an
offence without reasonable suspicion or acting mala fides, or (b) having
a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry,
they go beyond providing a mere opportunity and actually induce the commission
of an offence.  Caswell J. held that the police had acted with reasonable
suspicion with respect to both appellants.  She noted that the appellant
Shirose had been involved in a search for a large-scale supplier of hashish
long before the RCMP began its operation.  She considered that the appellant
Campbell volunteered himself  “out of the woodwork” and joined the conspiracy
completely on his own initiative.  As to the allegation that the RCMP had
induced the commission of the offences, Caswell J. concluded, based on the
criteria set out in Mack, that the police conduct had not induced the
offence or otherwise gone beyond “the limits that society deems proper”. 
Accordingly, there was no entrapment on the facts of this case.  

 








9                                  
In considering the broader aspects of the doctrine of abuse of process,
Caswell J. concluded that it was not necessary for her to decide whether or not
the reverse sting operation was illegal.  Instead, she posed the question
whether this is one of the “clearest cases” in which the proceedings are so
overwhelmingly unfair that to proceed would be contrary to the interests of
justice.  After reviewing various cases involving police conduct that did not
result in stays of proceedings, and measuring the conduct of the police and
Crown counsel in this case against the criteria set out in Mack, supra,
R. v. Conway, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, R. v. Showman, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 893, and Power, supra, Caswell J. concluded that it was in
the interest of justice to proceed to enter the conviction and impose
sentence.  In her view, society would not be offended by the acts of the
prosecution.  Society would be offended by the imposition of a stay.

 

Court of
Appeal for Ontario (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 181

 

10                              
Carthy J.A. disagreed with the conclusion of the trial judge that it was
not necessary to determine the legality of the police conduct.  Also basing
himself on the judgment of Lamer J. in Mack, supra, Carthy J.A.
considered that police illegality was an important factor to be weighed in
evaluating an accused’s claim of abuse of process and, indeed, he considered
that illegality may in certain instances be determinative.

 

11                              
After setting out the relevant portions of the Narcotic Control Act,
Carthy J.A. noted that the Narcotic Control Regulations, C.R.C., c.
1041, s. 3(1), saves the police harmless where possession of a narcotic
results from sting operations.  There is no corresponding regulation giving the
police immunity when they are offering to sell a narcotic. 
Carthy J.A. concluded that the RCMP’s offer to sell a narcotic to the
appellants constituted trafficking, and that it was irrelevant that the RCMP had
no intention of completing the sale.  Therefore, on the face of the statute,
the conduct of the RCMP in this case was, in Carthy J.A.’s view, illegal.








 

12                              
Carthy J.A. then considered the Crown’s arguments about extending public
interest immunity to the RCMP and concluded that the Crown does not exercise
sufficient de jure control over the activities of RCMP members to
justify such immunity from prosecution for breach of the criminal law as it
relates to narcotics.  As to the related concept of immunity derived from Crown
agency, Carthy J.A. considered that, while members of the RCMP are entitled to
seek out criminality through a variety of different methods, this mandate does
not extend to methods that would be illegal if done by any other person. 
Carthy J.A. examined R. v. Eldorado Nuclear Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 551. 
When Crown agents act within the scope of the public purposes they are
statutorily empowered to pursue, they may be entitled to claim Crown immunity,
he held, but in this case the RCMP officers had stepped outside the scope of
any agency relationship that may have existed. 

 

13                              
Carthy J.A. agreed with the trial judge that there was no entrapment. 
He went on, however, to consider whether the RCMP conduct amounted to an abuse
of process for reasons other than entrapment.  He noted that the illegal
conduct of the RCMP did not involve a trifling amount of drugs.  Further, he
noted that the illegal conduct was authorized at all levels of the RCMP.  He
was prepared to infer that the reverse sting was considered lawful by the
Department of Justice, and he treated this as an aggravating factor because
“the full might of the Crown resources were set upon the task of illegal
conduct” (p. 197).  Carthy J.A. noted an alternate possibility that the police
were acting on their own as “mavericks” contrary to legal advice.  While he
doubted that this was in fact the case, Carthy J.A. at p. 197 considered this
would be 

 








. . . an aggravating factor against the Crown of about equal weight to
the first assumption [i.e., of equal weight to the assumption that the RCMP did
follow the legal advice].

 

 

14                              
A third possibility, he considered, was that the RCMP had been advised
that the reverse sting would be legal provided no drugs were passed to the
appellants as part of a “sale”.  If so, the RCMP had complied with the advice
rendered, even though failure to complete the transaction did not change its
illegality.  Carthy J.A. recognized that all three scenarios were necessarily
speculative on his part.  He said, at p. 200, that had he been the trial judge
he “would have directed production of the documents and evidence of the Crown
law officer”.  However, while “[i]t obviously would have been better if the
[Department of Justice] information had been conveyed [to the appellants] at
trial” (p. 200), no miscarriage of justice occurred because even assuming “the
worst” against the Crown no stay could be justified in the circumstances of
this case.  It was not one of the clearest cases, nor did it involve conduct
that would cause the public conscience to be shocked if the convictions were
permitted to stand.  He concluded, at pp. 198-99, that “[h]aving condemned the
actions of the R.C.M.P. and having held up [his] hand against repetition, it
would, in [his] view, be sanctimonious to say that the rule of law ha[d] been
eroded by these convictions and sentences”.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the
other grounds of appeal, save for the technical variation in the order for
forfeiture previously mentioned. 

 

Analysis

 

Reverse
Sting Operations

 








15                              
There is a general recognition that “[i]f the struggle against crime is
to be won, the ingenuity of criminals must be matched by that of the police” (Mack,
supra, per Lamer J., at p. 916).  In a “sting” operation, the
police pose as willing purchasers of narcotics to obtain evidence against
traffickers.  The Narcotic Control Regulations  accept the
legitimacy of this technique by deeming police possession in these
circumstances to be authorized under that Act.  The problem is that traffickers
caught by ordinary “sting” purchases are generally minor street level personnel
whose conviction has little deterrence effect on the day-to-day operations of
the drug organization as a whole.  As pointed out by Cpl. Reynolds in this
case, the “executives” up the chain of command of large-scale drug
organizations are able to insulate themselves from sting operations.  The
street level pushers apprehended by the police are easily sacrificed and easily
replaced.  For the purpose of more effective law enforcement, the police
therefore devised what counsel referred to as “reverse sting” operations
whereby the police became vendors rather than purchasers, i.e., the roles of
vendor and purchaser were reversed within the sting operation.  Because of the
amount and value of drugs involved, reverse sting operations brought the police
“vendors” into direct contact with the executive purchasers in the large drug
organizations.  It has proved to be an effective technique.  It also, however,
brought the police into conflict with the very law that they were attempting to
enforce.  Neither the Narcotic Control Act nor its regulations authorize
the police to sell drugs.  The appellants, as stated, purport to be
shocked at the illegality of police conduct, and ask the Court to hold that the
conduct so violates the community’s fundamental sense of decency and values
that it should result in a stay of proceedings against them.  

 

Guilt or
Innocence of the Appellants








 

16                              
This appeal was directed almost entirely at the conduct of the abuse of
process application following the finding of the trial judge that the
appellants were guilty as charged.  The only surviving issue on the issue of
guilt or innocence is the contention of the appellant Campbell that the
conspiracy alleged by the Crown, and encompassed in the indictment, was a
larger agreement, different in time and place, than his demonstrated
involvement.  The counts in the indictment span the period November 1, 1990 to
January 15, 1992, whereas it appears Campbell first became involved on November
21, 1991.  The counts in the indictment refer to activity in Windsor, London,
Mississauga, Toronto, and elsewhere in Ontario, whereas Campbell’s demonstrated
involvement took place only in Mississauga.  Campbell further contends that the
evidence shows that he and Shirose were not related co-conspirators, because
they were members of separate and distinct groups, acting without a common
purpose or enterprise.  I think the Crown is correct that the decision of this
Court in R. v. Douglas, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 301, is fatal to this
objection.  After noting at pp. 315-16 that “[w]hile the offence of conspiracy
is inherently difficult to frame, the indictment must be set forth with such
reasonable precision as to inform the accused of the fundamental nature of the
conspiracy charged”.  Cory J. nevertheless concluded, at p. 322, that:

 

. . . it is not incumbent upon the Crown to prove the involvement of
every member alleged to be part of the conspiracy. . . .  If the conspiracy
proven includes fewer members than the number of accused or extends over only
part of the period alleged, then the conspiracy proven can still be said to be
the same conspiracy as that charged in the indictment.  In order to find that a
specific conspiracy lies within the scope of the indictment, it is sufficient
if the evidence adduced demonstrates that the conspiracy proven included some
of the accused, establishes that it occurred at some time within the time frame
alleged in the indictment, and had as its object the type of crime alleged.

 

 








The appellant
was clearly able to ascertain the conspiracy alleged against him from a plain
reading of the indictment and, in accordance with this Court’s decision in Douglas,
this ground of appeal must be dismissed.

 

17                              
For reasons to be discussed, it is important to note that, at this stage
of the proceedings, the door is finally and firmly closed against both
appellants on the question of guilt or innocence.  The remaining issue is
whether, notwithstanding the guilt of the appellants, the proceedings against
them should be stayed because of abuse of process.

 

The Rule of
Law

 

18                              
It is one of the proud accomplishments of the common law that everybody
is subject to the ordinary law of the land regardless of public prominence or
governmental status.  As we explained in Reference re Secession of Quebec,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at p. 240, the rule of law is one of the “fundamental
and organizing principles of the Constitution”, and at p. 258, it was further
emphasized that a crucial element of the rule of law is that “[t]here is ...
one law for all”.  Thus a provincial premier was held to have no immunity
against a claim in damages when he caused injury to a private citizen through
wrongful interference with the exercise of statutory powers by a provincial
liquor commission:  Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121. 
Professor F. R. Scott, who was counsel for the successful plaintiff,
Roncarelli, in that case, subsequently observed in Civil Liberties &
Canadian Federalism (1959), at p. 48:

 

. . . it is always a triumph for the law to show that it is applied
equally to all without fear or favour.  This is what we mean when we say that
all are equal before the law.

 

 








The principle
was famously enunciated by Professor A. V. Dicey in Introduction to the
Study of the Law of the Constitution (8th ed. 1927) as the second aspect of
the “rule of law”.  This principle was noted with approval in Attorney
General of Canada v. Lavell, [1974] S.C.R. 1349, at p. 1366:

 

It means again equality before the law or the equal subjection of all
classes to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary courts;
the ‘rule of law’ in this sense excludes the idea of any exemption of officials
or others from the duty of obedience to the law which governs other citizens or
from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.

 

 

19                              
The argument of the appellants is that not only are the police subject
to prosecution for their participation in the very transaction that gave rise
to the charges on which the appellants have been found guilty, but (more
importantly from their perspective) police illegality should deprive the state
of the benefit of a conviction against them.  It is relevant that in s. 37  of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. R-10 , Parliament
has specifically imposed on RCMP officers the duty to stay within the law, as
follows:

 

37.  It is incumbent on every member

 

(a) to respect the rights of all persons;

 

(b) to maintain the integrity of the law, law enforcement
and the administration of justice;

 

(c) to perform the member’s duties promptly, impartially and
diligently, in accordance with the law and without abusing the member’s
authority;  

 

                                                                    ...

 

(e) to ensure that any improper or unlawful conduct of
any member is not concealed or permitted to continue....  [Emphasis added.]

 

 








It is
recognized, of course, that police officers gain nothing personally from
conduct committed in good faith efforts to suppress crime that incidentally
violates the law the police are attempting to enforce.  Nevertheless, the
seeming paradox of breaking a law in order to better enforce it has important
ramifications for the rule of law.

 

Test for
Abuse of Process

 

20                              
In R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, the Court set down what has
since become the standard formulation of the test for abuse of process, per
Dickson C.J., at pp. 136-37:

 

I would adopt the conclusion of the Ontario Court
of Appeal in R. v. Young [(1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289], and affirm that “there
is a residual discretion in a trial court judge to stay proceedings where
compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles
of justice which underlie the community’s sense of fair play and decency and to
prevent the abuse of a court’s process through oppressive or vexatious
proceedings”.  I would also adopt the caveat added by the Court in Young
that this is a power which can be exercised only in the “clearest of cases”.

 

 

This general
test for abuse of process has been repeatedly affirmed:  see R. v. Keyowski,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, at pp. 658-59; Mack, supra, at p. 941; Conway,
supra, at p. 1667; R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at pp.
992-93; Power, supra, at pp. 612-15; R. v. T. (V.), [1992]
1 S.C.R. 749, at pp. 762-63; R. v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p.
915; and most recently in R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at p.
455.

 

21                              
Entrapment is simply an application of the abuse of process doctrine. 
Lamer J., in Mack, supra, set out the applicable test as
follows, at pp. 964-65:

 

. . . there is entrapment when,

 








(a) the authorities provide a person with an opportunity to commit an
offence without acting on a reasonable suspicion that this person is already
engaged in criminal activity or pursuant to a bona fide inquiry;

 

(b) although having such a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course
of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing an opportunity and
induce the commission of an offence.

 

 

The trial
judge concluded that she was “satisfied that the police acted on reasonable
suspicion.  That being so, the police were fully entitled to provide both
accused with opportunities to commit the offences”.  There was ample evidence
to support her finding.  She also found that the police had not crossed the
boundary line from providing opportunity to commit the offence into the
forbidden territory of inducing commission of the offence.  The appellants
needed no inducement.  Once the opportunity presented itself, they, not the
police, were the driving force behind the making of the deal.

 

22                              
In the absence of any plausible case for entrapment, the appellants can
only succeed on the more general ground of a serious violation of “[the
community’s sense of] fair play and decency ... disproportionate to the
societal interest in the effective prosecution of criminal cases” (Conway,
supra, at p. 1667).  In this regard, the centrepiece of the appellants’
argument, as stated, is the allegation of police illegality, and the refusal of
the courts below to order disclosure of what the appellants consider to be
relevant communications between Cpl. Reynolds and Mr. Leising of the Department
of Justice relied on by the police to establish their “good faith”.

 

The Issue
of Police Illegality

 








23                              
The allegation that the police have put themselves above the law is very
serious, with constitutional ramifications beyond the boundaries of the
criminal law.  This was not a trivial breach.  In the end, the transaction was
for 50 kilograms, but at the outset the police were trying to organize the sale
of over a ton of cannabis resin. The failure of the police to make a deal on
that scale was not for want of trying.

 

24                              
The effect of police illegality on an application for a stay of
proceedings depends very much on the facts of a particular case.  This
case-by-case approach is dictated by the requirement to balance factors which
are specific to each fact situation.  The problem confronting the police was
well described by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Bond (1993), 135
A.R. 329 (leave to appeal refused, [1993] 3 S.C.R. v), at p. 333:

 

Illegal conduct by the police during an
investigation, while wholly relevant to the issue of abuse of the court’s
processes, is not per se fatal to prosecutions which may follow: Mack;
supra at 558.  Frequently it will be, but situational police illegality
happens.  Police involve themselves in high speed chases, travelling beyond
posted speed limits.  Police pose as prostitutes and communicate for that
purpose in order to gather evidence.  Police buy, possess, and transport
illegal drugs on a daily basis during undercover operations.  In a perfect
world this would not be necessary but, patently illegal drug commerce is
neither successfully investigated, nor resisted, by uniformed police peering
through hotelroom transoms and keyholes or waiting patiently at police
headquarters to receive the confessions of penitent drug-traffickers.

 

 

The Crown
contends, as it did in the courts below, that the police did not violate the Narcotic
Control Act which at the time the reverse sting was initiated provided in
s. 4  as follows:

 

4.  (1) No person shall traffic in a
narcotic or any substance represented or held out by the person to be a
narcotic.

 








(2) No person shall have in his possession any
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.

 

(3) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) or
(2) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.  

 

 

“Traffic” is
defined in the Narcotic Control Act as follows:

 

2.  In this Act,

 

                                                                    ...

 

“traffic” means

 

(a) to manufacture, sell, give, administer, transport,
send, deliver or distribute, or

 

(b) to offer to do anything referred to in paragraph (a)

 

otherwise than under the authority of this Act or the regulations.
[Emphasis added.]

 

 








25                              
The conclusion that the RCMP acted in a manner facially prohibited by
the Act is inescapable.  Their motive in doing so does not matter because,
while motive may be relevant for some purposes, it is intent, not motive, that
is an element of a full mens rea offence:   see Lewis v. The
Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 821, at p. 831.  The actus reus of the
offence of trafficking is the making of an offer, and when accompanied by
intent to do so, the necessary mens rea is made out:   see R. v.
Mancuso (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Que. C.A.), at p. 390, leave to
appeal refused, [1990] 2 S.C.R. viii.  There is no need to prove both the
intent to make the offer to sell and the intent to carry out the offer:   see
R. v. Mamchur, [1978] 4 W.W.R. 481 (Sask. C.A.).  See also, e.g., R.
v. Sherman (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 207 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 208, upholding a
conviction where there was evidence that the accused had offered to sell heroin
to a person he knew was an undercover police officer, with a view to “rip off”
the officer and not complete the sale.  Sherman was later followed on
this point in Mancuso, supra, at pp. 389-90, where the accused
argued unsuccessfully that he did not intend actually to sell narcotics to a police
informer, but really wished to steal his money. 

 

Public
Interest Immunity

 

26                              
The Crown submits that even if the conduct of the RCMP was facially
prohibited by the terms of the Narcotic Control Act, no offence was
committed because members of the RCMP are either part of the Crown or are
agents of the Crown and as such partake of the Crown’s public interest
immunity.  Such an argument is difficult to square with s. 3(1) of the Narcotic
Control Regulations which authorizes the police to possess narcotics that
come to them from “sting” operations:

 

3.  (1) A person is authorized to have a narcotic
in his possession where that person has obtained the narcotic pursuant to these
Regulations and

 

                                                                    ...

 

(g) is employed as an inspector, a member of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, a police constable, [or] peace officer ... and such possession
is for the purposes of and in connection with such employment. . . .

 

 

Even though
the authority is contained in a regulation rather than the Act itself, it is
clear that the Regulation would be entirely unnecessary and superfluous if the
Act did not apply to the police in the first place.

 

The Status
of the Police

 








27                              
The Crown’s attempt to identify the RCMP with the Crown for immunity
purposes misconceives the relationship between the police and the executive
government when the police are engaged in law enforcement.  A police officer
investigating a crime is not acting as a government functionary or as an agent
of anybody.  He or she occupies a public office initially defined by the common
law and subsequently set out in various statutes.  In the case of the RCMP, one
of the relevant statutes is now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. R-10 .

 

28                             
Under the authority of that Act, it is true, RCMP officers
perform a myriad of functions apart from the investigation of crimes.  These
include, by way of examples, purely ceremonial duties, the protection of
Canadian dignitaries and foreign diplomats and activities associated with crime
prevention.  Some of these functions bring the RCMP into a closer relationship
to the Crown than others.  The Department
of the Solicitor General Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-13 , provides that the
Solicitor General’s powers, duties and
functions extend to matters relating to the RCMP over which Parliament has
jurisdiction, and that have not been assigned to another department.  Section 5 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act  provides for the governance of
the RCMP as follows:

 

5. (1) The Governor in Council may appoint an officer,
to be known as the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who,
under the direction of the [Solicitor General], has the control and management
of the Force and all matters connected therewith.

 

 








29                              
It is therefore possible that in one or other of its roles the RCMP
could be acting in an agency relationship with the Crown.  In this appeal,
however, we are concerned only with the status of an RCMP officer in the course
of a criminal investigation, and in that regard the police are independent of
the control of the executive government.  The importance of this principle,
which itself underpins the rule of law, was recognized by this Court in
relation to municipal forces as long ago as McCleave v. City of Moncton
(1902), 32 S.C.R. 106.  That was a civil case, having to do with potential
municipal liability for police negligence, but in the course of his judgment
Strong C.J. cited with approval the following proposition, at pp. 108-9:

 

Police officers can in no respect be regarded as
agents or officers of the city.  Their duties are of a public nature.  Their
appointment is devolved on cities and towns by the legislature as a convenient
mode of exercising a function of government, but this does not render them
liable for their unlawful or negligent acts.  The detection and arrest of
offenders, the preservation of the public peace, the enforcement of the laws,
and other similar powers and duties with which police officers and constables
are entrusted are derived from the law, and not from the city or town under
which they hold their appointment.

 

 

30                              
At about the same time, the High Court of Australia rejected the notion
that a police constable was an agent of the Crown so as to enjoy immunity
against a civil action for wrongful arrest.  Griffith C.J. had this to say in Enever
v. The King  (1906), 3 C.L.R. 969, at p. 977:

 

Now, the powers of a constable, quâ peace officer, whether
conferred by common or statute law, are exercised by him by virtue of his
office, and cannot be exercised on the responsibility of any person but
himself.  If he arrests on suspicion of felony, the suspicion must be his
suspicion, and must be reasonable to him.  If he arrests in a case in which the
arrest may be made on view, the view must be his view, not that of someone
else. ... A constable, therefore, when acting as a peace officer, is not
exercising a delegated authority, but an original authority, and the general
law of agency has no application.

 

 








31                              
Over 70 years later, Laskin C.J. in Nicholson v. Haldimand-Norfolk
Regional Board of Commissioners of Police, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 311, at p. 322,
speaking with reference to the status of a probationary police constable,
affirmed that “we are dealing with the holder of a public office,
engaged in duties connected with the maintenance of public order and
preservation of the peace, important values in any society” (emphasis added). 
See also Ridge v. Baldwin, [1964] A.C. 40 (H.L.), at p. 65.

 

32                              
Similar sentiments were expressed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council in Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Perpetual Trustee Co.,
[1955] A.C. 457 (P.C.), another civil case dealing with the vicarious liability
of the Crown, in which Viscount Simonds stated, at pp. 489-90:

 

[A constable’s] authority is original, not delegated, and is exercised
at his own discretion by virtue of his office:  he is a ministerial officer
exercising statutory rights independently of contract.  The essential
difference is recognized in the fact that his relationship to the Government is
not in ordinary parlance described as that of servant and master.

 

 

33                              
While for certain purposes the Commissioner of the RCMP reports to the
Solicitor General, the Commissioner is not to be considered a servant or agent
of the government while engaged in a criminal investigation.  The Commissioner
is not subject to political direction.  Like every other police officer similarly
engaged, he is answerable to the law and, no doubt, to his conscience.  As Lord
Denning put it in relation to the Commissioner of Police in R. v.
Metropolitan Police Comr., Ex parte Blackburn, [1968] 1 All E.R. 763
(C.A.), at p. 769:

 








I have no hesitation, however, in holding that, like every constable
in the land, he [the Commissioner of Police] should be, and is, independent of
the executive.  He is not subject to the orders of the Secretary of State,
save that under the Police Act 1964 the Secretary of State can call on him to
give a report, or to retire in the interests of efficiency.  I hold it to be
the duty of the Commissioner of Police, as it is of every chief constable, to
enforce the law of the land.  He must take steps so to post his men that crimes
may be detected; and that honest citizens may go about their affairs in peace. 
He must decide whether or not suspected persons are to be prosecuted; and, if
need be, bring the prosecution or see that it is brought; but in all these
things he is not the servant of anyone, save of the law itself.  No
Minister of the Crown can tell him that he must, or must not, keep observation
on this place or that; or that he must, or must not, prosecute this man or that
one.  Nor can any police authority tell him so.  The responsibility for law
enforcement lies on him.  He is answerable to the law and to the law alone. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

34                              
To the same effect, see the more recent Canadian cases of R. v.
Creswell, [1998] B.C.J. No. 1090 (QL) (S.C.), which involves facts closer
to those in the present appeal; Doe v.  Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality)
Commissioners of Police (1989), 58 D.L.R. (4th) 396 (Ont. H.C.), affirmed
(1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 225 (Div. Ct.); and Perrier v. Sorgat (1979), 25
O.R. (2d) 645 (Co. Ct.).  A contrary conclusion was reached by Bielby J. of the
Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench in Rutherford v. Swanson, [1993] 6 W.W.R.
126, but her decision, I think, suffers from the frailty of failing to differentiate
the different functions the RCMP perform, and the potentially different
relationship of the RCMP to the Crown in the exercise of those different
functions.  

 

35                              
While these cases generally examine the relationship between the police
and various governments in terms of civil liability, the statements made are of
much broader import.  It would make no sense in either law or policy to hold
the police to be agents of the Crown for the purposes of allowing the Crown to
shelter the police under its immunity in criminal matters, but to hold the
police not to be Crown agents in civil matters to enable the government
to resile from liability for police misconduct.  The Crown cannot have it both
ways.  

 

36                             
Parenthetically, it should be noted that Parliament has provided
in the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-50 , s. 36 , that:








 

36.  For the purposes of determining liability in any
proceedings by or against the Crown, a person who was at any time a member of
the Canadian Forces or of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police shall be deemed
to have been at that time a servant of the Crown.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

A “deeming” section would not be necessary if it were the case that,
at law, an RCMP officer was in any event a Crown servant for all purposes.

 

The Limitations on Crown Agency Expressed in R. v. Eldorado Nuclear
Ltd.

 

37                              
Even if the police could be considered agents of the Crown for some
purposes, and even if the Crown itself were not bound by the Narcotic
Control Act, I agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal that in this case the
police stepped outside the lawful ambit of their agency, and whatever immunity
was associated with that agency was lost.  This principle was elaborated upon
by this Court in two cases decided in 1983, namely Eldorado Nuclear, supra,
and Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 339.  In
the latter case, the CBC, which by its enabling  statute is expressly
constituted a Crown corporation, was nevertheless held subject to prosecution for
broadcasting an obscene film.  This Court held that the CBC’s conduct put it
outside the scope of its agency, per Estey J., at p. 351:

 

... even if Crown immunity may be attributed to the appellant [CBC] in
some circumstances, and the actions of the appellant in such circumstances
attributed to the Crown, it does not necessarily follow that the immunities
attendant upon the status of Crown agency will flow through to the benefit and
protection of the appellant in all circumstances.

 

 








38                              
In Eldorado Nuclear, on the other hand, the Court concluded that
two Crown corporations, namely Eldorado Nuclear Limited and Uranium Canada
Limited, who were accused of being parties to an unlawful uranium cartel, could
not be prosecuted under the Combines Investigation Act.  They were
acting pursuant to their corporate objects set out by Parliament in their
respective constitutive statutes, and, in respect of acts done in furtherance
of their statutory objects, the Combines Investigation Act had no
application to them.

 

39                              
While it may be convenient and expeditious for the police to enforce the
Narcotic Control Act by breaking it themselves under “controlled
circumstances”, such a strategy in the present case was not necessary to
accomplish the RCMP’s statutory mandate (Eldorado Nuclear, supra,
at p. 568).  Parliament made it clear in s. 37  of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Act , that the RCMP must act “in accordance with the law”. 
Parliament has made it clear that illegality by the RCMP is neither part of any
valid public purpose nor necessarily “incidental” to its achievement.  If some
form of public interest immunity is to be extended to the police to assist in
the “war on drugs”, it should be left to Parliament to delineate the nature and
scope of the immunity and the circumstances in which it is available, as indeed
was done in 1996, after the events in question here, in s. 8  of the Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 .

 

40                              
The respondent raises one further argument concerning the legality of the
RCMP’s conduct in engaging in the reverse sting operation.  This argument
consists of the bald assertion that the police have available to them a
so-called “necessity” justification or defence as that term was used in R.
v. Salvador (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 521 (N.S.C.A.), per Macdonald
J.A., at p. 542:

 

Generally speaking, the defence of necessity covers
all cases where non-compliance with law is excused by an emergency or justified
by the pursuit of some greater good.








 

It is not
alleged that the RCMP conduct is such that it could be said to fall within one
of the established “justification” defences (e.g., self-defence or defence of
third parties) and the Crown offers no authority for the proposition that there
exists (or should exist) in Canada a so-called “law enforcement” justification
defence generally.  The United States experience is mixed: see G. Greaney,
“Crossing the Constitutional Line: Due Process and the Law Enforcement
Justification” (1992), 67 Notre Dame L. Rev. 745.  In any event, the
author points out that the law justification defence “only applies if the
‘conduct is within the reasonable exercise of the policeman’s duty ...’” (p.
784) and “... courts also look to an officer’s adherence to state and federal
laws when examining the reasonableness of the officer’s conduct” (p. 787).  The
law enforcement justification is frequently raised in the United States in the
context of federal law enforcement activity that complies with federal laws but
breaches state laws.  In such cases, the United States Supreme Court held in In
re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1 (1890), per Miller J., at p. 68 and following,
that the officer claiming the law enforcement justification must be performing
an act that he or she is authorized by federal law to perform as part of
police duties and that actions in violation of state law must be carefully
circumscribed so as to do no more than is necessary and proper.  See Baucom
v. Martin, 677 F.2d 1346 (11th Cir. 1982), per Wood J., at p. 1350. 
It would therefore appear that in the United States a police officer would not
be entitled to the law enforcement justification where, as here, the
constitutive statute of the police force imposes on its members the duty to act
“in accordance with the law” (Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act , s. 37 ).

 








41                              
In this country, it is accepted that it is for Parliament to determine
when in the context of law enforcement the end justifies means that would
otherwise be unlawful.  As Dickson J. (as he then was) put it in Perka v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, at p. 248:

 

The Criminal Code  has specified a number of identifiable
situations in which an actor is justified in committing what would otherwise be
a criminal offence.  To go beyond that and hold that ostensibly illegal acts
can be validated on the basis of their expediency, would import an undue
subjectivity into the criminal law.  It would invite the courts to second-guess
the legislature and to assess the relative merits of social policies underlying
criminal prohibitions.  Neither is a role which fits well with the judicial
function.

 

 

While it is
true that Dickson J. was not addressing the issue of police illegality in that
case, a general “law enforcement justification” would run counter to the
fundamental constitutional principles outlined earlier.  It should be
emphasized that the police in this case were not acting in an emergency or
other exigent circumstances.  This was a premeditated, carefully planned
attempt to sell a ton of hashish.  If the Crown wishes to argue for specific
relief against criminal or civil liability of the police in emergency or other
exigent circumstances in a future case on facts where the argument fairly
arises, the issue will be more fully addressed at that time.  Such arguments have
no application here.

 

Evidence of
Police “Good Faith”

 








42                              
The conclusion that the police conduct in undertaking a reverse sting
is, on the facts of this case, illegal does not of itself amount to an abuse of
process or, to take it a step further, entitle the appellants to a stay.  The
legality of police action is but a factor, albeit an important factor, to be
considered in the determination of whether an abuse of process has taken
place:   see R. v. Lore (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 255 (Que. C.A.), at p.
271; R. v. Matthiessen (1995), 172 A.R. 196 (Q.B.), at pp. 209-10; and Bond,
supra, at p. 333.  Where the courts have found that the illegality or
other misconduct amounts to an abuse of process, it has by no means followed
that a stay of proceedings was considered the appropriate remedy.  In R. v.
Xenos (1991), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 362 (Que. C.A.), for example, a stay was
refused despite the finding that the police had participated in conduct that
was said to be totally unacceptable, per Brossard J.A., at p. 371.

 

43                              
I should make it clear that even if it should turn out here that the
police acted contrary to the legal advice provided by the Department of Justice
(and we have no reason at this stage to believe this to be the case), there
would still be no right to an automatic stay.  Apart from everything else, the
trial judge would still have to consider any other information or explanatory
circumstances that emerge during the inquiry into whether the police or
prosecutorial conduct “shocks the conscience of the community”.  In Mack,
supra, Lamer J. considered that the need to grant some leeway to law
enforcement officials to combat consensual criminal offences such as drug
trafficking must be weighed against the courts’ concern about law enforcement
techniques that involve conduct that the citizenry would not tolerate.  The
underlying rationale of the doctrine of abuse of process is to protect the
integrity of the courts’ process and the administration of justice from
disrepute:  see Mack, at pp. 938 and 940.  Lamer J. stated, at p. 939,
that “the doctrine of abuse of process draws on the notion that the state is
limited in the way it may deal with its citizens”. 

 

Relevance
of Legislative Change

 








44                              
It was considered in the court below, and by the Quebec Court of Appeal
in Lore, supra, at p. 271, that the immunity provisions of the
new Controlled Drugs and Substances Act  should be seen as confirmation
that the use of reverse stings would not shock the conscience of the community
in such a way as to constitute an abuse of process.  The fact that Parliament
has now enacted specific legislation permitting (in defined circumstances) the
police to engage lawfully in the type of conduct at issue in this appeal
confirms that the police conduct was not considered lawful by Parliament
prior to the amendments’ being made.  The Interpretation Act, R.S.C.,
1985, c. I-21 , s. 10 , provides that “[t]he law [is] always speaking”, and
Parliament’s view at the relevant time was embodied in its then existing
enactments.  At the material time, Parliament had enacted that conduct
otherwise illegal could be done lawfully “under the authority of this Act or
the regulations”, and under the regulations the police were authorized to
possess but not to sell controlled drugs.  Judicial notice can certainly be
taken of continuing public concern about the drug trade, and in a general way
of the difficulties of successfully employing traditional police techniques
against large-scale crime organizations.  There is little need in this case to
resort for evidence of public concern to legislative amendments that were not
made until two years after the trial.  Nevertheless, given that the test in Mack
calls for a broad inquiry into the balance of public interests, I would not
want to exclude the possibility that after-the-fact legislation may throw some
light on community acceptance of a reverse sting operation.  It was but a short
step from the existing regulatory authority to possess drugs as a result of a
sting to the desired regulatory authority to sell drugs in the context of a
reverse sting.  One of the purposes of the balancing exercise discussed by
L’Heureux-Dubé J. in O’Connor, supra, at paras. 129-30, is to put
misconduct by the authorities, worrisome as it may be, in a larger societal
perspective.

 








45                              
The point here, however, is slightly different.  Superadded to the issue
of illegal conduct is the possibility of a police operation planned and
executed contrary to the advice (if this turns out to be true) of the
Department of Justice.  The suggestion is that the RCMP, after securing the
relevant legal advice, nevertheless put itself above the law in its pursuit of
the appellants.  The community view of the police misconduct would, I think, be
influenced by knowing whether or not the police were told in advance by their
legal advisers that the reverse sting was illegal.  Standing by itself,
therefore, the subsequent 1996 enactment addresses only part of the issue.

 

The
Assertion of Police Good Faith Was Based in Part on Advice Received from the
Department of Justice

 

 

46                              
Counsel for the Crown has invited the Court to evaluate the police
conduct throughout the reverse sting and submits their actions do not
constitute an abuse of process.  One of the issues is good faith, as discussed
in A. Choo, Abuse of Process and Judicial Stays of Criminal Proceedings
(1993), at pp. 107-118.  As evidence of the fact that the reverse sting was
undertaken “with the purest of motives”, the Crown has pointed out that the
reverse sting proposal went through between 9 and 14 stages of approval before
finally being authorized.  The reverse sting operation was carefully planned,
narrowly targeted, and ensured that no hashish actually changed hands, and thus
never entered the criminal black market.  Most importantly for present purposes
is the fact that the Crown emphasized the good faith reliance of the police on
legal advice.  In the factum prepared for the Ontario Court of Appeal, for
example, the argument was put as follows:

 

26. The conduct of the R.C.M.P. in the present case
falls far short of conduct that has hitherto received the courts’ seal of
approval.  In the case at bar, as in the aforementioned case law, there has
been no abuse of process or any conduct by the police that could “shock the
conscience of the community”.  In particular, regard must be had to the
following considerations:

 

                                                                     ...








(f) The R.C.M.P. based, at least in part, the legality of there [sic]
investigatory techniques on valid case law (R. v. Lore, unreported,
Quebec Superior Court, 26 February, 1991, Pinard, J.S.C.) and consulted with
the Department of Justice with regard to any problems of illegality.
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

The RCMP’s
reliance on legal advice was thus invoked as part of its “good faith”
argument.  The privilege belonged to the client, and the RCMP joined with the
Crown to put forward that position.  While not explicitly stated in so many
words, the plain implication sought to be conveyed to the appellants and to the
courts was that the RCMP accepted the legal advice they were given by the
Department of Justice and acted in accordance with it.  The credibility of a
highly experienced departmental lawyer was invoked to assist the RCMP position
in the abuse of process proceedings.

 








47                              
The Crown now says that the content of communications between the police
and the Department of Justice could not affect the issue as to whether the
conduct of the RCMP gave rise to an abuse of process.  The Crown says it does
not matter what the RCMP were told as to the legality of the reverse sting
operation the RCMP planned.  Assuming the worst, the Crown says, no stay is
warranted.  On this point they rely on the analysis of the Court of Appeal,
already quoted at para. 13, that if it were shown that the RCMP “moved ahead on
their own as mavericks” (p. 197) despite legal advice to the contrary, it would
be “of about equal weight” to a situation where the RCMP acted on a positive legal
opinion that what they proposed to do would be lawful.  With respect, I do not
agree.  A police force that chooses to operate outside the law is not the same
thing as a police force that made an honest mistake on the basis of erroneous
advice.  We have no reason to think the RCMP ignored the advice it was given,
but as the RCMP did make an issue of the legal advice it received in response
to the stay applications, the appellants were entitled to have the bottom line
of that advice corroborated.

 

48                              
It appears, therefore, that the only satisfactory way to resolve the
issue of good faith is to order disclosure of the content of the relevant
advice.  This should be done (for the reasons to be discussed) on the basis of
waiver by the RCMP of the solicitor-client privilege.  It would be convenient,
however, to address beforehand three additional contentions by the appellants. 
They say that disclosure of the communications between Cpl. Reynolds and the
Department of Justice ought never to have been withheld in the first place
because (a) no solicitor-client relationship exists between Department of
Justice lawyers and police officers and therefore no privilege ever arose in
this case, or,  if such a relationship did exist, the communications at issue
in the present case fell within either (b) the future crimes or (c) full answer
and defence exceptions to the privilege.

 

(a)   Existence of a Solicitor-Client
Relationship between the RCMP Officers and Lawyers in the Department of Justice

 

 

49                              
The solicitor-client privilege is based on the functional needs of the
administration of justice.  The legal system, complicated as it is, calls for
professional expertise.  Access to justice is compromised where legal advice is
unavailable.  It is of great importance, therefore, that the RCMP be able to
obtain professional legal advice in connection with criminal investigations
without the chilling effect of potential disclosure of their confidences in
subsequent proceedings.  As Lamer C.J. stated in R. v. Gruenke, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 263, at p. 289:

 








The prima facie protection for solicitor-client communications
is based on the fact that the relationship and the communications between
solicitor and client are essential to the effective operation of the legal
system.  Such communications are inextricably linked with the very system which
desires the disclosure of the communication....

 

 

See also Smith
v. Jones, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 455, per Cory J., at para. 46, and per
Major J., at para. 5.  This Court had previously, in Descôteaux v.
Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, at p. 872, adopted Wigmore’s formulation
of the substantive conditions precedent to the existence of the right of the
lawyer’s client to confidentiality (Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8 (McNaughton
rev. 1961), § 2292, at p. 554):

 

Where legal advice of any kind is sought from a
professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, the communications relating
to that purpose, made in confidence by the client, are at his instance
permanently protected from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser,
except the protection be waived.   [Emphasis and numerotation deleted.]

 

 

Cpl. Reynolds’
consultation with Mr. Leising of the Department of Justice falls squarely
within this functional definition, and the fact that Mr. Leising works for an
“in-house” government legal service does not affect the creation or character
of the privilege.  

 








50                              
It is, of course, not everything done by a government (or other) lawyer
that attracts solicitor-client privilege.  While some of what government
lawyers do is indistinguishable from the work of private practitioners, they
may and frequently do have multiple responsibilities including, for example,
participation in various operating committees of their respective departments. 
Government lawyers who have spent years with a particular client department may
be called upon to offer policy advice that has nothing to do with their legal
training or expertise, but draws on departmental know-how.  Advice given by
lawyers on matters outside the solicitor-client relationship is not protected. 
A comparable range of functions is exhibited by salaried corporate counsel
employed by business organizations.  Solicitor-client communications by
corporate employees with in-house counsel enjoy the privilege, although (as in
government) the corporate context creates special problems:  see, for example,
the in-house inquiry into “questionable payments” to foreign governments at
issue in Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383 (1981), per
Rehnquist J. (as he then was), at pp. 394-95.  In private practice some lawyers
are valued as much (or more) for raw business sense as for legal acumen.  No
solicitor-client privilege attaches to advice on purely business matters even
where it is provided by a lawyer.  As Lord Hanworth, M.R., stated in Minter
v. Priest, [1929] 1 K.B. 655 (C.A.), at pp. 668-69:

 

[I]t is not sufficient for the witness to say, “I went to a solicitor’s
office.” ... Questions are admissible to reveal and determine for what purpose
and under what circumstances the intending client went to the office.

 

 

Whether or not
solicitor-client privilege attaches in any of these situations depends on the
nature of the relationship, the subject matter of the advice and the
circumstances in which it is sought and rendered.  One thing is clear:  the
fact that Mr. Leising is a salaried employee did not prevent the formation of a
solicitor-client relationship and the attendant duties, responsibilities and
privileges.  This rule is well established, as set out in Crompton (Alfred)
Amusement Machines Ltd. v. Comrs. of Customs and Excise (No. 2),
[1972] 2 All E.R. 353 (C.A.), per Lord Denning, M.R., at p. 376:

 








Many barristers and solicitors are employed as legal advisers, whole
time, by a single employer.  Sometimes the employer is a great commercial
concern.  At other times it is a government department or a local authority. 
It may even be the government itself, like the Treasury Solicitor and his
staff.  In every case these legal advisers do legal work for their employer and
for no one else.  They are paid, not by fees for each piece of work, but by a
fixed annual salary.  They are, no doubt, servants or agents of the employer. 
For that reason the judge thought that they were in a different position from other
legal advisers who are in private practice.  I do not think this is correct. 
They are regarded by the law as in every respect in the same position as those
who practise on their own account.  The only difference is that they act for
one client only, and not for several clients.  They must uphold the same
standards of honour and of etiquette.  They are subject to the same duties to
their client and to the court.  They must respect the same confidences.  They
and their clients have the same privileges....  I have always proceeded on the
footing that the communications between the legal advisers and their employer
(who is their client) are the subject of legal professional privilege; and I
have never known it questioned.

 

 

51                              
It is true that the Minister of Justice, who is ex officio the
Attorney General of Canada, has a special legislated responsibility to ensure
that “the administration of public affairs is in accordance with law”, and in
that respect he or she is not subject to the same client direction as private
clients:  see Department of Justice Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. J-2 , s. 4 .  We
are not, however, concerned in this case with any conflict that may arise
between the Minister and one of the “client departments”.  Here, the Attorney
General and the RCMP are united in asserting the privilege.  

 

52                              
In the United States, the courts have recognized that solicitor-client
privilege attaches to communications between government employees and
government lawyers that fulfill the Wigmore conditions mentioned in Descôteaux,
supra.  The point is made, for example, by the authors of the
Restatement (Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, § 124 (Proposed
Final Draft No. 1, 1996)), as follows:

 

Unless applicable law otherwise provides, the attorney-client privilege
extends to a communication of a governmental organization ... and of an
individual officer ... of a governmental organization.

 

 








It is possible
that in the United States the application of the privilege to government
counsel may be circumscribed differently than in this country owing to the
structure of the United States Constitution and government:   see, e.g., the
discussion of the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, in the
context of an investigation of alleged criminal conduct by government officials
in In re Lindsey, 158 F.3d 1263 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  In this
country as well, the solicitor-client privilege may operate differently in some
respects because of the public interest aspect of government administration,
but such differences are not relevant to this appeal. 

 

53                              
In support of their assertion that no privilege exists in respect of
communications between the police and Crown counsel in the course of a criminal
investigation, the appellants rely upon Re Girouard and the Queen
(1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 261 (S.C.B.C.), and R. v. Ladouceur, [1992]
B.C.J. No. 2854 (QL) (S.C.).  Girouard concerned the admissibility of
the details of a conversation between Crown counsel and a police officer who
was to be a Crown witness in the hallway outside the courtroom on the day of a
preliminary inquiry.  The conversation was overheard by defence counsel.  The
B.C. Supreme Court held, inter alia, that because the conversation had
been overheard, any privilege that might have existed had been waived.

 








54                              
Girouard advocates the proposition that communications as to the
question of identification between a police officer who is to be a Crown
witness and Crown counsel are not protected by solicitor-client privilege. 
This seems to be based on the Court’s view that because a police officer was
not an agent of the Attorney General, no solicitor-client relationship could
exist between a Crown counsel and a police officer.   I disagree with this
analysis.  The existence of an agency relationship is not essential to the
creation of solicitor-client privilege.  In seeking advice from a lawyer about
the exercise of his original authority that “cannot be exercised on the
responsibility of any person but himself” (Enever, supra, p.
977), Cpl. Reynolds satisfied the conditions precedent “to the existence of the
right of the lawyer’s client to confidentiality” (Descôteaux, supra,
p. 872).  Subject to what is said below, when Mr. Leising of the Department of
Justice initially advised Cpl. Reynolds about the legality of a reverse sting
operation, these communications were protected by solicitor-client privilege.

 

(b)   The “Future Crimes and Fraud” Exception

 

55                              
It is well established, as the appellants argue, that there is an
exception to the principle of confidentiality of solicitor-client
communications where those communications are criminal or else made with a view
to obtaining legal advice to facilitate the commission of a crime.  The
exception was noted by Dickson J. in Solosky v. The Queen, [1980] 1
S.C.R. 821, at pp. 835-36:

 

More significantly, if a client seeks guidance from a lawyer in order
to facilitate the commission of a crime or a fraud, the communication will not
be privileged and it is immaterial whether the lawyer is an unwitting dupe or
knowing participant.  The classic case is R. v. Cox and Railton [(1884),
14 Q.B.D. 153], in which Stephen J. had this to say (p. 167):  “A communication
in furtherance of a criminal purpose does not ‘come in the ordinary scope of
professional employment’.”

 

 








56                              
The Court of Appeal concluded, at p. 200, that the “future crimes”
exception applied because it was a “fair inference” from a memorandum dated June
1991 “that the lawyer was offering advice which, even given the utmost good
faith, was being utilized by Corporal Reynolds in the planning of the
venture”.  A distinction must be drawn, I think, between the evidence of Cpl.
Reynolds and related documents, on the one hand, and the position taken by the
Crown and the RCMP before the courts in this case, on the other hand.  The
testimony of Cpl. Reynolds was that he did not require legal advice “to plan
the venture”.  He already knew about reverse sting operations.  Nor did he seek
the advice to “facilitate” the crime.  He sought advice as to whether or not
the operation he had in mind was lawful.  This is the sort of transaction
advice sought every day from lawyers.  In my view, the privilege is not automatically
destroyed if the transaction turns out to be illegal.  As noted above, Dickson
J., in Solosky, at p. 835, referred to R. v. Cox and Railton
(1884), 14 Q.B.D. 153, as “[t]he classic case” on this point.  In that case, a
judgment debtor consulted a solicitor about the vulnerability of assets to
seizure.  The solicitor’s advice was essentially that it could not be done
without a bona fide sale of the property in question.  Later, when the
judgment creditor attempted to realize against the assets, they had been sold. 
It was alleged that the sale was fraudulent as having been entered into in an
attempt to deprive the judgment creditor of the fruits of his judgment.  The
solicitor was called as a witness and compelled to testify about the advice he
had given.  Stephen J., for the court on appeal, after affirming the importance
of the solicitor-client privilege, went on to discuss the limits of this
doctrine as follows, at p. 168:

 

In order that the rule [the solicitor-client privilege] may apply there
must be both professional confidence and professional employment, but if the
client has a criminal object in view in his communications with his solicitor
one of these elements must necessarily be absent.  The client must either
conspire with his solicitor or deceive him.  If his criminal object is
avowed, the client does not consult his adviser professionally, because it
cannot be the solicitor’s business to further any criminal object.  If the
client does not avow his object he reposes no confidence, for the state of
facts, which is the foundation of the supposed confidence, does not exist.  The
solicitor’s advice is obtained by a fraud.   [Emphasis added.]

 

 

The court
found in that case that although the solicitor was not an active part of the
conspiracy to defraud the creditor, he had been duped by his clients, and the
privilege was destroyed.

 








57                              
The language of the court in Cox and Railton (“... if the client
has a criminal object in view in his communications with his solicitor...”)
implied that this exception can only apply where a client is knowingly
pursuing a criminal purpose, and it is so laid down by Professor Wigmore (Wigmore
on Evidence, supra, § 2298, at p. 573) where he gives an affirmative
answer to the question, “Must . . . the advice be sought for a knowingly
unlawful end?” (Emphasis in original.)

 

58                              
Although the issue has apparently not been directly considered in the
Canadian case law, the Wigmore view was subsequently espoused by the authors
of  “The Future Crime or Tort Exception to Communications Privileges” (1964),
77 Harv. L. Rev. 730, where they state as follows, at pp. 730-31:

 

The attorney-client privilege has always been
subject to the qualification that protection is denied to communications
wherein a lawyer’s assistance is sought in activity that the client knows
to constitute a crime or tort. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

The scope of
the “future crimes” exception is circumscribed on a public policy basis, as
explained at p. 731:

 

The knowledge requirement minimizes the effect of the exception on
proper communications; absent this requirement legitimate consultations would
be inhibited by the risk that their subject matter might turn out to be illegal
and therefore unprivileged.  Moreover, counseling against unfounded claims
or illegal projects is an important part of the lawyer’s function.
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

59                              
This explanation is consistent with the statement of the principle of
Lamer J. in Descôteaux, supra, at p. 881:

 

Confidential communications, whether they relate to
financial means or to the legal problem itself, lose that character if and to
the extent that they were made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice to
facilitate the commission of a crime.

 

 








The exception
to the formation of the privilege was elaborated upon by Lord Parmoor in O’Rourke
v. Darbishire, [1920] A.C. 581 (H.L.), at p. 621:

 

The third point relied on by the appellant, as an
answer to the claim of professional privilege, is that the present case comes
within the principle that such privilege does not attach where a fraud has been
concocted between a solicitor and his client, or where advice has been given to
a client by a solicitor in order to enable him to carry through a fraudulent
transaction.  If the present case can be brought within this principle, there
will be no professional privilege, since it is no part of the professional
duty of a solicitor either to take part in the concoction of fraud, or to
advise his client how to carry through a fraud.  Transactions and
communications for such purposes cannot be said to pass in professional
confidence in the course of professional employment.   [Emphasis added.]

 

 

60                              
A leading U.S. case that considers this question is State ex rel.
North Pacific Lumber Co. v. Unis, 579 P.2d 1291 (Or. 1978).  In that case,
it was alleged that an employer illegally eavesdropped on an employee’s
telephone conversations.  The employer stated that before undertaking this
eavesdropping, it had sought legal advice and it claimed solicitor-client
privilege over these communications.  The employee sought the disclosure of
this advice, but disclosure was refused.  The court made the following
pertinent comment, at p. 1295:

 

We approve of the requirement that, in order to
invoke the exception to the privilege, the proponent of the evidence must show
that the client, when consulting the attorney, knew or should have known
that the intended conduct was unlawful.  Good-faith consultations with
attorneys by clients who are uncertain about the legal implications of a
proposed course of action are entitled to the protection of the privilege, even
if that action should later be held improper.   [Emphasis added.]

 

 








61                              
In the present case, the only evidence of RCMP knowledge, constructive
or otherwise, is the testimony of Cpl. Reynolds who insists that he believed
the reverse sting operation to be lawful.  In light of his prior study of the
Superior Court decision in Lore, supra, it cannot fairly be said
that Cpl. Reynolds “knew or should have known that the intended conduct was
unlawful” at the time he approached Mr. Leising.  Nor does the evidence
establish that Mr. Leising was a “conspirator or a dupe”.  There is therefore
no basis in Cpl. Reynold’s evidence to suggest that in this case the
solicitor-client privilege never came into existence.

 

62                              
The question remains whether the privilege was destroyed when the RCMP
sold hashish to the appellants.  It is argued by the authors of “The Future
Crime or Tort Exception to Communications Privileges”, supra, at p. 731,
that a “subsequent formation of criminal intent should be held to destroy a
preexisting privilege”.  This would suggest that proof of a crime which, except
in offences of absolute liability, entails proof of intent, would automatically
destroy the privilege in every case.  Such a proposition could have a very
broad impact, for example, in the field of regulatory crimes and offences.  In
my view, destruction of the privilege takes more than evidence of the existence
of a crime and proof of an anterior consultation with a lawyer.  There must be
something to suggest that the advice facilitated the crime or that the lawyer
otherwise became a “dupe or conspirator”.  The evidence of Cpl. Reynolds does not
establish such things, but the formal position of the Crown, with the support
of the RCMP, goes beyond his evidence.  The RCMP position before the Court was
that the decision to proceed with the reverse sting had been taken with the
participation and agreement of the Department of Justice.  By adopting this
position, the RCMP belatedly brought itself within the “future crimes”
exception, and put in question the continued existence of its privilege. 

 








63                              
If there had been no waiver of privilege by the RCMP in this case, I
would have taken the view that any papers documenting the legal advice (or, if
there was no contemporaneous documentation, an affidavit setting out the
content of the relevant advice) ought to be provided in the first instance to
the trial judge.  If he or she were satisfied, either on the basis of the
documents themselves or on the basis of the documents supplemented by other
evidence, that the documented advice could be fairly said in some way to have
facilitated the crime, the documents would then be provided to the appellants. 
If the lawyer had merely advised about the legality of the operation, and
thereby made himself neither dupe nor conspirator in the facilitation of a
crime, the proper course would have been to return the papers to the RCMP.

 

64                              
In this case, however, I think the RCMP did waive the privilege, as
discussed below.  The relevant solicitor-client communications that came within
the scope of the waiver ought therefore to be turned over directly to the
appellants without the need in the first instance of a two-stage procedure
involving the trial judge.  

 

(c)  Full Answer and Defence

 








65                              
Another exception to the rule of confidentiality of solicitor-client
privilege may arise where adherence to that rule would have the effect of
preventing the accused from making full answer and defence:   see R. v.
Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 340; R. v. Dunbar (1982),
68 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 43; R. v. Gray (1992), 74 C.C.C.
(3d) 267 (B.C.S.C.), at pp. 273-74.  The Crown concedes the validity of the
principle, but suggests that it is irrelevant to an abuse of process
application because it applies only where “innocence is at stake”, which is no
longer the case in the present appeal.  Where innocence is not at stake, the
Crown contends, the accused’s right to make full answer and defence is not
engaged.  In this connection, the Crown relies upon R. v. Seaboyer,
[1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, per McLachlin J., at p. 607, and A. (L.L.) v. B.
(A.), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., at p. 561.  I
do not think these cases can be taken as deciding an issue that was not before
the Court on those occasions.  The Ontario Court of Appeal concluded at p. 200
that the full answer and defence exception applied because “the entire jeopardy
of the appellants remained an open issue until disposition of the stay
application”.  This may be true, but the appellants were not providing “full
answer and defence” to the stay application.  On the contrary, the appellants
are the moving parties.  The application is being defended by the Crown.  The
appellants’ initiative in launching a stay application does not, of itself,
authorize a fishing expedition into solicitor-client communications to which
the Crown is a party.  

 

66                              
As stated, the present appeal is decided on the basis of waiver of
solicitor-client privilege and I leave for another day the decision whether, in
the absence of waiver, full answer and defence considerations may themselves
operate to compel the disclosure of solicitor-client privilege of
communications in an abuse of process proceeding and, if so, in what
circumstances.

 

Waiver of
Solicitor-Client Privilege

 








67                              
The record is clear that the RCMP put in issue Cpl. Reynolds’ good faith
belief in the legality of the reverse sting, and asserted its reliance upon his
consultations with the Department of Justice to buttress that position.  The
RCMP factum in the Ontario Court of Appeal has already been quoted in para.
46.  In my view, the RCMP waived the right to shelter behind solicitor-client
privilege the contents of the advice thus exposed and relied upon.  I
characterize the RCMP rather than Cpl. Reynolds as the client in these
circumstances because even though he was exercising the duties of his public
office as a police officer, Cpl. Reynolds was seeking the legal advice in the
course of his RCMP employment.  The identification of  “the client” is a
question of fact.  There is no conceptual conflict between the individual
responsibilities of the police officer and characterizing the “client” as the
RCMP.  Despite the existence of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act 
and related legislation, I believe the relationship among individual policemen
engaged in criminal investigations is accurately set out in Halsbury’s Laws
of England (4th ed. 1981), vol. 36, at p. 107:

 

The history of the police is the history of the office of constable
and, notwithstanding that present day police forces are the creation of statute
and that the police have numerous statutory powers and duties, in essence a
police force is neither more nor less than a number of individual constables,
whose status derives from the common law, organised together in the interests
of efficiency.

 

 

If Cpl.
Reynolds himself were characterized as the client, it could be said that
sharing the contents of that advice with his fellow officers would have
breached the confidentiality and waived the privilege, which would be absurd. 
At the same time, if the legal advice were intentionally disclosed outside the
RCMP, even to a department or agency of the federal government, such disclosure
might waive the confidentiality, depending on the usual rules governing
disclosure to third parties by a client of communications from its solicitor.  

 

68                              
It is convenient to recall at this point that at the time of the
original disclosure motions, the position of the appellants was clear, i.e.,
disclose the communications or forswear reliance upon them.  Notwithstanding
this caution, the RCMP and their legal counsel chose to rely upon the
communications to support their argument of good faith reliance.  In doing so,
the privilege was waived.

 








69                              
In Rogers v. Bank of Montreal, [1985] 4 W.W.R. 508 (B.C.C.A.),
the bank put a defaulting customer into receivership, and the customer sued
both the bank and the receiver, who then launched third party proceedings at
each other.  The bank said it had relied on the receiver’s advice in putting
the customer into receivership.  The receiver denied detrimental reliance on
its advice, and wanted to know what other professional advice the bank had
received at the relevant time.  In particular, the receiver wanted to know what
legal advice the bank had received from its own lawyers, MacKimmie Matthews. 
The bank claimed solicitor-client privilege over this correspondence.  In
rejecting the bank’s claim of privilege, the court, per Hutcheon J.A.,
stated as follows, at p. 513:

 

The issue in this case is not the knowledge of the
bank.  The issue is whether the bank was induced to take certain steps in
reliance upon the advice from the receiver on legal matters.  To take one
instance, the receiver, according to the bank, advised the bank that it was not
necessary to allow Abacus [the plaintiff debtor] time for payment before the
appointment of the receiver.  A significant legal decision had been rendered
some months earlier to the opposite of that advice.  The extent to which the
bank had been advised about that decision, not merely of its result, is
important in the resolution of the issue whether the bank relied upon the
advice of the receiver. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

The Court goes
on to adopt the reasoning of the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia in United States v. Exxon Corp., 94 F.R.D. 246 (1981) as
follows, at pp. 248-49:

 

Most courts considering the matter have concluded that a party waives
the protection of the attorney-client privilege when he voluntarily injects
into the suit the question of his state of mind.  For example, in Anderson
v. Nixon, 444 F.Supp. 1195, 1200 (D.D.C. 1978), Judge Gesell stated that as
a general principle “a client waives his attorney-client privilege when he
brings suit or raises an affirmative defense that makes his intent and
knowledge of the law relevant.”

 

                                                                     ...

 








Thus, the only way to assess the validity of Exxon’s affirmative
defenses, voluntarily injected into this dispute, is to investigate
attorney-client communications where Exxon’s interpretation of various DOE
policies and directives was established and where Exxon expressed its
intentions regarding compliance with those policies and directives. 

 

 

It appears the
court in Rogers found that any privilege with respect to correspondence
with the bank’s solicitors had been waived as necessarily inconsistent with its
pleading of reliance, even though the bank itself had not referred to, much
less relied upon, the existence of advice from its own solicitors.

 








70                              
The present case presents a stronger argument for waiver than Rogers. 
The Crown led evidence from Cpl. Reynolds about his knowledge of the law with
respect to reverse sting operations – he testified that he had read the
Superior Court decision in Lore, supra, and was of the view that
the operation in question was legal.  But Cpl. Reynolds also testified, in
answer to the appellants’ counsel, that he sought out the opinion of Mr.
Leising of the Department of Justice to verify the correctness of his own
understanding.  The appellants’ counsel recognized that this alone was not
enough to waive the privilege.  Cpl. Reynolds was simply responding to questions
crafted by the appellants, as he was required to do.  Appellants’ counsel
accepted that he had no right at that point to access the communications.  His
comment to the judge was simply that “I certainly don’t want to hear the
argument that ‘Oh well, the police acted in good faith because they acted on
legal advice’”.  The critical point is that the Court did hear that
precise argument from the Crown at a later date.  The RCMP and its legal
advisers were explicit in their factum in the Court of Appeal, where it was
argued that “regard must be had to the following considerations ... (f)
The R.C.M.P. ... consulted with the Department of Justice with regard to any
problems of illegality” (emphasis added).  We understand that the same position
was advanced to the trial judge.  As Rogers, supra, shows, it is
not always necessary for the client actually to disclose part of the contents
of the advice in order to waive privilege to the relevant communications of
which it forms a part.  It was sufficient in this case for the RCMP to support
its good faith argument by undisclosed advice from legal counsel in
circumstances where, as here, the existence or non-existence of the asserted
good faith depended on the content of that legal advice.  The clear implication
sought to be conveyed to the court by the RCMP was that Mr. Leising’s advice
had assured the RCMP that the proposed reverse sting was legal.

 

71                              
Cpl. Reynolds was not required to pledge his belief in the legality of
the reverse sting operation (comparable to the bank’s putting in issue its
belief in the correctness of the advice it was obtaining from the receiver in Rogers,
supra).  Nor was it necessary for the RCMP to plead the existence of Mr.
Leising’s  legal opinion as a factor weighing against the imposition of a stay
of proceedings (which went beyond what was done in Rogers).  The RCMP
and the Crown having done so, however, I do not think disclosure of the advice
in question could fairly be withheld. 

 

Result of
Non-Disclosure

 

72                              
Having found that the requested communications ought to have been
disclosed at trial, the Court of Appeal nevertheless excused non-disclosure on
the basis that it was willing to “assume the worst” against the Crown,
observing at p. 197 that “[o]n any version there is no avoiding that this was
very serious misconduct which should not be condoned by the courts in the sense
of giving any encouragement to its repetition”.  

 








73                              
I do not agree, with respect, that non-disclosure of information clearly
relevant to the good faith reliance issue can properly be disposed of by
adverse inferences.  The appellants were entitled to disclosure.  The Court of
Appeal said that it was prepared to assume the worst against the RCMP and on
that basis felt able to use s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code to
uphold the decision of the trial judge.  The difference between my approach and
that of the Court of Appeal is that in my view, with respect, a Department of
Justice opinion pronouncing the reverse sting to be unlawful would weigh
differently in the balancing of community values than a Department of Justice
opinion to the opposite effect.  Police illegality of any description is a
serious matter.  Police illegality that is planned and approved within the RCMP
hierarchy and implemented in defiance of legal advice would, if established,
suggest a potential systemic problem concerning police accountability and
control.  The RCMP position, on the other hand, that the Department of Justice
lent its support to an illegal venture may, depending on the circumstances,
raise a different but still serious dimension to the abuse of process
proceeding.  In either case, it is difficult to assume “the worst” if neither
alternative has been explored to determine what “the worst” is.  Because the
RCMP made a live issue of the legal advice it received from the Department of
Justice, the appellants were and are entitled to get to the bottom of it.

 

Disclosure
Direction

 

74                              
The relevant legal advice received by Cpl. Reynolds should be disclosed
to the appellants.  This is not an “open file” order in respect of the RCMP’s
solicitor and client communications.  The only legal advice that has to be
disclosed is the specific advice relating to the following matters identified
by Cpl. Reynolds:

 








1.    The legality of the police posing as sellers of drugs to persons
believed to be distributors of drugs.

 

2.    The legality of the police offering drugs for sale to persons
believed to be distributors of drugs.

 

3.    The possible consequences to the members of the RCMP who engaged
in one or both of the above, including the likelihood of prosecution.

 

While Cpl.
Reynolds also sought advice from Mr. Leising about other matters, including the
legality of any release of a sample of hashish to potential buyers, advice in
these respects need not be disclosed as they do not relate to a live issue at
this stage of the case.  If the relevant advice is documented, those portions
of the documents that deal with extraneous matters or that describe police methods
of criminal investigation may be masked.  All that is required is disclosure to
the appellants of the bottom line advice to confirm or otherwise the truth of
what the courts were advised about the legal opinions provided by the
Department of Justice.  If there is a dispute concerning the adequacy of
disclosure, the disputed documents or information should be provided by the
Crown to the trial judge for an initial determination whether this direction
has been complied with.  The trial judge should then determine what, if any,
additional disclosure should be made to the appellants.

 

75                              
If it turns out that Mr. Leising simply erred in connection with this
particular opinion, disclosure will support the RCMP officers’ claim that they
acted in good faith on legal advice, and the application for a stay of
proceedings will have to be dealt with on that basis.  








 

Nature of
the New Trial

 

76                              
Even if it is established that the RCMP proceeded with the reverse sting
contrary to the legal advice from the Department of Justice, the result would
not automatically be a stay of proceedings.  The test in Mack would
still apply.  The RCMP used its alleged good faith reliance on the Department
of Justice legal advice to neutralize or at least blunt any finding of police
illegality.  If it were determined that the police did not rely on
Department of Justice advice, the result would be a finding of police
illegality without extenuating circumstances.  As discussed in paras. 42 and
43, police illegality does not automatically give rise to a stay of
proceedings.

 

77                              
If it should turn out that the reverse sting was launched despite legal
advice to the contrary, I think this would be an aggravating factor.  However,
to repeat, it will be up to the trial judge to determine whether or not a stay
is warranted in light of all the circumstances, including the countervailing
consideration that police conduct did not lead to any serious infringement of
the accused’s rights, the RCMP was careful to keep control of the drugs and
ensure that none went on the market, and the acknowledged difficulty of
combatting drug rings using traditional police methods.

 

78                              
In R. v. Pearson, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620, this Court accepted that
in entrapment applications where the innocence of the accused is no longer a
live issue, a new trial may be limited to the stay of proceedings application. 
The authority to make such an order under ss. 686(2) and (8) is explained in Pearson,
at para. 16:

 








... the quashing of the formal order of conviction does not, without
more, entail the quashing of the underlying verdict of guilt.  In most
successful appeals against conviction, the court of appeal which quashes the
conviction will also overturn the finding of guilt; however, the latter is not
a legally necessary consequence of the former.  Under s. 686(8), the court of
appeal retains the jurisdiction to make an “additional order” to the effect
that, although the formal order of conviction is quashed, the verdict of guilt
is affirmed, and the new trial is to be limited to the post-verdict entrapment
motion.

 

 

As entrapment
is simply one form of abuse of process, the same approach should be adopted in
the present case.

 

Conclusion

 

79                              
The appeal is allowed in part, a new trial is ordered limited to the
issue of whether a stay of proceedings should be granted for abuse of process. 
The respondent is ordered to disclose to the appellants the materials referred
to in para. 74 of these reasons in advance of the retrial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 








Criminal law ‑‑ Sexual assault ‑‑
Consent ‑‑ Nature of consent ‑‑ Accused persistently
engaging complainant in a series of progressively more intimate sexual advances
‑‑ Complainant clearly saying no to each advance ‑‑
Complainant fearful and accused aware of her fear ‑‑ Whether a
sexual assault occurred ‑‑ Whether defence of “implied consent”
exists in Canadian law ‑‑ Whether trial judge erred in applying
that defence ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
ss. 265(1) , (2) , (3) , 273.1 , 273.2 , 686(4) .

 

The complainant, a 17‑year‑old woman, was
interviewed by the accused for a job in his van.  She left the van door open as
she was hesitant about discussing the job offer in his vehicle.  The interview
was conducted in a polite, business‑like fashion.  After the interview,
the accused invited the complainant to see some of his work which was in the
trailer behind the van.  The complainant purposely left the trailer door open
but the accused closed it in a way which made the complainant think that he had
locked it.  There was no evidence whether the door was actually locked.  The
complainant stated that she became frightened at this point.  The accused
initiated a number of incidents involving touching, each progressively more
intimate than the previous, notwithstanding the fact that the complainant
plainly said “no” on each occasion.  He stopped his advances on each occasion
when she said “no” but persisted shortly after with an even more serious
advance.  Any compliance by the complainant was done out of fear and the
conversation that occurred between them clearly indicated that the accused knew
that the complainant was afraid and certainly not a willing participant.  The
trial judge acquitted the accused of sexual assault relying on the defence of
implied consent and the Court of Appeal upheld that acquittal.  At issue
here are whether the trial judge erred in his understanding of consent in
sexual assault and whether his conclusion that the defence of “implied consent”
exists in Canadian law was correct. 

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Cory, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.:  If the trial judge
misdirected himself as to the legal meaning or definition of consent, then his
conclusion is one of law, and is reviewable. It properly falls to this Court to
determine whether the trial judge erred in his understanding of consent in
sexual assault, and to determine whether his conclusion that the defence of
“implied consent” exists in Canadian law was correct. 

 

A conviction for sexual assault requires proof beyond
reasonable doubt of two basic elements, that the accused committed the actus
reus and that he had the necessary mens rea.  The actus reus
of assault is unwanted sexual touching.  The mens rea is the intention
to touch, knowing of, or being reckless of or wilfully blind to, a lack of
consent, either by words or actions, from the person being touched.

 

The actus reus of sexual assault is established
by the proof of three elements:  (i) touching, (ii) the sexual nature of the
contact, and (iii) the absence of consent.  The first two of these elements are
objective.  It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused’s actions
were voluntary.  The Crown need not prove that the accused had any mens rea
with respect to the sexual nature of his behaviour. The absence of consent,
however, is purely subjective and determined by reference to the complainant’s
subjective internal state of mind towards the touching, at the time it
occurred.  While the complainant’s testimony is the only source of direct
evidence as to her state of mind, credibility must still be assessed by the
trier of fact in light of all the evidence.  It is open to the accused to claim
that the complainant’s words and actions, before and during the incident, raise
a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want
the sexual touching to take place.  If, however, the trial judge believes the
complainant that she did not consent, the Crown has discharged its obligation
to prove the absence of consent. The accused’s perception of the complainant’s
state of mind is not relevant and only becomes so when a defence of honest but
mistaken belief in consent is raised in the mens rea stage of the
inquiry.

 








The trier of fact may only come to one of two
conclusions:  the complainant either consented or did not.  There is no third
option.  If the trier of fact accepts the complainant’s testimony that she did
not consent, no matter how strongly her conduct may contradict that claim, the
absence of consent is established and the third component of the actus reus
of sexual assault is proven.  No defence of implied consent to sexual assault
exists in Canadian law.  Here, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s
testimony that she did not want the accused to touch her, but then treated her
conduct as raising a reasonable doubt about consent, described by him as
“implied consent”.  This conclusion was an error.

 








To be legally effective, consent must be freely
given.  Therefore, even if the complainant consented, or her conduct raises a
reasonable doubt about her non‑consent, circumstances may arise which
call into question what factors prompted her apparent consent.  Section 265(3) 
of the Criminal Code  enumerates a series of conditions ‑‑
including submission by reason of force, fear, threats, fraud or the exercise
of authority ‑‑ under which the law will deem an absence of consent
in assault cases, notwithstanding the complainant’s ostensible consent or
participation.  In a situation where the trier of fact finds that the
complainant did not want to be touched sexually and made her decision to permit
or participate in the sexual assault activity as a result of an honestly held
fear, the law deems an absence of consent and the third component of the actus
reus of sexual assault is established.  The complainant’s fear need not be
reasonable, nor must it be communicated to the accused in order for consent to
be vitiated.  While the plausibility of the alleged fear, and any overt
expressions of it, are obviously relevant to assessing the credibility of the
complainant’s claim that she consented out of fear, the approach is
subjective.  If, as in this case, the complainant’s testimony establishes the
absence of consent beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus analysis is
complete, and the trial judge should have turned his attention to the accused’s
perception of the encounter and the question of whether the accused possessed
the requisite mens rea.

 

The mens rea of sexual assault contains two
elements:  intention to touch and knowing of, or being reckless of or wilfully
blind to, a lack of consent on the part of the person touched.

 

The accused may challenge the Crown’s evidence of mens
rea by asserting an honest but mistaken belief in consent.  The defence of
mistake is simply a denial of mens rea.  It does not impose any burden
of proof upon the accused.  The accused need not testify in order to raise the
issue.  Support for the defence may stem from any of the evidence before the
Court, including the Crown’s case-in-chief and the testimony of the
complainant.  However, as a practical matter, this defence will usually arise
in the evidence called by the accused. 

 

Consent is an integral component of the mens rea,
but considered from the perspective of the accused. In order to cloak the
accused’s actions in moral innocence, the evidence must show that he believed
that the complainant communicated consent to engage in the sexual activity in
question.  A belief by the accused that the complainant, in her own mind,
wanted him to touch her but did not express that desire, is not a defence.  The
accused’s speculation as to what was going on in the complainant’s mind
provides no defence.

 








There is a difference in the concept of “consent” as
it relates to the state of mind of the complainant vis‑à‑vis
the actus reus of the offence and the state of mind of the accused in
respect of the mens rea.  For the purposes of the actus reus “consent”
means that the complainant in her mind wanted the sexual touching to take
place.  In the context of mens rea -- specifically for the purposes of
the honest but mistaken belief in consent -- “consent” means that the
complainant had affirmatively communicated by words or conduct her agreement to
engage in sexual activity with the accused.  The two parts of the analysis must
be kept separate. 

 

Not all beliefs upon which an accused might rely will
exculpate him.  Consent in relation to the mens rea of the accused is
limited by both the common law and the provisions of ss. 273.1(2)  and
273.2  of the Criminal Code .

 

The accused’s putting consent into issue is synonymous
with an assertion of an honest belief in consent.  If his belief is found to be
mistaken, then honesty of that belief must be considered.  As an initial step
the trial judge must determine whether any evidence exists to lend an air of
reality to the defence.  If so, then the question which must be answered by the
trier of fact is whether the accused honestly believed that the complainant had
communicated consent.  Any other belief, however honestly held, is not a
defence.  Moreover, to be honest the accused’s belief cannot be reckless,
willfully blind or tainted by an awareness of any of the factors enumerated in
ss. 273.1(2)  and 273.2 .  If at any point the complainant has expressed a
lack of agreement to engage in sexual activity, then it is incumbent upon the
accused to point to some evidence from which he could honestly believe consent
to have been re‑established before he resumed his advances.  If this
evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s mens rea, the
charge is not proven.

 








Here, the accused knew that the complainant was not
consenting before each encounter.  The trial judge ought to have considered
whether anything occurred between the communication of non‑consent and
the subsequent sexual touching which the accused could honestly have believed
constituted consent.  The trial record conclusively establishes that the
accused’s persistent and increasingly serious advances constituted a sexual
assault for which he had no defence.  But for his errors of law, the trial
judge would necessarily have found the accused guilty.  Since a new trial would
not be in the interests of justice, this Court can properly exercise its
discretion under s. 686(4) of the Code and enter a conviction.

 

Whether the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain
that the complainant was consenting is a question of fact to be determined by
the trier of fact only after the air of reality test has been met.  Given the
way the trial and appeal were argued, s. 273.2 (b) did not have to be
considered.

 

Per L’Heureux‑Dubé
and Gonthier JJ.:  Agreement was expressed generally with the reasons of Major

Canada is a party to the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which requires
respect for and observance of the human rights of women. Violence against women
is as much a matter of equality as it is an offence against human dignity and a
violation of human rights.  These human rights are protected by ss. 7  and 15  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and their violation
constitutes an offence under the assault provisions of s. 265  and under the
more specific sexual assault provisions of ss. 271 , 272  and 273  of the Criminal
Code .  

 








This case is not about consent, since none was given. 
It is about myths and stereotypes. The trial judge believed the complainant and
accepted her testimony that she was afraid and he acknowledged her
unwillingness to engage in any sexual activity. However, he gave no legal
effect to his conclusion that the complainant submitted to sexual activity out
of fear that the accused would apply force to her.  The application of s.
265(3)  requires an entirely subjective test.  As irrational as a complainant’s
motive might be, if she subjectively felt fear, it must lead to a legal finding
of absence of consent.

 

The question of implied consent should not have
arisen.  The trial judge’s conclusion that the complainant implicitly consented
and that the Crown failed to prove lack of consent was a fundamental error
given that he found the complainant credible, and accepted her evidence that
she said “no” on three occasions and was afraid.  This error does not derive
from the findings of fact but from mythical assumptions.  It denies women’s
sexual autonomy and implies that women are in a state of constant consent to
sexual activity.

 

The majority of the Court of Appeal also relied on
inappropriate myths and stereotypes.  Complainants should be able to rely on a
system free from such myths and stereotypes, and on a judiciary whose
impartiality is not compromised by these biased assumptions.

 

The findings necessary to support a verdict of guilty
on the charge of sexual assault were made.  In particular, there was no
evidence that would give an air of reality to a defence of  honest but mistaken
belief in consent for any of the sexual activity which took place in this case.
Section 273.2 (b) precludes an accused from raising that defence if he
did not take reasonable steps in the circumstances known to him at the time to
ascertain that the complainant was consenting. The position that the nature of
the defence of honest but mistaken belief does not need to be based on
reasonable grounds as long as it is honestly held has been modified by the
enactment of s. 273.2 (b), which introduced the “reasonable steps”
requirement. 

 








Finally, on the facts as found at trial, s. 273.1(2) (d)
also applies to this case and could not be ignored by the trial judge.

 

Per McLachlin J.:  The
reasons of Major J. and the finding of L’Heureux-Dubé J. that stereotypical
assumptions lay at the heart of this case were agreed with.  These
stereotypical assumptions no longer find a place in Canadian law.

//Major J.//

 

1                
Major J. --  In the
present appeal the accused was acquitted of sexual assault.  The trial judge
relied on the defence of implied consent.  This was a mistake of law as no such
defence is available in assault cases in Canada.  This mistake of law is
reviewable by appellate courts, and for the reasons that follow the appeal is
allowed.    

 

I.   Facts

 

2                
The complainant was a 17-year-old woman living in the city of Edmonton. 
She met the accused respondent Ewanchuk on the afternoon of June 2, 1994, while
walking through the parking lot of the Heritage Shopping Mall with her
roommate.  The accused, driving a red van towing a trailer, approached the two
young women. He struck up a conversation with them.  He related that he was in
the custom wood-working business and explained that he displayed his work at
retail booths in several shopping malls.  He said that he was looking for staff
to attend his displays, and asked whether the young women were looking for
work.  The complainant’s friend answered that they were, at which point the
accused asked to interview her friend privately.  She declined, but spoke with
the accused beside his van for some period of time about the sort of work he
required, and eventually exchanged telephone numbers with the accused.

 








3                
The following morning the accused telephoned the apartment where the
complainant and her friend resided with their boyfriends.  The complainant
answered the phone.  She told the accused that her friend was still asleep. 
When he learned this, the accused asked the complainant if she was interested
in a job.  She indicated that she was, and they met a short time later, again
in the Heritage Mall parking lot.  At the accused’s suggestion, the interview
took place in his van.  In the words of the complainant, a “very business-like,
polite” conversation took place.  Some time later, the complainant asked if she
could smoke a cigarette, and the accused suggested that they move outside since
he was allergic to cigarette smoke.   Once outside the van, he asked the
complainant if she would like to see some of his work, which was kept inside
the trailer attached to his van, and she indicated that she would.  

 

4                
The complainant entered the trailer, purposely leaving the door open
behind her.  The accused followed her in, and closed the door in a way which
made the complainant think that he had locked it.  There is no evidence whether
the door was actually locked, but the complainant stated that she became
frightened at this point.  Once inside the trailer, the complainant and the
accused sat down side-by-side on the floor of the trailer.   They spoke and
looked through a portfolio of his work.  This lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after
which the conversation turned to more personal matters.  

 








5                
During the time in the trailer the accused was quite tactile with the
complainant, touching her hand, arms and shoulder as he spoke.  At some point
the accused said that he was feeling tense and asked the complainant to give
him a massage.  The complainant complied, massaging the accused’s shoulders for
a few minutes.  After she stopped, he asked her to move in front of him so that
he could massage her, which she did.  The accused then massaged the
complainant’s shoulders and arms while they continued talking.  During this
mutual massaging the accused repeatedly told the complainant to relax, and that
she should not be afraid.  As the massage progressed, the accused attempted to
initiate more intimate contact. The complainant stated that, “he started to try
to massage around my stomach, and he brought his hands up around -- or
underneath my breasts, and he started to get quite close up there, so I used my
elbows to push in between, and I said, No”.

 

6                
The accused stopped immediately, but shortly thereafter resumed
non-sexual massaging, to which the complainant also said, “No”.  The accused
again stopped, and said, “See, I’m a nice guy. It’s okay”.  

 

7                
The accused then asked the complainant to turn and face him.  She did
so, and he began massaging her feet.  His touching progressed from her feet up
to her inner thigh and pelvic area.  The complainant did not want the accused to
touch her in this way, but said nothing as she said she was afraid that any
resistance would prompt the accused to become violent.  Although the accused
never used or threatened any force, the complainant testified that she did not
want to “egg [him] on”.  As the contact progressed, the accused laid himself
heavily on top of the complainant and began grinding his pelvic area against
hers.  The complainant testified that the accused asserted, “that he could get
me so horny so that I would want it so bad, and he wouldn’t give it to me
because he had self-control”.  

 

8                
The complainant did not move or reciprocate the contact.  The accused
asked her to put her hands across his back, but she did not; instead she lay
“bone straight”.   After less than a minute of this the complainant asked the
accused to stop.  “I said, Just please stop.  And so he stopped”.  The accused
again told the complainant not to be afraid, and asked her if she trusted that
he wouldn’t hurt her.  In her words, the complainant said, “Yes, I trust that
you won’t hurt me”.  On the stand she stated that she was afraid throughout,
and only responded to the accused in this way because she was fearful that a
negative answer would provoke him to use force. 








 

9                
After this brief exchange, the accused went to hug the complainant and,
as  he did so, he laid on top of her again, continuing the pelvic grinding.  
He also began moving his hands on the complainant’s inner thigh, inside her
shorts, for a short time.  While still on top of her the accused began to
fumble with his shorts and took out his penis.  At this point the complainant
again asked the accused to desist, saying, “No, stop”.  

 

10            
Again, the accused stopped immediately, got off the complainant, smiled
at her and said something to the effect of, “It’s okay.  See, I’m a nice guy, I
stopped”.  At this point the accused again hugged the complainant lightly
before opening up his wallet and removing a $100 bill, which he gave to the
complainant.  She testified that the accused said that the $100 was for the
massage and that he told her not to tell anyone about it.  He made some
reference to another female employee with whom he also had a very close and
friendly relationship, and said that he hoped to get together with the
complainant again.  

 

11            
Shortly after the exchange of the money the complainant said that she
had to go.  The accused opened the door and the complainant stepped out.  Some
further conversation ensued outside the trailer before the complainant finally
left and walked home.  On her return home the complainant was emotionally
distraught and contacted the police.   

 








12            
At some point during the encounter the accused provided the complainant
with a brochure describing his woodwork and gave her his name and address,
which she wrote on the brochure.  The investigating officer used this
information to locate the accused at his home, where he was arrested.  He was
subsequently charged with sexual assault and tried before a judge sitting
alone.  

 

13            
The accused did not testify, leaving only the complainant’s evidence as
to what took place between them.  The trial judge found her to be a credible
witness and her version of events was not contradicted or disputed.  In
cross-examination the complainant testified that, although she was extremely afraid
throughout the encounter, she had done everything possible to project a
confident demeanour, in the belief that this would improve her chances of
avoiding a violent assault.  The following passage is illustrative of her
evidence:

 

Q       You didn’t want to show any discomfort,
right?

 

A        No.

 

Q       Okay.  In fact, you wanted to project the
picture that you were quite happy to be with him and everything was fine,
right?

 

A        Not that I was happy, but that I was
comfortable.

 

Q       Comfortable, all right.  And relaxed?

 

A        Yes.

 

Q       And you did your best to do that, right?

 

A        Yes.

 

14            
Later in cross-examination, counsel for the accused again asked the
complainant about the image she sought to convey to the complainant by her
behaviour:

 

Q       And you wanted to make sure that he didn’t
sense any fear on your part, right?

 

A        Yes.

 








II.   Judicial
History

 

A.  Court
of Queen’s Bench

 

15            
The trial judge made a number of findings of fact in his oral
judgment.   He found that the complainant was a credible witness.  He found as
facts:  that in her mind she had not consented to any of the sexual touching
which took place; that she had been fearful throughout the encounter; that she
didn’t want the accused to know she was afraid; and that she had actively
projected a relaxed and unafraid visage.  He concluded that the failure of the
complainant to communicate her fear, including her active efforts to the
contrary, rendered her subjective feelings irrelevant.

 

16            
The trial judge then considered the question of whether the accused had
raised the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, and concluded that
he had not.  The trial judge characterized the defence position as being a
failure by the Crown to discharge its onus of proving “beyond a reasonable
doubt that there was an absence of consent”.  That is, he took the defence to
be asserting that the Crown had failed to prove one of the components of the actus
reus of the offence.   This led the trial judge to characterize the defence
as one of “implied consent”.  In so doing he concluded that the
complainant’s conduct was such that it could be objectively construed as
constituting consent to sexual touching of the type performed by the accused.

 








17            
The trial judge treated consent as a question of the complainant’s
behaviour in the encounter.  As a result of that conclusion he found that the
defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent had no application since the
accused made no claims as to his mental state.  On the totality of the
evidence, provided solely by the Crown’s witnesses, the trial judge concluded
that the Crown had not proven the absence of consent beyond a reasonable doubt
and acquitted the accused.  

 

B.  Alberta
Court of Appeal (1998), 57 Alta. L.R. (3d) 235

 

18            
Each of the three justices of the Court of Appeal issued separate
reasons.  McClung and Foisy JJ.A. both dismissed the appeal on the basis that
it was a fact-driven acquittal from which the Crown could not properly
appeal.   In addition, McClung J.A. concluded that the Crown had failed to
prove that the accused possessed the requisite criminal intent.   He found that
the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had
intended to commit an assault upon the complainant.

 

19            
Fraser C.J. dissented.  She found that the trial judge erred in a number
of ways.   Specifically, she found that:

 

--       The trial judge erred in his
interpretation of the term “consent” as that term is applied to the offence of
sexual assault.

 

--       There is no defence of  “implied consent”,
independent of the provisions of ss. 273.1  and 273.2  of the Criminal Code .


 

--       It was an error to employ an objective
test to determine whether a complainant’s “consent” was induced by fear.

 

--       The trial judge erred in the legal effect he ascribed:

 








to the complainant’s silence when subjected to sexual contact by the respondent;

 

to the complainant’s non-disclosure of her fear when subjected to
sexual contact by the respondent; 

 

to the complainant’s expressed lack of agreement to sexual contact;

 

to the fact that there was no basis for a defence of  “implied consent”
or “consent by conduct”;

 

to the fact that there was no consent to sexual activity.

 

--       The defence of mistake of fact had no
application to the issue of ‘consent’ in this case.

 

--       The trial judge erred when he failed to
consider whether the respondent had been wilfully blind or reckless as to
whether the complainant consented.

 

20            
Fraser C.J. held that the only defence available to the accused was that
of honest but mistaken belief in consent, and concluded that this defence could
not be sustained on the facts as found.  Accordingly, she would have allowed
the appeal and substituted a verdict of guilty. 

 

III.  Analysis

 

A. 
Appealable Questions of Law








 

21            
The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the ground
that the Crown raised no question of law but sought to overturn the trial
judge’s finding of fact that reasonable doubt existed as to the presence or
absence of consent.  If the trial judge misdirected himself as to the legal
meaning or definition of consent, then his conclusion is one of law, and is
reviewable.  See Belyea v. The King, [1932] S.C.R. 279, per
Anglin C.J., at p. 296:

 

The right of appeal by the Attorney-General,
conferred by [the Criminal Code ] is, no doubt, confined to “questions of
law”. . . .  But  we cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the
Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as
is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal
effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or the jury . .
. to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it
as anything else but a question of law,  -- especially where, as here, it is a
clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

22            
It properly falls to this Court to determine whether the  trial judge
erred in his understanding of consent in sexual assault, and to determine
whether his conclusion that the defence of “implied consent” exists in Canadian
law was correct. 

 

B.  The
Components of Sexual Assault 

 

23            
A conviction for sexual assault requires proof beyond reasonable doubt
of two basic elements, that the accused committed the actus reus and
that he had the necessary mens rea.  The actus reus of assault is
unwanted sexual touching.  The mens rea is the intention to touch,
knowing of, or being reckless of or wilfully blind to, a lack of consent,
either by words or actions, from the person being touched.

 

(1)      Actus Reus








24            
The crime of sexual assault is only indirectly defined in the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  The offence is comprised of an assault within
any one of the definitions in s. 265(1) of the Code, which is
committed in circumstances of a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity
of the victim is violated:  see R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909. 
Section 265  provides that:

 

265. (1)  A person commits an assault when 

 

(a) without the consent of another person, he applies force
intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

 

(b) he attempts or threatens, by an act or a gesture, to apply
force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person to believe on
reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose; or

 

(c) while openly wearing or carrying a weapon or an imitation
thereof, he accosts or impedes another person or begs.

 

(2)  This section applies to all forms of assault,
including sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third
party or causing bodily harm and aggravated sexual assault.

 

25            
The actus reus of sexual assault is established by the proof of
three elements:  (i) touching, (ii) the sexual nature of the contact, and (iii)
the absence of consent.  The first two of these elements are objective.  It is
sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused’s actions were voluntary. 
The sexual nature of the assault is determined objectively; the Crown need not
prove that the accused had any mens rea with respect to the sexual
nature of his or her behaviour:  see R. v. Litchfield, [1993] 4 S.C.R.
333, and R. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293.  

 








26            
The absence of consent, however, is subjective and determined by
reference to the complainant’s subjective internal state of mind towards the
touching, at the time it occurred:  see R. v. Jensen (1996), 106
C.C.C. (3d) 430 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 437-38, aff’d [1997] 1 S.C.R. 304, R. v.
Park, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at p. 850, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., and D.
Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1995), at p. 513.

 

27            
Confusion has arisen from time to time on the meaning of consent as an
element of the actus reus of sexual assault.  Some of this confusion has
been caused by the word “consent” itself.  A number of commentators have
observed that the notion of consent connotes active behaviour:  see, for
example, N. Brett, “Sexual Offenses and Consent” (1998), 11 Can. J. Law
& Jur. 69, at p. 73.  While this may be true in the general use of the
word, for the purposes of determining the absence of consent as an element of
the actus reus, the actual state of mind of the complainant is
determinative.  At this point, the trier of fact is only concerned with the
complainant’s perspective.  The approach is purely subjective.  

 

28            
The rationale underlying the criminalization of assault explains this.
Society is committed to protecting the personal integrity, both physical and
psychological, of every individual. Having control over who touches one’s body,
and how, lies at the core of human dignity and autonomy.  The inclusion of
assault and sexual assault in the Code expresses society’s determination
to protect the security of the person from any non-consensual contact or
threats of force.  The common law has recognized for centuries that the
individual’s right to physical integrity is a fundamental principle, “every
man’s person being sacred, and no other having a right to meddle with it, in
any the slightest manner”:  see Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of
England (4th ed. 1770), Book III, at p. 120.  It follows that any
intentional but unwanted touching is criminal.

 








29            
While the complainant’s testimony is the only source of direct evidence
as to her state of mind, credibility must still be assessed by the trial judge,
or jury, in light of all the evidence.  It is open to the accused to claim that
the complainant’s words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a
reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the
sexual touching to take place.  If, however, as occurred in this case, the
trial judge believes the complainant that she subjectively did not consent, the
Crown has discharged its obligation to prove the absence of consent.

 

30         
                      The complainant’s statement that she did not
consent is a matter of credibility to be weighed in light of all the evidence
including any ambiguous conduct.  The question at this stage is purely one of
credibility, and whether the totality of the complainant’s conduct is
consistent with her claim of non-consent.  The accused’s perception of the
complainant’s state of mind is not relevant.  That perception only arises when
a defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent is raised in the mens rea
stage of the inquiry.

 

(a)      “Implied Consent”

 

31            
Counsel for the respondent submitted that the trier of fact may believe
the complainant when she says she did not consent, but still acquit the accused
on the basis that her conduct raised a reasonable doubt.  Both he and the 
trial judge refer to this as “implied consent”.  It follows from the foregoing,
however, that the trier of fact may only come to one of two conclusions:  the
complainant either consented or not.  There is no third option.  If the trier
of fact accepts the complainant’s testimony that she did not consent, no matter
how strongly her conduct may contradict that claim, the absence of consent is
established and the third component of the actus reus of sexual assault
is proven.  The doctrine of implied consent has been recognized in our common
law jurisprudence in a variety of contexts but sexual assault is not one of
them.  There is no defence of implied consent to sexual assault in Canadian
law. 

 








(b)      Application to the Present Case

 

32            
In this case, the  trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant
that she did not consent.  That being so, he then misdirected himself when he
considered the actions of the complainant, and not her subjective mental state,
in determining the question of consent.  As a result, he disregarded his
previous finding that all the accused’s sexual touching was unwanted.  Instead
he treated what he perceived as her ambiguous conduct as a failure by the Crown
to prove the absence of consent.  

 

33            
As previously mentioned, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s
testimony that she did not want the accused to touch her, but then treated her
conduct as raising a reasonable doubt about consent, described by him as
“implied consent”.  This conclusion was an error.  See D. Stuart, Annotation on
R. v. Ewanchuk (1998), 13 C.R. (5th) 330, where the author points out
that consent is a matter of the state of mind of the complainant while belief
in consent is, subject to s. 273.2 of the Code, a matter of the state of
mind of the accused and may raise the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent.  

 

34            
The finding that the complainant did not want or consent to the sexual
touching cannot co-exist with a finding that reasonable doubt exists on the
question of consent.  The  trial judge’s acceptance of the complainant’s
testimony regarding her own state of mind was the end of the matter on this
point. 

 








35            
This error was compounded somewhat by the trial judge’s holding that the
complainant’s subjective and self-contained fear would not have changed his
mind as to whether she consented.  Although he needn’t have considered this
question, having already found that she did not in fact consent, any residual
doubt raised by her ambiguous conduct was accounted for by what he accepted as
an honest and pervasive fear held by the complainant.

 

(c)      Effect of the Complainant’s Fear

 

36            
To be legally effective, consent must be freely given.  Therefore, even
if the complainant consented, or her conduct raises a reasonable doubt about
her non-consent, circumstances may arise which call into question what factors
prompted her apparent consent.  The Code defines a series of conditions
under which the law will deem an absence of consent in cases of assault,
notwithstanding the complainant’s ostensible consent or participation.  As
enumerated in s. 265(3) , these include submission by reason of force, fear,
threats, fraud or the exercise of authority, and codify the longstanding common
law rule that consent given under fear or duress is ineffective:  see G.
Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1983), at pp. 551-61.   
This section reads as follows:

 

265. . . .

 

(3)  For the purposes of this section, no consent is
obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of

 

(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person
other than the complainant;

 

(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the
complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

(c) fraud; or

 

(d) the exercise of authority.

 








37            
The words of Fish J.A. in Saint-Laurent v. Hétu, [1994] R.J.Q. 69
(C.A.), at p. 82, aptly describe the concern which the trier of fact must bear
in mind when evaluating the actions of a complainant who claims to have been
under fear, fraud or duress:

 

“Consent” is . . . stripped of its defining
characteristics when it is applied to the submission, non-resistance,
non-objection, or even the apparent agreement, of a deceived, unconscious or
compelled will.

 

38            
In these instances the law is interested in a complainant’s reasons for
choosing to participate in, or ostensibly consent to, the touching in
question.  In practice, this translates into an examination of the choice the
complainant believed she faced.  The courts’ concern is whether she freely
made up her mind about the conduct in question.  The relevant section of the Code
is s. 265(3) (b), which states that there is no consent as a matter of
law where the complainant believed that she was choosing between permitting
herself to be touched sexually or risking being subject to the application of
force.  

 

39            
The question is not whether the complainant would have preferred not to
engage in the sexual activity, but whether she believed herself to have only
two choices:  to comply or to be harmed.  If  a complainant agrees to sexual
activity solely because she honestly believes that she will otherwise suffer
physical violence, the law deems an absence of consent, and the third component
of the actus reus of sexual assault is established.  The trier of fact
has to find that the complainant did not want to be touched sexually and made
her decision to permit or participate in sexual activity as a result of an
honestly held fear.  The complainant’s fear need not be reasonable, nor must it
be communicated to the accused in order for consent to be vitiated.  While the
plausibility of the alleged fear, and any overt expressions of it, are
obviously relevant to assessing the credibility of the complainant’s claim that
she consented out of fear, the approach is subjective.   








 

40            
Section 265(3) identifies an additional set of circumstances in
which the accused’s conduct will be culpable. The trial judge only has to
consult s. 265(3)  in those cases where the complainant has actually chosen to
participate in sexual activity, or her ambiguous conduct or submission has
given rise to doubt as to the absence of consent.  If, as in this case, the
complainant’s testimony establishes the absence of consent beyond a reasonable
doubt, the actus reus analysis is complete, and the trial judge should
have turned his attention to the accused’s perception of the encounter and the
question of whether the accused possessed the requisite mens rea.

 

(2)      Mens Rea

 

41            
Sexual assault is a crime of general intent.  Therefore, the Crown need
only prove that the accused intended to touch the complainant in order to
satisfy the basic mens rea requirement.  See R. v. Daviault,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 63.

 

42            
However, since sexual assault only becomes a crime in the absence of the
complainant’s consent, the common law recognizes a defence of mistake of fact
which removes culpability for those who honestly but mistakenly believed that
they had consent to touch the complainant.  To do otherwise would result in the
injustice of convicting individuals who are morally innocent:  see R. v.
Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3.  As such, the mens rea of sexual
assault contains two elements: intention to touch and knowing of, or being
reckless of or wilfully blind to, a lack of consent on the part of the person
touched.  See Park, supra, at para. 39. 

 








43            
The accused may challenge the Crown’s evidence of mens rea by
asserting an honest but mistaken belief in consent.  The nature of this defence
was described in Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, at p. 148,
by Dickson J. (as he then was) (dissenting in the result):

 

Mistake is a defence...where it prevents an accused from having the mens
rea which the law requires for the very crime with which he is charged.
Mistake of fact is more accurately seen as a negation of guilty intention than
as the affirmation of a positive defence.  It avails an accused who acts
innocently, pursuant to a flawed perception of the facts, and nonetheless
commits the actus reus of an offence.  Mistake is a defence though, in
the sense that it is raised as an issue by an accused.  The Crown is rarely
possessed of knowledge of the subjective factors which may have caused an
accused to entertain a belief in a fallacious set of facts.

 

44            
The defence of mistake is simply a denial of mens rea.  It does
not impose any burden of proof upon the accused (see R. v. Robertson,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, at p. 936) and it is not necessary for the accused to
testify in order to raise the issue.  Support for the defence may stem from any
of the evidence before the court, including, the Crown’s case-in-chief and the
testimony of the complainant.  However, as a practical matter, this defence
will usually arise in the evidence called by the accused. 

 

(a)      Meaning of “Consent” in the Context of
an Honest but Mistaken Belief in Consent 

 

45            
As with the actus reus of the offence, consent is an integral
component of the mens rea, only this time it is considered from the
perspective of the accused.  Speaking of the mens rea of sexual assault
in Park, supra, at para. 39, L’Heureux-Dubé J. (in her concurring
reasons) stated that:

 

. . . the mens rea of sexual assault is not only satisfied when
it is shown that the accused knew that the complainant was essentially saying
“no”, but is also satisfied when it is shown that the accused knew that the
complainant was essentially not saying “yes”.

 








46            
In order to cloak the accused’s actions in moral innocence, the evidence
must show that he believed that the complainant communicated consent to
engage in the sexual activity in question.  A belief by the accused that
the complainant, in her own mind wanted him to touch her but did not express
that desire, is not a defence.  The accused’s speculation as to what was going
on in the complainant’s mind provides no defence. 

 

47            
For the purposes of the mens rea analysis, the question is
whether the accused believed that he had obtained consent.  What matters is
whether the accused believed that the complainant effectively said “yes”
through her words and/or actions. The statutory definition added to the Code
by Parliament in 1992 is consistent with the common law:

 

273.1 (1) Subject to subsection (2) and
subsection 265(3) , “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271 , 272  and
273 , the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question.

 

48            
There is a difference in the concept of “consent” as it relates to the
state of mind of the complainant vis-à-vis the actus reus of the
offence and the state of mind of the accused in respect of the mens rea.  For
the purposes of the actus reus, “consent” means that the complainant in
her mind wanted the sexual touching to take place.  

 

49            
In the context of  mens rea – specifically for the purposes of
the honest but mistaken belief in consent – “consent” means that the
complainant had affirmatively communicated by words or conduct her agreement to
engage in sexual activity with the accused.  This distinction should always be
borne in mind and the two parts of the analysis kept separate. 

 








(b)      Limits on Honest but Mistaken Belief in
Consent 

 

50            
Not all beliefs upon which an accused might rely will exculpate him. 
Consent in relation to the mens rea of the accused is limited by both
the common law and the provisions of ss. 273.1(2) and 273.2 of the Code,
which provide that: 

 

273.1 . . .

 

(2)  No consent is obtained, for the purposes of
sections 271 , 272  and 273 , where

 

(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a
person other than the complainant;

 

(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;

 

(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the
activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;

 

(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of
agreement to engage in the activity; or

 

(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual
activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to
engage in the activity.

 

273.2  It is not a defence to a charge under
section 271 , 272  or 273  that the accused believed that the complainant
consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where

 

(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s

 

(i)  self-induced intoxication, or

 

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or

 

(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the
circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the
complainant was consenting.

 








51            
For instance, a belief that silence, passivity or ambiguous conduct
constitutes consent is a mistake of law, and provides no defence:  see R. v.
M. (M.L.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 3.  Similarly, an accused cannot rely upon his
purported belief that the complainant’s expressed lack of agreement to sexual
touching in fact constituted an invitation to more persistent or aggressive
contact.  An accused cannot say that he thought “no meant yes”.  As Fraser C.J.
stated at p. 272 of her dissenting reasons below:

 

One “No” will do to put the other person on notice that there is then a
problem with “consent”.  Once a woman says “No” during the course of sexual
activity, the person intent on continued sexual activity with her must then
obtain a clear and unequivocal “Yes” before he again touches her in a sexual
manner.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

I take the
reasons of Fraser C.J. to mean that an unequivocal “yes” may be given by either
the spoken word or by conduct.

 

52            
Common sense should dictate that, once the complainant has expressed her
unwillingness to engage in sexual contact, the accused should make certain that
she has truly changed her mind before proceeding with further intimacies.  The
accused cannot rely on the mere lapse of time or the complainant’s silence or
equivocal conduct to indicate that there has been a change of heart and that
consent now exists, nor can he engage in further sexual touching to “test the
waters”.  Continuing sexual contact after someone has said “No” is, at a
minimum, reckless conduct which is not excusable.  In R. v. Esau, [1997]
2 S.C.R. 777, at para. 79, the Court stated:

 

An accused who, due to wilful blindness or recklessness, believes that
a complainant . . . in fact consented to the sexual activity at issue is
precluded from relying on a defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, a
fact that Parliament has codified:  Criminal Code , s. 273.2 (a)(ii).

 

(c)      Application to the Facts

 








53            
In this appeal the accused does not submit that the complainant’s
clearly articulated “No’s” were ambiguous or carried some other meaning.  In
fact, the accused places great reliance on his having stopped immediately each
time the complainant said “no” in order to show that he had no intention to
force himself upon her.  He therefore knew that the complainant was not
consenting on four separate occasions during their encounter.

 

54            
The question which the trial judge ought to have considered was whether
anything occurred between the communication of non-consent and the subsequent
sexual touching which the accused could honestly have believed constituted
consent.

  

55            
The trial judge explicitly chose not to consider whether the accused had
the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, and concluded that the
defence was probably not available unless the accused testified.  This
conclusion ignores the right of the accused to have this defence considered
solely on the Crown’s case.  The trial judge paid only passing interest to this
defence undoubtedly because he had concluded that the defence of implied
consent exonerated the accused.  The accused is entitled to have all available
defences founded on a proper basis considered by the court, whether he raises
them or not:  see R. v. Bulmer, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 782, at p. 789.

 

56            
In Esau, supra, at para. 15, the Court stated that,
“before a court should consider honest but mistaken belief or instruct a jury
on it there must be some plausible evidence in support so as to give an air of
reality to the defence”.  See also R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595. 
All that is required is for the accused to adduce some evidence, or refer to
evidence already adduced, upon which a properly instructed trier of fact could
form a reasonable doubt as to his mens rea:  see Osolin, supra,
at pp. 653-54, and p. 687. 

 








57            
The analysis in this appeal makes no attempt to weigh the evidence. At
this point we are concerned only with the facial plausibility of the defence of
honest but mistaken belief and should avoid the risk of turning the air of
reality test into a substantive evaluation of the merits of the defence.  

 

58            
As the accused did not testify, the only evidence before the Court was
that of the complainant.  She stated that she immediately said “NO” every time
the accused touched her sexually, and that she did nothing to encourage him. 
Her evidence was accepted by the trial judge as credible and sincere.  Indeed,
the accused relies on the fact that he momentarily stopped his advances each
time the complainant said “NO” as evidence of his good intentions.  This
demonstrates that he understood the complainant’s “NO’s” to mean precisely
that.  Therefore, there is nothing on the record to support the accused’s claim
that he continued to believe her to be consenting, or that he re-established
consent before resuming physical contact.  The accused did not raise nor does
the evidence disclose an air of reality to the defence of honest but mistaken
belief in consent to this sexual touching.

 

59            
The trial record conclusively establishes that the accused’s persistent
and increasingly serious advances constituted a sexual assault for which he had
no defence.  But for his errors of law, the trial judge would necessarily have
found the accused guilty.  In this case, a new trial would not be in the
interests of justice.  Therefore, it is proper for this Court to exercise its
discretion under s. 686(4) of the Code and enter a conviction:  see R.
v. Cassidy, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 345, at pp. 354-55.

 








60            
In her reasons, Justice L’Heureux-Dubé makes reference to s. 273.2(b)
of the Code.  Whether the accused took reasonable steps is a question of
fact to be determined by the trier of fact only after the air of reality test
has been met.  In view of the way the trial and appeal were argued, s. 273.2 (b)
did not have to be considered.

  

IV.   Summary

 

61            
In sexual assault cases which centre on differing interpretations of
essentially similar events, trial judges should first consider whether the
complainant, in her mind, wanted the sexual touching in question to occur. 
Once the complainant has asserted that she did not consent, the question is
then one of credibility.  In making this assessment the trier of fact must take
into account the totality of the evidence, including any ambiguous or
contradictory conduct by the complainant.  If the trier of fact is satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did not in fact consent, the actus
reus of sexual assault is established and the inquiry must shift to the
accused’s state of mind.

 

62            
If there is reasonable doubt as to consent, or if it is established that
the complainant actively participated in the sexual activity, the trier of fact
must still consider whether the complainant consented because of fear, fraud or
the exercise of authority as enumerated in s. 265(3) .  The complainant’s state of
mind in respect of these factors need not be reasonable.  If her decision to
consent was motivated by any of these factors so as to vitiate her freedom of
choice the law deems an absence of consent and the actus reus of sexual
assault is again established.

 








63            
Turning to the question of mens rea,  it is artificial to require
as a further step that the accused separately assert an honest but mistaken
belief in consent once he  acknowledges that the encounter between him and the
complainant unfolded more or less as she describes it, but disputes that any
crime took place:  see Park, supra, at p. 851, per
L’Heureux-Dubé J.  In those cases, the accused can only make one claim:  that
on the basis of the complainant’s words and conduct he believed her to be
consenting.  This claim both contests the complainant’s assertions that in her
mind she did not consent, and posits that, even if he were mistaken in his
assessment of her wishes, he was nonetheless operating under a morally innocent
state of mind.  It is for the trier of fact to determine whether the evidence
raises a reasonable doubt over either her state of mind or his. 

 

64            
In cases such as this, the accused’s putting consent into issue is
synonymous with an assertion of an honest belief in consent.  If his belief is
found to be mistaken, then honesty of that belief must be considered.  As an
initial step the trial judge must determine whether any evidence exists to lend
an air of reality to the defence.  If so, then the question which must be answered
by the trier of fact is whether the accused honestly believed that the
complainant had communicated consent.  Any other belief, however honestly
held, is not a defence. 

 

65            
Moreover, to be honest the accused’s belief cannot be reckless,
willfully blind or tainted by an awareness of any of the factors enumerated in
ss. 273.1(2)  and 273.2 .  If at any point the complainant has expressed a lack
of agreement to engage in sexual activity, then it is incumbent upon the
accused to point to some evidence from which he could honestly believe consent
to have been re-established before he resumed his advances.  If this
evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s mens rea, the
charge is not proven.

 








66            
Cases involving a true misunderstanding between parties to a sexual
encounter infrequently arise but are of profound importance to the community’s
sense of safety and justice.  The law must afford women and men alike the peace
of mind of knowing that their bodily integrity and autonomy in deciding when
and whether to participate in sexual activity will be respected.  At the same
time, it must protect those who have not been proven guilty from the social
stigma attached to sexual offenders. 

 

V.  Disposition

 

67            
The appeal is allowed, a conviction is entered and the matter is
remanded to the trial judge for sentencing.

L’Heureux-Dubé J. --
Violence against women takes many forms:  sexual assault is one of them.  In
Canada, one-half of all women are said to have experienced at least one
incident of physical or sexual violence since the age of 16 (Statistics Canada,
“The Violence Against Women Survey”, The Daily, November 18, 1993).  The
statistics demonstrate that 99 percent of the offenders in sexual assault cases
are men and 90 percent of the victims are women (Gender Equality in the
Canadian Justice System: Summary Document and Proposals for Action (April
1992), at p. 13, also cited in R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p.
669).

 








69                           
Violence against women is as much a matter of equality as it is an
offence against human dignity and a violation of human rights.  As Cory J.
wrote  in Osolin, supra, at p. 669, sexual assault “is an assault
upon human dignity and constitutes a denial of any concept of equality for
women”.  These human rights are protected by ss. 7  and 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and their violation constitutes  an offence
under the assault provisions of s. 265  and under the more specific sexual
assault provisions of ss. 271 , 272  and 273  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 .

 

70                           
So pervasive is violence against women throughout the world that the
international community adopted in December 18, 1979 (Res. 34/180), in addition
to all other human rights instruments, the Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Can. T.S. 1982 No. 31, entered
into force on September 3, 1981, to which Canada is a party, which has been
described as “the definitive international legal instrument requiring respect
for and observance of the human rights of women”.  (R. Cook, “Reservations to
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women”
(1990), 30 Va. J. Int’l L. 643, at p. 643).   Articles 1 and 2 of the
Convention read:

 

                                                                     

                                                            Article I

 

For the purposes of the present Convention, the term
“discrimination against women” shall mean any distinction, exclusion or
restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of
impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women,
irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women,
of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social,
cultural, civil or any other field.

 

 

                                                           Article II

 

States Parties condemn discrimination against women
in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a
policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake:

 

(a)        To embody the principle of the equality of
men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation
if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other
appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle;

 

(b)        To adopt appropriate legislative and
other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all
discrimination against women;

 








(c)        To establish legal protection of the
rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent
national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of
women against any act of discrimination;

 

(d)        To refrain from engaging in any act or
practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities
and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation;

 

(e)        To take all appropriate measures to
eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or
enterprise;

 

(f)         To take all appropriate measures,
including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs
and practices which constitute discrimination against women;

 

(g)        To repeal all national penal provisions
which constitute discrimination against women. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

71                           
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,
G.A. Res. 34/180, U.N. Doc. A/47/48 (1979), established under Article 17 of the
Convention, adopted General Recommendation No. 19 (Eleventh session, 1992) on
the interpretation of discrimination as it relates to violence against women:

 

 

6.  The Convention in article 1 defines discrimination against women.  The
definition of discrimination includes gender-based violence, that is,
violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that
affects women disproportionately.  It includes acts that inflict physical,
mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and
other deprivations of liberty. Gender-based violence may breach specific
provisions of the Convention, regardless of whether those provisions expressly
mention violence.

 

24. In light of these comments, the Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women recommends:

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

(b) States parties should ensure that laws against family violence and
abuse, rape, sexual assault and other gender-based violence give adequate
protection to all women, and respect their integrity and dignity.  Appropriate
protective and support services should be provided for victims.
Gender-sensitive training of judicial and law enforcement officers and other
public officials is essential for the effective implementation of the
Convention . . .   [Emphasis added.]

 








72                           
On February 23, 1994, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, G.A. Res. 48/104,
U.N. Doc. A/48/49 (1993).  Although not a treaty binding states, it sets out a
common international standard that U.N. members states are invited to follow. 
Article 4 of the Declaration provides:

 

                                                              Article
4

 

States should condemn violence against women and
should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid
their obligations with respect to its elimination.  States should pursue by all
appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating violence against
women and, to this end, should:

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(i) Take measures to ensure that law
enforcement officers and public officials responsible for implementing policies
to prevent, investigate and punish violence against women receive
training to sensitize them to the needs of women;

 

(j) Adopt all appropriate measures,
especially in the field of education, to modify the  social and cultural
patterns of conduct of men and women and to eliminate prejudices, customary
practices and all other practices based on the idea of the inferiority
or superiority of either of the sexes and on stereotyped roles for men and
women. . . . [Emphasis added.]

Our Charter is the primary vehicle through which international
human rights achieve a domestic effect (see Slaight Communications Inc. v.
Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3
S.C.R. 697).  In particular, s. 15  (the equality provision) and s. 7  (which
guarantees the right to life, security and liberty of the person) embody the
notion of respect of human dignity and integrity.

 








74                           
It is within that larger framework that, in 1983, Canada revamped the
sexual assault provisions of the Code (S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 125),
formerly ss. 143, 149 and 244 (R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34) which are now contained in
the general assault provisions of s. 265.  Together with  the 1992 amendments
of the Code (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual assault),
S.C. 1992, c. 38), mainly ss. 273.1  and 273.2 , they govern the issue of consent
in the context of sexual assault.  In the preamble to the 1992 Act, Parliament
expressed its concern about the “prevalence of sexual assault against women and
children” and stated its intention to “promote and help to ensure the full
protection of the rights guaranteed under sections 7  and 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ”.

 

75                           
Fraser C.J., in her dissenting reasons in this case, has set out the
legislative history of those provisions.  In R. v. Cuerrier, [1998] 2
S.C.R. 371, Cory J. and I both noted the significant reform of sexual assault
provisions undertaken by Parliament.  (See C. Boyle, Sexual Assault
(1984), at pp. 27-29.)   I observed in R. v. Park, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836,
at para. 42, that:

 

. . . the primary concern animating and underlying the present offence
of sexual assault is the belief that women have an inherent right to exercise
full control over their own bodies, and to engage only in sexual activity that
they wish to engage in.  If this is the case, then our approach to consent must
evolve accordingly, for it may be out of phase with that conceptualization of
the law.

 

 

See also R.
v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577.

 

 

76                           
In the present case, the respondent was charged with sexual assault
under s. 271 of the Code.  The applicable notions of “assault” and
“consent” are defined in ss. 265, 273.1 and 273.2 of the Code.  The
relevant provisions read:

 

265.   (1) A person commits an assault when

 

(a) without the consent of another person, he applies force
intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

 

(b) he attempts or threatens, by an act or a gesture, to apply
force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person to believe on
reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose; or

 








(c) while openly wearing or carrying a weapon or an imitation
thereof, he accosts or impedes another person or begs.

 

(2) This section applies to all forms of assault,
including sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third
party or causing bodily harm and aggravated sexual assault.

 

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is
obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of

 

(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person
other than the complainant;

 

(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the
complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

(c) fraud; or

 

(d) the exercise of authority.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

273.1  (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection
265(3) , ""consent"" means, for the purposes of sections 271 , 272  and
273 , the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question.

 

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of
sections 271 , 272  and 273 , where

 

(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a
person other than the complainant;

 

(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;

 

(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the
activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;

 

(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of
agreement to engage in the activity; or

 

(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual
activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to
engage in the activity.

 

 

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as
limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

 

273.2    It is not a defence to a charge
under section 271 , 272  or 273  that the accused believed that the complainant
consented to the activity that forms the subject‑matter of the charge,
where

 

(a) the accused's belief arose from the accused's








(i) self‑induced intoxication, or

 

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or

 

(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the
circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the
complainant was consenting.

 

77                           
Briefly stated, the accused is charged with sexually assaulting a
17-year-old girl.  The accused was acquitted at trial and the acquittal was
upheld on appeal, by a majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal, Fraser C.J.
dissenting ((1998), 57 Alta. L.R. (3d) 235).  The appellant alleges that the
acquittal and the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal are based on an
error of law in the interpretation of the notion of consent contained in ss.
265(3), 273.1 and 273.2 of the Code and invites this Court to enter a
conviction.

 

78                           
I have had the benefit of the reasons of Justice Major in this appeal
and I agree generally with his reasons on most issues and with the result that
he reaches.  However, I wish to add some comments and discuss some of the
reasoning of the trial judge and of the majority of the Court of Appeal.

 

79                           
Although my colleague has recounted the facts, there are some
significant nuances that need to be stated.  When the complainant and the
accused met in the parking lot of a shopping mall to discuss the job offer, the
complainant suggested that the interview be held in the mall.  The accused
expressed his preference for more privacy and proposed instead that the
interview take place in his van to which a trailer was attached.  The
complainant agreed to sit in the van, but she left the door of the van open
since she was still hesitant about discussing the job offer in his vehicle.

 








80                           
The accused then proposed that they proceed to his trailer.  Shortly
after entering the trailer, the complainant agreed to massage lightly the
accused.  However, she testified that she did not want to give him a massage
but was afraid at this point, considering that she saw and heard the accused
lock the door of the trailer and that the accused was almost twice her size. 
The accused then asked the complainant to come in front of him so that he could
return the favour.  He started massaging the complainant and brought his hands
close to her breasts.  The complainant pushed him away with her elbows and said
“no”.    He then told the complainant to turn around in order to massage her
feet.  Again out of fear, she complied.  When he began massaging her feet, the
touching progressed to her inner thigh and pelvic area up to a point where he
laid heavily on top of the complainant and started grinding his pelvic area
against hers while telling her, as she testified, that: “he could get me so
horny so that I would want it so bad, and he wouldn’t give it to me because he
had self-control and because he wouldn’t want to give it to me”.  The accused
stopped after the complainant asked him to “Just please stop” and at one point
he said: “I had you worried, didn’t I?  You were scared, weren’t you?”.  She
answered: “Yes, I was very scared”.  This is particularly revealing of the accused’s
knowledge that she was afraid and certainly not a willing participant.  The
accused resumed his pelvic grinding, only this time he tried to touch her
vaginal area, exposed his penis and placed it on the complainant’s clothed
pelvic area under her shorts.  He stopped after the complainant said “No,
stop”.  

 

81                           
After this ordeal, the accused opened the door at her request and the
complainant finally exited the trailer.   When the complainant arrived home,
she was crying and told her roommate, Ms. Tait, what had occurred.  Shortly
after, the accused called the complainant’s apartment to ask her if she was
fine.  She answered that she was and called the police.  This evidence is
uncontradicted and the trial judge found the complainant to be an articulate
and intelligent young woman and a credible witness.








 

82                           
This case is not about consent, since none was given.  It is about myths
and stereotypes, which have been identified by many authors and succinctly
described by D. Archard, Sexual Consent (1998), at p. 131:

 

Myths of rape include the view that women fantasise about being rape
victims; that women mean ‘yes’ even when they say ‘no’; that any woman could
successfully resist a rapist if she really wished to; that the sexually
experienced do not suffer harms when raped (or at least suffer lesser harms
than the sexually ‘innocent’); that women often deserve to be raped on account
of their conduct, dress, and demeanour; that rape by a stranger is worse than
one by an acquaintance.  Stereotypes of sexuality include the view of women as
passive, disposed submissively to surrender to the sexual advances of active
men, the view that sexual love consists in the ‘possession’ by a man of a
woman, and that heterosexual sexual activity is paradigmatically penetrative
coitus.

 

(For example
see Seaboyer, supra, at p. 651, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.; M.
Burt, “Rape Myths and Acquaintance Rape”, in A. Parrot and L. Bechhofer, eds., Acquaintance
Rape: The Hidden Crime (1991); N. Naffine, “Possession:  Erotic Love in the
Law of Rape” (1994), 57 Mod. L. Rev. 10; R. T. Andrias, “Rape Myths: A
persistent problem in defining and prosecuting rape” (1992), 7 Criminal
Justice 2; Gender Equality in the Canadian Justice System: Summary
Document and Proposals for Action, supra; C. A. MacKinnon, Toward
a Feminist Theory of the State (1989); E. A. Sheehy, “Canadian Judges and
the Law of Rape: Should the Charter  Insulate Bias?” (1989), 21 Ottawa
L. Rev. 741.)

 








83                           
The trial judge believed the complainant and accepted her testimony that
she was afraid and he acknowledged her unwillingness to engage in any sexual
activity.  In addition, there is no doubt that the respondent was aware that
the complainant was afraid since he told her repeatedly not to be afraid.  The
complainant clearly articulated her absence of consent:  she said no.  Not only
did the accused not stop, but after a brief pause, as Fraser C.J. puts it, he
went on to an “increased level of sexual activity” to which twice the
complainant said no.  What could be clearer?

 

84                           
The trial judge gave no legal effect to his conclusion that the
complainant submitted to sexual activity out of fear that the accused would
apply force to her.  Section 265(3)(b) states that no consent is
obtained where the complainant submits by reason of threats or fear of the
application of force.  Therefore, s. 265(3)(b) applies and operates to
further establish the lack of consent:  see Cuerrier, supra.

 

85                           
I agree with Major J. that the application of s. 265(3) requires an
entirely subjective test.  In my opinion, as irrational as a complainant’s
motive might be, if she subjectively felt fear, it must lead to a legal finding
of absence of consent.  Accordingly, I agree with Fraser C.J. that any
objective factor should be considered under the defence of honest but mistaken
belief.

 

86                           
However, in my view, Major J. unduly restricts the application of s.
265(3) to instances where the complainant chooses “to participate in, or
ostensibly consent to, the touching in question” (at para. 38; see also para.
36).  Section 265(3) applies to cases where the “complainant submits or does
not resist” (emphasis added) by reason of the application of force, threats
or fear of the application of force, fraud or the exercise of authority. 
Therefore, that section should also apply to cases where the complainant is
silent or passive in response to such situations.

 








87                           
In the circumstances of this case, it is difficult to understand how the
question of implied consent even arose.  Although he found the complainant
credible, and accepted her evidence that she said “no” on three occasions and
was afraid, the trial judge nonetheless did not take “no” to mean that the
complainant did not consent.  Rather, he concluded that she implicitly
consented and that the Crown had failed to prove lack of consent.  This was a
fundamental error.  As noted by Professor Stuart in Annotation on R. v.
Ewanchuk (1998), 13 C.R. (5th) 330, at p. 330:

 

Both the trial judgment and that of Justice McClung do not make the
basic distinction that consent is a matter of the state of mind of the
complainant and belief in consent is, subject to s. 273.2  of the Criminal
Code , a matter of the state of mind of the accused.    

 

This error
does not derive from the findings of fact but from mythical assumptions that
when a woman says “no” she is really saying “yes”, “try again”, or “persuade
me”.  To paraphrase Fraser C.J. at p. 263, it denies women’s sexual autonomy
and implies that women are “walking around this country in a state of constant
consent to sexual activity”.

 

88                           
In the Court of Appeal, McClung J.A. compounded the error made by the
trial judge.  At the outset of his opinion, he stated at p. 245 that “it must
be pointed out that the complainant did not present herself to Ewanchuk or
enter his trailer in a bonnet and crinolines”.  He noted, at pp. 245-46, that
“she was the mother of a six-month-old baby and that, along with her boyfriend,
she shared an apartment with another couple”.

 








89                           
Even though McClung J.A. asserted that he had no intention of
denigrating the complainant, one might wonder why he felt necessary to point
out these aspects of the trial record.  Could it be to express that the
complainant is not a virgin?  Or that she is a person of questionable moral
character because she is not married and lives with her boyfriend and another
couple?  These comments made by an appellate judge help reinforce the myth that
under such circumstances, either the complainant is less worthy of belief, she
invited the sexual assault, or her sexual experience signals probable consent
to further sexual activity.  Based on those attributed assumptions, the
implication is that if the complainant articulates her lack of consent by
saying “no”, she really does not mean it and even if she does, her refusal
cannot be taken as seriously as if she were a girl of “good” moral character. 
“Inviting” sexual assault, according to those myths, lessens the guilt of the
accused as Archard, supra, notes at p. 139:

 

. . . the more that a person contributes by her behaviour or negligence
to bringing about the circumstances in which she is a victim of a crime, the
less responsible is the criminal for the crime he commits.  A crime is no less
unwelcome or serious in its effects, or need it be any the less deliberate or
malicious in its commission, for occurring in circumstances which the victim
helped to realise.  Yet judges who spoke of women ‘inviting’ or ‘provoking’ a
rape would go on to cite such contributory behaviour as a reason for regarding
the rape as less grave or the rapist as less culpable.  It adds judicial insult
to criminal injury to be told that one is the part author of a crime one did
not seek and which in consequence is supposed to be a lesser one.

 

 

 

90                           
McClung J.A. writes, at p. 247:

 

 

There is no room to suggest that Ewanchuk knew, yet disregarded, her
underlying state of mind as he furthered his romantic intentions.  He
was not aware of her true state of mind.  Indeed, his ignorance about that was
what she wanted.  The facts, set forth by the trial judge, provide support for
the overriding trial finding, couched in terms of consent by implication, that
the accused had no proven preparedness to assault the complainant to get what
he wanted. [Emphasis added.]  

 

 

On the
contrary, both the fact that Ewanchuk was aware of the complainant’s state of
mind, as he did indeed stop each time she expressly stated “no”, and the trial
judge’s findings reinforce the obvious conclusion that the accused knew there
was no consent.  These were two strangers, a young 17-year-old woman attracted
by a job offer who found herself trapped in a trailer and a man approximately
twice her age and size.  This is hardly a scenario one would characterize as
reflective of “romantic intentions”.  It was nothing more than an effort by
Ewanchuk to engage the complainant sexually, not romantically.

 








91                           
The expressions used by McClung J.A. to describe the accused’s sexual
assault, such as “clumsy passes” (p. 246) or “would hardly raise Ewanchuk’s
stature in the pantheon of chivalric behaviour” (p. 248), are plainly
inappropriate in that context as they minimize the importance of the accused’s
conduct and the reality of sexual aggression against women.

 

92                           
McClung J.A. also concluded that “the sum of the evidence indicates that
Ewanchuk’s advances to the complainant were far less criminal than hormonal”
(p. 250) having found earlier that “every advance he made to her stopped
when she spoke against it” and that “[t]here was no evidence of an assault or
even its threat” (p. 249).  According to this analysis, a man would be
free from criminal responsibility for having non-consensual sexual activity
whenever he cannot control his hormonal urges.  Furthermore, the fact that the
accused ignored the complainant’s verbal objections to any sexual activity and
persisted in escalated sexual contact, grinding his pelvis against hers
repeatedly, is more evidence than needed to determine that there was an
assault.

 

93                           
Finally, McClung J.A. made this point: “In a less litigious age going
too far in the boyfriend’s car was better dealt with on site -- a well-chosen
expletive, a slap in the face or, if necessary, a well-directed knee” (p.
250).  According to this stereotype, women should use physical force, not
resort to courts to “deal with” sexual assaults and it is not the perpetrator’s
responsibility to ascertain consent, as required by s. 273.2 (b), but the
women’s not only to express an unequivocal “no”, but also to fight her way out
of such a situation.  In that sense, Susan Estrich has noted that “rape is most
assuredly not the only crime in which consent is a defense; but it is the only
crime that has required the victim to resist physically in order to establish
nonconsent” (“Rape” (1986), 95 Yale L.J. 1087, at p. 1090).

 








94                           
Cory J. referred to the inappropriate use of rape myths by courts in Osolin,
supra, at p. 670:

 

A number of rape myths have in the past improperly formed the
background for considering evidentiary issues in sexual assault trials.  These
include the false concepts that: women cannot be raped against their will; only
“bad girls” are raped; anyone not clearly of “good character” is more likely to
have consented. 

 

In Seaboyer,
supra, I alluded to this issue as follows, at pp. 707-9:

 

Parliament exhibited a marked, and justifiedly so, distrust of the
ability of the courts to promote and achieve a non-discriminatory application
of the law in this area.  In view of the history of government attempts, the
harm done when discretion is posited in trial judges and the demonstrated
inability of the judiciary to change its discriminatory ways, Parliament was
justified in so choosing.  My attempt to illustrate the tenacity of these
discriminatory beliefs and their acceptance at all levels of society clearly
demonstrates that discretion in judges is antithetical to the goals of
Parliament.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

History demonstrates that it was discretion in trial judges that
saturated the   law in this area with stereotype.  My earlier discussion shows
that we are not, all of a sudden, a society rid of such beliefs, and hence,
discretionary decision making in this realm is absolutely antithetical to the
achievement of government’s pressing and substantial objective.

 








95                           
This case has not dispelled any of the fears I expressed in Seaboyer,
supra,  about the use of myths and stereotypes in dealing with sexual
assault complaints (see also Bertha Wilson, “Will Women Judges Really Make a
Difference?” (1990), 28 Osgoode Hall L.J. 507).  Complainants should be
able to rely on a system free from myths and stereotypes, and on a judiciary
whose impartiality is not compromised by these biased assumptions.  The Code
was amended in 1983 and in 1992 to eradicate reliance on those assumptions;
they should not be permitted to resurface through the stereotypes reflected in
the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal.  It is part of the role of
this Court to denounce this kind of language, unfortunately still used today,
which not only perpetuates archaic myths and stereotypes about the nature of
sexual assaults but also ignores the law.

 

96                           
In “The Standard of Social Justice as a Research Process” (1997), 38 Can.
Psychology 91,  K. E. Renner, C. Alksnis and L. Park make a strong
indictment of the current criminal justice process, at p. 100:

 

The more general indictment of the current criminal justice process is
that the law and legal doctrines concerning sexual assault have acted as the
principle [sic] systemic mechanisms for invalidating the experiences of
women and children.  Given this state of affairs, the traditional view of
the legal system as neutral, objective and gender-blind is not defensible.
Since the system is ineffective in protecting the rights of women and children,
it is necessary to re-examine the existing doctrines which reflect the cultural
and social limitations that have preserved dominant male interests at the
expense of women and children.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

97                           
This being said, turning to the facts of the present case, I agree with
Major J. that the findings necessary to support a verdict of guilty on the
charge of sexual assault have been made.  In particular, there is, on the
record, no evidence that would give an air of reality to an honest belief in
consent for any of the sexual activity which took place in this case.  One
cannot imply that once the complainant does not object to the massage in the
context of a job interview, there is “sufficient evidence” to support that the
accused could honestly believe he had permission to initiate sexual contact. 
This would mean that complying to receive a massage is consent to sexual
touching.  It would reflect the myth that women are presumptively sexually
accessible until they resist.  McLachlin J. has recognized in R. v. Esau,
[1997] 2 S.C.R. 777, at para. 82, that reliance on rape myths cannot ground a
defence of mistaken belief in consent:

 

Care must be taken to avoid the false assumptions or
“myths” that may mislead us in determining whether the conduct of the
complainant affords a sufficient basis for putting the defence of honest
mistake on consent to the jury.  One of these is the stereotypical notion that
women who resist or say no may in fact be consenting.

 








Furthermore, I
agree with Fraser C.J. at p. 278 that there is no air of reality to a defence
of mistaken belief in consent “in the face of the complainant’s clearly stated
verbal objections”.

 

98                           
Moreover, s. 273.2(b) precludes the accused from raising the
defence of belief in consent if he did not take “reasonable steps” in the
circumstances known to him at the time to ascertain that the complainant was
consenting.  This provision and the defence of honest but mistaken belief were
before the trial judge and it should have been given full effect.  The trial
judge erred in law by not applying s. 273.2(b) which was the law of the
land at the time of the trial, irrespective of whether the case proceeded on
that basis. As stated by McLachlin J. in Esau, supra, at para.
50, with whom I concurred:

 

Major J. [for the majority] does not consider s. 273.2. 
This may be because it was not argued on the appeal or in the proceedings
below.  With respect, I do not believe that the force of s. 273.2 may be
avoided on that ground.  Parliament has spoken.  It has set out minimum
conditions for the defence of mistaken belief in consent.  If those conditions
are not met, the defence does not lie.

 








99                           
I agree entirely with Fraser C.J. that, unless and until an accused
first takes reasonable steps to assure that there is consent, the defence of
honest but mistaken belief does not arise (see R. v. Daigle, [1998] 1
S.C.R. 1220; Esau, supra,  per McLachlin J. dissenting;
and J. McInnes and C. Boyle, “Judging Sexual Assault Law Against a Standard of
Equality” (1995), 29 U.B.C. L. Rev. 341).  In this case, the accused
proceeded from massaging to sexual contact without making any inquiry as to
whether the complainant consented.  Obviously, interpreting the fact that the
complainant did not refuse the massage to mean that the accused could further
his sexual intentions is not a reasonable step.  The accused cannot rely on the
complainant’s silence or ambiguous conduct to initiate sexual contact. 
Moreover, where a complainant expresses non-consent, the accused has a
corresponding escalating obligation to take additional steps to ascertain
consent.  Here, despite the complainant’s repeated verbal objections, the accused
did not take any step to ascertain consent, let alone reasonable ones. 
Instead, he increased the level of his sexual activity.  Therefore, pursuant to
s. 273.2(b) Ewanchuk was barred from relying on a belief in consent.

 

100                       
Major J., at para. 43, relies on this Court’s decision in Pappajohn
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, to describe the nature of the defence of
honest but mistaken belief.  In Pappajohn, the majority held that this
defence does not need to be based on reasonable grounds as long as it is
honestly held.  That approach has been modified by the enactment of s. 273.2(b)
which introduced the “reasonable steps” requirement.  Therefore, that decision
no longer states the law on the question of honest but mistaken belief in
consent.

 

101                       
I wish to point out that, on the facts as found at trial, s. 273.1(2) 
also applies to this case.  Coupled with the reasonable steps requirement of s.
273.2(b), s. 273.1(2)  restricts the circumstances in which an accused
could claim that he had a mistaken belief in the complainant’s agreement to
engage in the impugned sexual activity.  Particularly relevant to this case, s.
273.1(2) (d) states that no consent is obtained where “the complainant
expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement...”.   Here, the complainant
clearly expressed her lack of consent by saying “no” three times.  The
application of that provision acknowledges that when a woman says “no” she is
communicating her non-agreement, regardless of what the accused thought it
meant, and that her expression has an enforceable legal effect.  It precludes
the accused from claiming that he thought there was an agreement.  That
provision was in force at the time of trial and could not be ignored by the
trial judge.

 

Disposition








102                       
Like my colleague Major J., I would allow the appeal, enter a conviction
and send the matter back to the trial judge for sentencing.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

//McLachlin
J.//

 

103                       
McLachlin J. -- I agree
with the reasons of Justice Major.  I also agree with Justice L’Heureux-Dubé
that stereotypical assumptions lie at the heart of what went wrong in this
case.  The specious defence of implied consent (consent implied by law), as
applied in this case, rests on the assumption that unless a woman protests or resists,
she should be “deemed” to consent (see L’Heureux-Dubé J.).  On appeal, the idea
also surfaced that if a woman is not modestly dressed, she is deemed to
consent.  Such stereotypical assumptions find their roots in many cultures,
including our own.  They no longer, however, find a place in Canadian law.  

 

104                       
I join my colleagues in rejecting them.

Two police officers received a call from radio
dispatch concerning a 911 emergency call originating from the accused’s
apartment in which the line had been disconnected before the caller spoke. 
Along with two back‑up officers they arrived at the accused’s apartment
and knocked on the door.  The accused partially opened the door and when asked
if things were all right inside responded that there was no problem.  One of
the officers asked if they could enter the apartment to investigate but the
accused tried to close the door.  The officer prevented him from shutting the
door and the four officers entered the dwelling.  The officer testified that as
soon as they got inside, he heard a woman crying.  He found the accused’s
common law wife in their bedroom, curled in a fetal position and sobbing.  The
officer observed considerable swelling above her left eye.  He testified that
she stated the accused had hit her.  Based on these observations, the accused
was placed under arrest for assaulting his wife.  He resisted the arrest and in
the ensuing struggle, an officer’s finger was broken.  The accused was charged
with assaulting a police officer with the intent of resisting arrest.  The
trial judge dismissed the charge, holding that the officers’ entry into the accused’s
apartment was unauthorized and that therefore all subsequent actions of the
police, including the arrest of the accused, were illegal.  The Ontario
Court (General Division) allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new
trial.  The Court of Appeal upheld that decision.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 








Public policy clearly requires that the police ab
initio have the authority to investigate 911 calls, but whether they may
enter dwelling houses in the course of such an investigation depends on the
circumstances of each case.  If police conduct constitutes a prima facie
interference with a person’s liberty or property, as it does here, the court
must consider two questions:  first, does the conduct fall within the general
scope of any duty imposed by statute or recognised at common law; and second,
does the conduct, albeit within the general scope of such a duty, involve an
unjustifiable use of powers associated with the duty.  The common law duties of
the police (statutorily incorporated in s. 42(3) of the Ontario Police
Services Act) include the protection of life.  The police duty to protect
life is engaged whenever it can be inferred that the 911 caller is or may be in
some distress, including cases where the call is disconnected before the nature
of the emergency can be determined.  The importance of the police duty to protect
life warrants and justifies a forced entry into a dwelling in order to
ascertain the health and safety of a 911 caller.  While residents have a
recognized privacy interest within the sanctity of their home, the public
interest in maintaining an effective emergency response system is obvious and
significant enough to merit some intrusion on a resident’s privacy interest. 
However, the intrusion must be limited to the protection of life and safety;
the police do not have further permission to search premises or otherwise
intrude on a resident’s privacy or property.

 

The forced entry into the accused’s home was
justifiable considering all the circumstances of this case.  The police had a
duty to ascertain the reason for the 911 call and had the power, derived as a
matter of common law from this duty, to enter the apartment to verify that
there was in fact no emergency.  The fact that the accused tried to shut the
door on the police further contributes to the appropriateness of their response
in forcing entry.  Having found that the police were authorized to enter the
accused’s dwelling, the Court of Appeal did not err in finding there were
reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused.

//The Chief Justice//

 

1                                  
The Chief Justice - - This
case raises for the first time the scope of police powers in responding to
emergency 911 calls.  The Court of Appeal held that the police had a common law
duty to investigate a 911 call and, accordingly, had authority to forcibly
enter a dwelling in search of the caller.  This Court affirmed that decision
from the bench and indicated that reasons for judgment would follow.  The Court
of Appeal decision is well reasoned.  I wish only to add a few remarks
concerning the police duty to protect the safety of the public and the
importance of an effective emergency response system.

 

 

I.  Background    

 

2                                  
In the early morning hours of June 1, 1992, Officers Clafton and
Baldesarra received a call from radio dispatch concerning an “unknown trouble
call” originating from the appellant’s apartment.  An “unknown trouble call” is
a 911 call in which the line is disconnected before the caller speaks.  The 911
system is equipped to trace all incoming calls and automatically provides
dispatchers with the address of the caller.  Unknown trouble calls are deemed
by police policy to be the second highest priority distress call, superseded
only by calls concerning police officers in distress.  While all 911 calls are
treated as requests for assistance, unknown trouble calls carry the added
element of the unknown.  Accordingly, police procedure is to respond with
back-up.  In this case, Officers Mercer and Connor assisted at the appellant’s
residence.

 








3                                  
At approximately 1:30 a.m., the four officers arrived at the appellant’s
apartment and knocked on the door.  The appellant partially opened the door and
when asked if things were all right inside, responded: “Sure, there is no
problem”.  Officer Clafton asked if they could enter the apartment to
investigate if there was a problem but the appellant tried to close the door. 
Officer Clafton prevented him from shutting the door by putting his foot in the
way.  The four officers then entered the dwelling.  Officer Clafton testified
that as soon as they got inside, he heard a woman crying.  He found the
appellant’s common law wife in their bedroom, curled in a fetal position and
sobbing.  The officer observed considerable swelling above her left eye.  He
testified that she stated the appellant had hit her.

 

4                                  
Based on these observations, Officer Mercer placed the appellant under
arrest for assaulting his wife.  The appellant resisted the arrest and in the
ensuing struggle, Officer Baldesarra’s finger was broken.  The appellant was
charged with assaulting a police officer with the intent of resisting arrest.

 

II.  Judgments
Below

 

A. Ontario
Court (Provincial Division)

                                                                     








5                                  
At the trial, Bentley Prov. Div. J. dismissed the initial charge of
assault on the appellant’s wife after she testified that he did not hit her. 
With respect to the second charge of assaulting Officer Baldesarra, the trial
judge held that the officers’ entry in the appellant’s apartment was
unauthorized and therefore all subsequent actions of the police, including the
arrest of the appellant, were illegal.  In reaching his decision that the
officers’ entry into the apartment was unlawful, Bentley Prov. Div. J.
concluded that the 911 call and then a denial of entry at the door did not
constitute reasonable and probable grounds to violate the sanctity of a
person’s dwelling house.  The charge of assaulting a police officer was
dismissed. 

 

B. Ontario
Court (General Division)

 

6                                  
Hoilett J. allowed the appeal from the Provincial Division decision on
the basis that the characterization of the 911 call and subsequent denial of
entry at the door as being insufficient to constitute reasonable and probable
grounds to enter the home ignores modern social realities in which spousal
abuse is not an “uncommon phenomenon”.  Hoilett J. noted that had the police
taken “no” for an answer at the door and a homicide occurred, he could only
speculate  as to public response.  A new trial was ordered.

 

C. Ontario
Court of Appeal (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 445

 

7                                  
Finlayson J.A. for the court dismissed the appeal.  He reviewed the
common law powers accorded to police officers as set out in R. v. Landry,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 145, and found that the 911 call gave the police reasonable and
probable grounds to believe that there was an emergency in the apartment and
that the caller was in distress.  The high priority given to disconnected 911
calls is instructive and reflects the collective experience of the police force
in responding to this kind of distress call.  Finlayson J.A. referred to the
Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. Simpson (1993), 79 C.C.C.
(3d) 482, in which Doherty J.A. applied R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3 All
E.R. 659 (C.C.A.).  Waterfield sets out the test for determining the
common law powers of the police.  Doherty J.A. noted that police conduct which
interfered with an individual’s liberty or freedom would be authorized by the
common law if two criteria were satisfied:

 








1.    the police were acting in the course of
their duty when they effected that interference; and

 

2.    the conduct of the police did not involve an
unjustifiable use of powers in the circumstances.

 

8                                  
In considering the first element of the test, Finlayson J.A. found that
the police have a power at common law to enter a private dwelling in response
to a disconnected 911 call in the circumstances of this case.  The police were
acting in the course of their duty to “protect life” which includes preventing
death or serious injury.  They entered the apartment with the knowledge that a
911 call was made from that residence.  Entry was necessary to determine the
cause of the distress and to give aid if necessary.  Giving aid to persons in
distress is the very essence of the police duty to “protect life”.  

 








9                                  
With respect to the second element of the test, Finlayson J.A. concluded
that the interference with the appellant’s liberty in this case was minimal.  The
police were only in the apartment for a short time and the forced entry was
only to determine that there was no emergency and that the 911 caller was not
in distress.  Having received an unsatisfactory answer from the appellant at
the door, the police were obligated to enter the dwelling and investigate. 
Further questions to the appellant would have been impossible had he succeeded
in shutting the door.  In any event, entry into a private dwelling to
investigate a disconnected 911 call is justified even if someone answers the
knock at the door, where that person is evasive and uncooperative in response
to proper police questioning.  Finlayson J.A. asked (at p. 459):  “How
demoralized would a victim of burglary, sexual assault or spousal abuse be if
the culprit was able to get rid of his or her rescuers simply by telling them
that ‘there is no problem’?”  Under all the circumstances of the case, it was a
justifiable use of police powers to enter the apartment in response to the
disconnected 911 call.  Finlayson J.A. did note that any greater interference
with the sanctity of a home, other than the level exercised here, could only be
justified with further information, such as the grounds for arrest for an
indictable offence.

 

III.  Issues

 

10                              
1.    Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in finding the police were
acting in the execution of their duty to protect life and prevent injury when
they forcibly entered the appellant’s apartment in response to a disconnected
911 call?

 

2.                                
If not, did the Court of Appeal err in finding that the officers had
reasonable and probable grounds to effect the arrest of the appellant?

 

IV.  Analysis

 

A.                              
Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in finding the police were
acting in the execution of their duty to protect life and prevent injury when
they forcibly entered  the appellant’s apartment in response to a disconnected
911 call?

 

11                              
In my view, public policy clearly requires that the police ab initio have
the authority to investigate 911 calls, but whether they may enter dwelling
houses in the course of such an investigation depends on the circumstances of
each case.

 








12                              
The accepted test for evaluating the common law powers and duties of the
police was set out in Waterfield, supra (followed by this Court
in R. v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631, Knowlton v. The Queen,
[1974] S.C.R. 443, and Dedman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2).  If
police conduct constitutes a prima facie interference with a person’s
liberty or property, the court must consider two questions:  first, does the
conduct fall within the general scope of any duty imposed by statute or
recognized at common law; and second, does the conduct, albeit within the
general scope of such a duty, involve an unjustifiable use of powers associated
with the duty.

 

13                              
There is no doubt that the forcible entry by police into a private
dwelling home constitutes a prima facie interference with a person’s
liberty and property.  It is therefore incumbent upon the Court to consider the
two questions posed in Waterfield, supra.  

 

(1) The general statutory and common law duties of the police

 

14                              
Section 42 of the Police Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P 15 (the
“Act”) read as follows at the relevant time:

 

42.--(1) The duties of a police officer
include, 

 

(a)   preserving the peace;

 

(b)   preventing crimes and other offences and
providing assistance and encouragement to other persons in their prevention;

 

(c)   assisting victims of crime;

 

(d)   apprehending criminals and other offenders
and others who may lawfully be taken into custody;

 

(e)   laying charges, prosecuting and participating
in prosecutions;

 

(f)    executing warrants that are to be executed
by police officers and performing related duties;

 

(g)   performing the lawful duties that the chief
of police assigns; 








(h)   in the case of a municipal police force and
in the case of an agreement under section 10 (agreement for provision of police
services by O.P.P.), enforcing municipal by-laws;

 

(i)    completing the prescribed training.

 

(2) A police officer has authority to act as such throughout

Ontario.

 

(3) A police officer has the powers and duties ascribed to a                 constable
at common law. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

15                              
In Dedman, supra, at pp. 11-12, this Court held
that the common law duties of the police (statutorily incorporated in s. 42(3))
include the “preservation of the peace, the prevention of crime, and the
protection of life and property” (emphasis added). As Finlayson J.A. noted
in the Court of Appeal, the common law duties of the police have yet to be
judicially circumscribed.  Furthermore, the duty to protect life is a “general
duty” as described by Finlayson J.A., and is thus not limited to protecting the
lives of victims of crime.   

 

16                              
 A 911 call is a distress call -- a cry for help.  It may indeed be
precipitated by criminal events, but criminal activity is not a prerequisite
for assistance.  The duties specifically enumerated in s. 42(1) of the Act may
or may not be engaged.  The point of the 911 emergency response system is to
provide whatever assistance is required under the circumstances of the call. 
In the context of a disconnected 911 call, the nature of the distress is
unknown.  However, in my view, it is reasonable, indeed imperative, that the
police assume that the caller is in some distress and requires immediate
assistance.  To act otherwise would seriously impair the effectiveness of the
system and undermine its very purpose.  The police duty to protect life is therefore
engaged whenever it can be inferred that the 911 caller is or may be in some
distress, including cases where the call is disconnected before the nature of
the emergency can be determined.  








 

17                              
Before this Court, the parties did not seriously debate whether the
police have a common law duty to respond to distress calls.  Rather, the real
question is whether the discharge of this common law duty entitles the police
to forcibly enter a dwelling. In other words, the central issue concerns the
second branch of the Waterfield test.  

 

(2)   Does the conduct in question involve an
unjustifiable use of police powers in the circumstances?

 

18                              
In Simpson, supra, Doherty J.A. applied both Waterfield,
supra, and Dedman, supra, and described what is meant by a
“justifiable” use of police power as follows (at p. 499):

 

. . . the justifiability of an officer’s conduct depends on a number of
factors including the duty being performed, the extent to which some
interference with individual liberty is necessitated in order to perform that
duty, the importance of the performance of that duty to the public good, the
liberty interfered with, and the nature and extent of the interference.

 

I agree that
these considerations should form the basis of analysis.  In the case at bar, it
was necessary for the police to enter the appellant’s apartment in order to
determine the nature of the distress call.  There was no other reasonable
alternative to ensure that the disconnected caller received the necessary
assistance in a timely manner.  While the appellant suggested that the police
could knock on the neighbours’ doors and question them, or wait in the
apartment corridor for further signs of distress, in my view these suggestions
are not only impractical but dangerous.  If a 911 caller is in serious danger
and is unable either to communicate with the 911 dispatcher or answer the door
upon police arrival, the caller’s only hope is that the police physically
locate him or her within the apartment and come to his or her aid. 

 








19                              
There is unquestionably a recognized privacy interest that residents
have within the sanctity of the home.  In R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R.
281, this Court recognized that the values underlying the privacy interest
protected by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  are (per
Sopinka J. at p. 292) “dignity, integrity and autonomy”.  In R. v. Edwards,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 50, Cory J. elaborated that one aspect of this
privacy interest is “[t]he right to be free from intrusion or interference”. 
However, dignity, integrity and autonomy are the very values engaged in a most
immediate and pressing nature by a disconnected 911 call.  In such a case, the concern
that a person’s life or safety might be in danger is enhanced.  Therefore, the
interest of the person who seeks assistance by dialing 911 is closer to the
core of the values of dignity, integrity and autonomy than the interest of the
person who seeks to deny entry to police who arrive in response to the call for
help.

 

20                              
One can imagine, for example, a person having a heart attack who dials
911 but cannot speak.  Perhaps there is no one home to answer the door.  Would
a reasonable person expect that the police would take steps to ensure that the
911 caller was all right?  I believe so.  A further example might be a
situation where a home is burglarized and a resident is being held at
gunpoint.   Assuming a resident can actually make the 911 call, he or she might
answer the door to the police under a threat of bodily injury should the police
be allowed to enter.  On the other hand, the person who answers the door might
well be the intruder.  I see no other use for an emergency response system if
those persons who are dispatched to the scene cannot actually respond to
the individual caller.  I certainly cannot accept that the police should simply
take the word of the person who answers the door that there is “no problem”
inside.  

 








21                              
Further, the courts, legislators, police and social service workers have
all engaged in a serious and important campaign to educate themselves and the
public on the nature and prevalence of domestic violence.  One of the hallmarks
of this crime is its private nature.  Familial abuse occurs within the supposed
sanctity of the home.  While there is no question that one’s privacy at home is
a value to be preserved and promoted, privacy cannot trump the safety of all
members of the household.  If our society is to provide an effective means of
dealing with domestic violence, it must have a form of crisis response.  The
911 system provides such a response.  Given the wealth of experience the police
have in such matters, it is unthinkable that they would take the word of the
person who answers the door without further investigation.  Without making any
comment on the specific facts of this case, it takes only a modicum of common
sense to realize that if a person is unable to speak to a 911 dispatcher when
making a call, he or she may likewise be unable to answer the door when help
arrives.  Should the police then take the word of the person who does answer
the door, who might well be an abuser and who, if so, would no doubt pronounce
that all is well inside?  I think not.

 








22                              
Thus in my view, the importance of the police duty to protect life
warrants and justifies a forced entry into a dwelling in order to ascertain the
health and safety of a 911 caller.  The public interest in maintaining an
effective emergency response system is obvious and significant enough to merit
some intrusion on a resident’s privacy interest.  However, I emphasize that the
intrusion must be limited to the protection of life and safety.  The police
have authority to investigate the 911 call and, in particular, to locate the
caller and determine his or her reasons for making the call and provide such
assistance as may be required. The police authority for being on private
property in response to a 911 call ends there.  They do not have further
permission to search premises or otherwise intrude on a resident’s privacy or
property.  In Dedman, supra, at p. 35, Le Dain J. stated that the
interference with liberty must be necessary for carrying out the police duty
and it must be reasonable.  A reasonable interference in circumstances
such as an unknown trouble call would be to locate the 911 caller in the home. 
If this can be done without entering the home with force, obviously such a
course of action is mandated.  Each case will be considered in its own context,
keeping in mind all of the surrounding circumstances.  (I specifically refrain
from pronouncing on whether an entry in response to a 911 call affects the
applicability of the “plain view” doctrine as it is not at issue on the facts
of the case at bar.)

 

23     
In the case at bar, the forced entry into the appellant’s home was
justifiable considering the totality of the circumstances.  The police were
responding to an unknown trouble call.  They had no indication as to the nature
of the 911 distress.  They did not know whether the call was in response to a
criminal action or not.  They had the common law duty (statutorily codified in
s. 42(3) of the Act) to act to protect life and safety.  Therefore, the police
had the duty to respond to the 911 call.  Having arrived at the appellant’s
apartment, their duty extended to ascertaining the reason for the call. 
Acceptance of the appellant’s bald assertion that there was “no problem” would
have been insufficient to satisfy that duty.  The police had the power, derived
as a matter of common law from this duty, to enter the apartment to verify that
there was in fact no emergency.  The fact that the appellant tried to shut the
door on the police further contributes to the appropriateness of their response
in forcing entry.  As I have already discussed, the privacy interest of the
person at the door must yield to the interests of any person inside the
apartment.  A threat to life and limb more directly engages the values of
dignity, integrity and autonomy underlying the right to privacy than does the
interest in being free from the minimal state intrusion of police entering an
apartment to investigate a potential emergency.  Once inside the apartment, the
police heard the appellant’s wife crying.  They had a duty to search the
apartment and find her.  In my view, Finlayson J.A. for the Court of Appeal
correctly concluded that the police conduct was a justifiable use of their
powers.

 

(3) The impact of the decision in R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2
S.C.R. 13








24                              
In its decision, the Court of Appeal discussed this Court’s decision in Landry,
supra.  In Landry, the issue was whether the police had the power
to enter an apartment without a warrant to make an arrest.  Dickson C.J. held
that a compelling public interest warranted giving the police the power to
enter private premises to make an arrest under certain conditions.  However, Landry,
a pre-Charter  case, was reconsidered by this Court in Feeney,
and Sopinka J., for the majority of the Court, concluded that the Landry
test for warrantless arrests no longer applies in the Charter  era.

 

25                              
I note that the Court of Appeal did not rely upon the decision in Landry
in reaching its conclusion in the case at bar.  Finlayson J.A. noted that
the question in this case is whether the police had the power to enter a
private dwelling where “they reasonably believe that the occupant is in
distress and entry is necessary, not to make an arrest, but to protect
life, prevent death and prevent serious injury” (pp. 453-54).  In fact,
Finlayson J.A. noted that there were no cases directly on point.  Therefore,
the fact that Landry has been superceded by Feeney does not
invalidate the Court of Appeal’s decision.

 

26                              
In any event, I emphasize that Feeney was concerned solely with
when the police can enter a dwelling without a warrant to make an arrest.  
Thus, in my view, the reasoning in Feeney does not apply to the
case at bar, which is unconcerned with powers of
arrest.                             

 

B.                               
If not, did the Court of Appeal err in finding that the officers had
reasonable and probable grounds to effect the arrest of the appellant?

 








27                              
Having found that the police were authorized to enter into the
appellant’s dwelling, the Court of Appeal did not err in finding there were
reasonable and probable grounds to effect the arrest of the appellant.  The
condition of the appellant’s wife, combined with her statement to Officer
Clafton, constituted sufficient grounds for an arrest.

 

V.  Conclusion

 

28                              
In summary, emergency response systems are established by municipalities
to provide effective and immediate assistance to citizens in need.  The 911
system is promoted as a system available to handle all manner of crises,
including situations which have no criminal involvement whatsoever.  When the
police are dispatched to aid a 911 caller, they are carrying out their duty to
protect life and prevent serious injury.  This is especially true where the
call is disconnected and the nature of the emergency unknown.  When a caller
uses a 911 system, he or she has requested direct and immediate intervention
and has the right to expect emergency services will arrive and locate the
caller.  The public interest in maintaining this system may result in a limited
intrusion in one’s privacy interests while at home.  This interference is
authorized at common law as it falls within the scope of the police duty to
protect life and safety and does not involve an unjustifiable use of the powers
associated with this duty.

 

29                              
The appeal is dismissed and the matter returned to the Ontario Court
(Provincial Division) for a new trial on the charge of assaulting a police
officer with the intent to resist arrest.








Appeal dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for newfoundland

 

Criminal law -‑ Appeals -‑ Court of
Appeal ‑- Jurisdiction -- Sentencing -- Whether Court of Appeal has
inherent jurisdiction to vary sentence where no appeal from sentence has been
sought -- Whether Court of Appeal can ease its concern over what it feels is an
improper sentence by inviting counsel to seek leave to appeal.

 








The accused was convicted by a jury of one count of
assault, two counts of assault and sexual assault against his common law spouse
and one count of obstruction of justice.  He was sentenced to four years in
prison.  He appealed his conviction but not his sentence.  The Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal against conviction.  However, based on its unease over the
prison term it elected to exercise what it deemed to be an inherent
jurisdiction to review sentence on its own motion, even in the absence of an appeal
against sentence.  Counsels were ordered to return to present argument on the
sentence.  The Crown appeals the Court of Appeal’s order on sentence.

 

Held:  The appeal is allowed.

 

Per Lamer C.J. and Gonthier,
Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and Binnie  JJ.:  Appellate courts do not have
inherent jurisdiction to consider a sentence imposed upon an accused after
conviction, in the absence of an appeal against sentence.  No such power exists
in a court that is governed solely by a statutory framework.  A review of the
line of authority considered by the Court of Appeal to support its claim to
inherent appellate jurisdiction to deal with sentencing reveals, first, that
some of the cases do not necessarily support such an assertion, and second,
that those that do support it all purport to follow a single British case that
does not in fact support the existence of that jurisdiction.

 








While appellate courts have no explicit statutory
right to invite appeal on sentence, they do possess the right to ask the
parties questions during oral argument.  But an appellate court’s jurisdiction
in this area is seriously limited and should be exercised in only the rarest of
circumstances.  As long as the question is not raised in a manner which
suggests bias or partiality on the part of the appeal court, such a question is
proper.  The Court of Appeal’s reasons for judgment, which speak of an “unease”
and “discomfort” with the sentence imposed, indicate that the necessary
threshold for raising the issue of a sentence appeal with counsel was not met. 
Courts should refrain from raising the issue unless, after reviewing the
conviction appeal, there is some preliminary indication that the sentence is
“clearly unreasonable” or “demonstrably unfit” in the sense of being outside
the acceptable range.  The Court of Appeal conducted what amounted to a de
facto sentence review which was inappropriate.  Its reasoning gives rise to
a reasonable apprehension of bias in favour of the accused.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé and
Gonthier JJ.:  The Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to review a sentence proprio
motu.  In the absence of jurisdiction to entertain a sentence appeal, the
Court of Appeal was clearly wrong to comment on the adequacy of the sentence. 
The comments attract a reasonable apprehension of bias, all the more so since
such comments may be perceived as reflecting myths and stereotypes about
complainants in sexual assault cases.

The Chief Justice –

 

I.  Introduction

 








1                                  
The central issue in this appeal is whether appellate courts have any
inherent jurisdiction to consider the sentence imposed upon an accused after
conviction, in the absence of an appeal against sentence.  The respondent was
convicted by a jury of two counts of assault and sexual assault against his
common law spouse, occurring over an extended period of time, one count of
assault which occurred on January 3, 1993 and one count of obstruction of
justice.  The trial judge sentenced the respondent to four years’
imprisonment.  The respondent appealed his conviction but not his sentence. 
The Crown indicated an intent to appeal the sentence but elected not to pursue
the matter after the hearing on the conviction appeal.  The Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal against conviction but ordered that counsel return to
present argument on the sentence.  The court held that it had an inherent
jurisdiction to consider the sentence on its own motion (proprio motu),
even in the absence of an appeal against sentence.  The Crown appealed the
decision of the Court of Appeal to this Court and, in the interim, the Court of
Appeal’s order was stayed.  On June 25, 1999, the Court of Appeal (in a
separate proceeding) granted the respondent an extension of time in which to
file a notice of application for leave to appeal from sentence.

 

2                                  
This Court allowed the Crown’s appeal from the Bench.   The Court of
Appeal’s order that the parties return to present argument on sentence was
quashed.  We indicated that reasons for judgment would follow.  These are those
reasons which elaborate briefly on our decision.

 

II.  Background

 

3                                  
The indictment of the respondent contained four counts.  Counts 2 and 3
were of a general nature alleging both physical and sexual abuse on the
complainant over an extended period of almost six years.  Count 1 referred to a
specific assault on January 3, 1993 in which the complainant’s arm was
fractured.  Count 4 referred to a charge of obstruction of justice arising from
the respondent’s death threats against the complainant in the event that she
should proceed with her allegations of abuse.  The respondent was convicted by
a jury of all counts.  He was sentenced to a total period of incarceration of
four years after consecutive sentences were imposed for each conviction.  

 

4                                  
The accused appealed his conviction but did not seek leave to appeal his
sentence.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the conviction appeal: (1998), 163
Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 132.  However, it indicated in its reasons for judgment by
Marshall J.A., at p. 147, that it felt “sufficient unease over the prison term”
to invoke its alleged “inherent  appellate power” to review the sentence on its
own motion.  It ordered that counsel return to present argument on the sentence
within a week.

IV.  Decision of the Court of Appeal 








6                               
The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction.  However,
based on its “unease” with the length of the prison term imposed, the court
elected to exercise what it deemed to be an inherent jurisdiction to review the
sentence even in the absence of an appeal against sentence.  Its conclusion
that it possessed such jurisdiction stemmed entirely from its reading of the
text Sentencing (4th ed. 1994) by C. Ruby wherein the author provided
(at p. 455) five case precedents as authority for such an inherent appellate
jurisdiction.  The court expressed its concern over the evidence presented in
this case, particularly the evidence of the complainant.  The complainant’s
motivation for laying the charges was questioned as the court speculated she
may have been prompted by the accused’s new relationship with another woman. 
The “indirect effect” of a motive inspired by vengeance had to be considered. 
Furthermore, the court felt that its perusal of the record showed several
indicia of exaggeration by the complainant with respect to the extent and
nature of the abuse and injuries suffered.  Finally, the court concluded that
its “extreme discomfort” over the length of the sentence could be further
traced to the lack of need for specific deterrence.  The Court of Appeal
observed that the accused and complainant were no longer involved in an
intimate relationship.  Accordingly, the court assumed that the need for
specific deterrence was negligible to non-existent.  The parties were ordered
to return in one week to present argument on sentence.

 

V.  Analysis

 








7                               
At first blush this appeal could be disposed of quickly by dealing with
the central issue of whether there is any inherent appellate power to deal with
sentencing matters in the absence of an appeal against sentence.  The answer is
clearly “no”.  No such power exists in a court that is governed solely by a
statutory framework.   However, a second glance reveals that this case involves
a more complicated subsidiary issue.  If an appellate court cannot deal with
the matter of sentence in the absence of an appeal on that issue, can it assuage
its concern over what it feels is an improper sentence by inviting counsel to
seek leave to appeal?  The respondent argues that appellate courts have the
power to invite argument on specific matters.  I will elaborate on these two
issues in turn.  Finally, in light of the respondent’s successful application
for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal sentence, I will discuss my
concerns with the appellate judgment in this case which cause me to suggest
that any further hearings be conducted before a differently constituted panel. 
In my view, the reasoning of the Court of Appeal gives rise to a reasonable
apprehension of bias in favour of the respondent.

 

A.  Appellate
Court Powers

 

8                               
It is clear that there is no inherent appellate court jurisdiction. 
This statement has been explicitly made in numerous cases and should be well
understood.  Most recently in R. v. Thomas, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 535, I
reiterated the established principle that courts of appeal are purely statutory
bodies.  La Forest J. earlier emphasized this concept in Kourtessis v.
M.N.R., [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53, at pp. 69-70:

 

Appeals are solely creatures of statute; see R.
v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764, at p. 1773. There is no inherent
jurisdiction in any appeal court.  Nowadays, however, this basic proposition
tends at times to be forgotten.  Appeals to appellate courts and to the Supreme
Court of Canada have become so established and routine that there is a
widespread expectation that there must be some way to appeal the decision of a
court of first instance.  But it remains true that there is no right of appeal
on any matter unless provided for by the relevant legislature.

 

The jurisprudence
of this Court has definitively established therefore, that appellate courts
cannot claim any inherent jurisdiction.  

 








9                               
The Court of Appeal in this case based its claim to inherent appellate
jurisdiction to deal with sentencing on Ruby’s text Sentencing, supra. 
Mr. Ruby makes reference to five cases which in his view provide the authority
for inherent appellate sentencing jurisdiction.  A review of this line of
authority reveals, first, that some of these cases do not necessarily support
Mr. Ruby’s assertion, and second, that those that do support it all purport to
follow a single British case that does not in fact support the existence of
that jurisdiction.

 

10                           
In two of the cases cited by Mr. Ruby, the accused had actually initiated
appeals against sentence.  In R. v. Henry (1927), 20 Cr. App. R. 117,
the accused specifically appealed his sentence which included a term of
“preventive detention” following his conviction and labelling as a “habitual
criminal”.  The court considered that the accused’s record was very bad but
that he had shown initiative in gaining employment and, therefore, the term of
preventive detention was removed.  In my view, this case can only be referred
to as support for the notion that where an accused appeals his or her sentence,
a court can reduce the sentence on its own judgment without returning the
matter to a sentencing judge.  While the headnote states: “the Court may proprio
motu reduce the primary sentence”, the case does not support the notion that
the court could reduce sentence when it was not appealed.  

 

11                           
In R. v. Towers (1929), 21 Cr. App. R. 74, the accused applied
for leave to appeal his conviction.  At the hearing, he also asked the court to
give leave to appeal against sentence.  The Crown raised no objection to the
application being extended to include the question of sentence.  The court
noted that it was “unintelligible” why the accused would not have applied for
leave to appeal his sentence. Crown counsel “concede[d] the point” (p. 75).  The
court further held that since Crown counsel was present in the courtroom, it
would deal with the matter immediately.  The accused’s sentence was reduced
from a prison term to a fine.  The reduction was mandated because the trial
judge was under a mistaken impression that he did not have the power to impose
a fine.  Since it was “perfectly obvious” that he did indeed have such a power,
the Court of Appeal substituted that result.  I would note however that the
accused in Towers did specifically seek leave to appeal his sentence
which merited no objection from the Crown.  This is distinguishable from the
case at bar.

 








12                           
I turn now to the other cases relied on in the court below.  In R. v.
MacKay (1934), 62 C.C.C. 188, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court did state that
it could proprio motu reduce the sentence and relied on R. v.
Musgrave (1926), 46 C.C.C. 45 (N.S.S.C.) as authority for exercising this
power.  Musgrave concluded that a court may proprio motu reduce
sentence where there was no appeal against sentence.  The Nova Scotia Supreme
Court in Musgrave relied on an English case, R. v. Moscovitch
(1924), 18 Cr. App. R. 37, as authority for this proposition.  In Moscovitch,
the accused appealed against his conviction but his counsel was specifically
invited to seek leave to appeal against sentence.  After considering the
circumstances, the court in Moscovitch reduced his sentence.  

 

13                           
The appellant quite rightly points out that in Moscovitch, the
court specifically invited the accused to appeal against his sentence. 
Therefore, it was improperly relied upon in Musgrave, supra,
which used it as a precedent for an appellate court reducing sentence
completely on its own initiative.  Musgrave then was improperly relied
upon in MacKay.

 








14                           
In R. v. Hervey (1939), 27 Cr. App. R. 146, at pp. 148-49, the
court noted that the defendant had appealed against his conviction only but
held, “it is within the power of the Court to treat his notice of appeal as if
it had included an appeal against sentence”.  The accused was convicted on four
counts dealing with robbery, housebreaking and conspiracy to steal.  The court
quashed his conviction on two counts and stated, “Notwithstanding the omission
in the notice of appeal, the Court is of opinion that, in view of the
partial revision of the conviction, his sentence may suitably be reduced to
one of eighteen months’ imprisonment” (emphasis added).  Hervey is
distinguishable from the case at bar in two respects: first, the court in Hervey
quashed his conviction on two counts and it therefore follows that his
sentence should have been reduced accordingly; second, while the court in Hervey
felt it could extend an appeal from conviction to include an appeal from
sentence, the current Canadian Criminal Code offers specific
alternatives that an accused must follow to appeal a conviction and/or
sentence.  In particular, s. 675(1) (b) states:

 

675.  (1) A person who is convicted by a
trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

 

 .
. .

 

(b) against the sentence passed by the trial court, with
leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that sentence is one
fixed by law. [Emphasis added.]

 

An accused
therefore needs leave of the court to appeal his or her sentence.  It would not
be proper for an appellate court to consider a notice of appeal from conviction
as incorporating a notice of appeal from sentence. This point was made in R.
v. Ferencsik, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 166 (Ont. C.A.), wherein Aylesworth J.A.
specifically held that the unequivocal wording of the appeal sections of the Criminal
Code , “indicates the separateness of and the distinction between appeals as
against conviction or dismissal of a charge on the one hand, and as against
sentence on the other” (p. 167).

 

15                           
It is evident therefore that there is no inherent power in courts of
appeal to deal with sentence appeals.  The jurisprudence from this Court
confirms the statutory definition of appellate bodies.  This conclusion alone
is sufficient to dispose of the narrow issue here in that the Newfoundland
Court of Appeal erred in finding that it had the inherent power to consider a
sentence in the absence of an appeal against sentence.  However, as I said,
this case also raises a separate question as to whether an appellate court has
the power to invite a sentence appeal in the interests of justice.  As I will
explain, in my view an appellate court’s jurisdiction in this area is seriously
limited and should be exercised in only the rarest of circumstances. 

 

B.  Proper
Role of the Court








16                           
It is true that the Newfoundland Court of Appeal did not “officially”
reconsider the respondent’s sentence in the absence of an appeal against
sentence.  Rather, it ordered the parties to return to court in one week’s time
to set a date for the hearing of argument on sentence.  The respondent remained
free on judicial interim release.  In argument before us, the respondent
conceded that the court did not have the inherent power it claimed to consider
the sentence but argued that it did have the power to “invite” the respondent
to file an Application for an extension of time to proceed with a Notice of
Application for leave to appeal sentence.  This power of “invitation” is also
mentioned in one of the cases relied on in one of the cases previously
mentioned, Moscovitch, supra.  I would note that such a power has
no statutory foundation.

 

17                           
While appellate courts have no explicit statutory right to invite appeal
on sentence, they do possess the right to ask the parties questions during oral
argument.  As long as the question is not raised in a manner which suggests
bias or partiality on the part of the appeal court, such a question is proper. 
It is important to emphasize that this right is limited to oral argument, and
may not be exercised ex parte, in the court’s reasons for judgment or in
any other forum.  Parenthetically, I would add that it is not inappropriate,
however, for an appellate court simply to note in its reasons for judgment that
neither party brought an appeal against sentence before it.  An appeal court
may wish to do so in order to indicate, for example, why the conviction was
reviewed but the sentence was left untouched.

 








18                           
This approach respects the tactical decisions made by counsel and
remains firmly within the procedure for sentence appeals articulated in the Criminal
Code .  It also avoids an apprehension of bias because appellate judges are
expected to ask pointed questions in the course of oral argument.  By contrast,
the Newfoundland Court of Appeal’s approach of inviting appeal risks creating
an apprehension of bias particularly if, as in this case, the Court of Appeal
expresses “discomfort” or “unease” with the sentence in its reasons.  Such an
approach, in my view, may provide grounds on which to impugn the impartiality
of the court when it subsequently hears submissions on sentence.  Especially in
the absence of an appeal against sentence, such an expression of opinion also
violates the longstanding principle that sentencing judges are owed tremendous
deference due to the delicate nature of the sentencing process.  In R. v. M.
(C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 91, I elaborated on the deference
owed sentencing judges:

 

This deferential standard of review has profound
functional justifications.  As Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire,
[[1995] 4 S.C.R. 227], at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit
of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the
comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime.... A
sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge
in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown
and the offender.  A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications
of experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our
criminal justice system.  Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will
normally preside near or within the community which has suffered consequences
of the offender’s crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense
of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be “just and appropriate”
for the protection of that community.  The determination of a just and
appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the
societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender
and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account
the needs and current conditions of and in the community.  The discretion of a
sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

In rare
circumstances, appellate courts may feel compelled to ask the parties why they
have not appealed a sentence.  This would obviously be most appropriate in
cases where an accused is unrepresented at the appellate level, as there is
less concern about intruding upon a party’s strategic choices in framing the
issues.  Similarly, the risk of creating an apprehension of bias is diminished
where the accused is unrepresented, as courts have historically taken extra
measures to ensure that all available avenues have been considered by such an
accused.

 








19                           
I emphasize also that in R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 227, and M. (C.A.), this Court held that a variation of
sentence (after leave to appeal has been granted) should only be made by an
appellate court if the sentence imposed is “clearly unreasonable” or
“demonstrably unfit”, these two standards in my view meaning the same thing. 
In Shropshire, the Court concluded  (at para. 50) that unreasonableness
in the sentencing context refers to an order falling outside the “acceptable
range” of sentences under similar circumstances.  In an adversarial system, it
seems logical to assume that if no appeal against sentence is taken, neither of
the parties found anything “clearly” unreasonable in it.  I caution, therefore,
that appellate courts should be wary of raising the issue of a sentence appeal
unless the sentence is so clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit as to
indicate possible oversight on the part of counsel or an unrepresented accused.

 

20                           
I realize this may at first seem contradictory in that appellate courts
are asked not to conduct sentence reviews proprio motu, and yet may
inquire as to whether the absence of an appeal is an oversight if they believe
that the sentence, upon an initial review, is “clearly unreasonable”.  In order
to resolve the conundrum, I stress that a preliminary assessment of the
appropriateness of a sentence can be made rather easily during a conviction
appeal.  In my view, it would be possible for an appellate court conducting a
conviction appeal to form a preliminary opinion that a sentence appears to be
clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit.  In such cases the remedy of a
sentence appeal could be raised with counsel or suggested to a self-represented
accused in oral argument.  A full-fledged review of sentence would be
inappropriate in the absence of an appeal.

 








21                           
To that end, in my view the Court of Appeal’s comments here that it felt
“unease” and “discomfort” over the period of incarceration handed down to the
respondent were in error for two reasons: first, the court went beyond merely
raising the matter of a sentence appeal with counsel (it actually ordered the
parties to return and present submissions); second, the language used does not
indicate that the appropriate threshold was met for raising the issue of a
sentence appeal. The possibility of mere disagreement over the sentence awarded
does not warrant unilateral intervention by an appellate court.  Admittedly,
the Court of Appeal did not purport to undertake a full-fledged sentence
review.  It certainly did not make an order as to sentence substituting its
view for that of the sentencing judge.  However, in effect, additional comments
made by the Court of Appeal indicate that it had embarked on a de facto
sentence review.    

 

22                           
The Court of Appeal clearly indicated its opinion that the sentence
imposed by the sentencing judge was too high.  Indeed, the Court of Appeal
concluded that the transcript of evidence provided three reasons for its unease
and discomfort over the four-year sentence imposed (at p. 150):

 

They center on the nature of the dysfunctional relationship, the
apparent severity of the sentence in comparison with misgivings over the extent
of the actual violence and injury involved, and the absence of any apparent need
for the sentence to specifically deter G.W. from recidivism.

 

23                           
Notwithstanding the foregoing comments, in ordering the parties to
return to present argument on sentence, the Court of Appeal attempted to make
clear that it would remain unbiased and consider the Crown’s submissions that
the sentence was appropriate.  However, an objective observer would, I think,
find it difficult to believe that this panel of the court would affirm the
sentence imposed, despite what efforts the Crown might bring to bear in that
regard.  The court’s clear indication of displeasure raises a concern about
apprehension of bias in the court.   

 

VI.  Conclusion
and Disposition

 

24                           
To summarize, in my view the Court of Appeal erred in the following
respects:

 








1.               In the absence of a sentencing
appeal, the Court of Appeal  had no inherent jurisdiction which could support
an order that the parties return to make submissions on sentence.

 

2.               The Court of Appeal’s reasons for
judgment, which speak of an “unease” and “discomfort” with the sentence
imposed,  indicate that  the necessary threshold for raising the issue of a
sentence appeal with counsel was not met.  Courts should  refrain from raising
the issue unless, after reviewing the conviction appeal, there is some preliminary
indication that the sentence is “clearly unreasonable” or “demonstrably unfit”
in the sense of being outside the acceptable range.

 

3.               The Court of Appeal conducted
what amounted to a  de facto sentence review which was inappropriate,
especially in the context of an order that the parties return in one week’s
time to make submissions on sentencing.     

 

25                           
Therefore, this Court having already allowed the appeal and quashed the
order of the Court of Appeal that would have the parties return to make
sentencing submissions,  the respondent’s application for leave to appeal the
sentence should proceed before a differently constituted panel of the Court of
Appeal.

 

The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

 

L’Heureux-Dubé J. –  The
issue in this appeal is whether a Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear an
appeal against sentence where no leave to appeal has been sought. 








26                           
I agree with the Chief Justice that the law on this issue is clear:  the
Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to review a sentence proprio motu. 

 

27                           
In this case, not only did the Court of Appeal err in invoking its
alleged “inherent jurisdiction” to review the sentence and ordering the parties
to return to make submissions on sentence, but it commented as follows on the
issue of sentencing:

 

While a complainant’s motivation per se is not a
factor directly impacting on the fixing of an appropriate sentence, it may be,
nonetheless, a circumstance that has the potential for indirect effect.  Where
the evidence clearly shows, as it does in the case at bar, that the complaint
was laid in retaliation for actions unrelated to the crimes, there is cause to
inquire in the course of fixing a just sanction commensurate to the offences
whether the impact of the crimes was as serious as represented by the victim. 
In such a circumstance, a perusal of the record is warranted for indicia of
exaggerations by the complainant. 

 

.
. .

 

In this case, the perusal does leave scope for
unease as to the actual extent of the episodic violence and injuries.  It is
fully appreciated the violent and threatening acts of which G.W. stands
convicted must attract punishment.  However, the penalty has to be
appropriately commensurate to his offences.  The jury’s verdicts speak to his
culpability, but not to its degree. . . . [I]t has to be said that the
transcript’s descriptions of the extent of S.M.’s injuries do not entirely
support the magnitude of the abuse she alleges in her testimony to have
suffered in the course of the unhealthy relationship.

 

.
. .

 

A final factor ascertainable from the transcript
which adds to the feeling of extreme discomfort over the length of the sentence
is that the need for specific deterrence in this case appears negligible, or
even non-existent, with the ending of G.W.’s relationship with S.M. and his
entering a new one.

 

((1998), 163 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 132, at pp. 149-50)

 








28                           
In the absence of jurisdiction to entertain a sentence appeal, the Court
of Appeal was clearly wrong to comment on the adequacy of the sentence.  The
comments attract, as the Chief Justice points out, a reasonable apprehension of
bias, all the more so since such comments may be perceived as reflecting myths
and stereotypes about complainants in sexual assault cases.  (See R. v.
Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at pp. 604 and 630, per McLachlin J.,

1985, c. C-46 , ss. 278.1  to 278.91 .

 








The accused was charged with one count of sexual
assault and one count of unlawful sexual touching.  On the scheduled day of the
trial, the Crown provided the accused with a statement of the complainant L.C. 
Counsel for the accused also obtained partial disclosure of therapeutic records
and notes relating to the complainant that were in the possession of a
counselling organization.  Counsel for the accused later  sought production of
records relating to the complainant held by a psychiatrist and a child and
adolescent services association.  The trial judge then informed  the parties
that on May 12, 1997, Bill C-46 was proclaimed into force and  amended the Criminal
Code  to include ss. 278.1  to 278.91 , which deal with the production of
records in sexual offence proceedings.  The accused brought a constitutional
challenge attacking the validity of these provisions on the basis that they
violated ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .  The trial judge concluded that the new Criminal Code 
provisions infringed the accused’s rights under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of
the Charter  and, in a separate judgment,  ruled that the impugned
provisions were not saved by s. 1  of the Charter . 

 

Held (Lamer C.J.
dissenting in part):  The appeal should be allowed.  Sections 278.1  to 278.91 
of the Criminal Code  are constitutional.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier, McLachlin, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.:  To challenge
the constitutionality of the impugned legislation, the accused need not prove
that the legislation would probably violate his right to make full answer and
defence.  It is sufficient that he establish that the legislation is
unconstitutional in its general effect.  In determining whether a
constitutional challenge is premature, one must ask whether the record provides
sufficient facts to permit a court to adjudicate properly the issues raised. 
The record in this case contains sufficient facts to resolve the issues posed
by the present appeal and the constitutional challenge is therefore not
premature.  A determination that the legislation at issue in this appeal is
unconstitutional in its general effect involves an assessment of its effects
under reasonable hypothetical circumstances.

 








Although the procedure governing the production of
private records of complainants in sexual assault proceedings set out in Bill
C-46 differs significantly from the O’Connor regime, it does not follow
that Bill C-46 is unconstitutional.  Parliament may build on the Court’s
decision, and develop a different scheme as long as it meets the required
constitutional standards.  A posture of respect towards Parliament has been
adopted by the courts.  The relationship between the courts and the legislature
should be one of dialogue.  The courts do not hold a monopoly on the protection
and promotion of rights and freedoms.  Parliament also plays a role in this
regard and is often able to act as a significant ally for vulnerable groups,
especially in the context of sexual violence.  While it is the role of the
courts to specify constitutional standards, there may be a range of permissible
regimes that can meet these standards.  In adopting Bill C-46, Parliament
sought to recognize the prevalence of sexual violence against women and
children and its disadvantageous impact on their rights, to encourage the
reporting of incidents of sexual violence, to recognize the impact of the
production of personal information on the efficacy of treatment, and to
reconcile fairness to complainants with the rights of the accused.  Parliament
may also be understood to be recognizing “horizontal” equality concerns, where
women’s inequality results from the acts of other individuals and groups rather
than the state.

 

At issue in the present case is whether the procedure
established in Bill C-46 violates the principles of fundamental justice.  Two
principles of fundamental justice seem to conflict:  the right to full answer
and defence and the right to privacy.  Neither right may be defined in such a
way as to negate the other and both sets of rights are informed by the equality
rights at play in this context.  No single principle is absolute and capable of
trumping the others; they must all be defined in light of competing claims.  A
contextual approach to the interpretation of rights should be adopted as they
often inform, and are informed by, other rights at issue in the circumstances. 
It is important, however, to distinguish between balancing the principles of
fundamental justice under s. 7  and balancing interests under s. 1  of
the Charter .  The issue under s. 7  is the delineation of the
boundaries of the rights in question whereas under s. 1  the question is
whether the violation of these boundaries may be justified.  In this context,
the right to make full answer and defence, the right to privacy, and the right
to equality must be defined.

 








The right of an accused to make full answer and
defence is crucial to ensuring that the innocent are not convicted.  In the
context of records production, it is important not to place the accused in a
Catch-22 situation as often the accused may be in the difficult position of
making submissions regarding the importance to full answer and defence of
records that he or she has not seen.  The accused’s right to make full answer
and defence must be understood in light of other principles of fundamental
justice which may embrace interests and perspectives beyond those of the
accused.  In this context, full answer and defence does not include the right
to evidence that would distort the search for truth inherent in the trial
process.

 








An order for the production of records made pursuant
to ss. 278.1  to 278.91  of the Criminal Code  is a seizure within the
meaning of s. 8  of the Charter .  The reasonable expectation of
privacy or right to be left alone by the state protected by s. 8  includes
the ability to control the dissemination of confidential information.  Privacy
is also necessarily related to many fundamental human relations.  The
therapeutic relationship is one that is characterized by trust, an element of which
is confidentiality.  The protection of the complainant’s reasonable expectation
of privacy in her therapeutic records protects the therapeutic relationship and
the mental integrity of complainants and witnesses.  Security of the person is
violated by state action interfering with an individual’s mental integrity. 
Therefore, in cases where a therapeutic relationship is threatened by the
disclosure of private records, security of the person and not just privacy is
implicated.  The right to privacy is one which may be limited as reasonable
searches and seizures are permitted by s. 8  of the Charter .  Given
that s. 8  addresses a particular application of the principles of
fundamental justice it may be inferred that a reasonable search or seizure is
consistent with the principles of fundamental justice and  accommodates both
the accused’s ability to make full answer and defence and the complainant’s
privacy right.  The accused will have no right to the records in question
insofar as they contain information that is either irrelevant or would serve to
distort the search for truth.  On the other hand, the accused’s right must
prevail where the lack of disclosure or production of the record would render
him unable to make full answer and defence.  Between these extremes lies a
spectrum of possibilities regarding where to strike a balance between these
competing rights in any particular context.  Full answer and defence will be
more centrally implicated where the information contained in a record is part
of the case to meet or where its potential probative value is high.  Privacy
rights will be most directly at stake where a record concerns aspects of one’s
individual identity or where confidentiality is crucial to a therapeutic or
trust-like relationship.

 

Equality concerns must also inform the contextual
circumstances in which the rights of full answer and defence and privacy will
come into play.  An appreciation of myths and stereotypes in the context of
sexual violence is essential to delineate properly the boundaries of full
answer and defence.  An appreciation of the equality dimensions of record
production in cases concerning sexual violence highlights the need to balance
privacy and full answer and defence in a manner that fully respects the privacy
interests of complainants.

 

The definition of the records subject to Bill C-46 is
not overly broad as the legislation only applies to records in which there is a
reasonable expectation of privacy. The legislation is therefore consistent with
the definition of privacy rights under s. 8  of the Charter . 
Documents falling within the ambit of Bill C-46 may or may not be ordered to be
disclosed to the accused pursuant to the legislative regime.  It is therefore
the procedures established by Bill C-46 and not the spectrum of records subject
to these procedures that will determine the fairness or constitutionality of
the legislation.

 








The mere fact that s. 278.2  of the Criminal
Code  prevents the automatic disclosure of all relevant and non-privileged
information in the possession of the Crown does not  deprive the accused of his
right to full answer and defence.  This provision does not by itself deny
access to documents to which the defence is constitutionally entitled. It was
open for Parliament to determine what procedure was to be followed where third
party records were in the possession of the Crown without the existence of an
express waiver.  Crown possession or control of such records cannot be equated
with a total loss of any reasonable expectation of privacy.  Although the Crown
can obtain private records through a search warrant or subpoena while the
accused, in the absence of an express waiver, can only apply for the documents
under Bill C-46, s. 278.2  of the Criminal Code  does not provide the
Crown with an unconstitutional advantage.  It is constitutionally permissible
for the Crown to be subject to different treatment, to different procedures, or
even to end up with documents that the accused has not seen, as long as the
accused can make full answer and defence and the trial is fundamentally fair. 
Any unfairness to the accused is offset by the provision that requires
disclosure to the defence if the protection of the legislation is waived and
the requirement under s. 278.2(3)  that the prosecutor  notify the accused
of the private documents in his or her possession.  A fully informed
complainant may waive the protection of the legislation by express declaration
or by voluntarily providing records to the Crown.  The fact that the Crown may
possess documents that the accused has not seen does not violate s. 7  of
the Charter  as the remainder of Bill C-46 gives the accused sufficient
access to all relevant documents.

 








Section 278.3(4)  of the Criminal Code , which
lists a series of assertions that cannot on their own establish that a record
is likely relevant, does not violate s. 7  of the Charter .  The
purpose of this provision is to prevent speculative and unmeritorious requests
for production.  It does not entirely prevent an accused from relying on the
factors listed, but simply prevents reliance on bare assertions of the listed
matters where there is no other evidence and they stand on their own.  This
provision prevents speculative myths, stereotypes, and generalized assumptions
about sexual assault victims and classes of records from forming the entire
basis of an otherwise unsubstantiated order for production of private
records.  Where any one of the listed assertions is made and supported by
the required evidentiary and informational foundation, the trial judge remains
the ultimate arbiter in deciding whether the likely relevance threshold is met.

 

In s. 278.5(1) of the Criminal Code 
Parliament supplemented the “likely relevant” standard for production to the
judge proposed in O’Connor with the further requirement that production
be “necessary in the interests of justice”.  This new standard is the result of
a lengthy consultation process and is a notable example of the dialogue between
the judicial and legislative branches.  Under the new provision a trial judge
is required to consider the salutary and deleterious effects of production to
the court on the accused’s right to make full answer and defence and on the
rights to privacy and equality of the complainant or witness.  Once likely
relevance is established, the fact that a consideration of the rights and
interests of those affected by production to the court might result in
production not being ordered does not necessarily render the legislation unconstitutional. 
The non-disclosure of third party records with a high privacy interest that may
contain relevant evidence will not compromise trial fairness where such
non-disclosure would not prejudice the accused’s right to full answer and
defence.  The criterion that production to the court be necessary in the
interests of justice invests the trial judge with the discretion to consider
the full range of rights and interests at issue before ordering production, in
a manner scrupulously respectful of the requirements of the Charter .  If
the judge concludes that it is necessary to examine the documents at issue in
order to determine whether they should be produced to enable the accused to
make full answer and defence, then production to the judge is necessary in the
interests of justice.  Likewise if the judge is left uncertain about whether
the production of the documents is necessary to make full answer and defence,
then the judge should rule in favour of inspecting the document.

 








In determining whether production is necessary in the
interests of justice, the judge need not engage in a conclusive and in-depth
analysis of each of the factors listed in s. 278.5(2).  The provision
merely requires that the judge take these factors into account.  Even at this
early stage, the analysis required can have a sufficient evidentiary basis
through Crown disclosure, defence witnesses, the cross-examination of Crown
witnesses at both the preliminary inquiry and trial, and expert evidence.  In
addition to the evidentiary foundation of a case, considerations such as the
nature of the records sought and the manner in which these records were taken
will often provide trial judges with sufficient information to be able to
consider and take into account the factors listed in s. 278.5(2) and
fulfil the requirements of s. 278.5(1).

 

When determining whether production of part or all of
the impugned record to the accused is necessary in the interests of justice
under s. 278.7(1)  of the Criminal Code , trial judges are only asked
to take into account the factors listed in s. 278.5(2)  and are not
required to rule conclusively on each factor.  Trial judges are also not
required to determine whether factors relating to the privacy and equality of
the complainant or witness outweigh factors relating to the accused’s right to
full answer and defence.  The inclusion of societal interest factors in the
analysis does not alter the constitutional balance established in O’Connor. 
The requirement that the judge consider the effect of the determination on the
integrity of the trial process relates to whether the search for truth would be
advanced by the production of the records in question or whether the material
would introduce discriminatory biases and beliefs into the fact-finding
process.  The scheme created by Parliament permits judges to exercise wide
discretion and consider a variety of factors in order  to preserve the
complainant’s privacy and equality rights to the maximum extent possible, and
also ensure that the accused has access to the documents required to make full
answer and defence.

 








Per Lamer C.J.
(dissenting in part):  Although Bill C-46 complies with ss. 7 and 11(d)
of the Charter  as it applies to the production of records in the
possession of third parties, ss. 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code  infringe these Charter  provisions as they
apply to records in the Crown’s possession or control.  Parliament was
unquestionably free to fashion a legislative scheme to address the issue of the
procedure applicable to the production of records in the Crown’s possession in
the absence of an express waiver.  However, the legislative means chosen are
not impeccably consistent with ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
The Crown’s constitutional and ethical duty to disclose all information in its
possession reasonably capable of affecting the accused’s ability to raise a
reasonable doubt flows from the right to make full answer and defence, which is
itself a principle of fundamental justice protected by ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter .  The duty of disclosure is premised on the presumption
that material in the Crown’s possession has probative value.  The requirement
in Bill C-46 that the accused must prove the relevance of records that form
part of the case to meet is a serious incursion on the meaningful exercise of
the right to make full answer and defence.  By displacing the presumption of
relevance and increasing the relevance threshold, ss. 278.3(3)(b)
and 278.5(1)(b) of the Code give the Crown a distinct advantage
over the defence, as it holds information that the accused must surmount a
significant obstacle to obtain.  These provisions therefore infringe the
accused’s right to a fair trial.  

 








The infringement of ss. 7  and 11 (d) is not
justified by s. 1  of the Charter .  Sections 278.3(3) (b) and
278.5(1) (b) fail to protect the privacy and equality rights of
complainants and witnesses in sexual assault trials in a manner that minimally
impairs the right of an accused to make full answer and defence. The burden on
the accused to demonstrate likely relevance is more intrusive than reasonably
necessary to achieve the important legislative goals.  In addition, the risk of
suppressing relevant evidence and of convicting an innocent person outweighs
the salutary effects of the impugned provisions on privacy and equality
rights.  A combination of reading down and reading in new language is the most
appropriate way to vindicate the Charter  rights at issue.  Sections
278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b) should be read as not applying to
records in the possession or control of the prosecutor in the proceedings.  The
existing principles for Crown disclosure as enunciated in Stinchcombe and
O’Connor would partially apply instead of those paragraphs, such that
the Crown would have the opportunity to show the trial judge that the documents
are irrelevant or privileged.  If the Crown is unable to discharge this burden,
then the records should, to protect the complainant’s privacy rights, be
disclosed to the trial judge rather than the accused if the trial judge is
satisfied that the other requirements in s. 278.5(1)  and (2)  are met.  The
second stage of the legislative regime -- judicial examination of the documents
to determine whether and to what extent they should be produced to the accused
-- would then proceed according to the criteria in ss. 278.6  to 278.91 .

The following are the reasons delivered by

 








1                                  
The Chief Justice
(dissenting in part) -- The issue in this appeal is whether Bill C-46 (now S.C.
1997, c. 30) strikes the appropriate constitutional balance between protecting
the accused’s right to a fair trial and the privacy and equality rights of
complainants and witnesses when an accused seeks access to their confidential
records in sexual assault proceedings.  While I agree with McLachlin and
Iacobucci JJ.’s finding that Bill C-46 complies with ss. 7 and 11(d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as it applies to the
production of records in the possession of third parties, I take a different
view of the legislative regime’s approach to records in the hands of the
Crown.  In my opinion, Bill C-46's treatment of records that form part of the
case to meet tips the balance too heavily in favour of privacy to the detriment
of the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.

 

2                                  
As my colleagues have explained, s. 278.2(2)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , extends the application of the legislative scheme for
the production of therapeutic records to documents in the Crown’s possession or
control.  If the complainant or witness expressly waives the protection of the
legislation, then the records may be produced to the accused as at common law according
to the principles in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R.
326.

 

3                                  
Absent waiver, however, Bill C-46 requires the accused to submit to the
same two-stage procedure for production applicable to records held by third
parties:  disclosure to the trial judge and production to the accused.   The
first stage obliges the accused to establish that the record in the Crown’s
possession is “likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a
witness to testify” (ss. 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b)).  The trial
judge must also decide whether disclosure to the court is “necessary in the
interests of justice” and consider the salutary and deleterious effects of
production on the accused’s right to make full answer and defence, and on the
complainant’s or witness’s right to privacy and equality (s. 278.5(1) (c)
and 278.5(2)).  If the first step is satisfied, the second stage involves
judicial inspection of the documents to determine whether and to what extent
they should be produced to the accused (ss. 278.6  to 278.91 ).

 








4                                  
My colleagues observe that the majority in R. v. O’Connor, [1995]
4 S.C.R. 411,  did not comment on the procedure applicable to the production of
records which the Crown possesses in the absence of an express waiver. 
Parliament was unquestionably free to fashion a legislative scheme to address
this issue.  I agree entirely with the appellant L.C.’s submission that the
courts’ creation of a common law procedure for production does not curtail
Parliament’s jurisdiction to modify that scheme, particularly after having the
benefit of evaluating its impact.  However, I cannot agree with my colleagues
that the legislative means chosen are impeccably consistent with ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter .

 

5                                  
As this Court maintained in Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 336,
the right of an accused to make full answer and defence is a pillar of
criminal justice on which we rely heavily to prevent the conviction of the
innocent.  It is a principle of fundamental justice protected by ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter .  Flowing from the right to make full answer and defence
is the Crown’s constitutional and ethical duty to disclose all information in
its possession reasonably capable of affecting the accused’s ability to raise a
reasonable doubt concerning his innocence:  R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R.
451, at p. 466.  This obligation is subject only to the Crown’s discretion to
withhold disclosure on the basis that the material is irrelevant or privileged.

 

6                                  
The duty of disclosure is premised on the presumption that material in
the Crown’s possession has probative value.  The O’Connor majority
endorsed this presumption at para. 12, where we surmised that “[g]enerally
speaking, the Crown would not obtain possession or control of therapeutic
records unless the information the records contained was somehow relevant to
the case against the accused.”  This reasoning applies with even greater force,
in my view, when the Crown seeks access to documents without the complainant’s
cooperation, such as by way of a search warrant.

 








7                                  
McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. emphasize in their reasons that the Crown’s
duty of disclosure is not absolute.  The Charter  entrenches the
right to a fair trial, they maintain, not the best trial.  The principles of
fundamental justice do not guarantee the most favourable procedures
conceivable.  All of this is true.  However, in my respectful view my
colleagues understate the importance of Crown disclosure to trial fairness. 
Disclosure of records in the Crown’s hands furthers the search for truth as it
enables the defence to challenge the accuracy and cogency of the prosecution’s
case.  The accused’s ability to access relevant information that may ultimately
deprive him of his liberty strikes at the very core of the principles of
fundamental justice.

 

8                                  
The requirement in Bill C-46 that the accused must prove the relevance
of records that form part of the case to meet is a serious incursion on the
meaningful exercise of the right to make full answer and defence.  Not only
does the legislative scheme supplant the presumption of relevance, but it also
raises the relevance bar.  The standard of relevance which the accused must
satisfy according to ss. 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b) – likely
relevance to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify –
is higher than that required for disclosure under a Stinchcombe
application, which is whether the information “may be useful to the defence”:  O’Connor,
supra, at para. 22, and Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 345.

 








9                                  
Moreover, I do not agree with McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.’s assertion
that the notification requirement in s. 278.2(3) provides the accused with much
assistance in establishing the likely relevance of a document in the Crown’s
possession.  I reiterate the concerns which the majority expressed in O’Connor,
supra, at paras. 25-26, about placing an accused in the position of
having to persuade the trial judge that documents are relevant without any
knowledge of their contents.  It will be difficult indeed for an accused to
establish the likely relevance of a record which he knows to exist, but which
he has never seen.  By displacing the presumption of relevance and increasing
the relevance threshold, ss. 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b) give the
Crown a distinct advantage over the defence, as it holds information that the
accused must surmount a significant obstacle to obtain.  These provisions
therefore infringe the accused’s right to a fair trial.

 

10                              
Having found that ss. 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b) violate
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  as they apply to records in the
Crown’s possession, I must consider whether the infringement is a reasonable
limit prescribed by law that is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society.  I am mindful that violations of s. 7  are  rarely saved by s. 1 :  New
Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), [1999] 3
S.C.R. 46, at para. 99.  Iacobucci J. summarized the analytical framework
applicable to s. 1  as follows in Egan v. Canada, [1995] 2
S.C.R. 513, at para. 182:

 

A limitation to a constitutional guarantee will be sustained once two
conditions are met.  First, the objective of the legislation must be pressing
and substantial. Second, the means chosen to attain this legislative end must 
be reasonable and demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society. 
In order to satisfy the second requirement, three criteria must be satisfied: 
(1) the rights violation must be rationally connected to the aim of the
legislation; (2) the impugned provision must minimally impair the Charter 
guarantee; and (3) there must be a proportionality between the effect of the
measure and its objective so that the attainment of the legislative goal is not
outweighed by  the abridgement of the right.

 

 








11                              
Without a doubt, Bill C-46 was adopted to address a pressing and
substantial objective, which is the protection of the privacy and equality
rights of complainants and witnesses in the context of sexual assault trials. 
The legislative scheme also rationally advances this important aim.  In my
opinion, however, ss. 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b) fail to protect
those rights in a manner that minimally impairs the right of an accused to make
full answer and defence.  The requirement that the accused must demonstrate the
likely relevance of records held by the Crown is more intrusive than reasonably
necessary to achieve the legislative goals: see M. v. H., [1999]
2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 118.  In addition, the risk of suppressing relevant
evidence and of convicting an innocent person outweighs the salutary effects of
the impugned provisions on privacy and equality rights.  I accordingly conclude
that the violations are not justified by s. 1 .

 

12                              
While in my view ss. 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b) are
unconstitutional as they apply to records in the Crown’s hands, I remain
sensitive that the production of therapeutic records to the defence is
injurious to a complainant’s privacy rights.  Indeed, disclosure may be all the
more invasive to a complainant’s dignity and psychological integrity when they
are obtained by the Crown without her consent.

 

13                              
In this regard, I emphasize that records which the Crown procures absent
waiver would still be subject to the principles in Stinchcombe.  The
prosecution would be free to rebut the presumption that the documents are
relevant.  I remark in passing that this may be difficult for the Crown to
accomplish in respect of documents obtained pursuant to a search warrant, as in
most cases the evidentiary basis upon which the warrant was secured will itself
be disclosed.  As with any Stinchcombe application, the Crown may
likewise attempt to resist disclosure by demonstrating that the records are
privileged.

 








14                              
If the Crown is unable to discharge this burden, then the records should
be disclosed to the trial judge rather than the accused (as they normally would
under a Stinchcombe application), because of the privacy rights at
stake, if the trial judge is satisfied that the other requirements in s.
278.5(1)  and (2)  are met.  The second stage of the legislative regime --
judicial examination of the documents to determine whether and to what extent
they should be produced to the accused -- would then proceed according to the
criteria in ss. 278.6  to 278.91 , as explained by my colleagues.  In my view,
relieving the accused of the burden of showing relevance strikes a more
appropriate balance between the various rights at stake.  It removes a
significant barrier to the accused’s ability to raise a reasonable doubt
concerning his innocence while preserving a large measure of protection for the
privacy and equality rights of complainants and witnesses.

 

15                              
I turn last to a consideration of the appropriate remedy under s. 52(1) 
of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  My finding of unconstitutionality is
limited to two provisions of an otherwise complex legislative scheme.  I
believe that a combination of reading down the sections and reading in new
language is the most appropriate way to vindicate the Charter  rights at
play “while refraining from intrusion into the legislative sphere beyond what
is necessary”:  R. v. Laba, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 965, at p. 1012, per
Sopinka J.  Sections 278.3(3) (b) and 278.5(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code  should therefore be interpreted such that they no longer apply to an
application for the production of records in the Crown’s possession.  Language
along the following lines should be read into both ss. 278.3(3) (b) and
278.5(1) (b):  “unless the record is in the possession or control of the
prosecutor in the proceedings, in which case this paragraph does not apply”. 
The principles for Crown disclosure enunciated in Stinchcombe and O’Connor
would partially apply instead of those paragraphs, such that the Crown would
have the opportunity to show the trial judge that the documents are irrelevant
or privileged.

 

16                              
I would allow the appeal in part and answer the constitutional questions

I.  Introduction

 








17                              
The question of when accused persons should have access to private
records of complainants and witnesses in sexual assault trials is a vexed one.
This Court addressed this issue in R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411.
Following this decision, and a lengthy consultation process, Parliament
reviewed the issue and drafted Bill C-46, (now S.C. 1997, c. 30) which came
into force on May 12, 1997 and amended the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 . The issue in the present appeal is whether Bill C-46 is
constitutional. The resolution of this appeal requires understanding  how to
define competing rights, avoiding the hierarchical approach rejected by this
Court in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835,
at p. 877.  On the one hand stands the accused’s right to make
full answer and defence. On the other hand stands the complainant’s and
witness’s right to privacy. Neither right may be defined in such a way as to
negate the other and both sets of rights are informed by the equality rights at
play in this context. Underlying this question is the relationship
between the courts and Parliament when Parliament alters a judicially created
common law procedure that already embodies Charter  standards.

 

II.  Summary

 

18               
This appeal presents an apparent conflict among the rights to full
answer and defence, privacy, and equality, all of which are protected by the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (ss. 7  and 11 (d), s. 8 , and s. 15 ,
respectively).  The underlying issue is what is required by the “principles of
fundamental justice” protected by s. 7 .  Bill C-46 reflects Parliament’s effort
at balancing these rights.  Our task is to decide whether Parliament’s balance
is a constitutional one.  

 

19               
As a preliminary matter, we conclude that this appeal is not premature. 
While it is true that the accused did not actually make an application for
records under Bill C-46, this does not deprive the Court of a sufficient basis
to decide the issues raised in the appeal.

 








20               
As noted above, this Court has previously addressed the issue of
disclosure of third party records in sexual assault proceedings: see O’Connor,
supra.  However, it is important to keep in mind that the decision in O’Connor
is not necessarily the last word on the subject.  The law develops through
dialogue between courts and legislatures: see Vriend v. Alberta, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 493.  Against the backdrop of O’Connor, Parliament was free to
craft its own solution to the problem consistent with the Charter .

 

21               
As this Court’s decision in Dagenais, supra, makes clear, Charter 
rights must be examined in a contextual manner to resolve conflicts between
them.  Therefore, unlike s. 1  balancing, where societal interests are sometimes
allowed to override Charter  rights, under s. 7  rights must be defined so
that they do not conflict with each other.  The rights of full answer and
defence, and privacy, must be defined in light of each other, and both must be
defined in light of the equality provisions of s. 15 .

 

22               
Turning to the legislation at issue in this appeal, we find it
constitutional.  It is undisputed that there are several important respects in
which Bill C-46 differs from the regime set out in O’Connor.  However,
these differences are not fatal because Bill C-46 provides sufficient
protection for all relevant Charter  rights.  There are, admittedly,
several provisions in the Bill that are subject to differing interpretations. 
However, in such situations we will interpret the legislation in a
constitutional manner where possible: see Slaight Communications Inc. v.
Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1078.  By so doing, we conclude that
Bill C-46 is a constitutional response to the problem of production of records
of complainants or witnesses in sexual assault proceedings.

 

III.  Proceedings and Judgments in the Court Below

 

23               
The appellant L.C. is the complainant in a criminal proceeding in which
the respondent, Brian Mills, has been charged with one count of sexual assault
and one count of unlawful sexual touching. The offences are alleged to have
occurred on July 12, 1995, when the appellant L.C. was 13 years of age.

 








24               
The respondent elected to waive his right to a preliminary inquiry. On
the scheduled day of the trial, October 4, 1996, the Crown provided the
respondent with a second statement of the appellant L.C., dated September 29,
1996. Mr. Justice Jones adjourned the trial until January 28, 1997. On January
27, 1997, counsel for the respondent brought an application to have a new
preliminary inquiry, arguing that the original preliminary inquiry was waived
on the basis of the original witness statement, dated July 12, 1995, which
disclosed information alleged to be less substantial and serious than that
provided in the second statement. Counsel for the respondent also sought full
disclosure of all therapeutic records and notes relating to the appellant that
were in the possession of a counselling organization known as “Changes”. 

 

25               
In dismissing the application for a new preliminary inquiry, Belzil J.
held that the trial could not proceed until the application for production of
third party records was dealt with.  On the basis of O’Connor, he
ordered that portions of various records be produced.

 

26               
On May 14, 1997, counsel for the respondent sought the production of
records relating to the appellant held by a psychiatrist, Dr. Drew Bremness,
and the Child and Adolescent Services Association. On May 16, 1997, Belzil J.
advised the parties that on May 12, 1997, Bill C-46 was proclaimed into force
and amended the Criminal Code  to include ss. 278.1  to 278.91 .  On May
26, 1997, counsel for the respondent forwarded correspondence to both Alberta
Justice and the Federal Department of Justice advising that he intended to
argue that the new amendments violated ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
Belzil J. held that the respondent could proceed with his constitutional
challenge without first making an application for third party records under the
new provisions, and granted full standing to intervene in respect of the
constitutional challenge to both the Attorney General of Canada and the
appellant L.C. 

 








27               
On September 18, 1997, Belzil J. concluded that the new Criminal Code 
provisions infringed ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  ((1997), 56
Alta. L.R. (3d) 277 (Q.B.)).  Belzil J. first dealt with the argument that the
respondent’s application was premature since the accused had not been denied
access to any records pursuant to the new provisions. He stated, at para. 12 of
his reasons: “it would be grossly unfair to an accused to force an accused to
make an application pursuant to legislation which according to the accused is
unconstitutional”. Furthermore, given that the respondent is not allowed
unfettered access to the records, he could never know whether his access under
the new provisions would differ from that under the O’Connor procedure. 
Accordingly, Belzil J. held that the respondent had the right to bring an
application at this time to determine the constitutionality of Bill C-46.

 

28               
After ruling that the application was not premature, Belzil J. dealt
with the constitutional claims. He characterized Bill C-46 as Parliament’s
reaction to the majority decision in O’Connor.  He held that, if
propositions of law not accepted by the majority in O’Connor are found
within Bill C-46, that should be a relevant consideration in determining the
constitutional validity of the legislation.  Moreover, if Bill C-46 materially
alters the balance between privacy rights and the rights of an accused to a
fair trial as enunciated by the majority in O’Connor, this in and of
itself gives rise to an argument that Bill C-46 is constitutionally invalid. In
his view, there are five broad differences between Bill C-46 and O'Connor:

 

(1)        The broad definition of records in Bill
C-46 forces an accused to proceed with an application under the new Bill for each
type of record, each of which must be supported by affidavits.

 








(2)        Notwithstanding that in O’Connor
this Court specifically rejected the idea that therapeutic records will rarely
be relevant, Bill C-46 restricts the type of evidence that an accused may place
before a judge in support of an application for production of records by
imposing a higher initial threshold on an accused to show likely relevance,
compelling an accused to rely on the veracity of a complainant to determine on
a preliminary inquiry whether such records exist.

 

(3)        Section 278.5(2) requires the trial
judge to engage in a balancing exercise before examining the records in
question, requiring the trial judge to weigh important rights in a vacuum, and
exacerbating the Catch-22 situation identified in O’Connor. 

 

(4)        Section 278.5(2) compels the trial judge
to use factors specifically rejected by a majority of the Supreme Court of
Canada, namely factors  (f), (g), and (h).  

 

(5)        Bill C-46 restricts the ability of the
Crown to produce relevant records, weakening the Crown’s obligations under R.
v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.

 

29               
Belzil J. concluded that these differences sacrificed the balance of
rights achieved by this Court in O’Connor by creating a presumption
against disclosure and ranking privacy rights above the rights of an accused to
a fair trial. Therefore, he held that Bill C-46 infringed the accused's rights
under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 








30               
In a separate judgment delivered on October 31, 1997, Belzil J. ruled
that Bill C-46 was not saved by s. 1 of the Charter  ((1997), 56 Alta.
L.R. (3d) 301 (Q.B.)).  None of the testimony justified exclusion of
therapeutic records on the basis of detrimental impacts, and the records might 
contain highly probative evidence. Belzil J. stated that no authority had been
cited before him wherein this Court had ever sanctioned the use of s. 1  for a
breach of the fundamental right to a fair trial. In his view, almost by
definition an impairment of a fundamental right can never be demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society.  Belzil J. held that Bill C-46 is
not a proportional response and does not constitute a minimal impairment of
rights, but rather constitutes a substantial impairment of the fundamental
right to a fair trial.  He concluded that Bill C-46 could not be saved by s. 1 
and should be struck down in its entirety.  

 

31               
Leave to appeal was granted to the appellant L.C. by this Court. As our
jurisprudence has established, a third party may challenge an interlocutory
court order, issued by a superior court judge in criminal proceedings, by
seeking leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 40  of the Supreme Court
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .  See A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.), [1995] 4
S.C.R. 536; Dagenais, supra.

Bill C-46

 

An Act to amend the Criminal Code  (production of records in sexual
offence proceedings)

 

WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada continues to be
gravely concerned about the incidence of sexual violence and abuse in Canadian
society and, in particular, the prevalence of sexual violence against women and
children;

 

WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes that
violence has a particularly disadvantageous impact on the equal participation
of women and children in society and on the rights of women and children to
security of the person, privacy and equal benefit of the law as guaranteed by
sections 7 , 8 , 15  and 28  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ;

 

WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada intends to promote
and help to ensure the full protection of the rights guaranteed by the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  for all, including those who are accused of,
and those who are or may be victims of, sexual violence or abuse;

 

WHEREAS the rights guaranteed by the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  are guaranteed equally to all and, in the
event of a conflict, those rights are to be accommodated and reconciled to the
greatest extent possible;

 

WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada wishes to encourage
the reporting of incidents of sexual violence and abuse and to provide for the
prosecution of offences within a framework of laws that are consistent with the
principles of fundamental justice and that are fair to complainants as well as
to accused persons;

 

WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes that the
compelled production of personal information may deter complainants of sexual
offences from reporting the offence to the police and may deter complainants
from seeking necessary treatment, counselling or advice;

 

WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes that the
work of those who provide services and assistance to complainants of sexual
offences is detrimentally affected by the compelled production of records and
by the process to compel that production;

 








AND WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes
that, while production to the court and to the accused of personal information
regarding any person may be necessary in order for an accused to make a full
answer and defence, that production may breach the person’s right to privacy
and equality and therefore the determination as to whether to order production
should be subject to careful scrutiny;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

 

1. The Criminal Code  is amended by adding
the following after section 278 :

 

278.1 For the purposes of sections 278.2  to
278.9 , ""record"" means any form of record that contains personal
information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and
includes, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, medical,
psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education, employment, child welfare,
adoption and social services records, personal journals and diaries, and
records containing personal information the production or disclosure of which
is protected by any other Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature, but
does not include records made by persons responsible for the investigation or
prosecution of the offence.

 

278.2 (1) No record relating to a complainant
or a witness shall be produced to an accused in any proceedings in respect of

 

 

(a) an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 155, 159, 160, 170,
171, 172, 173, 210, 211, 212, 213, 271, 272 or 273,

 

(b) an offence under section 144 , 145 , 149 , 156 , 245  or 246  of
the Criminal Code , chapter C‑34 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1970, as it read immediately before January 4, 1983, or

 

(c) an offence under section 146 , 151 , 153 , 155 , 157 , 166  or 167 
of the Criminal Code , chapter C‑34 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1970, as it read immediately before January 1, 1988,

 

or in any proceedings in respect of two or more offences that include
an offence referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (c), except in
accordance with sections 278.3 to 278.91.

 

(2) Section 278.1, this section and sections 278.3 to 278.91 apply
where a record is in the possession or control of any person, including the
prosecutor in the proceedings, unless, in the case of a record in the
possession or control of the prosecutor, the complainant or witness to whom the
record relates has expressly waived the application of those sections.

 

(3) In the case of a record in respect of which this section applies
that is in the possession or control of the prosecutor, the prosecutor shall
notify the accused that the record is in the prosecutor's possession but, in
doing so, the prosecutor shall not disclose the record's contents.

 








278.3 (1) An accused who seeks production of
a record referred to in subsection 278.2(1) must make an application to the
judge before whom the accused is to be, or is being, tried.

 

(2) For greater certainty, an application under
subsection (1) may not be made to a judge or justice presiding at any other
proceedings, including a preliminary inquiry.

 

(3) An application must be made in writing and set
out

 

(a) particulars identifying the record that the accused seeks to
have produced and the name of the person who has possession or control of the
record; and

 

(b) the grounds on which the accused relies to establish that
the record is likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a
witness to testify.

 

(4) Any one or more of the following assertions by
the accused are not sufficient on their own to establish that the record is
likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to
testify:

 

(a) that the record exists;

 

(b) that the record relates to medical or psychiatric treatment,
therapy or counselling that the complainant or witness has received or is
receiving;

 

(c) that the record relates to the incident that is the subject‑matter
of the proceedings;

 

(d) that the record may disclose a prior inconsistent statement
of the complainant or witness;

 

(e) that the record may relate to the credibility of the
complainant or witness;

 

(f) that the record may relate to the reliability of the testimony
of the complainant or witness merely because the complainant or witness has
received or is receiving psychiatric treatment, therapy or counselling;

 

(g) that the record may reveal allegations of sexual abuse of
the complainant by a person other than the accused;

 

(h) that the record relates to the sexual activity of the
complainant with any person, including the accused;

 

(i) that the record relates to the presence or absence of a
recent complaint;

 

(j) that the record relates to the complainant's sexual
reputation; or

 

(k) that the record was made close in time to a complaint or to
the activity that forms the subject‑matter of the charge against the
accused.

 








(5) The accused shall serve the application on the
prosecutor, on the person who has possession or control of the record, on the
complainant or witness, as the case may be, and on any other person to whom, to
the knowledge of the accused, the record relates, at least seven days before the
hearing referred to in subsection 278.4(1) or any shorter interval that the
judge may allow in the interests of justice. The accused shall also serve a
subpoena issued under Part XXII in Form 16.1 on the person who has possession
or control of the record at the same time as the application is served.

 

(6) The judge may at any time order that the
application be served on any person to whom the judge considers the record may
relate.

 

278.4 (1) The judge shall hold a hearing in
camera to determine whether to order the person who has possession or
control of the record to produce it to the court for review by the judge.

 

(2) The person who has possession or control of the
record, the complainant or witness, as the case may be, and any other person to
whom the record relates may appear and make submissions at the hearing, but
they are not compellable as witnesses at the hearing.

 

(3) No order for costs may be made against a person
referred to in subsection (2) in respect of their participation in the hearing.

 

278.5 (1) The judge may order the person who
has possession or control of the record to produce the record or part of the
record to the court for review by the judge if, after the hearing referred to
in subsection 278.4(1), the judge is satisfied that

 

(a) the application was made in accordance with subsections
278.3(2) to (6);

 

(b) the accused has established that the record is likely
relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify; and

 

(c) the production of the record is necessary in the interests
of justice.

 

(2) In determining whether to order the production
of the record or part of the record for review pursuant to subsection (1), the
judge shall consider the salutary and deleterious effects of the determination
on the accused's right to make a full answer and defence and on the right to
privacy and equality of the complainant or witness, as the case may be, and any
other person to whom the record relates. In particular, the judge shall take
the following factors into account:

 

(a) the extent to which the record is necessary for the accused
to make a full answer and defence;

 

(b) the probative value of the record;

 

(c) the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of
privacy with respect to the record;

 








(d) whether production of the record is based on a
discriminatory belief or bias;

 

(e) the potential prejudice to the personal dignity and right to
privacy of any person to whom the record relates;

 

(f) society's interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual
offences;

 

(g) society's interest in encouraging the obtaining of treatment
by complainants of sexual offences; and

 

(h) the effect of the determination on the integrity of the
trial process.

 

278.6 (1) Where the judge has ordered the
production of the record or part of the record for review, the judge shall
review it in the absence of the parties in order to determine whether the
record or part of the record should be produced to the accused.

 

(2) The judge may hold a hearing in camera if
the judge considers that it will assist in making the determination.

 

(3) Subsections 278.4(2) and (3) apply in the case
of a hearing under subsection (2).

 

278.7 (1) Where the judge is satisfied that
the record or part of the record is likely relevant to an issue at trial or to
the competence of a witness to testify and its production is necessary in the
interests of justice, the judge may order that the record or part of the record
that is likely relevant be produced to the accused, subject to any conditions
that may be imposed pursuant to subsection (3).

 

(2) In determining whether to order the production
of the record or part of the record to the accused, the judge shall consider
the salutary and deleterious effects of the determination on the accused's
right to make a full answer and defence and on the right to privacy and
equality of the complainant or witness, as the case may be, and any other
person to whom the record relates and, in particular, shall take the factors
specified in paragraphs 278.5(2)(a) to (h) into account.

 

(3) Where the judge orders the production of the
record or part of the record to the accused, the judge may impose conditions on
the production to protect the interests of justice and, to the greatest extent
possible, the privacy and equality interests of the complainant or witness, as
the case may be, and any other person to whom the record relates, including,
for example, the following conditions:

 

(a) that the record be edited as directed by the judge;

 

(b) that a copy of the record, rather than the original, be
produced;

 

(c) that the accused and counsel for the accused not disclose
the contents of the record to any other person, except with the approval of the
court;

 

(d) that the record be viewed only at the offices of the court;








(e) that no copies of the record be made or that restrictions be
imposed on the number of copies of the record that may be made; and

 

(f) that information regarding any person named in the record,
such as their address, telephone number and place of employment, be severed
from the record.

 

(4) Where the judge orders the production of the
record or part of the record to the accused, the judge shall direct that a copy
of the record or part of the record be provided to the prosecutor, unless the
judge determines that it is not in the interests of justice to do so.

 

(5) The record or part of the record that is
produced to the accused pursuant to an order under subsection (1) shall not be
used in any other proceedings.

 

(6) Where the judge refuses to order the production
of the record or part of the record to the accused, the record or part of the
record shall, unless a court orders otherwise, be kept in a sealed package by
the court until the later of the expiration of the time for any appeal and the
completion of any appeal in the proceedings against the accused, whereupon the
record or part of the record shall be returned to the person lawfully entitled
to possession or control of it.

 

278.8 (1) The judge shall provide reasons for
ordering or refusing to order the production of the record or part of the
record pursuant to subsection 278.5(1)  or 278.7(1) .

 

(2) The reasons referred to in subsection (1) shall
be entered in the record of the proceedings or, where the proceedings are not
recorded, shall be provided in writing.

 

278.9 (1) No person shall publish in a
newspaper, as defined in section 297, or in a broadcast, any of the following:

 

(a) the contents of an application made under section 278.3;

 

(b) any evidence taken, information given or submissions made at
a hearing under subsection 278.4(1) or 278.6(2); or

 

(c) the determination of the judge pursuant to subsection
278.5(1)  or 278.7(1)  and the reasons provided pursuant to section 278.8, unless
the judge, after taking into account the interests of justice and the right to
privacy of the person to whom the record relates, orders that the determination
may be published.

 

(2) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

278.91 For the purposes of sections 675 and
676, a determination to make or refuse to make an order pursuant to subsection
278.5(1)  or 278.7(1)  is deemed to be a question of law.

 








V. Issues

 

33               
On June 11, 1998, the Chief Justice stated the following constitutional
questions:

 

1.         Do ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringe s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.         If so, is the infringement demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society?

 

3.         Do ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringe s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

4.         If so, is the infringement demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society?

 

A further
issue is whether this constitutional challenge has been brought prematurely.

 

VI. Analysis

 

A.  Introduction

 

34               
We have chosen to address the issues raised by this appeal in the
following manner. First, we will outline why this constitutional challenge is
not premature. Second, we will discuss the relevant background considerations
such as the relationship between the courts and Parliament in light of this
Court’s decision in O’Connor, supra, and the definition of the
constitutional rights at stake in this appeal. Third, with this background and
context, we will consider the constitutionality of the impugned provisions.

 

B.  Prematurity

 








35               
The appellant the Attorney General for Alberta (“Alberta”) submitted
that Belzil J.’s  finding of constitutional invalidity was premature and lacked
an adequate factual foundation. Alberta argued that as no application for
records had been made by the respondent under the new provisions, it is unclear
what records, if any, would be denied to the respondent. Several lower courts
have endorsed this reasoning. For example, see R. v. Weeseekase (1997),
161 Sask. R. 264 (Q.B.); R. v. G.C.B., [1997] O.J. No. 5019 (QL) (Gen.
Div.); R. v. Fiddler, [1998] O.J. No. 5819 (QL) (Prov. Div.); R.
v. D.H.C. (1998), 163 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 116 (Nfld. S.C.T.D.); R. v.
O'Neill (1998), 172 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 136 (Nfld. S.C.T.D.); R. v.
E.M.F., [1997] O.J. No. 4828 (QL) (Gen. Div.).  However, other courts have
adopted Belzil J.’s reasoning in the court below: see, e.g.,  R. v. Lee
(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 594 (Gen. Div.); R. v. E.H., [1998] O.J. No. 4515
(QL) (Gen. Div.);  R. v. G.J.A., [1997] O.J. No. 5354 (QL) (Gen. Div.).

 

36               
The mere fact that it is not clear whether the respondent will in fact
be denied access to records potentially necessary for full answer and defence
does not make the claim premature. The respondent need not prove that the
impugned legislation would probably violate his right to make full
answer and defence. Establishing that the legislation is unconstitutional in
its general effects would suffice, as s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 ,
declares a law to be of no force or effect to the extent that it is
inconsistent with the Constitution.  

 








37               
However, accepting that the respondent may challenge the general
constitutionality of the impugned legislation does not answer the question of
whether the respondent must first apply for, and be denied, the production of
third party records before bringing a constitutional challenge. The question to
answer is whether the appeal record provides sufficient facts to permit the
Court to adjudicate properly the issues raised.  As Sopinka J. stated for the
Court in R. v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at p. 955, when discussing
the general rule that constitutional challenges should be disposed of at the
end of a case: “An apparently meritorious Charter  challenge of the law
under which the accused is charged which is not dependent on facts to be
elicited during the trial may come within this exception to the general rule”
(emphasis added).

 

38               
This Court has often stressed the importance of a factual basis in Charter 
cases. See, for example,  MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at p.
361; R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, at pp. 762
and 767-68, per Dickson C.J.; Rio Hotel Ltd. v. New Brunswick (Liquor
Licensing Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 59, at p. 83; Danson v. Ontario
(Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086, at p. 1099; Baron v. Canada,
[1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at p. 452; DeSousa, supra, at p. 954; Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.  v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R.
480, at para. 15. These facts have been broken into two categories: legislative
and adjudicative.  In Danson, supra, at p. 1099, Sopinka J., for
the Court, outlined these categories as follows:

 

These terms derive from Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1958),
vol. 2, para. 15.03, p. 353. (See also Morgan, ""Proof of Facts in Charter 
Litigation"", in Sharpe, ed., Charter Litigation (1987).)
Adjudicative facts are those that concern the immediate parties: in Davis'
words, ""who did what, where, when, how, and with what motive or intent
...."" Such facts are specific, and must be proved by admissible evidence.
Legislative facts are those that establish the purpose and background of
legislation, including its social, economic and cultural context. Such facts
are of a more general nature, and are subject to less stringent admissibility
requirements: see e.g., Re Anti-Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, per
Laskin C.J., at p. 391; Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1
S.C.R. 714, per Dickson J. (as he then was), at p. 723; and Reference
re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297, per
McIntyre J., at p. 318.

 

 

39               
The argument that the present appeal is premature rests on the
contention that there are few adjudicative facts before the Court. Two points
may be made in response.

 








40               
First, it is not clear what further adjudicative facts would arise if
the respondent had gone through the impugned procedure and been refused
production. Although, pursuant to s. 278.8(1)  of the Criminal Code ,  the
trial judge must provide reasons for refusing to order production of any
record, or part of any record, presumably these reasons could not divulge much
about the content of the records in question for that would defeat the very
purpose of the new provisions.

 

41                           
Second, the record contains sufficient facts to resolve the issues posed
by the present appeal. Indeed, no argument was made that the adjudicative
facts, sparse as they may be, are insufficient.  Moreover, a determination that
the legislation at issue in this appeal is unconstitutional in its general
effect involves an assessment of the effects of the legislation under
reasonable hypothetical circumstances.  In R. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R.
485, Gonthier J. stated, for the majority, at pp. 515-16:

 

It is true that this Court has been vigilant, wherever possible, to
ensure that a proper factual foundation exists before measuring legislation
against the Charter  (Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1990]
2 S.C.R. 1086, at p. 1099, and MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357,
at pp. 361-62). Yet it has been noted above that s. 12  jurisprudence does not
contemplate a standard of review in which that kind of factual foundation is
available in every instance. The applicable standard must focus on
imaginable circumstances which could commonly arise in day-to-day life.
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

 

Likewise,
given the nature of the statutory framework, where the accused and the Court
remain unaware of the contents of the records sought, many of the arguments by
necessity focus upon such “imaginable circumstances”. 

 

42                           
Given these considerations, we are satisfied that there is an
appropriate factual basis in this case and that the application is therefore
not premature.

 








C.  Background
Considerations

 

(1)  The O’Connor Regime and Bill C-46

 

43                           
The respondent in this appeal and several interveners argued that the
provisions of Bill C-46 are unconstitutional to the extent that they are
inconsistent with the reasons of the majority of this Court in O’Connor,
supra.  Belzil J., for the court below, similarly held that Bill C-46 is
unconstitutional because it alters the constitutional balance achieved in O’Connor.  
Before addressing these arguments, we will briefly review the production
regimes at issue.

 

(a)  The O’Connor Regime

 

44                           
This Court’s decision in O’Connor concerned the common law
procedure to be followed by an accused seeking production of therapeutic
records in the hands of third parties.  As a preliminary matter, Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka J., for the majority on the issue of production, also discussed the issue
of disclosure of therapeutic records in the hands of the Crown. In their
opinion, the Crown’s obligation to disclose records in its possession or
control, as established in  Stinchcombe, supra, is unaltered by
the confidential nature of therapeutic records where the records have been
shared with the Crown or “confidentiality has been waived for the purpose of
proceeding against the accused” (para. 9).  Even if privileged, these records
must be disclosed to the accused where “clearly relevant and important to the
ability of the accused to raise a defence” (para. 11).

 








45                           
In the context of ordering production of records that are in the hands
of third parties, Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. outlined a two-stage process.  At
the first stage, the issue is whether the document sought by the accused ought
to be produced to the judge; at the second stage, the trial judge must balance
the competing interests to decide whether to order production to the accused. 
At the first stage, the onus is on the accused to establish that the
information in question is “likely to be relevant” (para. 19 (emphasis
in original)).  Unlike in the Crown disclosure context, where relevance is
understood to mean “may be useful to the defence”, the threshold of likely
relevance in this context requires that the presiding judge be satisfied
“that there is a reasonable possibility that the information is logically
probative to an issue at trial or the competence of a witness to testify”
(para. 22 (emphasis in original)). This shift in onus and the higher threshold,
as compared to when records are in the possession of the Crown, was
necessitated by the fact that the information in question is not part of the
state’s “case to meet”, the state has not been given access to it, and third parties
are under no obligation to assist the defence.

 

46                           
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. held that the threshold of likely relevance at
this first stage is not a significant or onerous burden.  It is meant to
prevent requests for production that are “speculative, fanciful, disruptive,
unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming” (para. 24). Although Lamer C.J.
and Sopinka J. disagreed with L’Heureux-Dubé J. that therapeutic records are
rarely relevant to the accused, they declined to set out “categories of relevance”
(para. 27).

 

47                           
If the first stage is passed, the record is disclosed to the court and
the application for production moves onto the second stage where the judge
determines whether the record should be produced to the accused.  At this
second stage, Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. require the trial judge to balance the
competing interests in order to determine whether a non-production order would
be a reasonable limit on the accused’s ability to make full answer and
defence.  They list a series of factors that trial judges should consider in
making this determination (at para. 31):

 








(1) the extent to which the record is necessary for the accused to make
full answer and defence; (2) the probative value of the record in question; (3)
the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy vested in that
record; (4) whether production of the record would be premised upon any
discriminatory belief or bias; and (5) the potential prejudice to the
complainant’s dignity, privacy or security of the person that would be
occasioned by production of the record in question.

 

Although
L’Heureux-Dubé J., for the minority on this issue, outlined the same five
factors as the majority, she also included two additional factors: the
integrity of the trial process and the societal interest in reporting sexual
crimes. Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. held that the former is better dealt with
when determining admissibility of the evidence and that the latter, while a
relevant factor, was “not a paramount consideration” as there are many other
avenues open to the trial judge to protect this interest than declining production
(at paras. 32 and 33).

 

(b)  Bill C-46

 

48                           
On May 12, 1997, approximately 17 months after this Court released its
decision in O’Connor, Bill C-46 came into force.  Bill C-46 sets out a
process to govern the production of the private records of complainants and
witnesses in sexual assault trials in place of the common law regime this Court
established in O’Connor.  The preamble to the Bill indicates that
Parliament was concerned about the incidence of sexual violence and abuse in
Canadian society, its prevalence against women and children, and its
“particularly disadvantageous impact on the equal participation of women and
children in society and on the rights of women and children to security of the
person, privacy and equal benefit of the law as guaranteed by sections 7, 8, 15
and 28 of the [Charter ]”.  The preamble expressly declares that
Parliament seeks to provide a framework of laws that are fair to and protect
the rights of both accused persons and complainants.

 








49                           
While the Bill retains the two-stage structure set out in O’Connor,
there are significant differences between the two regimes.  Many of these are
uncontentious.  In the following overview of the Bill, we expound on only the
provisions brought under review in this appeal.

 

50                           
Bill C-46 begins by defining the records to which it applies: “any form
of record that contains personal information for which there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy”, excluding investigatory or prosecutorial records: s.
278.1. It goes on to define the types of offences that will trigger its
application: s. 278.2(1).  Generally, these are sexual assault and similar
sexual offences.  Section 278.2(1) states that an accused person charged with
these offences cannot obtain the records relating to complainants or witnesses
covered by s. 278.1, except in accordance with the process set out by the Bill.

 

51                           
A third preliminary section, s. 278.2(2) , states that the Bill applies
to records in the possession or control of any person, including the Crown
prosecutor, unless the complainant or witness “has expressly waived the
application of [the Bill]”.  Absent waiver, documents in the possession of the
prosecution are treated in the same manner as documents in the hands of a
private individual or organization and therefore  are subject to disclosure
pursuant to the Bill’s procedures.  

 

52                           
Yet another preliminary provision sets out “assertions” that are “not
sufficient on their own” on an application for production to establish that a
record is “likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a
witness to testify”: s. 278.3(4) .  

 








53                           
This brings us to the heart of the Bill – the process established to
govern the production of private records to an accused person in sexual offence
proceedings.  Like O’Connor, Parliament has set up a two-stage process:
(1) disclosure to the judge; and (2) production to the accused.  At the first
stage, the accused must establish that the record sought is “likely relevant to
an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify” and that “the
production of the record is necessary in the interests of justice” (s.
278.5(1) ).  Bill C-46 diverges from O’Connor by directing the trial
judge to consider the salutary and deleterious effects of production to the
court on the accused’s right to full answer and defence and the complainant’s
or witness’s right to privacy and equality.  A series of factors is listed that
the trial judge is directed to take into account in deciding whether the document
should be produced to the court (s. 278.5(2)):

 

(a) the extent to which the record is necessary for the accused
to make a full answer and defence; 

 

(b) the probative value of the record; 

 

(c) the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of
privacy with respect to the record;

 

(d) whether production of the record is based on a
discriminatory belief or bias; 

 

(e) the potential prejudice to the personal dignity and right to
privacy of any person to whom the record relates; 

 

(f) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual
offences; 

 

(g) society’s interest in encouraging the obtaining of treatment
by complainants of sexual offences; and 

 

(h) the effect of the determination on the integrity of the
trial process.  

 

 








54                           
If the requirements of this first stage are met, the record will be
ordered produced to the trial judge.  At the second stage, the judge looks at
the record in the absence of the parties (s. 278.6(1)), holds a hearing if
necessary (s. 278.6(2)), and determines whether the record should be produced
on the basis that it is “likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence
of a witness to testify” and that its production is “necessary in the interests
of justice” (s. 278.7).  Again at this stage, the judge must consider the
salutary and deleterious effects on the accused’s right to make full answer and
defence and on the right to privacy and equality of the complainant or witness,
and is directed to “take into account” the factors set out at s. 278.5(2): s.
278.7(2). When ordering production, the judge may impose conditions on
production: s. 278.7(3).

 

55                           
The respondent and several supporting interveners argue that Bill C-46
is unconstitutional to the extent that it establishes a regime for production
that differs from or is inconsistent with that established by the majority in O’Connor. 
However, it does not follow from the fact that a law passed by Parliament
differs from a regime envisaged by the Court in the absence of a statutory
scheme, that Parliament’s law is unconstitutional.  Parliament may build on the
Court’s decision, and develop a different scheme as long as it remains
constitutional.  Just as Parliament must respect the Court’s rulings, so the
Court must respect Parliament’s determination that the judicial scheme can be
improved.  To insist on slavish conformity would belie the mutual respect that
underpins the relationship between the courts and legislature that is so
essential to our constitutional democracy: Vriend, supra.  We
turn now to a brief discussion of that relationship.

 

(2)  Relationship Between the Courts and the Legislature Generally

 

56                           
A posture of respect towards Parliament was endorsed by this Court in Slaight
Communications, supra, at p. 1078, where we held that if legislation
is amenable to two interpretations, a court should choose the interpretation
that upholds the legislation as constitutional. Thus courts must presume that
Parliament intended to enact constitutional legislation and strive, where
possible, to give effect to this intention.

 








57                           
This Court has also discussed the relationship between the courts and
the legislature in terms of a dialogue, and emphasized its importance to the
democratic process.  In Vriend, supra, at para. 139, Iacobucci J.
stated:

 

To my mind, a great value of judicial review and
this dialogue among the branches is that each of the branches is made somewhat
accountable to the other. The work of the legislature is reviewed by the courts
and the work of the court in its decisions can be reacted to by the legislature
in the passing of new legislation (or even overarching laws under s. 33  of the Charter ).
This dialogue between and accountability of each of the branches have the
effect of enhancing the democratic process, not denying it.

 

 

 

See also P. W.
Hogg and A. A. Bushell, “The Charter  Dialogue Between Courts and
Legislatures” (1997), 35 Osgoode Hall L.J. 75. If the common law were to
be taken as establishing the only possible constitutional regime, then we could
not speak of a dialogue with the legislature. Such a situation could only
undermine rather than enhance democracy. Legislative change and the development
of the common law are different. As this Court noted in R. v. Salituro,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at p. 666, the common law changes incrementally, “while
complex changes to the law with uncertain ramifications should be left to the
legislature”.  While this dialogue obviously is of a somewhat different nature
when the common law rule involves interpretation of the Charter , as in O’Connor,
it remains a dialogue nonetheless.

 








58                           
Moreover, in this Court’s recent decision Reference re Secession of
Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217,  we affirmed the proposition that
constitutionalism can facilitate democracy rather than undermine it, and that
one way in which it does this is by ensuring that fundamental human rights and
individual freedoms are given due regard and protection (at paras. 74-78).
Courts do not hold a monopoly on the protection and promotion of rights and
freedoms; Parliament also plays a role in this regard and is often able to act
as a significant ally for vulnerable groups. This is especially important to
recognize in the context of sexual violence. The history of the treatment of
sexual assault complainants by our society and our legal system is an
unfortunate one. Important change has occurred through legislation aimed at
both recognizing the rights and interests of complainants in criminal
proceedings, and debunking the stereotypes that have been so damaging to women
and children, but the treatment of sexual assault complainants remains an
ongoing problem. If constitutional democracy is meant to ensure that due regard
is given to the voices of those vulnerable to being overlooked by the majority,
then this court has an obligation to consider respectfully Parliament’s attempt
to respond to such voices.

 








59                           
Parliament has enacted this legislation after a long consultation
process that included a consideration of the constitutional standards outlined
by this Court in O’Connor. While it is the role of the courts to specify
such standards, there may be a range of permissible regimes that can meet these
standards. It goes without saying that this range is not confined to the
specific rule adopted by the Court pursuant to its competence in the common
law. In the present case, Parliament decided  that legislation was necessary in
order to address the issue of third party records more comprehensively. As is
evident from the language of the preamble to Bill C-46, Parliament also sought
to recognize the prevalence of sexual violence against women and children and
its disadvantageous impact on their rights, to encourage the reporting of
incidents of sexual violence, to recognize the impact of the production of
personal information on the efficacy of treatment, and to reconcile fairness to
complainants with the rights of the accused. Many of these concerns involve
policy decisions regarding criminal procedure and its relationship to the
community at large. Parliament may also be understood to be recognizing
“horizontal” equality concerns, where women’s inequality results from the acts
of other individuals and groups rather than the state, but which nonetheless
may have many consequences for the criminal justice system. It is perfectly
reasonable that these many concerns may lead to a procedure that is different
from the common law position but that  nonetheless meets the required
constitutional standards.

 

60                           
We cannot presume that the legislation is unconstitutional simply
because it is different from the common law position. The question before us is
not whether Parliament can amend the common law; it clearly can. The question
before us is whether in doing so Parliament has nonetheless outlined a
constitutionally acceptable procedure for the production of private records of
complainants in sexual assault trials.  This question is considered at length
below, following the discussion of the constitutional rights at stake in this
appeal.  

 

(3)  Tensions Among Full Answer and Defence, Privacy, and Equality

 

 

(a)  Balancing Interests and Defining Rights

 

61                           
At play in this appeal are three principles, which find their
support in specific provisions of the Charter .  These are full answer
and defence, privacy, and equality. No single principle is absolute and capable
of trumping the others; all must be defined in light of competing claims. As
Lamer C.J. stated in Dagenais, supra, at p. 877: “When the
protected rights of two individuals come into conflict . . . Charter 
principles require a balance to be achieved that fully respects the importance
of both sets of rights.”  This illustrates the importance of
interpreting rights in a contextual manner -- not because they are of
intermittent importance but because they often inform, and are informed by,
other similarly deserving rights or values at play in particular circumstances.

 








62                           
The respondent’s right to liberty under s. 7  of the Charter  is
engaged because he faces the possibility of imprisonment.  The question
therefore becomes whether the procedure outlined in ss. 278.1  to 278.91  of the Criminal
Code  violates the principles of fundamental justice.  To answer this we
must determine what the relevant rights are. First of all, the denial of the
accused’s ability to make full answer and defence implicates s. 7 .  An
unreasonable search and seizure of a complainant’s records, however, violates
the complainant’s right to privacy protected under s. 8 .  As this Court made
clear in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 502, both
of these rights are instances of the “principles of fundamental justice”
enshrined in s. 7 .  Insofar as the rights at stake all fall within ss. 7  to 14 ,
the “principles of fundamental justice” provide a useful context for defining
these rights in light of each other.

 

63                           
Considered in the abstract, these principles of fundamental justice may
seem to conflict.  The conflict is resolved by considering conflicting rights
in the factual context of each particular case.  Therefore, we do not say that
a complainant’s right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure may be
justifiably infringed by the accused’s right to make full answer and defence or
vice versa.  Rather, part of what defines both a reasonable search or seizure
and full answer and defence is a full appreciation of these principles of
fundamental justice as they operate within a particular context.

 

64                           
Moreover, a full interpretation and discussion of these principles will
implicate other Charter  rights such as equality and security of the
person.  When the rights involved are outside of ss. 7  to 14 , resort to the
principles of fundamental justice will of course not be sufficient to resolve
the question.  However, it will not change   the analysis.  Whether or not all
the rights involved are “principles of fundamental justice”, Charter 
rights must always be defined contextually.

 








65                           
It is also important to distinguish between balancing the principles of
fundamental justice under s. 7  and balancing interests under s. 1  of the Charter .
The s. 1  jurisprudence that has developed in this Court is in many respects
quite similar to the balancing process mandated by s. 7 . As McLachlin J. stated
for the Court in Cunningham v. Canada, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 143, at p. 152,
regarding the latter: “The . . . question is whether, from a substantive point
of view, the change in the law strikes the right balance between the accused’s
interests and the interests of society.” Much the same could be said regarding
the central question posed by s. 1 . 

 

66                           
However, there are several important differences between the balancing
exercises under ss. 1  and 7 . The most important difference is that the issue
under s. 7  is the delineation of the boundaries of the rights in question
whereas under s. 1  the question is whether the violation of these boundaries
may be justified. The different role played by ss. 1  and 7  also has important
implications regarding which party bears the burden of proof. If interests are
balanced under s. 7  then it is the rights claimant who bears the burden of
proving that the balance struck by the impugned legislation violates s. 7 .  If
interests are balanced under s. 1  then it is the state that bears the burden of
justifying the infringement of the Charter  rights.

 








67                           
Because of these differences, the nature of the issues and interests to
be balanced is not the same under the two sections. As Lamer J. (as he then
was) stated in  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at p. 503: “the
principles of fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets of our
legal system”.  In contrast, s. 1  is concerned with the values underlying a
free and democratic society, which are broader in nature. In R. v. Oakes,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, Dickson C.J. stated, at p. 136, that these values and
principles “embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the
human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a
wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in
social and political institutions which enhance the participation of
individuals and groups in society”.  In R. v.  Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
697, at p. 737, Dickson C.J. described such values and principles as “numerous,
covering the guarantees enumerated in the Charter  and more”.

 

68                           
Keeping these differences in mind, the first question to ask is how to define
full answer and defence, privacy, and equality in this context, and not how
they may be justifiably limited.  We therefore now turn to a more detailed
consideration of these rights and their animating principles.

 

(b)  Nature of the Charter Principles

 

(i)  Full Answer and Defence

 

69                           
It is well established that the ability of the accused to make full
answer and defence is a principle of fundamental justice protected by s. 7 : Dersch
v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505.  Full answer and
defence  is also linked to other principles of fundamental justice “such as the
presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial, and the principle against
self-incrimination”: R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262, per Cory,
Iacobucci and Bastarache JJ., at para. 98.  Many of these principles of
fundamental justice are informed by the legal rights outlined in ss. 8  to 14  of
the Charter :  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra; R. v.
CIP Inc., [1992] 1 S.C.R. 843.  Indeed, in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2
S.C.R. 577, at p. 603, the majority of this Court recognized that both s. 7  and
the guarantee of a right to a fair trial enshrined in s. 11 (d) are
“inextricably intertwined” and protect a right to full answer and defence.

 








70                           
Indeed, this Court recognized in Stinchcombe, supra, that
non-disclosure of relevant information by the Crown can seriously erode the
right to make full answer and defence and carries with it the very real threat
of convicting an innocent person.  Sopinka J. noted, at p. 336, that the Royal
Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr., Prosecution found that the Crown’s
failure to disclose prior inconsistent statements played a key role in the
miscarriage of justice that occurred in that case, prompting the Commissioners
to recommend that “anything less than complete disclosure by the Crown falls
short of decency and fair play” (see Royal Commission on the Donald
Marshall, Jr., Prosecution, vol. 1, Findings and Recommendations
(1989), at p. 238).

 

71                           
Our jurisprudence has recognized on several occasions “the danger of
placing the accused in a ‘Catch-22’ situation as a condition of making full
answer and defence”: O’Connor, supra, at para. 25; see also Dersch,
supra, at pp. 1513-14; R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at
pp. 1463-64; Carey v. Ontario, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 637; R. v. Durette,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 469.  This is an important consideration in the context of
records production as often the accused may be in the difficult position of
making submissions regarding the importance to full answer and defence of
records that he or she has not seen. Where the records are part of the case to
meet, this concern is particularly acute as such a situation very directly
implicates the accused’s ability to raise a doubt concerning his or her
innocence.  As the Court stated in R. v. Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281,
at para. 24, “[t]his Court has consistently affirmed that it is a fundamental
principle of justice, protected by the Charter , that the innocent must
not be convicted”.  Where the records to which the accused seeks access are not
part of the case to meet, however, privacy and equality considerations may
require that it be more difficult for accused persons to gain access to
therapeutic or other records.

 








72                           
That said, the principles of fundamental justice do not entitle the
accused to ""the most favourable procedures that could possibly be
imagined"": R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, per La Forest
J., at p. 362. This is because fundamental justice embraces more than the
rights of the accused. For example, this Court has held that an assessment of
the fairness of the trial process must be made “from the point of view of
fairness in the eyes of the community and the complainant” and not just the
accused: R. v. E. (A.W.), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 155, per Cory J., at p.
198.  In a similar vein, McLachlin J., in Seaboyer, supra, at p.
603, stated:

 

The principles of fundamental justice reflect a
spectrum of interests, from the rights of the accused to broader societal
concerns. Section 7  must be construed having regard to those interests and
“against the applicable principles and policies that have animated legislative
and judicial practice in the field” (Beare, [[1988] 2 S.C.R. 387], at
pp. 402-3 per La Forest J.). The ultimate question is whether the
legislation, viewed in a purposive way, conforms to the fundamental precepts
which underlie our system of justice.

 

 

 

She concluded,
at p. 606, that  “the avoidance of unprobative and misleading evidence, the
encouraging of reporting and the protection of the security and privacy of the
witnesses” conform to these fundamental precepts.

 

73                           
This spectrum of interests reflected in the principles of fundamental
justice highlights the need to avoid viewing any particular principle in
isolation from the others. As La Forest J. stated in R. v. Harrer,
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 14:

 

As in other
cases involving broad concepts like ""fairness"" and ""principles
of fundamental justice"", one is not engaged in absolute or immutable
requirements; these concepts vary with the context in which they are invoked;
see Lyons, at p. 361. Specifically here, one is engaged in a delicate
balancing to achieve a just accommodation between the interests of the
individual and those of the state in providing a fair and workable system of
justice; see my remarks in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, at p. 539. 








See also Cunningham,
supra, at p. 152. The ability to make full answer and defence, as a
principle of fundamental justice, must therefore be understood in light of
other principles of fundamental justice which may embrace interests and
perspectives beyond those of the accused.

 

74                           
One example is society’s interest in having the trial process arrive at
the truth. Accordingly, this Court has held that full answer and defence does
not entitle the accused to admit at trial all evidence that tends to prove his
or her innocence irrespective of the ordinary rules governing admissibility of
evidence, such as the hearsay exclusion: Dersch, supra, at p.
1515.  In Seaboyer, supra, at pp. 609 et seq., McLachlin
J. stated that the underlying principle of many such exclusionary rules is that
they disclose circumstances where the potential prejudice to the fact-finding
process of the evidence to be admitted outweighs its probative value.
Similarly, the accused has never had a right to irrelevant evidence. In other
words, the accused is not permitted to distort the truth-seeking function of
the trial process. 

 








75                           
The foregoing considerations do not mean that the accused’s right to
make full answer and defence is automatically breached where he or she is
deprived of relevant information. As this Court outlined in R. v. La,
[1997] 2 S.C.R. 680, at para. 25, where the claim is based on lost evidence,
“the accused must establish actual prejudice to his or her right to make full
answer and defence”.  Other public interests may similarly limit the accused’s
ability to gain access to potentially relevant information. This is clear from Stinchcombe,
supra, where this Court held that the Crown’s disclosure obligation is
subject to a privilege exception.  Similarly, our law has long recognized the
importance of protecting the identity of police informers through an informer
privilege, subject to the “innocence at stake” exception: see Marks v.
Beyfus (1890), 25 Q.B.D. 494 (C.A.); R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
979; Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60, at p. 93; Leipert, supra,
at p. 295.

 

76                           
Several principles regarding the right to make full answer and defence
emerge from the preceding discussion.  First, the right to make full answer and
defence is crucial to ensuring that the innocent are not convicted. To that
end, courts must consider the danger of placing the accused in a Catch-22
situation as a condition of making full answer and defence, and will even
override competing considerations in order to protect the right to make full
answer and defence in certain circumstances, such as the “innocence at stake”
exception to informer privilege. Second, the accused’s right must be defined in
a context that includes other principles of fundamental justice and Charter 
provisions. Third, full answer and defence does not include the right to
evidence that would distort the search for truth inherent in the trial process.

 

(ii)  Privacy

 

77                           
Since Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, this Court has
recognized that s. 8  of the Charter  protects a person’s reasonable
expectation of privacy. This right is relevant to the present appeal, as an
order for the production of documents is a seizure within the meaning of s. 8 
of the Charter  (Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425; R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 627), as is
the power to make copies of documents (Comité paritaire de l’industrie de la
chemise v. Potash, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 406).  Therefore, an order for the
production of records made pursuant to ss. 278.1  to 278.91  of the Criminal
Code , falls within the ambit of s. 8 . 

 








78                           
Section 278.1  of the Criminal Code  defines the records apposite
to ss. 278.2  to 278.9  as:

 

. . . any form of record that contains personal information for which
there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and includes, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling,
education, employment, child welfare, adoption and social services records,
personal journals and diaries, and records containing personal information the
production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act of Parliament
or a provincial legislature, but does not include records made by persons
responsible for the investigation or prosecution of the offence.

 

Therefore, if
a record does not contain information regarding which there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy, then it is not subject to the impugned provisions
governing production. 

 

79                           
This Court has most often characterized the values engaged by privacy in
terms of liberty, or the right to be left alone by the state. For example, in R.
v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, at p. 427, La Forest J. commented that
“privacy is at the heart of liberty in a modern state”. In R. v. Edwards,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 50, per Cory J., privacy was characterized
as including “[t]he right to be free from intrusion or interference”.

 

80                           
This interest in being left alone by the state includes the ability to
control the dissemination of confidential information. As La Forest J. stated
in R. v. Duarte, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 53-54:

 

. . . it has long been recognized that this freedom not to be compelled
to share our confidences with others is the very hallmark of a free society.
Yates J., in Millar v. Taylor (1769), 4 Burr. 2303, 98 E.R. 201, states,
at p. 2379 and p. 242:

 








It is certain every man has a right to keep his own
sentiments, if he pleases: he has certainly a right to judge whether he will
make them public, or commit them only to the sight of his friends.

 

These privacy
concerns are at their strongest where aspects of one’s individual identity are
at stake, such as in the context of information “about one’s lifestyle,
intimate relations or political or religious opinions”: Thomson Newspapers,
supra, at p. 517, per La Forest J., cited with approval in British
Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 62.

 

81                           
The significance of these privacy concerns should not be understated. 
Many commentators have noted that privacy is also necessarily related to many
fundamental human relations. As C. Fried states in “Privacy” (1967-68), 77 Yale
L.J. 475, at pp. 477-78:

 

To respect, love, trust, feel affection for others and to regard
ourselves as the objects of love, trust and affection is at the heart of our
notion of ourselves as persons among persons, and privacy is the necessary
atmosphere for these attitudes and actions, as oxygen is for combustion.

 

See also D.
Feldman, “Privacy-related Rights and their Social Value”, in P. Birks, ed., Privacy
and Loyalty (1997), 15, at pp. 26-27, and J. Rachels, “Why Privacy Is
Important” (1975), 4 Philosophy & Public Affairs 323.  This Court
recognized these fundamental aspects of privacy in R. v. Plant, [1993] 3
S.C.R. 281, where Sopinka J., for the majority, stated, at p. 293:

 

In fostering the underlying values of dignity, integrity and
autonomy, it is fitting that s. 8  of the Charter  should seek to
protect a biographical core of personal information which individuals in a free
and democratic society would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to
the state. This would include information which tends to reveal intimate
details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.  [Emphasis
added.]








82                           
That privacy is essential to maintaining relationships of trust was
stressed to this Court by the eloquent submissions of many interveners in this
case regarding  counselling records. The therapeutic relationship is one that
is characterized by trust, an element of which is confidentiality. Therefore,
the protection of the complainant’s reasonable expectation of privacy in her
therapeutic records protects the therapeutic relationship. 

 

83                           
Confidential relationships have a long history of being protected
through the common law doctrine of privilege. The “Wigmore test” sets out the
generally accepted  criteria for determining whether, in a particular case, the
communications at issue should be privileged and therefore excluded as evidence
at trial (Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961), §2285, at
p. 527).  See M. (A.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at para. 20.

 

84                           
Of course, where state action is implicated, and competing Charter 
rights are at stake such as in the present appeal, a common law test like
Wigmore’s will not be sufficient. We therefore advocate a different approach to
balancing interests from that found in the Wigmore test for privilege. However,
we accept that confidential relationships may be protected under s. 8  of the Charter .

 








85                           
Many interveners in this case pointed out that the therapeutic 
relationship has important implications for the complainant’s psychological
integrity. Counselling helps an individual to recover from his or her trauma.
Even the possibility that this confidentiality may be breached affects the
therapeutic relationship. Furthermore, it can reduce the complainant’s
willingness to report crime or deter him or her from counselling altogether. In
our view, such concerns indicate that the protection of the therapeutic
relationship protects the mental integrity of complainants and witnesses. This
Court has on several occasions recognized that security of the person is
violated by state action interfering with an individual’s mental integrity: New
Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), [1999] 3
S.C.R. 46, at paras. 58-60; Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at
pp. 919-20, per  Lamer J.;  Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of
the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at p. 1177, per
Lamer J.; R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 55-56, per
Dickson C.J., and p. 173, per Wilson J. Therefore, in cases where a
therapeutic relationship is threatened by the disclosure of private records,
security of the person and not just privacy is implicated.

 

86                           
Despite the importance of the interests protected by privacy, this right
may be limited; a reasonable search or seizure is permitted by s. 8  of
the Charter . In Hunter v. Southam, supra, Dickson J.
stated, for the Court, at pp. 159-60, that the limitation on the right
guaranteed by s. 8  

 

indicates that an assessment must be made as to whether in a particular
situation the public’s interest in being left alone by government must give way
to the government’s interest in intruding on the individual’s privacy in order
to advance its goals, notably those of law enforcement. 

 

This balance
of interests is not to be assessed ex post facto. Thus, where feasible,
a search or seizure requires prior authorization. Such authorization is to be
provided by an individual who is capable of acting judicially, and who must
assess the balance of interests at stake. As Dickson J. stated, at pp. 167-68:

 








The state’s interest in detecting and preventing crime begins to
prevail over the individual’s interest in being left alone at the point where
credibly-based probability replaces suspicion. History has confirmed the
appropriateness of this requirement as the threshold for subordinating the
expectation of privacy to the needs of law enforcement. Where  the state’s
interests is not simply law enforcement as, for instance, where state security
is involved, or where the individual’s interest is not simply his expectation
of privacy as, for instance, when the search threatens his bodily integrity,
the relevant standard might well be a different one.

 

Therefore, the
appropriateness of the balance is assessed according to the nature of the
interests at stake in a particular context, and the place of these interests
within our legal and political traditions.

 

87                           
The present appeal asks how to define the privacy rights of third
parties in light of the accused’s right to gain access to evidence in order to
make full answer and defence. As the right to make full answer and defence is a
principle of fundamental justice protected by s. 7  of the Charter , it is
helpful to explore the connection between ss. 7  and 8  of the Charter . 
In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at p. 502, Lamer J. stated
for the majority:

 

Sections 8  to 14 , in other words, address specific
deprivations of the “right” to life, liberty and security of the person in
breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and as such, violations of s.
7 . They are designed to protect, in a specific manner and setting, the right to
life, liberty and security of the person set forth in s. 7 . It would be
incongruous to interpret s. 7  more narrowly than the rights in ss. 8  to 14 . 

 

Of course,
later cases have held that the text of the Charter  supports some
differences between ss. 7  and 8 . For example, s. 8  applies to corporations
whereas s. 7  does not: Hunter v. Southam, supra; Irwin Toy
Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927.  In CIP Inc.,
supra, at p. 854, this Court held that the concern that there be
no incongruity between ss. 7  and 8 -14  related to the principles of fundamental
justice and not to the scope of life, liberty and security of the person.

 








88                           
Given that s. 8  protects a person’s privacy by prohibiting unreasonable
searches or seizures, and given that s. 8  addresses a particular application of
the principles of fundamental justice, we can infer that a reasonable search or
seizure is consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. Moreover, as
we have already discussed, the principles of fundamental justice include the
right to make full answer and defence. Therefore, a reasonable search and
seizure will be one that accommodates both the accused’s ability to make full
answer and defence and the complainant’s privacy right.

 

89                           
From our preceding discussion of the right to make full answer and
defence, it is clear that the accused will have no right to the records in
question insofar as they contain information that is either irrelevant or would
serve to distort the search for truth, as access to such information is not
included within the ambit of the accused’s right. In this regard, it is
important to note that several interveners before this Court stressed the
importance of understanding the context in which therapeutic records are made
and their potential unreliability as a factual account of an event. However,
the accused’s right must prevail where the lack of disclosure or production of
the record would render him unable to make full answer and defence. This is
because our justice system has always held that the threat of convicting an
innocent individual strikes at the heart of the principles of fundamental
justice. However, between these extremes lies a spectrum of possibilities
regarding where to strike a balance between these competing rights in any
particular context. The values protected by privacy rights will be most
directly at stake where the confidential information contained in a record
concerns aspects of one’s individual identity or where the maintenance of
confidentiality is crucial to a therapeutic, or other trust-like, relationship.

 

(iii)  Equality

 








90                           
Equality concerns must also inform the contextual circumstances in which
the rights of full answer and defence and privacy will come into play. In this
respect, an appreciation of myths and stereotypes in the context of sexual
violence is essential to delineate properly the boundaries of full answer and
defence. As we have already discussed, the right to make full answer and
defence does not include the right to information that would only distort the
truth-seeking goal of the trial process. In R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4
S.C.R. 595, Cory J., for the majority on this issue, stated, at pp. 669-70:

 

The provisions of ss. 15  and 28  of the Charter  guaranteeing
equality to men and women, although not determinative should be taken into
account in determining the reasonable limitations that should be placed upon
the cross-examination of a complainant. . . . A complainant should not be
unduly harassed and pilloried to the extent of becoming a victim of an
insensitive judicial system. . . .

 

The reasons in Seaboyer make it clear that
eliciting evidence from a complainant for the purpose of encouraging inferences
pertaining to consent or the credibility of rape victims which are based on
groundless myths and fantasized stereotypes is improper.

 

The accused is
not permitted to “whack the complainant” through the use of stereotypes
regarding victims of sexual assault.

 

91                           
In addition, an appreciation of the equality dimensions of records
production in cases concerning sexual violence highlights the need to balance
privacy and full answer and defence in a manner that fully respects the privacy
interests of complainants. McLachlin J. made this clear in M. (A.) v. Ryan,
supra, at para. 30, while  discussing the interests at stake in
determining whether counselling records were privileged or should be produced
in a civil action for damages allegedly caused by sexual assault:

 








A rule of privilege which fails to protect confidential doctor/patient
communications in the context of an action arising out of sexual assault
perpetuates the disadvantage felt by victims of sexual assault, often women.
The intimate nature of sexual assault heightens the privacy concerns of the
victim and may increase, if automatic disclosure is the rule, the difficulty of
obtaining redress for the wrong. The victim of a sexual assault is thus placed
in a disadvantaged position as compared with the victim of a different wrong.
The result may be that the victim of sexual assault does not obtain the equal
benefit of the law to which s. 15  of the Charter  entitles her. She is
doubly victimized, initially by the sexual assault and later by the price she
must pay to claim redress – redress which in some cases may be part of her
program of therapy.

 

92                           
When the boundary between privacy and full answer and defence is not
properly delineated, the equality of individuals whose lives are heavily
documented is also affected, as these individuals have more records that will
be subject to wrongful scrutiny.  K. Busby cautions that the use of records to
challenge credibility at large

 

will subject those whose lives already have been subject to extensive
documentation to extraordinarily invasive review. This would include women
whose lives have been documented under conditions of multiple inequalities and
institutionalization such as Aboriginal women, women with disabilities, or
women who have been imprisoned or involved with child welfare agencies.

 

(“Discriminatory
Uses of Personal Records in Sexual Violence Cases” (1997), 9 C.J.W.L.148,
at pp. 161-62.)

 

93                           
These concerns highlight the need for an acute sensitivity to context
when determining the content of the accused’s right to make full answer and
defence, and its relationship to the complainant’s privacy right.

 

(c)  Summary

 








94                           
In summary, the following broad considerations apply to the definition
of the rights at stake in this appeal.  The right of the accused to make full
answer and defence is a core principle of fundamental justice, but it does not
automatically entitle the accused to gain access to information contained in
the private records of complainants and witnesses.  Rather, the scope of the
right to make full answer and defence must be determined in light of privacy
and equality rights of complainants and witnesses.  It is clear that the right
to full answer and defence is not engaged where the accused seeks information
that will only serve to distort the truth-seeking purpose of a trial, and in
such a situation, privacy and equality rights are paramount.  On the other
hand, where the information contained in a record directly bears on the right to
make full answer and defence, privacy rights must yield to the need to avoid
convicting the innocent.  Most cases, however, will not be so clear, and in
assessing applications for production, courts must determine the weight to be
granted to the interests protected by privacy and full answer and defence in
the particular circumstances of each case. Full answer and defence will be more
centrally implicated where the information contained in a record is part of the
case to meet or where its potential probative value is high. A complainant’s
privacy interest is very high where the confidential information contained in a
record concerns the complainant’s personal identity or where the
confidentiality of the record is vital to protect a therapeutic relationship.

 

95                           
With this background in mind, we now proceed to discuss the statutory
provisions under attack.

 

D.  Analysis
of Sections 278.1 to 278.91 of Bill C-46

 

96                           
In enacting Bill C-46, Parliament was concerned with preserving an
accused’s access to private records that may be relevant to an issue on trial,
while protecting the right to privacy of complainants and witnesses to the
greatest extent possible.  Notwithstanding Parliament’s good intentions, the
respondent suggests that Bill C-46 violates the constitutional right of the
accused to a fair trial and full defence on a number of grounds.  We will
consider each in turn.  

 








(1)  The Definition of Documents Subject to the
Legislation: Sections 278.1  and 278.2(1) 

 

97                           
An initial issue to address is the definition of documents subject to
the legislation.  Pursuant to ss. 278.1  and 278.2(1) , the Bill applies to all
records of complainants and witnesses in sexual offence proceedings containing
“personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy”,
including “medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education,
employment, child welfare, adoption and social services records, personal
journals and diaries, and records containing personal information the
production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act of Parliament
or a provincial legislature”.

 

98                           
Belzil J., for the court below, found that the definition of records
under the Bill is “extremely broad” (para. 47) and that the Bill therefore
accords legislative protection to records not contemplated under O’Connor. 
The broader scope of the legislation, he held, imposes a significant burden on
accused persons by requiring them to proceed with an application, supported by
affidavits, for each different type of record listed.  Belzil J. considered the
greater reach of the Bill to be one of five significant differences between the
Bill and O’Connor which led him to conclude that the Bill as a whole was
unconstitutional.  

 








99                           
The response to these claims is to remember that the legislation applies
only to records “for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy”
(s. 278.1  (emphasis added)). Only documents that truly raise a legally
recognized privacy interest are caught and protected: see R. v. Regan
(1998), 174 N.S.R. (2d) 230 (S.C.).  The Bill is therefore carefully tailored
to reflect the problem Parliament was addressing  –  how to preserve an
accused’s access to private records that may be relevant to an issue on trial
while protecting, to the greatest extent possible, the privacy rights of the
subjects of such records, including both complainants and witnesses.  By
limiting its coverage to records in which there is a reasonable expectation of
privacy, the Bill is consistent with the definition of s. 8  privacy rights
discussed above.  Moreover, as will be discussed below, the mere fact that
records are within the ambit of Bill C-46 will not, in itself, prevent the
accused from obtaining access to them.  Applied in this way, ss. 278.1  and
278.2(1)  will not catch more records than they should, and are not overly
broad.

 

100                       
It must also be remembered that the definition of records in ss. 278.1 
and  278.2(1)  simply establishes the starting point for the analysis proposed
by the Bill.  Documents falling within the ambit of these provisions, after
being subject to the legislative regime, may or may not be ordered to be
disclosed to the accused.  It is therefore the procedures established by the
Bill and not the spectrum of records subject to these procedures that will
determine the fairness or constitutionality of the legislation. If the
legislative regime fairly provides access to all constitutionally required
documents, then the spectrum of records brought under the Bill, if in keeping
with the Bill’s objectives, cannot be challenged.

 








101                       
The broad scope of Bill C-46 has also been challenged as imposing an
excessive burden on judicial resources.  However, the Bill safeguards the
efficiency and resources of the judicial system while furthering its objective
of protecting, to the greatest extent possible, the rights of all those
involved in sexual offence proceedings, by mandating that judges can only
review the records in question once these records have been established as
likely relevant and their production to the court has been established as
necessary in the interests of justice.  The balancing process required at the
first stage ensures that records are not needlessly or casually produced to the
court for review: see O’Connor, supra, at para. 152, per
L’Heureux-Dubé J.  Moreover, as many interveners have pointed out, production
of records to the court had become almost routine in sexual assault cases.  It
is unlikely that Bill C-46's procedures will be substantially more onerous on
judicial resources.  Finally, Parliament, with the benefit of a full
legislative inquiry, has ruled on such questions of administrative
convenience.  We see no reason to disturb its conclusion.  If the system proves
unworkable in practice, then Parliament, not this Court, is better positioned
to fix it.

 

(2)  Third Party Records in the Possession of
the Crown:  Sections 278.2(2)  and (3) 

 

102                       
The next provision at issue extends the application of the legislative
regime for the production of private records to records “in the possession or
control of any person”, including the Crown: s. 278.2(2) .

 

103                       
Where private records are in the possession or control of the Crown two
important variations on the regime for production exist.  First, the
legislative regime does not apply if the complainant or witness has expressly
waived the protections of the Bill (s. 278.2(2)).  Second, s. 278.2(3) requires
the prosecutor to notify the accused of any records in the Crown’s possession.

 








104                       
The respondent objects to the fact that this provision prevents the
automatic disclosure of all relevant and non-privileged information in the
possession of the Crown.  He submits that this is contrary to the
constitutional obligation upon the Crown set out in Stinchcombe, and is
inconsistent with this Court’s conclusion in O’Connor that “the Crown’s
disclosure obligations established in the Stinchcombe decision are
unaffected by the confidential nature of therapeutic records” (para. 13, per
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.).  The respondent also argues that s. 278.2(2) gives
the Crown an unfair advantage in that only the accused is subject to the
legislative regime.  The Crown can obtain private records through the
complainant directly or through the power of a search warrant.  The Bill not
only exempts the Crown from the obligation to comply with the legislation
regime when seeking private records, but also allows the Crown to possess
information that the defence does not have.

 

105                       
The first response to the respondent’s argument is that it is 
premature.   Section 278.2  simply defines the scope of the legislation.  It
does not by itself deny access to documents to which the defence is
constitutionally entitled.  If the procedures set out in the sections that
follow fairly provide access to all constitutionally required documents, then
the accused has no constitutional complaint. 

 








106                       
Second, the argument that this provision contradicts Stinchcombe
and  O’Connor rests on an overstatement of the Crown obligation to
disclose that was affirmed in those cases.  It is true that Stinchcombe
spoke of a duty on the Crown to disclose to the defence all relevant documents
in the Crown’s possession, subject to privilege.  Privacy interests, however,
were not at issue in Stinchcombe.  In O’Connor, the Court
considered the Crown’s obligation to disclose private records in the context of
sexual offence proceedings where the complainant has made an informed waiver of
her privacy rights.  The majority in O’Connor concluded that “the
Crown’s well-established duty to disclose all information in its possession is
not affected by the confidential nature of therapeutic records”: O’Connor,
supra, at para. 7.  This conclusion, however, was premised upon the
assumption that the records in the Crown’s possession have been freely and
voluntarily surrendered by the complainant or witness: “where the documents in
question have been shared with an agent of the state (namely, the Crown), it is
apparent that the complainant’s privacy interest in those records has
disappeared” (O’Connor, supra, at para 8).  Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka J. further found that “fairness must require that if the complainant is
willing to release this information in order to further the criminal
prosecution, then the accused should be entitled to use the information in the
preparation of his or her defence” (O’Connor, supra, at para. 9
(emphasis added)).  Bill C-46 imposes the same waiver rule.  Where a fully
informed complainant expressly waives the protection of the legislation, by
declaration or by voluntarily providing her records to the Crown, the Bill C-46
procedure does not apply and the records are producible as at common law: s.
278.2(2).  Bill C-46 thus conforms to the constitutional standard of O’Connor.

 

107                       
The respondent argues, however, that O’Connor should not be read
as requiring the disclosure of confidential records pursuant to Stinchcombe
only in cases of an express waiver and that s. 278.2(2) is
unconstitutional.   He asserts that any reasonable expectation of privacy is
lost once the records are in the possession of the Crown, regardless of how the
records came into the Crown’s possession.  Once in the Crown’s hands, the
records become “the property of the public” to be used to ensure that justice
is done and must be disclosed pursuant to the common law.    

 








108                       
This argument erroneously equates Crown possession or control with a
total loss of any reasonable expectation of privacy.  Privacy is not an all or
nothing right.  It does not follow from the fact that the Crown has possession
of the records that any reasonable expectation of privacy disappears.  Privacy
interests in modern society include the reasonable expectation that private
information will remain confidential to the persons to whom and restricted to
the purposes for which it was divulged,  Dyment, supra, at p.
429.  Where private information is disclosed to individuals outside of those to
whom, or for purposes other than for which, it was originally divulged, the
person to whom the information pertains may still hold a reasonable expectation
of privacy in this information, R. v. Boudreau, [1998] O.J. No. 3526
(QL) (Gen. Div.), at para. 18.   Third party records may fall into the
possession of the Crown without the knowledge, consent, or assistance of the
complainant or witness.  Where the complainant or witness has not expressly
waived her privacy right, Parliament can legitimately take steps to protect
those privacy rights.  Such protection is to be found in the procedures for
production set out in ss. 278.5 and 278.7 of the Bill. 

 

109                       
The O’Connor majority did not address what procedure was to be
followed where third party records were in the possession of the Crown without
the existence of an express waiver.  It was therefore open to Parliament to
fill this void legislatively.  Viewed in this context, s. 278.2(2) ensures that
the range of interests triggered by production will be balanced pursuant to the
procedure set out in ss. 278.5 and 278.7.  The mere fact that this procedure
differs from that set out in Stinchcombe does not, without more,
establish a constitutional violation.  As noted, Stinchcombe and O’Connor
did not address the situation at issue here, namely, records in the Crown’s
possession in which a complainant or witness has a reasonable, and non-waived,
expectation of privacy. We are thus returned to our starting point – that s.
278.2  in itself violates no rights and any violation can be determined only by
examining its impact in conjunction with ss. 278.5 through 278.8. 

 

110                       
When the arguments that s. 278.2  is inconsistent with Stinchcombe
and O’Connor are cleared away, the respondent’s fundamental objection to
the section emerges – it unfairly favours the Crown.  The Crown can obtain the
complainant’s private records through a search warrant or subpoena.  Where the
complainant or witness does not expressly waive the protection of the
legislation, the accused can get these documents only by applying under the
Bill C-46 regime.  If the accused does not succeed, the Crown may possess
documents that the accused does not have.  This, it is argued, puts the Crown
at an advantage. 








 

111                       
All this is true.  But it begs the real question -- is the Crown’s
advantage unconstitutional?   In other words, does it deprive the accused of
his right to make full answer and defence?  That will be so only if the
legislation prevents the accused from getting access to all constitutionally
required documents.  There is no principle of fundamental justice that the
Crown and defence must enjoy precisely the same privileges and procedures.  See
Leipert, supra. The real question is whether the procedures that
Parliament has enacted prevent the accused from making full answer and
defence.  This is the true meaning of the passage from O’Connor, supra,
at para. 34, which states that “[f]airness requires that the accused be treated
on an equal footing” with the Crown, which has access to search warrants. 
Obviously, the search warrant procedure involves a different array of factors
from those that are relevant to production of third party records to the
accused.  All that was meant by this passage is that the accused must have a
procedure for obtaining evidence that respects all the relevant constitutional
rights at stake, just as the prosecution does through the warrant process.  As
we will explain below, Bill C-46 is just such a procedure.

 








112                       
In Stinchcombe, this Court acknowledged that the Crown, by virtue
of its unique role as agent of the state, has greater access to certain types
of information than the accused.  The Court therefore imposed a duty on the
Crown to disclose all relevant information to the defence.  The goal behind
imposing this duty upon the Crown was not, however, to ensure equivalency of 
treatment between the accused and the Crown.  Rather, the duty to disclose was
imposed to advance the overall fairness, justice, efficacy, and truth finding
elements of criminal proceedings. Since the right to full answer and defence
must be defined in light of other principles of fundamental justice, that right
is not an absolute one.  Thus, while acknowledging the disparity in access to
certain types of information, Sopinka J. conditioned the Crown’s duty to
disclose by investing in the Crown a discretion to withhold information where
necessary to respect the rules of privilege, to protect persons from harassment
or injury, or where this information is clearly irrelevant, at pp. 336 and
339.  Similarly, in O’Connor, supra, at para. 16, Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka J. held:

 

. . . Stinchcombe recognized that, even in the context of
disclosure, there are limits on the right of an accused to access information. 
For example, when the Crown asserts that the information is privileged, the
trial judge must then balance the competing claims at issue.  In such cases,
the information will only be disclosed where the trial judge concludes that the
asserted privilege “does not constitute a reasonable limit on the
constitutional right to make full answer and defence” (Stinchcombe, at
p. 340).

 

Stinchcombe
and O’Connor accept that it is constitutionally permissible for the
Crown to be subject to different treatment, to different procedures, or even to
end up with documents that the accused has not seen, as long as the accused can
make full answer and defence and the trial is fundamentally fair.

 

113                       
Furthermore, when addressing the disparity of treatment between defence
counsel and the Crown, we must remember the specific problem Bill C-46 was
enacted to address.  Through Bill C-46, Parliament sought to preserve an
accused’s access to private records that may be relevant to the defence in a
sexual offence proceeding while protecting, to the greatest extent possible,
the privacy rights of complainants and witnesses.  The context of the Bill is
one in which defence counsel were routinely seeking access to the private
records of complainants or witnesses in sexual offence proceedings (K. Kelly,
“‘You must be crazy if you think you were raped’: Reflections on the Use of
Complainants’ Personal and Therapy Records in Sexual Assault Trials” (1997), 9 C.J.W.L.
178; K. Busby, “Third Party Records Cases Since R. v. O’Connor: 
A Preliminary Analysis”, a study funded by the Research and Statistics Section,
Department of Justice Canada, July 1998.).  As H. Holmes aptly summarizes:








 

The O’Connor issue arose from new defence intrusion into the
rights and interests of third parties.  Defence applications for access to
third party records are quite properly motivated only by the accused’s
concern to make full answer and defence to the charge.  The Crown, by contrast,
is responsible for a larger set of interests including those of third parties
and the general public as well as those of the accused.  [Emphasis in
original.]  

 

(“An Analysis
of Bill C-46, Production of Records in Sexual Offence Proceedings” (1997), 2 Can.
Crim. L.R. 71, at p. 86.)

 

The greater
procedural burden placed on the accused under Bill C-46 reflects the fact that
unlike the Crown, the accused bears no responsibility to protect the rights of
others.  To protect such rights, when they are threatened by the acts of the
accused, greater procedural protections are required.  

 

114                       
The defence concern that it will be unable to obtain records relevant to
its defence will be considered in greater detail later.  However, in relation
to s. 278.2(2)  it is worth pointing out that Parliament inserted two
provisions to offset any unfairness that might flow from the Crown’s being in
possession of documents that the defence has not seen.  As discussed above, the
first is the provision that if the complainant or witness waives the protection
of the legislation, the documents must be disclosed to the defence:  s.
278.2(2).  Waiver should not be read in a technical sense.  Where the
complainant or witness, with knowledge that the legislation protects her
privacy interest in the records, indicates by words or conduct that she is
relinquishing her privacy right, waiver may be found.  Turning records over to
the police or Crown, with knowledge of the law’s protections and the
consequences of waiving these protections, will constitute an express waiver pursuant
to s. 278.2(2).

 








115                       
The second aid to the accused is the requirement in s. 278.2(3) that the
prosecutor notify the accused of the private documents in his or her
possession.  While the contents are not to be disclosed at this stage, the notification
requirement reveals the existence of the record to the accused and allows the
accused to make an application for production.  When notifying an accused, the
Crown should ensure that information as to date and context are provided so
that the documents can be sufficiently identified.  This will help furnish the
accused with a basis for arguing that the documents may be relevant to the
defence under s. 278.5: see Boudreau, supra, per Ewaschuk
J.

 

116                       
We conclude that the fact that s. 278.2  may result in the Crown holding
documents that the accused does not possess does not of itself deprive the
accused of the right to make full answer and defence. Parliament has balanced
the inevitably advantageous documentary position the prosecution enjoys with safeguards
to protect the accused’s interest in getting those documents that may be
relevant to the defence.  Provided the remainder of Bill C-46 permits the
accused to obtain the documents to which the defence is entitled, the fact that
the Crown may possess documents that the accused does not, does not vitiate the
process.  Section 278.2  is constitutional in that it does not violate ss. 7  or
11 (d) of the Charter .

 

(3)  The “Insufficient Grounds” Section:  Section 278.3(4) 

 








117                       
Section 278.3(4) lists a series of “assertions” that cannot “on their
own” establish that a record is likely relevant.  The respondent submits that
on a plain reading, this provision prevents the accused from relying on the
listed factors when attempting to establish the likely relevance of the
records.  This, he argues, interferes with the right to make full answer and
defence by restricting what the judge can consider in determining whether the
records must be produced to the defence.  The legislation raises the bar for
production, he asserts, making it difficult if not impossible for the accused
to meet the likely relevance test of ss. 278.5 and 278.7.   The Respondent
contends that it is unconstitutional to exclude the assertions listed in s.
278.3(4)  as irrelevant.

 

118                       
This submission forgets that when legislation is susceptible to more
than one interpretation, we must always choose the constitutional reading.  See
Slaight, supra, at p. 1078. This mistake leads the respondent to
overstate the purpose and effect of s. 278.3(4) .  As has frequently been held,
its purpose is to prevent speculative and unmeritorious requests for
production: R. v. Hurrie (1997), 12 C.R. (5th) 180 (B.C.S.C.), at paras.
16-17; Boudreau, supra, at para. 6; Regan, supra,
at paras. 26-27;  R. v. Stromner (1997), 205 A.R. 385 (Prov. Ct.), at
paras. 39-42; R. v. J.F.G., [1997] N.W.T.J. No. 47 (QL) (S.C.), at
paras. 27-28.  It does not entirely prevent an accused from relying on the
factors listed, but simply prevents reliance on bare “assertions” of the
listed matters, where there is no other evidence and they stand “on their own”.

 

119                       
As has frequently been noted, speculative myths, stereotypes, and
generalized assumptions about sexual assault victims and classes of records
have too often in the past hindered the search for truth and imposed harsh and
irrelevant burdens on complainants in prosecutions of sexual offences.  See Seaboyer,
supra, at p. 634. The myths that a woman’s testimony is unreliable 
unless she made a complaint shortly after the event (recent complaint), or if
she has had previous sexual relations, are but two of the more notorious
examples of the speculation that in the past has passed for truth in this
difficult area of human behaviour and the law.  The notion that consultation
with a psychiatrist is, by itself, an indication of untrustworthiness is a more
recent, but equally invidious, example of such a myth.  The purpose of s.
278.3(4)  is to prevent these and other myths from forming the entire basis of
an otherwise unsubstantiated order for production of private records.

 








120                       
The purpose and wording of s. 278.3 do not prevent an accused from
relying on the assertions set out in s. 278.3(4)  where there is an evidentiary
or informational foundation to suggest that they may be related to likely
relevance.   (An exception is “recent complaint” which has been abolished by
the jurisprudence and cannot be relied on in any event, quite apart from the
section.)   The section requires only that the accused be able to point to case
specific evidence or information to show that the record in issue is likely
relevant to an issue at trial or the competence of a witness to testify: see Leipert,
supra, at para.  21.   Conversely, where an accused does provide
evidence or information to support an assertion listed in s. 278.3(4) , this
does not mean that likely relevance is made out.  Section 278.3(4)  does not
supplant the ultimate discretion of the trial judge.  Where any one of the
listed assertions is made and supported by the required evidentiary and
informational foundation, the trial judge is the ultimate arbiter in deciding
whether the likely relevance threshold set out in ss. 278.5 and 278.7 is met.  

 

121                       
We conclude that s. 278.3(4)  does not violate ss. 7  or 11 (d) of
the Charter .

 

(4)  The First Stage -- Production to the Judge:  Sections 278.4 and
278.5

 

122                       
Bill C-46, as noted, contemplates a two-stage procedure for gaining
access to documents.  At the first stage, the issue is whether the document
should be produced to the judge.  If that stage is passed, the judge looks at
the document to determine whether it should be produced to the accused. 
Section 278.5 establishes the procedure for production to the judge at the
first stage.

 








123                       
Section 278.4 also deals with procedure.  The judge holds the hearing in
camera, and may hear witnesses and take submissions.  Witnesses are not,
however, compellable, though under s. 278.4(2) they “may appear and make
submissions”.  None of the parties or interveners in this appeal directly
challenged the non-compellability of witnesses under s. 278.4(2) (though this
section falls within the stated constitutional questions, and was addressed by
Belzil J.).  We are therefore reluctant to assess its constitutionality.  That
said, and without deciding the issue, we would note that the fact that
witnesses are not compellable must be viewed in light of the preliminary,
investigatory nature of the process at this stage and the other sources upon
which the judge can draw in assessing whether the documents may be relevant and
whether their production is necessary to the interests of justice, discussed
more fully below.  While Stinchcombe affirmed the right of the defence
to obtain documents in the possession of the Crown which may be relevant to the
defence, it did not suggest that the defence should have the right to examine
witnesses on what documents are relevant.  The common law has never compelled
witnesses to testify as to records at the investigatory stage, although many
inquisitorial, civilian systems do so.  The fact that witnesses are not
compellable under s. 278.4(2) is consistent, at the very least, with the common
law tradition and with Stinchcombe.  Moreover, as we discuss more fully infra,
trial judges retain a broad discretion under s. 278.5(1)  to order production. 
We must presume that Parliament intended for trial judges to exercise that
discretion in a manner consistent with the Charter  principles discussed
above.

 








124                       
Both the majority and minority of this Court in O’Connor held
that records must be produced to the judge for inspection if the accused can
demonstrate that the information is “likely to be relevant”: O’Connor, supra,
at para. 19, per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J., and at para. 138, per
L’Heureux-Dubé J.  The Court defined the standard of likely relevance as “a
reasonable possibility that the information is logically probative to an
issue at trial or the competence of a witness to testify” (para. 22
(emphasis in original)). Although the majority recognized that complainants
have a constitutional right to privacy (at para. 17), it held that no balancing
of rights should be undertaken at the first stage (at para. 24).  This
conclusion was premised on the finding that: (1) to require the accused to meet
more than the likely relevance stage would be to “put the accused in the
difficult situation of having to make submissions to the judge without
precisely knowing what is contained in the records” (para. 25); and (2) there
is not enough information before a trial judge at this initial stage of
production for an informed balancing procedure to take place (at para. 21).  To
this end, the majority held that the analysis should be confined to determining
“likely relevance” and “whether the right to make full answer and defence is
implicated by information contained in the records” (para. 21).  In contrast,
the minority held that once the accused meets the “likely relevance” threshold,
he must then satisfy the judge that the salutary effects of ordering the
documents produced to the court for inspection outweigh the deleterious effects
of such production, having regard to the accused’s right to make full answer
and defence, and the effect of such production on the privacy and equality
rights of the subject of the records (at para. 150).  L’Heureux-Dubé J. found
that a sufficient evidentiary basis could be established at this stage through
Crown disclosure, defence witnesses, the cross-examination of Crown witnesses
at both the preliminary inquiry and the trial and, on some occasions, expert
evidence (at para. 146).  

 








125                       
Parliament, after studying the issue, concluded that the rights of both
the complainant and the accused should be considered when deciding whether to
order production to the judge.  In coming to this conclusion, Parliament must
be taken to have determined, as a result of lengthy consultations, and years of
Parliamentary study and debate, that trial judges have sufficient evidence to
engage in an informed balancing process at this stage.  Parliament began
consultations on the production of complainants’ private records in sexual
assault cases in June 1994.  The O’Connor decision became a part of that
discussion when it was released December 14, 1995, and was subsequently
addressed in the consultations which continued until March 1997.  In developing
the Bill C-46 production regime, we must therefore remember that Parliament had
the benefit of information not available to the Court when it penned O’Connor. 
Specifically, Parliament had the advantage of being able to assess how the O’Connor
regime was operating.  The record indicates that Parliament received many
submissions that under the O’Connor regime, private records were
routinely being produced to the court at the first stage, leading to the
recurring violation of the privacy interests of complainants and witnesses. 
While it is true that little statistical data existed at the time of the
drafting of Bill C-46 on the application of O’Connor, it was open to
Parliament to give what weight it saw fit to the evidence presented at the
consultations.  As a result of the consultation process, Parliament decided to
supplement the “likely relevant” standard for production to the judge proposed
in O’Connor with the further requirement that production be “necessary
in the interests of justice”.  The result was s. 278.5. This process is a
notable example of the dialogue between the judicial and legislative branches
discussed above.  This Court acted in O’Connor, and the legislature
responded with Bill C-46.  As already mentioned, the mere fact that Bill C-46
does not mirror O’Connor does not render it unconstitutional.

 

126                       
Section 278.5(1) requires the accused at the stage of production to a
judge to demonstrate not only that the information is “likely relevant” but, in
addition, that the production of the record “is necessary in the interests of
justice”.  The first requirement takes up the unanimous view in O’Connor that
the accused, to get production to the judge, must show that the record is
“likely relevant”.  The additional requirement that production to the judge be
“necessary in the interests of justice” encompasses (but is not confined to)
the concern of the minority in O’Connor that even where likely relevance
is shown, there should be room for the court to consider the rights and
interests of all those affected by disclosure before documents are ordered
disclosed to the court. 

 








127                       
Section 278.5(1) is followed by s. 278.5(2) which gives substance to the
requirement that trial judges consider the broad range of rights and interests
affected before ordering disclosure to the court.  Under this section, a trial
judge is required to consider the salutary and deleterious effects of
production to the court on the accused’s right to make full answer and defence
and on the rights to privacy and equality of the complainant or witness and any
other person to whom the record relates.  The section directs the trial judge
to “take into account” a series of factors in deciding whether the document
should be produced to the court: (a) the extent to which the record is
necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence; (b) the probative
value of the record; (c) the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of
privacy with respect to the record; (d) whether production of the record is
based on a discriminatory belief or bias; (e) the potential prejudice to the
personal dignity and right to privacy of any person to whom the record relates;
(f) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences; (g)
society’s interest in encouraging the obtaining of treatment by complainants of
sexual offences; and (h) the effect of the determination on the integrity of
the trial process.  

 








128                       
The respondent takes no issue with the requirement that the records be
established as likely relevant before production to the judge is ordered.  His
objection is that the accused must also show that disclosure to the judge is
“necessary in the interests of justice”.  He argues that this requires a
weighing and balancing of interests that cannot properly be done without
reviewing the documents in question.  To this end, s. 278.5 calls upon the
trial judge to do the impossible – to weigh competing rights in a vacuum.  The
respondent contends that likely relevance should be the only requirement at the
stage of deciding whether the judge can see the document.  In  imposing the
additional requirement that production be established as “necessary in the
interests of justice”, s. 278.5 risks depriving the accused of documents
relevant to his defence and hence is unconstitutional.

 

129                       
The question comes down to this: once likely relevance is established,
is it necessarily unconstitutional that a consideration of the rights and
interests of those affected by production to the court might result in
production not being ordered?  The answer to this question depends on whether a
consideration of the range of rights and interests affected, in addition to a
finding of likely relevance, will ultimately prevent the accused from seeing
documents that are necessary to enable him to defend himself – to raise all the
defences that might be open to him at trial.  The non-disclosure of third party
records with a high privacy interest that may contain relevant evidence will
not compromise trial fairness where such non-disclosure would not prejudice the
accused’s right to full answer and defence. 

 

130                       
Section 278.5(1) is a very wide and flexible section.  It accords the
trial judge great latitude.  Parliament must be taken to have intended that
judges, within the broad scope of the powers conferred, would apply it in a
constitutional manner - a way that would ultimately permit the accused access
to all documents that may be constitutionally required.  Indeed, a production
regime that denied this would not be production “necessary in the interests of
justice”.

 








131                       
The requirement that production be “necessary in the interests of
justice”  at this stage refers to whether production to the judge is
necessary in the interests of justice.  That is a phrase capable of
encompassing a great deal.  It permits the judge to look at factors other than
relevancy, like the privacy rights of complainants and witnesses, in deciding
whether to order production to himself or herself.  Where the privacy right in
a record is strong and the record is of low probative value or relates to a
peripheral issue, the judge might decide that non-disclosure will not prejudice
the accused’s right to full answer and defence and dismiss the application for
production.

 

132                       
However, pursuant to the first factor of s. 278.5(2), the judge must
consider the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  If the judge
concludes that it is necessary to examine the documents at issue in order to
determine whether they should be produced to enable the accused to make full
answer and defence, then production to the judge is “necessary in the interests
of justice”.  This answers the argument that s. 278.5(1)  may require the judge
to decide against production to himself or herself of documents necessary to
the defence, and hence foreclose production to the accused in an unconstitutional
manner.  If a record is established to be “likely relevant” and, after
considering the various factors, the judge is left uncertain about whether its
production is necessary to make full answer and defence, then the judge should
rule in favour of inspecting the document.  As L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated in O’Connor,
supra, at para. 152, “[i]n borderline cases, the judge should err on
the side of production to the court”.  The interests of justice require nothing
less.

 








133                       
The criterion in s. 278.5 that production must be “necessary in the
interests of justice” invests trial judges with the discretion to consider the
full range of rights and interests at issue before ordering production, in a
manner scrupulously respectful of  the requirements of the Charter ; see:
Baron, supra, at p. 442, per Sopinka J.  The fact that the
approach set out in s. 278.5  does not accord with O’Connor’s
pronouncement, at para. 24, that at the stage of production to the Court,
“considerations of privacy should not enter into the analysis”, does not render
it unconstitutional.  In O’Connor, the Court was operating in a
legislative vacuum, and fashioned what it considered to be the preferred common
law rule.  While the rule from that case was of course informed by the Charter ,
it should not be read as a rigid constitutional template.  As discussed above,
the relationship between the courts and legislatures allows a range of
constitutional options. While this Court may have considered it preferable not
to consider privacy rights at the production stage, that does not preclude
Parliament from coming to a different conclusion, so long as its conclusion is
consistent with the Charter  in its own right.  As we have explained, the
Bill’s directive to consider what is “necessary in the interests of justice”,
read correctly, does include appropriate respect for the right to full answer
and defence.

 

134                       
This leaves the argument that the judge cannot consider the factors
listed in s. 278.5(2) without looking at the documents.  However, s. 278.5(2)
does not require that the judge engage in a conclusive and in-depth evaluation
of each of the factors.  It rather requires the judge to “take them into
account” – to the extent possible at this early stage of proceedings – in
deciding whether to order a particular record produced to himself or herself
for inspection.  Section 278.5(2) serves as a check-list of the various factors
that may come into play in making the decision regarding production to the
judge.  Therefore, while the s. 278.5(2) factors are relevant, in the final
analysis the judge is free to make whatever order is “necessary in the
interests of justice” – a mandate that includes all of the applicable
“principles of fundamental justice” at stake.  

 








135                       
Furthermore, contrary to the respondent’s submissions, there is a
sufficient evidentiary basis to support such an analysis at this early stage. 
This basis can be established through Crown disclosure, defence witnesses, the
cross-examination of Crown witnesses at both the preliminary inquiry and the
trial, and expert evidence, see: O’Connor, supra, at para.
146, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.  As noted by Taylor J. for the British
Columbia Supreme Court, “the criminal process provides a reasonable process for
the acquisition of the evidentiary basis”, Hurrie, supra, at
para. 39.  To this end, as the Attorney of British Columbia submitted: “Laying
the groundwork prior to trial, or comprehensive examination of witnesses at
trial, will go a long way to establishing a meritorious application under this
legislation.”  

 

136                       
The nature of the records in question will also often provide the trial
judge with an important informational foundation.  For example, with respect to
the privacy interest in records, the expectation of privacy in adoption or
counselling records may be very different from that in school attendance
records (see R. v. J.S.P.,  B.C.S.C., Vancouver Registry Nos. CC970130
& CC960237, May 15, 1997).  Similarly, a consideration of the probative
value of records can often be informed by the nature and purposes of a record,
as well as the record taking practices used to create it.  As noted above, many
submissions were made regarding the different levels of reliability of certain
records.  Counselling or therapeutic records, for example, can be highly
subjective documents which attempt merely to record an individual’s emotions
and psychological state.  Often such records have not been checked for accuracy
by the subject of the records, nor have they been recorded verbatim.  All of
these factors may help a trial judge when considering the probative value of a
record being sought by an accused. 

 








137                       
The evidentiary foundation of a case, and considerations such as the
nature of the records sought and the manner in which these records were taken,
will often provide trial judges with sufficient information to be able to
“consider” and to “take into account” the factors listed in s. 278.5(2) and to
fulfil the requirements of s. 278.5(1) .  As a final protection for the accused,
the trial judge is always free to make whatever order is “necessary in the
interests of justice”.  As discussed above in the context of defining the right
to full answer and defence, courts must as a general matter ensure that the
accused can obtain all pertinent evidence required to make full answer and
defence, and must be wary of the danger of putting the accused in a Catch-22
situation in seeking to obtain such evidence.  Where there is a danger that the
accused’s right to make full answer and defence will be violated, the trial
judge should err on the side of production to the court. 

 

138                       
We conclude that s. 278.5 is constitutional.  The respondent’s argument
depends on reading the requirement in s. 278.5(1) (c), that production
can only be ordered where “necessary in the interests of justice”, as capable
of blocking production even where the accused might constitutionally require
access to the documents in question.  A finding of unconstitutionality also
hinges on reading s. 278.5(2) as consisting of a check-list of factors and
rights to be conclusively assessed and weighed-off against one other.  Such
readings, however, cannot stand.  It can never be in the interests of justice
for an accused to be denied the right to make full answer and defence and, pursuant
to s. 278.5(2) the trial judge is merely directed to “consider” and “take into
account” the factors and rights listed.  Where the record sought can be
established as “likely relevant”, the judge must consider the rights and
interests of all those affected by production and decide whether it is
necessary in the interests of justice that he or she take the next step of
viewing the documents.  If in doubt, the interests of justice require that the
judge take that step.

 

(5)  Stage Two -- Production to the Accused,
Section 278.7: The Consideration of Societal Interests, Sections
278.5(2)(f) and (g), and the Integrity of the Trial  Process,
Section 278.5(2)(h)

 

139                       
Once the first hurdle is passed and the records are produced to the
judge, the judge must determine whether it is in the interests of justice that
they be produced to the defence.  Again the judge must be satisfied that the
records are “likely relevant” and that production, this time to the accused, is
necessary in the interests of justice.  In making this decision, the judge must
once again consider the factors set out in s. 278.5(2).

 








140                       
The respondent accepts that weighing competing interests is appropriate
at this second stage of the analysis.  However, the respondent contends that
the requirement under s. 278.7(2), that the trial judge take the factors
specified in s. 278.5(2)(a) to (h) into account, inappropriately
alters the constitutional balance established in O’Connor. 
Specifically, the respondent contends that ss. 278.5(2)(f) and (g)
elevate the societal interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences
and encouraging of treatment of complainants of sexual offences, to a status
equal to the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  This, he
suggests, alters the constitutional balance established in O’Connor,
where the majority specifically determined these factors to be of secondary
importance to defence interests in any balancing of competing interests and
better taken into account through other avenues. The respondent also contends
that s. 278.5(2)(h) unfairly requires trial judges to consider the
effect of disclosure on the integrity of the trial process.  The respondent
submits that this is a question going to admissibility.

 

141                       
These concerns are largely answered by the analysis advanced under s.
278.5(2), discussed at greater length above.  Trial judges are not required to
rule conclusively on each of the factors nor are they required to determine
whether  factors relating to the privacy and equality of the complainant or
witness “outweigh”  factors relating to the accused’s right to full answer and
defence.  To repeat, trial judges are only asked to “take into account” the
factors listed in s. 278.5(2) when determining whether production of part or
all of the impugned record to the accused is necessary in the interest of
justice (s. 278.7(1) ).

 








142                       
The respondent argues that the inclusion of the societal interest
factors in ss. 278.5(2)(f) and (g) alters the constitutional
balance established by the O’Connor majority.  With respect, this
argument is unsound.  Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. explicitly held that such
factors were relevant and ought to be “taken into account in weighing the
competing interests” (para. 33).  Their concern was solely that such factors
not be given controlling weight.  The interpretation of s. 278.5(2) advanced
above respects this concern.  Nonetheless, it is worth noting that when
considering the factors set out in ss. 278.5(2)(f) and (g), trial
judges should acknowledge that such factors will likely arise in every case and
may be more readily supported by evidence, and take them into account
accordingly.

 

143                       
This leaves the argument that s. 278.5(2)(h) goes to admissibility
and that any consideration of it at the stage of production distorts the
fairness of the trial.  While the O’Connor majority held that this
factor was “more appropriately dealt with at the  admissibility stage”, this
conclusion does not amount to a finding that a consideration of this factor at
the stage of production would result in unfairness to the accused: see O’Connor,
at para. 32.  As noted above, when preparing Bill C-46 Parliament had the
advantage of being able to assess how the O’Connor regime was
operating.  From the information available to Parliament and the submissions it
received during the consultation process, Parliament concluded that the effect
of production on the integrity of the trial was a factor that should be
included in the list of factors for trial judges to “take into account” at both
stages of an application for production.  Several interveners have interpreted
this factor as requiring courts to consider, along with the other enumerated
factors, whether the search for truth would be advanced by the production of
the records in question; that is, the question is whether the material in
question would introduce discriminatory biases and beliefs into the
fact-finding process.  We agree with this interpretation of the inquiry
required by s. 278.5(2)(h) and believe it to be in keeping with the
purposes set out in the preamble of the legislation.  

 








144                       
By giving judges wide discretion to consider a variety of factors and
requiring them to make whatever order is necessary in the interest of justice
at both stages of an application for production, Parliament has created a
scheme that permits judges not only to preserve the complainant’s privacy and
equality rights to the maximum extent possible, but also to ensure that the
accused has access to the documents required to make full answer and defence. 

 

(6)  Timing

 

145                       
Concerns were raised as to how the legislation would work in practice. 
One concern was that the application must be made to the trial judge: s.
278.3(1).  This suggests that it may be deferred to the eve of trial or at the
trial itself, allowing the accused little time for consideration of whether and
how the records may relate to the accused’s defence.  One way of avoiding this
is through the early assignment of the trial judge, a common practice in
prosecutions of serious criminal offences.  The trial judge may canvas the
possibility of applications for production well in advance of the trial,
leaving time for follow-up applications if the first is unsuccessful.  

 

VII. Conclusion and Disposition

 

146                       
In the result we would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments of
Belzil J., and uphold the constitutionality of Bill C-46.  We answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.               Do ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringe s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 








Answer:      No.

 

2.               If so, is the infringement
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society?

 

Answer:      Given the answer to question 1, it is
not necessary to answer this question.

 

3.               Do ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringe s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:      No.

 

 

4.               If so, is the infringement
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society?

 

Answer:      Given the answer to question 3, it is
not necessary to answer this question.

Between 1984 and 1991, the accused,  holding himself out as a
photographer with connections to a modelling agency,  invited the complainants,
who ranged in age from 15 to 20, to pose for a portfolio of photographs with a
view to initiating a modelling career.  He persuaded all of them to pose nude
or semi-nude, and some of them were photographed in bondage.  The accused
allegedly sexually assaulted the complainants D., K., S. and R. while they were
posing in various stages of undress or were tied up and completely vulnerable. 
In the cases of B. and D., it was alleged that the accused threatened to send
revealing photographs to either their parents or to a pornographic magazine if
they did not agree to perform sexual favours for him.  While D. ignored the
accused’s threats, B. acceded to them and performed sexual favours over the
course of a two- to three-month period in exchange for the negatives.  In her
testimony, B. indicated that during that period there were at least two
incidents in which the accused persisted in sexual activity after she had
communicated her lack of consent.  The accused testified that any sexual
activity between B. and himself was consensual and that the photography
sessions began after they had already been involved in a sexual relationship. 
He thus had no reason to threaten to expose the complainant, and never did so. 
In the case of D.,  the accused admitted taking her photos, but denied that any
semi-nude photos were taken or that any sexual impropriety had occurred.  He
also denied trying to extort sexual favours from her, as there were no
photographs with which to threaten her.  With respect to K., S. and R.,  the
accused claimed that any sexual contact  was consensual.  The trial judge
convicted the accused of two counts of extortion against B. and D. and of five
counts of sexual assault against the five complainants.  On appeal, the
majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 








It is a crime to extort sexual favours.   Although the extortion
provision is located in the Part of the Criminal Code  entitled “Offences
Against Rights of Property”,  the word “anything” in the provision is not 
limited to things of a proprietary or pecuniary nature.  Headings will never be
determinative of legislative intention, but are merely one factor to be taken
into account.  In this case, the extortion provision’s location in the Criminal
Code  is outweighed by competing considerations in determining the scope of
“anything”.  First, the ordinary meaning of “anything” in its immediate context
is clear and supports a broad interpretation, which would include sexual
favours. Second, an interpretation of “anything” that includes sexual favours
is suggested by the purpose and nature of the offence of extortion.  That
purpose, which  can be directly inferred from the wording of the provision, is
that extortion criminalizes intimidation and interference with freedom of
choice.  Given this objective, it would be unreasonable to criminalize
extortion of money or property, but not extortion of sexual favours.  Third,
Parliament could have easily limited the scope of the word “anything” to things
of a proprietary or pecuniary nature.  Finally,  a number of Canadian courts
have found that “anything” includes sexual favours.

 

It is unnecessary in this case to decide whether there is consent to
sexual activity if it is obtained by threatened exposure of nude photographs. 
The accused’s conviction of sexually assaulting B. may be affirmed on the basis
of an independent sexual assault, wholly apart from his extortionate conduct. 
B. testified that, during the two- to three-month period in which she went to
the accused’s apartment and had sexual intercourse with him in exchange for the
negatives, there were at least two incidents in which the accused persisted in
sexual activity after she had unambiguously communicated her lack of consent. 
The trial judge found B. to be a credible witness and this Court is satisfied
that the events unfolded as the complainant described them.  This evidence
supports a conviction of sexual assault.

 








Even though this is an appeal as of right pursuant to s. 691(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code  and the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal
dissented only on the extortion and sexual assault convictions in relation to
B., the Court has jurisdiction to address the application of Kienapple
in the case of B.  The Court’s jurisdiction over both the extortion and sexual
assault convictions must, of necessity, include the jurisdiction to make
whatever order that is required to dispose of these grounds of appeal.  The
Court cannot make an order that would violate established principles or rules
of law.  In the case of B., there is a possibility that in affirming the
convictions without considering the potential application of Kienapple
the Court might be convicting the accused of multiple offences arising from the
same delict. Such a disposition would be illegal, as it would contravene an
established legal principle.  Here, there is not a sufficient factual nexus
between the extortion and sexual assault convictions to trigger the application
of Kienapple in the case of B.  The convictions arise out of different
factual transactions.  Any one of the occasions over the two- to three-month
period in which the accused engaged in sexual activity with B. is sufficient to
ground the extortion conviction.  By contrast, the sexual assault conviction
arises from one or two specific occasions in which B. explicitly communicated
her lack of consent to sexual contact. 

 

In the case of K., assuming, without deciding, that the trial judge
failed to consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, a
review of the evidence leads to the conclusion that there was no air of reality
to the defence.  Even if the testimony of the accused is completely accepted,
it discloses that, at a minimum, he was wilfully blind as to whether K.
consented to the fondling of her breasts and vagina.   There is no suggestion
by the accused that K. posed nude for any reason other than to further her
modelling career.  Nor was there any evidence that she invited him to touch her
prior to his fondling of her breasts and vagina. 

 








The trial judge did not err in his application of the principle of
reasonable doubt.  He clearly directed himself properly and his judgment
reveals a thorough review of the evidence.  In the cases of S. and R., the
trial judge’s remarks that he was “not convinced” that the complainants
consented to the sexual activity in question suggest, when read out of context,
that he may have reversed the burden of proof.  These remarks, however, when
viewed in the context of the entire judgment, were effectively neutralized by
other passages.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by








1                                  
The Chief Justice
– This is an appeal as of right of the appellant’s convictions of five counts
of sexual assault and two counts of extortion involving five complainants.  The
appellant challenged his convictions on a number of grounds.  The main issue to
be decided in this appeal is whether the scope of the offence of extortion as
set out in the Criminal Code  includes the extortion of sexual favours.

 

I.  Factual
Background

 

2                                  
The appellant was charged with a total of 10 counts involving seven
complainants: four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 246.1(1)(a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 271(1) (a)), on
complainants C.B., P.V.B., T.R., and C.D.;  two counts of extortion contrary to
s. 305(1) (now s. 346(1)) involving complainants P.V.B. and C.D.; one count of
buggery contrary to  s. 155 (now s. 159) involving complainant T.R.; and  three
counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,  on complainants E.V.K., D.A.S., and J.C.H. 
The events which are the subject of the charges occurred on various dates
between 1984 and 1991.  The facts in this case are quite intricate and were set
out in considerable detail in the trial judgment.  A brief overview is provided
below.  I will discuss the facts in greater detail in my review of the trial
judgment.

 








3                                  
In every case the appellant held himself out as a photographer with
connections to a modelling agency.  In actual fact he had no such connections. 
Under this guise, he would interest the complainants, who ranged in age from 15
to 20, in the idea of having a portfolio of photographs taken with a view to
initiating a modelling career.  He persuaded all of the complainants to pose
nude or semi-nude, and four of the complainants were photographed in bondage. 
In all but one of the cases he allegedly sexually assaulted the complainants
while they were posing in various stages of undress.  Some of them were
assaulted when they were tied up and completely vulnerable.  In the cases of
P.V.B. and C.D., it was alleged that the appellant threatened either to send
some of the more revealing photographs to their parents or to a pornographic
magazine if they did not agree to perform sexual favours for him.  While C.D.
ignored the appellant’s threats, P.V.B. acceded to them and performed sexual
favours over the course of a two- to three-month period in exchange for the
negatives of the impugned photographs.

 

4                                  
The appellant was convicted of sexual assault on E.V.K., D.A.S., T.R.
and of extortion and sexual assault in the cases of P.V.B. and C.D.  He was
acquitted of the charges of sexual assault relating to C.B. and J.C.H., and of
the charge of buggery involving T.R.  He was sentenced to a total of nine years
imprisonment.  This was later reduced to seven years by the Newfoundland Court
of Appeal.

 

5                                  
The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeals
against the convictions.  O’Neill J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the
appeals and ordered a new trial on the counts of sexual assault involving
E.V.K., D.A.S., T.R. and C.D.  He would have acquitted the appellant on the
count of sexual assault involving P.V.B. and on the counts of extortion
involving P.V.B. and C.D. 

                                                                                                                                          

II.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

6                                  
The relevant section of the Criminal Code  at the time of the
events was as follows:

 

305. (1) Every one who, without reasonable
justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain anything, by threats,
accusations, menaces or violence induces or attempts to induce any person,
whether or not he is the person threatened, accused or menaced or to whom
violence is shown, to do anything or cause anything to be done, is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.








 

III.  Judicial
History

 

A. Supreme
Court of Newfoundland, Trial Division, [1993] N.J. No. 143 (QL)

 

7                                  
Easton J. addressed two issues at trial that are not before this Court
on appeal.  The first was whether the Crown fulfilled its obligation of timely
disclosure in respect of its intention to call expert evidence regarding post traumatic
stress syndrome in sexual assault cases, as well as expert toxicological
evidence.  The second was whether similar fact evidence should have been
introduced at trial.  He found that the Crown made adequate disclosure.  He
would also have admitted similar fact evidence, but limited its use to the modus
operandi used by the appellant and as a tool in the assessment of the
credibility of all witnesses.

 

8                                  
After cautioning himself as to the proper application of the presumption
of innocence in a case with a large number of complainants and a total of 10
charges, he then turned to an assessment of the evidence presented by each
complainant and the appellant on each count.  I will not review the evidence
pertaining to the complainant C.B.  The appellant was acquitted of sexually
assaulting her and his acquittal is not in issue in this appeal.

 

(1)  P.V.B.

 








9                                  
P.V.B., who was 15-16 years old at the time of the events in question,
came to know the appellant through the motorcycle federation of which he was
the chairman.  The complainant went to the appellant’s residence in the early
spring of 1985 for several photo sessions.  After some coaxing, nude
photographs were taken.  She testified that she kept asking the appellant about
the photographs but he refused to show them to her.  She finally refused to
pose for any more photographs and insisted that he give her the negatives.  The
appellant told her that if she wanted the negatives she would have to perform
sexual favours for him, and if she refused, he would send the photographs to
her mother.

 

10                              
The complainant explained that because of her fear that she would be, in
her words, “exposed”, she agreed to his terms.  Her evidence was that for the
next two to three months she would regularly go to the appellant’s apartment to
have sexual intercourse with him.  During these visits she was subjected to
bondage and whipping, and had vibrators and dildos inserted in her vagina.  At
the end of each session, she received a strip of negatives.  She collected them
all and burned them.  A friend of P.V.B.’s and her boyfriend of the time
confirmed that they were aware of the “arrangement” she had with the appellant,
and the friend saw P.V.B. destroy some of the negatives.

 

11                              
The appellant’s claim was that any sexual activity between the
complainant and himself was consensual and that the photography sessions only
began after they had been involved in a sexual relationship for some time.  As
a result, he would have had no reason to threaten to expose the complainant,
and he never did so.

 

12                              
Easton J. accepted P.V.B.’s evidence, and convicted the appellant of
sexual assault contrary to s. 246.1(1)(a), and extortion contrary to s.
305(1).

 

(2)  C.D.

 








13                              
C.D. met the appellant at a local mall during the summer of 1984.  She
was 19 years old at the time.  Photographs were eventually taken at C.D.’s
parents’ home.  A second session was later arranged in the basement of her
apartment building.  A friend of hers was present at this second photo
session.  At one point during the shoot, she asked her friend to go and check
on her daughter who was upstairs with a third person.  While her friend was
away, the appellant asked her to take off her clothes.  She refused, and he
became angry and said that she was wasting his time.  After some persuasion,
she took off her top.  He then grabbed her breasts with his hands, squeezed
them, and made lewd comments.  The complainant testified that she was shocked
and did not know what to do.  The appellant then slid his hand inside her
bikini bottom and onto her vagina.  C.D. claimed she became very upset and got
up just as her friend returned from checking on her daughter.  The appellant
packed up his photographic equipment and left.

 

14                              
C.D. testified that he later returned to her apartment and brought the
photographs with him.  She told him they were disgusting.  He replied that she
would have to pay for them if she wanted them back.  A figure was mentioned but
she did not have the money.  The appellant then told her that if she went to
bed with him, she would not have to pay.  He also threatened to publish the
photographs in a pornographic magazine and to put others in her father's
mailbox if she did not have sex with him although he did not, in the end, carry
out his threats.

 

15                              
The appellant admitted taking photographs of the complainant, but denied
that any semi-nude photos were taken or that any sexual impropriety had
occurred. He also denied trying to extort sexual favours from her, as there
were no photographs with which to threaten her.

 








16                              
Easton J. accepted the complainant’s evidence and convicted the
appellant of sexual assault contrary to s. 246.1(1)(a) and of extortion
contrary to s. 305(1).

 

(3)  E.V.K.

 

17                              
E.V.K., who was approximately 20 years old at the time of the alleged
assault, met the appellant near the Fraser Mall in August 1990. The appellant
approached her and asked if she would consider modelling.  She expressed
interest, and later attended his apartment on several occasions for photo
sessions.  At her last photo session, the appellant convinced her to pose nude
and tied her wrists with ropes to hooks in an archway in his apartment.  While
she was tied up, he came up behind her, touched her breasts, and fondled and
inserted a finger in her vagina.  She asked him: ""[D]o you have to do
that?"" and he said: ""No.""  He then untied her, brought over a
chair, and proceeded to tie her to the chair.  He again fondled her breasts and
vagina.  According to her evidence she saw his reflection in the glass of the
stereo and watched him undo his pants.  She asked him to untie her. He did, but
not before touching her vagina with his penis. 

 

18                              
The accused  confirmed the two incidents in his testimony but claimed
they were consensual.  Easton J. disagreed, and convicted him of sexual assault
contrary to s. 271(1) (a).

 

(4)  T.R.

                    








19                              
T.R., who was 19 years old at the time of the assault, was approached by
the appellant in the spring of 1986.  She posed for semi-nude photographs at
his apartment.  A couple of weeks later, she returned to his apartment. 
Photographs were taken and some wine was consumed.  The appellant suggested
some bondage shots, and she agreed.  He tied her wrists to each side of the
archway, and while he was behind her, he moved her clothes aside and had
intercourse with her from behind.  She said she tried to stop him when he tried
to put his penis in her vagina, but he did not until he ejaculated.  She was
very upset and he untied her.  According to her testimony, they had more wine
and he assured her that nothing of that nature would ever happen again.  She
later posed over a blanket on a coffee table. The appellant coaxed her into
being tied to the table.  She was fairly drunk at the time.  He took some more
photographs of her, then sodomized her.  Afterwards, he untied her and she
gathered her belongings and left.  She later came back to his apartment to see
some of the photographs, but there was no sexual contact, nor were any
photographs taken.

 

20                              
The evidence of the appellant was considerably different than that of
the complainant.  He testified that he had a sexual relationship with T.R.
prior to the events in question.  He also claimed that the two incidents T.R.
complained of – intercourse and anal intercourse – did not occur on the same
night.  He admitted that he had intercourse with the complainant while she was
tied up, but that it was wholly consensual and that they had later gone into
the bedroom to continue having sex.  The anal intercourse took place on another
occasion.  It was his evidence that T.R. had discussed the idea with him.  She
then performed oral sex on him until he became aroused and he reciprocated
before anally penetrating her with her consent.  The appellant also described
another consensual sexual encounter following the alleged offences when the
complainant came over to look at photographs.

 








21                              
Easton J. convicted the appellant of sexual assault contrary to s.
246.1(1)(a).  Although he wasn’t sure whether the anal intercourse
occurred on the same night as the sexual assault, even if the complainant’s
evidence that it occurred on the same night was accepted, he had grave doubts
about her credibility vis-à-vis this second episode.  He found it
surprising that the complainant would allow herself to be put in an even more
vulnerable and compromising position following a sexual assault.  Accordingly,
he was not convinced that the anal sex was not consensual and he acquitted the
appellant of buggery.

 

(5)  D.A.S. and J.C.H.

 

22                              
The sexual assault on D.A.S. allegedly occurred on the night of August
4, 1991.  D.A.S., who was 15 years old at the time, went to Davis’s apartment
with her friend J.C.H., who had previously posed for photographs with the
appellant.  After a discussion about modelling, D.A.S. signed a consent form. 
She was then asked to stay in the bedroom for about half an hour while
photographs were taken of J.C.H.  D.A.S. then remembers being photographed as
she was tied to the archway, and said that the appellant  tried to take the
straps off her bathing suit and touched her breasts and pinched her nipples
""to make them hard"".  D.A.S. told him to leave her alone, and he
untied her.  This was the only allegation of sexual assault she made.  The next
thing she remembered was J.C.H. phoning for a ride and leaving the appellant’s
apartment.

 

23                              
D.A.S.’s recollection of the events was sketchy, and there was a period
of about one and one‑half hours for which she could not account.  She
could not remember how she got tied up, and did not know if she consented to
sexual activity with the appellant during that time frame.

 








24                              
J.C.H., who was 17 years old, had previously been to the appellant’s
apartment and posed nude for him.  On August 4, while D.A.S. was in the
bedroom, it was J.C.H.’s testimony that he tied her to a chair and inserted a
dildo in her vagina without her consent.  She said nothing because she was
scared.  She further alleged that the appellant had touched her breasts while
she was tied to the archway.  She also offered the following account of the
sexual activities between the appellant and D.A.S.: the appellant tied D.A.S.
to a chair and had J.C.H. perform oral sex on him.  The appellant then inserted
his penis in D.A.S., who was crying at the time, and ejaculated over her.  They
left shortly afterwards, after being picked up by J.C.H.’s former boyfriend. 
He confirmed that when he picked them up both J.C.H. and D.A.S. appeared upset,
and that D.A.S. seemed to be annoyed with J.C.H.

 

25                              
The appellant claimed that he had slept with J.C.H. on one of her
previous visits, and that any sexual activity that took place, including the
incidents on the night of August 4, was purely consensual.  It was his evidence
that on the night in question J.C.H. was urging  D.A.S. to pose for
photographs, and that J.C.H. suggested D.A.S. be tied to the chair.  Once tied
up, J.C.H. inserted a vibrator into D.A.S. and motioned him over and gave him
oral sex.  He said that J.C.H. then took out the vibrator and that he had
intercourse with D.A.S. while J.C.H. was urging him on.  He ejaculated over
D.A.S., then untied her.  D.A.S. then said: ""Get out, get me out of
here"", which the appellant said was in response to J.C.H.’s proposal of
lesbian sex with her. 

 

26                              
A video of J.C.H. that had been seized at the appellant’s residence was
also shown to the court.  It included a segment in which J.C.H., who was
obviously a willing participant, was masturbating herself with a dildo.
According to the appellant, the video had been made sometime after August 4,
1991.  J.C.H. denied having any knowledge whatsoever of this video.

 








27                              
Easton J. found it extremely difficult to reconstruct the events of the
night in question.  D.A.S. did not remember many events and contradicted
herself at times.  In addition, there were numerous discrepancies between
J.C.H.’s and  D.A.S.’s testimony.  Nevertheless, he found at paras. 95-97: 

 

Here, even though we have the claimed lapse of memory; which I found
suspect on the part of the complainant, this is not to say that she was not
sexually assaulted. For many reasons she may not have told what I believe
happened that evening at that residence.  While her evidence about the pinching
of her breasts may or may not have been true and was the only sexual assault
which she asserted had occurred, nevertheless, I am not convinced that a sexual
assault did not in fact take place.

 

... In my view, here there is other evidence, including that of the
accused, which proves to me beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did, in
fact, commit a sexual assault upon the complainant without her consent....
[T]he accused admits that he had sex with the complainant.... He stated that
the complainant, D.A.S. was very upset.  It was his evidence that D.A.S.'s arms
and legs had been tied and that D.A.S. was complaining while being tied to the
chair.... D.A.S. said: ""Get out, get out"". While the accused tries to
divert this comment more towards J.C.H. than himself, I am not convinced that
it was not equally applicable to him.

 

I also accept the evidence of J.C.H. that at the
time the accused inserted his penis in D.A.S., she was crying. I take this as a
manifestation of lack of consent.

He convicted
Davis of sexually assaulting D.A.S., contrary to s. 271(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code .

 

28                              
Easton J. acquitted Davis of sexually assaulting J.C.H.   The fact that
she did not remember doing the video, in which she appeared to be a willing
participant, along with the fact that similar memory losses were claimed by
C.B. and D.A.S., who were all good friends, cast doubts on her credibility.  

 

B. Newfoundland
Court of Appeal (1998), 159 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 273

 

(1) Green J.A. for the majority (Steele J.A. concurring)

 








29                              
The appellant challenged his convictions on a number of grounds.  I will
deal with each ground of appeal in the order disposed of by the majority of the
Court of Appeal.

 

30                              
Green J.A. first dismissed the appellant’s arguments that the trial
judge erred in holding that the Crown fulfilled its disclosure obligations and
in admitting similar fact evidence.  He then turned to consider more specific
grounds of appeal relating to individual charges.

 

31                              
The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in a number of respects
in convicting him of extortion in the cases of P.V.B. and C.D.  His principal
argument was that the word “anything” in s. 346(1)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly 305(1)), was limited to things of a proprietary
or pecuniary nature and therefore did not include sexual favours.  Green J.A.
rejected this argument.  Relying on the case of R. v. Bird (1969), 9
C.R.N.S. 1 (B.C.C.A.), he held that the scope of the word “anything” extended
to intangibles and included sexual favours.  Acknowledging that the trial judge
did not undertake a specific analysis of the law of extortion, he nevertheless
found after a review of the record that the necessary elements of the offence
were established.  He therefore dismissed this ground of appeal.  

 








32                              
The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in convicting him of
sexual assault in the case of P.V.B.  Although P.V.B. chose to have sexual
intercourse with him as a result of his threatened exposure of nude photographs
of her, the appellant submitted that a threat of this nature did not render her
choice non-consensual.  He argued that s. 265(3) (b) (formerly s. 244(3)(b)),
which refers to threats of force, was exhaustive of the types of threats that
vitiate consent.  Green J.A. found that threatened exposure of nude photographs
did not fall within the ambit of s. 265(3) .  However, relying on R. v.
Coughlan (1992), 100 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 326 (Nfld. C.A.), and R. v.
Caskenette (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 439 (B.C.C.A.), he concluded that s.
265(3)  was not exhaustive of the circumstances in which threats can vitiate
consent.  He also held that the appellant’s threat in this case was
sufficiently coercive to vitiate the complainant’s consent.  Accordingly, he
dismissed this ground of appeal.

 

33                              
Green J.A. then considered the appellant’s argument that the principle
against multiple convictions arising from the same delict articulated by this
Court in  Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729,
should have precluded one of the two convictions on the charges related to
P.V.B.   He found that for the Kienapple principle to apply, there must
be both a factual and legal nexus between the offences.  In this case there was
not a sufficient legal nexus between extortion and sexual assault, given the
different societal interests the two offences sought to protect.  He dismissed
this ground of appeal.     

 

34                              
The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in not considering
whether there was an air of reality to the defence of honest but mistaken
belief in consent in the case of E.V.K.  Green J.A. held that the trial judge’s
failure to advert to the defence in an otherwise detailed judgment raised the
question of whether he failed to consider it.  Another possibility was that the
trial judge had decided the defence had no “air of reality” and therefore did
not need to be addressed in his reasons.  Finding it impossible to resolve this
question from a review of the judgment, Green J.A. conducted a review of the
evidence and concluded there was no air of reality to the defence, and
therefore dismissed this ground of appeal.

 








35                              
Finally, Green J.A. addressed the appellant’s contention that the trial
judge erred in his application of the principle of reasonable doubt in the
cases of all five complainants.  He noted that the trial judge made two
problematic statements in the cases of D.A.S. and T.R. where, in reviewing the
evidence, he said he was “not convinced” that the complainants consented to the
sexual activity in question.  Green J.A. found that the trial judge properly
directed himself as to the presumption of innocence and the principle of
reasonable doubt at the outset of his judgment.  He concluded that the
problematic remarks, when viewed in the context of the entire judgment, were
effectively neutralized by other passages.  Green J.A. also found that the
verdicts were all reasonable and supported by the evidence.

 

(2) O’Neill J.A. in dissent

 

36                              
O’Neill J.A. would have acquitted the appellant on both counts of
extortion.  Adopting the views of A.W. Mewett and M. Manning (Mewett &
Manning on Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 833), he found that the word 
“anything” in the context of s. 346(1)  could only refer to “something of some
tangible proprietary or pecuniary nature”.  Therefore, “anything” could not
include sexual acts.  With respect to the extortion of sexual favours
from C.D., O’Neill J.A. found that the offence required that an actual attempt
be made by the appellant.  An attempt in law required something more than a
statement of intention.  There was no evidence of any further contact between
the appellant and the complainant after the meeting in her apartment, nor was
there evidence to show that anything was done by the appellant in furtherance
of the threats.  Accordingly, the charge should have been dismissed. 

 

37                              
O’Neill J.A. would have acquitted the appellant of sexual assault in the
case of P.V.B.  Relying on R. v. Guerrero (1988), 64 C.R. (3d) 65 (Ont.
C.A.), he found that s. 265(3)  was exhaustive of the circumstances in which
threats vitiate consent. 

 








38                              
With respect to the appellant’s conviction of sexual assault in the case
of E.V.K., O’Neill J.A. found that the trial judge was in error in not
considering whether there was an air of reality to the defence of honest but
mistaken belief in consent, and would have ordered a new trial.

 

39                              
Finally, O’Neill J.A. held that the trial judge erred in his application
of the principle of reasonable doubt in the cases of all five complainants.  He
found that the trial judge made two notable errors.  First, in each case the
trial judge failed to consider all of the evidence in determining whether there
was a reasonable doubt in the manner set out by this Court’s decision in R.
v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  Second, that in the cases of D.A.S. and
T.R., the trial judge used language that suggests that he reversed the onus on
the burden of proof from the Crown to the appellant.  He would have ordered new
trials on the charges of sexual assault in the cases of D.A.S., T.R., and C.D. 
O’Neill J.A. specifically did not dissent on the reasonableness of verdicts or
whether they were supported by the evidence. 

 

IV.  Issues

 

40                              
This is an appeal as of right, and the issues on which this Court has
jurisdiction are limited to questions of law on which O’Neill J.A. dissented. 
There are five issues:

 

1. Is it a crime to extort sexual favours? 

 

2. Is there consent to sexual activity if it is obtained by threatened
exposure of nude photographs?

 








3. Does the Kienapple principle apply to the convictions of
extortion and sexual assault in the case of P.V.B.?

 

4. Did the trial judge err in failing to consider the defence of honest
but mistaken belief in consent in convicting the appellant of sexually
assaulting E.V.K.?

 

5. Did the trial judge err in his application of the principle of
reasonable doubt in the cases of all five complainants?

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.                Is it a crime to extort sexual
favours?

 

41                              
Is it a crime to extort sexual favours?  The answer to this question
depends on the scope of the word “anything” in the extortion provision of the Criminal
Code .  The appellant was charged under s. 305 , where extortion was defined
as follows: 

 

305. (1) Every one who, without reasonable
justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain anything, by threats,
accusations, menaces or violence induces or attempts to induce any person,
whether or not he is the person threatened, accused or menaced or to whom
violence is shown, to do anything or cause anything to be done, is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

Section 305(1)
was slightly modified in 1985 (S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 47).  It is now s. 346(1) ,
which reads as follows:

 








346. (1) Every one commits extortion who,
without reasonable justification or excuse and with intent to obtain anything,
by threats, accusations, menaces or violence induces or attempts to induce any
person, whether or not he is the person threatened, accused or menaced or to
whom violence is shown, to do anything or cause anything to be done.

 

Both Green
J.A. and O’Neill J.A. referred to s. 346(1) in their reasons.  While ss. 305(1)
and 346(1) are virtually identical, the words “with intent to extort or gain”
precede the first reference to “anything” in s. 305, whereas the words “with
intent to obtain” precede the first reference to “anything” in s. 346.  Given
this subtle difference and the fact that the appellant was charged and
convicted under s. 305, I will refer to s. 305 in the course of my analysis.

 

42                              
In Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at
para. 21, the Court adopted the following passage from Driedger’s Construction
of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983)  as the general approach to be taken to
statutory construction:

 

Today there is only one principle or approach,
namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their
grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.

 

43                              
I begin with the grammatical and ordinary sense of “anything”.  The Oxford
English Dictionary  (2nd ed. 1989), vol. 1, defines anything as follows: 
“A combination of  ANY and THING, in the widest sense of the latter, with all
the varieties of sense belonging to ANY.”  The dictionary definition suggests a
broad interpretation, which would include sexual favours.  Such an
interpretation is also supported by the immediate context of the provision. 
“Anything” is referred to three times in s. 305(1):

 

305. (1) Every one who, without reasonable
justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain anything, by
threats, accusations, menaces or violence induces or attempts to induce any
person, whether or not he is the person threatened, accused or menaced or to
whom violence is shown, to do anything or cause anything to be done, is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen
years. [Emphasis added.]








 

In my view,
the meaning of “anything” in the immediate context of “to extort or gain
anything” and inducing any person “to do anything or cause anything to be done”
is clearly in keeping with the wide, unrestricted dictionary definition, and
includes sexual favours.

 

44                              
Mewett and Manning, supra, take a differing view.  Commenting on R.
v. Bird, they argue at p. 833 that:

 

Not a great deal of discussion appears in Bird on
this wide interpretation of “anything”, the court being content to say that the
word is clear and unambiguous and used in this context is of wide unrestricted
application.  Yet this is not what is normally meant by “extort or gain”.  It
is true that, in isolation, “anything” can be of the widest meaning, but in the
context of “extort or gain”, one might have thought that it referred to
something of some tangible proprietary or pecuniary nature. 

 

I respectfully
disagree.  I do not believe the authors place sufficient weight on the fact
that the meaning of “anything” is further qualified by the words “to do
anything or  cause anything to be done” at the end of the section.   

 








45                              
I also find that an interpretation of “anything” that includes sexual
favours is suggested by the purpose and nature of the offence of extortion. 
Extortion criminalizes intimidation and interference with freedom of choice. 
It punishes those who, through threats, accusations, menaces, or violence
induce or attempt to induce their victims into doing anything or causing
anything to be done.  Threats, accusations, menaces and violence clearly
intimidate: see R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at p. 81; R. v.
Clemente, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, at pp. 761-62.  When threats are coupled
with demands, there is an inducement to accede to the demands.  This interferes
with the victim’s freedom of choice, as the victim may be coerced into doing
something he or she would otherwise have chosen not to do.

 

46                              
Given this purpose, I find it difficult to accept the appellant’s
contention that “anything” should be limited to things of a proprietary or
pecuniary nature.  If the appellant’s argument is accepted, it would be
criminal to threaten exposure of nude photographs when coupled with a demand for
money, but it would not be criminal to make that same threat when coupled with
a demand for sex.  This strikes me as unreasonable, and at odds with the
purpose of the provision.  The threat is equally intimidating in both cases, as
the consequences of non-compliance are identical.  With respect to interference
with freedom of choice, in both cases the victim is asked to do something he or
she may not want to do.  It is likely that the victim would much sooner accede
to the monetary demand than the sexual demand.  Freedom of choice in sexual
matters is at least as highly valued as freedom of choice in matters concerning
property.  Accordingly, there is no reason to think that extortion of sexual
favours is not also a criminal offence.

 

47                              
It may be objected that this conception of the purpose of s. 305 is
overly broad, and does not take into account two important contextual factors:
that the offence of extortion was historically a property offence and that the
extortion provision was located in Part VII (now Part IX) of the Code,
entitled “Offences Against Rights of Property”.  When these factors are
properly taken into account, it is submitted that extortion only criminalizes
demands of a proprietary or pecuniary nature.  Accordingly, “anything” should
be given a more limited interpretation.

 








48                              
In assessing the arguments about the historical origins of the offence, 
I will briefly review the evolution of the offences of blackmail and extortion
in English and Canadian law.  In Great Britain, “[b]lackmail was originally the
tribute exacted by free-booters in the northern border countries to secure
lands and goods from despoilment or robbery”: see W. H. D. Winder, “The
Development of Blackmail” (1941), 5 Modern L. Rev. 21, at p. 24.  It
later came to denote a number of offences in which property or some other
advantage was demanded with threats: see G. L. Williams, “Blackmail”, [1954] Crim.
L. Rev. 79, at p. 79.  In the early stages of its development, the crime of
blackmail “seems to have been pretty well coextensive with robbery and
attempted robbery, but over the years the definition has been extended to
embrace more subtle methods of extortion”: J. C. Smith and B. Hogan, Criminal
Law (8th ed.  1996), at p. 618.   Extortion was originally a separate
common law offence punishing the conduct of public officials who sought
personal financial gain under colour of their office.  It has since been
statutorily expanded in some jurisdictions, such as Canada, to include more familiar
forms of blackmail.

 

49                              
The roots of s. 305  of the Criminal Code  lie in five separate and
relatively narrowly defined offences from the first Criminal Code  of
1892 (S.C. 1892, c. 29).   The five offences were defined in ss. 402 to 406,
and may be briefly described as follows: 

 

s. 402: Compelling the execution of a document by violence or restraint
or by the threat of violence or restraint.

 

s. 403: Uttering a letter or other writing demanding with menaces any         property,
chattel, money, valuable security or other valuable thing. 

 

s. 404: Demanding with menaces anything capable of being stolen with       intent
to steal it. 

 








s. 405: Accusing or threatening to accuse a person of certain listed
crimes  with intent to extort or gain anything or to compel the execution of a                                                                      document.


 

s. 406: Accusing or threatening to accuse a person of crimes other than
     those listed in s. 405 with intent to extort or gain anything or to 
compel                                                               the
execution of a document. 

 

Minor changes
were made to the provisions in the 1906 revision (R.S.C. 1906, c. 146), when
ss. 402 to 406 were renumbered as ss. 450 to 454, and in the 1927 revision
(R.S.C. 1927, c. 36).  In the comprehensive 1955 amendments (S.C. 1953-54, c.
51), ss. 450 to 455 were combined into one global offence called  “extortion”
and re-enacted as s. 291, which in turn was subsequently renumbered unchanged
as s. 305  in the 1970 revision (R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34).  

 

50                              
Legislative history may be used as an aid in determining the intention
of the legislature: see Rizzo Shoes, supra, at para. 31; see also
R. v. Vasil, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 469, at p. 487; Paul v. The Queen,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 621, at pp. 635, 653 and 660.  However, the legislative history
of s. 305  does not shed much light on the meaning of “anything”.  As Cartwright
J. (as he then was) held for a unanimous five-person bench in R. v.
Natarelli, [1967] S.C.R. 539,  at pp. 543-44:

 

It appears to me that the wording of s. 291 [later
s. 305 ] of the present Code is so different from that of ss. 450 to 454
of the former Code that little is to be gained from a consideration of
the cases decided under those sections.

 

The words of Lord Herschell in Bank of England v.
Vagliano Brothers [[1891] A.C. 107, at pp. 144‑45] appear to me to
be appropriate to the problem before us. They are accurately summarized in Halsbury,
3rd ed., vol. 36, p. 406, s. 614, as follows:








In construing a codifying statute the proper course
is, in the first instance, to examine its language and to ask what is its
natural meaning; it is an inversion of the proper order of consideration to
start with inquiring how the law previously stood, and then, assuming that it
was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the words of the
enactment will bear interpretation in conformity with this view.  The object of
a codifying statute has been said to be that on any point specifically dealt
with by it the law should be ascertained by interpreting the language used,
instead of roaming over a number of authorities.  After the language has been
examined without presumptions, resort must only be had to the previous state of
the law on some special ground, for example for the construction of provisions
of doubtful import, or of words which have acquired a technical meaning.

 

As a final
point regarding legislative history I would note that there is no Hansard
evidence or Committee Reports which illuminate Parliament’s intention in
enacting the new extortion provision in 1955.    

 

51                              
I turn now to the fact that extortion is located in the Part of the Code
entitled “Offences Against Rights of Property”.  The Court has held on a number
of occasions that headings may be used as an aid in statutory construction: see
Attorney-General of  Canada v. Jackson, [1946] S.C.R. 489, at pp.
495-96; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357;
Skoke-Graham v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 106, at pp. 119-20; R. v.
Lohnes, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 167, at p. 179.

 

52                              
In Skapinker, Estey J. discussed the role of headings in
constitutional interpretation.  His reasons are just as apposite to the
interpretation of ordinary statutes.  At pp. 376-77 he held:

 








It is clear that these headings were systematically and deliberately
included as an integral part of the Charter for whatever purpose.  At
the very minimum, the Court must take them into consideration when engaged in
the process of discerning the meaning and application of the provisions of the Charter. 
The extent of the influence of a heading in this process will depend upon many
factors including (but the list is not intended to be all-embracing) the degree
of difficulty by reason of ambiguity or obscurity in construing the section;
the length and complexity of the provision; the apparent homogeneity of the
provision appearing under the heading; the use of generic terminology in the
heading; the presence or absence of a system of headings which appear to
segregate the component elements of the Charter; and the relationship of
the terminology employed in the heading to the substance of the headlined
provision.

 

.
. .

 

I conclude that an attempt must be made to bring about a
reconciliation of the heading with the section introduced by it.  If,
however, it becomes apparent that the section when read as a whole is clear and
without ambiguity, the heading will not operate to change that clear and
unambiguous meaning.  Even in that midway position, a court should not, by
the adoption of a technical rule of construction, shut itself off from whatever
small assistance might be gathered from an examination of the heading as part
of the entire constitutional document. [Emphasis added.]

 

53                              
In my view, Estey J.’s approach to the role of headings in statutory
interpretation is the correct one.  Headings “should be considered part of the
legislation and should be read and relied on like any other contextual
feature”: Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), by R.
Sullivan, at p. 269.  The weight to be given to the heading will depend on the
circumstances.  Headings will never be determinative of legislative intention,
but are merely one factor to be taken into account: see Lohnes, supra,
at p. 179.

 

54                              
In this case, I find the fact that the extortion provision is located in
the “Offences Against Rights of Property” Part of the Code is outweighed
by competing considerations in determining the scope of “anything”.  First, the
ordinary meaning of “anything” in its immediate context is clear and supports a
broad interpretation.  Greater weight should be given to ordinary meaning than
to headings.  As Estey J. held in Skapinker, supra, at p. 377,
“[i]f . . . it becomes apparent that the section when read as a whole is clear
and without ambiguity, the heading will not operate to change that clear and
unambiguous meaning.”  See also Jackson, supra, at pp. 495-96,
per  Kellock J.  

 








55                              
Second, the purpose of s. 305  that can be directly inferred from the
wording of the provision is that extortion criminalizes intimidation and
interference with freedom of choice.  Given this objective, it would be
unreasonable to criminalize extortion of money or property, but not extortion
of sexual favours.  Adopting a narrower formulation of the purpose in light of
the heading would lead to this consequence.

 

56                              
Third, Parliament could have easily limited the scope of the word
“anything” to things of a proprietary or pecuniary nature.  In Great Britain,
the offence of blackmail is defined in s. 21 of the Theft Act 1968
(U.K.),  1968, c. 60, in part as follows:

 

(1) A person is guilty of blackmail if, with a view to gain for himself
or another or with intent to cause loss to another, he makes any unwarranted
demand with menaces;

 

The ordinary
meaning of “any unwarranted demand” is of similar breadth as “anything” in s.
305 .  However, the scope of s. 21 is expressly limited by s. 34 of the Theft
Act, which states that for the purposes of the Theft Act (and thus
for the purpose of s. 21) “‘gain’ and ‘loss’ are to be construed as extending
only to gain or loss in money or other property”.  The fact that Parliament did
not limit s. 305  in this manner is yet another reason in favour of adopting a
broad interpretation.

 

57                              
Finally, a number of courts in Canada have found that “anything”
includes sexual favours: see Bird, supra; R. v. D.K.P. (No. 1)
(1991), 11 W.A.C. 302 (B.C.); R. v. Bloch-Hansen (1977),  38 C.C.C.
(2d) 143 (Sask. Dist. Ct.).

 








58                              
For all these reasons, I agree with the British Columbia Court of Appeal
in Bird, supra, at p. 17, that “anything” should be given
a “wide unrestricted application” and that sexual favours fall “squarely within
the meaning of the word ‘anything’ as used in the section”.

 

59                              
I note that O’Neill J.A. dissented on the ground that the appellant did
not attempt to extort anything from C.D. because his threats amounted merely to
a statement of intention.  I respectfully disagree with this conclusion.  The
appellant’s threats clearly amounted to an attempt to extort sexual favours
from C.D., thereby constituting the actus reus of extortion, which
includes an attempt at inducing any person to do anything or to cause anything
to be done.  The attempt is completed once the offender threatens the victim
with a view to extorting or gaining anything.

 

B.                Is there consent to sexual
activity if it is obtained by threatened exposure of  nude photographs?

 

60                              
The trial judge found that P.V.B. chose to engage in sexual activity
with the appellant by reason of his threats to expose the nude photographs he
had taken of her.  He found this choice to be non-consensual and convicted the
appellant of sexual assault.

 

61                              
The appellant, adopting O’Neill J.A.’s dissent, argued that the trial
judge erred because s. 265(3) (b), which refers to threats of force, was
exhaustive of the circumstances in which no consent is obtained by reason of
threats.  The Crown took the contrary position, arguing that s. 265(3) (b)
was merely illustrative, and not exhaustive.

 

62                              
I find that I do not need to decide this issue.  The appellant’s
conviction of sexually assaulting P.V.B. may be affirmed on the basis of an
independent sexual assault, wholly apart from his extortionate conduct.  This
alternative basis of affirming the appellant’s conviction was argued by the
Crown.

 








63                              
Over the course of a two- to three-month period P.V.B. would go to the
appellant’s apartment and have sexual intercourse with him in exchange for the
negatives of the photographs he had taken of her.  By the appellant’s own
admission P.V.B. was tied up on several occasions.  On at least two such
occasions, P.V.B. testified that the appellant persisted in sexual activity
after she had unambiguously communicated her lack of consent.  I reproduce the following
excerpts from her examination in chief:

 

A. He would tie my wrists, one in each corner; and
my ankles                                      to the bottom corners and then
he would blindfold me and perform sexual acts on me in there[,] [i]nsert
objects in me and sometimes he would use a leather strap to hit me with.

 

Q. Where would he hit you?

 

A. He would hit me on various parts of my body and
on my vagina.

 

Q. Were you consenting to these activities, what
would you, what did you say to him?

 

A. No, I never told him anything to do to me.  And
I told him to stop hitting me with [the] strap, it was hurting me.

 

Q. Yes.

 

A. And he would continue to do so.
[Emphasis added.]

 

P.V.B. also
referred to at least one other incident in which the appellant persisted
notwithstanding her lack of consent:

 

A. He had me bent over the back of the couch with
each leg tied to a corner and my hands tied together and bound around the
middle leg of the couch and I was blindfolded and he was performing sexual acts
on me this way and it was very uncomfortable.  He was inserting objects in me
that were very uncomfortable and it was hurting me and I managed to get my
hands free and I took the blindfold off and I looked at him and said to
stop, he was hurting me and he said you’re not playing fair.  And the tone
of his voice and the look in his eyes frightened me that I went back to the
position and he tied my hands again and I just stayed still, just hoping that
it would be over soon so I could leave.

 








.
. .

 

Q.        There was that occasion where you had
broken free and told him to stop and you’d also mentioned other occasions when
he was strapping you?

 

A. Yes.

 

.
. .

 

Q. Okay.  What other forms of resistance did you
make known to him?

 

A. I had asked him to stop inserting large
objects because it was hurting me.  I was experiencing discomfort and pain and
he would not.  He would continue to do so.  Most times though, I was in
bondage, [so] I couldn’t stop him. [Emphasis added.]

 

64                              
Davis was cross-examined by Crown counsel as to these incidents.  I
reproduce the relevant excerpts:

 

Q. She was consenting to everything that took place.

 

A.        Yes.

 

Q.        How about the vegetables inserted up her?

 

A.        There was no vegetables inserted up her.

 

Q.        How about the dildos inserted up her?

 

A.        There was one time that I can recall, maybe twice, that the                                           vibrator
was used.

 

Q.        Consensual.

 

A.        Yes.

 

Q.        How about the strapping of her?

 

A.        She was never strapped.

 

Q.        The tying up, that took place.

 

A.        She was never blindfolded either.

 

Q.        Never blindfolded.  How about being bent over the couch?

 

A. She was.








Q.        She wasn’t blindfolded at that time.  She didn’t indicate it
hurt                                      at that time.

 

A.        She indicated that she was sore.

 

65                              
While the trial judge did not comment directly on these incidents in his
reasons, he did find P.V.B. to be a credible witness.  At para. 62 he held: “On
an overall assessment of the credibility of the complainant, it is fair to say
that she gave her evidence in a straightforward manner with no apparent
evasiveness”.  The trial judge made only one qualification to this conclusion:
“[O]n cross-examination it was evident that she was somewhat defensive and on
occasions almost belligerent”.  However, he quickly went on to add, “When
considering the nature of the evidence that was given and the type of
cross-examination which obviously had to be conducted, it is not surprising
that the witness would react in a defensive manner”.

 

66                              
By contrast, the trial judge found the appellant’s testimony
incredible.  The appellant contended that he had an ongoing consensual
relationship with P.V.B. well before the photography sessions took place, and
that P.V.B. initiated the sexual activity between them.  He denied ever threatening
to expose the photographs.  He said there was no reason to extort sex from her,
since they were already having sex anyway. Despite his testimony, the trial
judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant threatened to
expose the photographs and that any sexual activity that took place occurred
because of P.V.B.’s fear that the appellant would expose her.

 








67                              
Given the trial judge’s findings in this regard, I am satisfied that the
events unfolded as the complainant described them.  The testimony of a friend
of the complainant, provides further support for this conclusion.  P.V.B.’s
friend testified that on a couple of occasions following sexual encounters with
the appellant, P.V.B. arrived at her apartment distraught.  She further
testified that she knew P.V.B. was hurt because she was bleeding from her
vagina even though she was not menstruating.  I would note that her testimony
was accepted by the trial judge to corroborate P.V.B.’s testimony regarding the
burning of the negatives after P.V.B. received them from the appellant.  

 

68                              
The question, then, is whether this evidence supports a conviction of
sexual assault.  The Crown argued before us that it does.  I agree.  P.V.B.
clearly communicated her lack of consent to the appellant.  She asked him to
stop, yet he persisted.  He did so even though, through his own admission, he
knew she was “sore”.  As such, both the actus reus and mens rea
of sexual assault have been made out.  I would therefore affirm the appellant’s
conviction of sexual assault on these grounds.  

 

C.                Does the Kienapple principle
apply to the convictions of extortion and sexual assault in the case of P.V.B.?

 

69                              
The appellant argued that the Kienapple principle, which
precludes multiple convictions in respect of the same “delict”, “matter”, or
“cause”, ought to apply to his convictions of sexual assault and extortion in
relation to P.V.B.

 

70                              
As a preliminary matter, I will first consider whether the Court has
jurisdiction to address this issue.  At the hearing the Crown argued that the
Court does not have jurisdiction because this issue was not raised by O’Neill
J.A. in his dissenting judgment.  Since this is an appeal as of right pursuant
to s. 691(1)(a) of the Code, the jurisdiction of this Court is
limited to questions of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents. 
O’Neill J.A. dissented only on the extortion and sexual assault convictions in
relation to P.V.B.  He did not dissent on the application of Kienapple. 
Accordingly, the Crown contended the Court’s jurisdiction is limited solely to
these grounds, unless leave to appeal to address the application of Kienapple
is granted.  

 








71                              
I do not find this argument convincing.  In light of the fact that I
would affirm both convictions, the Court has, by necessary implication, the
jurisdiction to consider Kienapple.  The Court’s jurisdiction over both
the extortion and sexual assault convictions must, of necessity, include the
jurisdiction to make whatever order  is required to dispose of these grounds of
appeal.  It goes without saying that any order the Court makes in this regard
must be a legal order.  The Court cannot make an order that would
violate established principles or rules of law.  There is a possibility,
however, that in affirming the convictions without considering the potential
application of Kienapple that the accused could be convicted of multiple
offences arising from the same delict.  Such a disposition would be illegal, as
it would contravene an established legal principle.  Thus, in order to
safeguard against this possibility, the Court has an implied jurisdiction to
consider the application of Kienapple, to which I now turn.

 

72                              
The scope of the Kienapple principle was considered in R. v.
Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480.  Dickson C.J. found that the application of
the principle required that there be both a factual and legal nexus between the
offences in issue.  At p. 493 he held “[o]nce it has been established that
there is a sufficient factual nexus between the charges, it remains to determine
whether there is an adequate relationship between the offences themselves”.

 








73                              
In this appeal there is not a sufficient factual nexus between the
extortion and sexual assault convictions to trigger the application of Kienapple. 
The convictions arise out of different factual transactions.  Any one of the
occasions over the two- to three‑month period in which the appellant
engaged in sexual activity with P.V.B. is sufficient to ground the extortion
conviction.  By contrast, the sexual assault conviction arises from one or two
specific occasions in which the complainant explicitly communicated her lack of
consent to sexual contact.  Since there are separate factual circumstances
which give rise to the different convictions, Kienapple does not apply.

 

D.                Did the trial judge err in
failing to consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent in
convicting the appellant of sexually assaulting E.V.K.?

 

74                              
The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in convicting him of
sexual assault in the case of E.V.K. because the trial judge failed to consider
the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.  

 

75                              
Although the trial judge gave detailed reasons for his findings, he did
not specifically advert to the possibility that the appellant honestly but
mistakenly believed the complainant consented to the sexual activity in
question.

 

76                              
Green J.A. held that the trial judge’s failure to advert to the defence
of honest but mistaken belief in an otherwise detailed judgment raised the
question of whether the trial judge failed to consider it.  If so, the accused
may not have been afforded the benefit of the doubt on that issue.  Another
possibility was that the trial judge had decided that the defence had no “air
of reality” and therefore did not need to be addressed in his reasons.  Finding
it impossible to resolve this question from a review of the judgment, Green
J.A. conducted an extensive review of the evidence to determine whether there
was an air of reality to the defence.  He concluded there was none.  Therefore,
he held that even if the trial judge had failed to consider the issue at all,
no reversible error was committed.  O’Neill J.A. dissented, and would have
ordered a new trial.

 








77                              
In order for the appellant to succeed on this ground of appeal, he must
establish two things.  First, that the trial judge failed to consider the
defence, and second, that there was an air of reality to the defence.  Failure
of a trial judge to consider the defence when there is an air of reality to it,
whether sitting alone or with a jury, is an error of law.

 

78                              
Since the trial judge did not advert to the defence at all in his
reasons, it cannot be determined whether he in fact considered it.  Resolving
this issue requires the Court to determine whether in these circumstances the
failure to give reasons may be deemed a failure to consider the defence, and
thus an error of law.

 

79                              
Counsel did not address this issue in either oral or written arguments,
focussing instead on whether there was an air of reality to the defence.  Given
that there was no argument on this point and that I am of the opinion that the
appeal can be disposed of on the grounds that there was no air of reality to
the defence, it is safer to assume without deciding that the failure of the
trial judge to advert to the defence amounted to a failure to consider it.  It
is best to leave to another day the question of whether a trial judge’s
complete silence as regards a defence raised by the evidence constitutes a
failure to consider it and therefore an error of law.

 








80                              
The defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent is simply a denial
of the mens rea of sexual assault: R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R.
330, at para. 44; Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, at p.
148.  The actus reus of sexual assault requires a touching, of a sexual
nature, without the consent of the complainant.  The mens rea requires
the accused to intend the touching and to know of, or to be reckless or
wilfully blind as to the complainant’s lack of consent: Ewanchuk, supra,
at paras. 25 and 42.  In some circumstances, it is possible for the complainant
not to consent to the sexual touching but for the accused to honestly but
mistakenly believe that the complainant consented.  In these circumstances, the
actus reus of the offence is established, but the mens rea is
not.

 

81                              
Before the defence can be considered, there must be sufficient evidence
for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that (1) the complainant did not
consent to the sexual touching, and (2) the accused nevertheless honestly but
mistakenly believed that the complainant consented: see R. v. Osolin,
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 648, per McLachlin J.  In other words, given
the evidence, it must be possible for a reasonable trier of fact to
conclude that the actus reus is made out but the mens rea is
not.  In these circumstances, the defence is said to have an “air of reality”,
and the trier of fact, whether a judge or jury, must consider it.  Conversely,
where there is no air of reality to the defence, it should not be considered,
as no reasonable trier of fact could acquit on that basis: see R. v. Park,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 11. 

 

82                              
In determining whether there is an air of reality to the defence, the
trial judge should consider the totality of the evidence: see Osolin, supra,
at p. 683, per Cory J.; Park, supra, at para. 16.  The
role of the judge in making this determination was set out by Major J. in Ewanchuk,
supra, at para. 57.  He held that the judge should make “no attempt to
weigh the evidence”.  The sole concern is “with the facial plausibility of the
defence”, and the judge should “avoid the risk of turning the air of reality
test into a substantive evaluation of the merits of the defence”.  Care should
be taken not to usurp the role of the trier of fact.  Whenever there is a
possibility that a reasonable trier of fact could acquit on the basis of the
defence, it must be considered.

 








83                              
It is not necessary for the accused to specifically assert a belief that
the complainant consented.  By simply asserting that the complainant consented,
either directly under oath or through counsel, the accused is also asserting a
belief that the complainant consented: see Park, supra, at
para. 17.  However, the accused’s mere assertion will not give the defence an
air of reality: see R. v. Bulmer, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 782, at p. 790. 

 

84                              
While this is evidence of a belief in consent, it is not sufficient
evidence of an honest but mistaken belief in consent.  Sexual assault is
not a crime that is generally committed by accident: see Pappajohn, at
p. 155, per Dickson J.; Osolin, at pp. 685-86, per Cory
J.  In most cases, the issue will be simply one of “consent or no consent”, and
there will be only one of two possibilities.  The first is that the complainant
consented, in which case there is no actus reus.  The second is that the
complainant did not consent, and the accused had subjective knowledge of this
fact.  Here, the actus reus is made out, and the mens rea follows
straightforwardly.  

 

85                              
For example, suppose the complainant and the accused relay diametrically
opposed stories.  The complainant alleges a brutal sexual assault and vigorous
resistance, whereas the accused claims consensual intercourse.  Suppose further
that  it is impossible to splice together the evidence to create a third
version of events in which the accused honestly but mistakenly believed the
complainant consented.  In such circumstances, the trial becomes, essentially,
a pure question of credibility.  If the complainant is believed, the actus
reus is made out and the mens rea follows straightforwardly.  If the
accused is believed, or if there is a reasonable doubt as to the complainant’s
version of events, there is no actus reus.  There is no third
possibility of an honest but mistaken belief in consent, notwithstanding the
accused’s assertion that the complainant consented: Park, supra,
at paras. 25-26.

 








86                              
Although the accused’s mere assertion that the complainant consented
will not be sufficient evidence to raise the defence, the requisite evidence
may nevertheless come from the accused: see Park, supra, at paras.
19-20, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.; Osolin, supra, at pp.
686-87, per Cory J., and pp. 649-50, per McLachlin J.  It may
also come from the complainant, other sources, or a combination thereof.  In R.
v. Esau, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 777.  McLachlin J., dissenting in the result,
accurately conveyed the nature of this evidence at para. 63:

 

There must be evidence not only of non-consent and belief in consent,
but in addition evidence capable of explaining how the accused could honestly
have mistaken the complainant’s lack of consent as consent.  Otherwise, the
defence cannot reasonably arise.  There must, in short, be evidence of a
situation of ambiguity in which the accused could honestly have misapprehended
that the complainant was consenting to the sexual activity in question.

 

87                              
Finally, the Court has held that there will be no air of reality where
the evidence shows that the accused was reckless or wilfully blind as to
whether the complainant consented.  In those circumstances, the accused has
subjectively adverted to the absence of consent, and therefore cannot have an honest
but mistaken belief that the complainant consented.

 

88                              
I note that the appellant was charged with offences allegedly committed
prior to the introduction of s. 273.2  in August of 1992.  Consequently, the
statutory amendments to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent do
not apply to this appeal.   

 








89                              
With these principles in mind I turn to consider the evidence in the
case of E.V.K.  I will begin with the complainant’s testimony.  She claims to
have first met the appellant while walking near a mall in Gander, Newfoundland
in August 1990.  She was 20 years old at the time.  The appellant, who was in
his late thirties, approached her on his motorcycle.  He held himself out as a photographer
for a Toronto agency and asked her if she would consider modelling, as she had
great potential.  Some time later, she met with him at his residence to discuss
the matter further, and she thought it a good idea.  No photographs were taken
on this occasion.

 

90                              
A few days later, the appellant contacted the complainant and told her
to come to his residence and to bring some clothes with her.  She posed for
photographs, fully clothed.  Towards the end of the session, he discussed the
possibility of nude photographs, as they were needed if she wanted to be sent
to Toronto to pursue a career.  She demurred because of her religious
upbringing.  

 

91                              
Roughly one week later she returned to his apartment.  Photographs were
taken of her in a bathing suit and lingerie.  Eventually he convinced her to
pose nude.  She was very hesitant, but he assured her that only he and some
people in Toronto would see the photographs.  While she was posing nude in his
living room, the appellant approached her, took her hands, and tied her wrists
with ropes that were attached to hooks inserted in an archway such that her
arms were reaching up towards the ceiling.  He took some photographs of her in
that position.   He then came up behind her and, without asking her permission,
touched her breasts and inserted his finger into her vagina.  The complainant
said that she froze and did not know what to do.  

 

92                              
After some time he untied her.  He then brought over a chair, bent her
over it, and tied her to it by her hands and feet.  While tied to the chair,
the complainant saw his reflection in the glass of the stereo and watched him
approach her and undo his pants.  She said he touched her vagina with his
penis.  She screamed for him to untie her, saying “I don’t want to do this”. 
The appellant then untied her and apologized for his conduct, and the
complainant left his apartment.  There were no more photography sessions after
that.








 

93                              
The accused confirmed that he met the complainant near the Fraser Mall
and that she was interested in modelling.  He testified that there were one or
two photo sessions in August of 1990.  In his direct examination he offered the
following description of events on the evening during which the alleged assault
occurred:

 

She did everything that she did that night was just lingerie and nudes,
and I had asked her about if she would like to try something different with the
light bondage.  As I told you, I was having very, very strong feelings for
her.  When she was in the archway I did come up behind her one time.  She had
her breasts exposed and I reached around behind her and I said, “I really like
you”.  I was just telling her I really liked her, she really turned me on.  I
was just gently fondling her breasts and she said, “What are you doing?” 
I said, “I really like you and I’m making your breasts hard for the pictures”. 
She didn’t say anything else.  I placed my hand down on her vagina.  I was
fondling her for a little while and she said, “Well do you have to do that?” 
I said, “No”, and I left her alone.  So anyway we took some more pictures, then
we did the – tied her up over the chair.  Again, after taking a couple of
photographs I leaned forward, I touched her, I was fondling her vagina and I
said, “I really want you.  I really, really like you.  I want to have sex with
you.”  She had not said no or anything before that and I was touching her on
her vagina, and I don’t know, I started to undo my pants.  I don’t know if she
heard the noise or what it was at the time, but all of a sudden like she sort
of lifted her head and said, “No, don’t do that.”  I said, “Oh, come on, I
really, really want you.”   She said, “No, no, don’t do that.  I have no
protection, you can’t do it.  Stop.”  I just withdrew like that, and what I was
touching her with was my hand, and I immediately withdrew.  I said, “I’m
sorry.”  I immediately untied her. [Emphasis added.]

 

The appellant
also testified that he never asked the complainant for permission to touch her.


 

94                              
In my view, even if the testimony of the appellant is completely
accepted, it discloses that, at a minimum, he was wilfully blind as to whether 
the complainant consented to the fondling of her breasts and vagina. 
Consequently, the defence of honest but mistaken belief has no air of reality.

 








95                              
There is no suggestion by the appellant that the complainant posed nude
for any reason other than to further her modelling career.  Nor was there any
evidence that she invited him to touch her prior to his fondling of her breasts
and vagina.  Nevertheless, the appellant approached the complainant when she
was in an extremely vulnerable position and began fondling her breasts.  I
agree with Green J.A., who held at p. 314 that:

 

This is not a case of a subtle and tentative
initiation of preliminary sexual exploration by one person towards another in a
situation of autonomy, in the belief or hope that the feelings will be
reciprocated and that the other party will be receptive to progressively more
intimate activity.  E.V.K. had made no prior request for sexual activity and
had given no other indication she was interested.  There was a manifest power
imbalance present of which the appellant took advantage.  The appellant was
directing operations, ostensibly for a photographic purpose, but with the
(unexpressed, before the first touching) intent of pursuing a sexual
encounter.  The touching occurred when E.V.K. was vulnerable by being tied up. 
There was no basis in the evidence for the appellant thinking, at the time of
the initiation of sexual touching, that E.V.K. might have been receptive to his
advances.

 

96                              
In cross-examination, the appellant testified that he did not
immediately touch the complainant’s breasts, but rather began by touching her
shoulders and telling her how much he liked her.  The complainant was silent. 
Taking her silence and passivity as evidence of consent, he then proceeded to
fondle her breasts.  In these circumstances, I fail to see how the
complainant’s silence could have led the appellant to believe she was
consenting to more intimate sexual contact.

 








97                              
Moreover, after he pinched her nipples, the appellant admits that the
complainant said, “What are you doing?”.  Undeterred, he fondled her vagina. 
She then said “Do you have to do that?”.  The appellant stopped.  This is clear
evidence that he understood she was not consenting to further contact. 
Notwithstanding these statements, he tied her to a chair and again fondled her
breasts and vagina.  The appellant provided no evidence to suggest that the
complainant had a change of heart.  As the Court held in Ewanchuk, supra,
at para. 58, there can be no air of reality in these circumstances.

 

98                              
In Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, at p. 584,
McIntyre J. held that “wilful blindness arises where a person who has become
aware of the need for some inquiry declines to make the inquiry because he does
not wish to know the truth.  He would prefer to remain ignorant”.  More
recently in Esau, supra, McLachlin J. described wilful blindness
as follows at para. 70:

 

The term wilful blindness connotes a deliberate avoidance of the facts
and circumstances.  It is the legal equivalent of turning a blind eye, of not
seeing or hearing what is there to hear or see.  It is the making of an assumption
that the complainant consents without determining whether, as a matter of
fact, the complainant consents.  Blindness as to the need to obtain consent
can never be raised by an accused as a defence.... [Emphasis in original.]

 

In light of
the foregoing evidence, I am convinced that the appellant was wilfully blind as
to whether the complainant consented.  Accordingly, the defence of honest but
mistaken belief in consent has no air of reality.  

 

99                              
I note that O’Neill J.A. also dissented on the grounds that the trial
judge failed to consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent
in the cases of T.R. and D.A.S.  The appellant, however, made no submissions on
this point in either oral or written arguments.  It is not clear whether this
was an oversight, or a concession that there was no air of reality to the
defence in either case and thus a waiver of this ground of appeal.  To rule out
the possibility of a potentially harmful oversight and in an abundance of
caution, I have reviewed the record, and am of the opinion that there was no
air of reality to the defence.  The issue was simply one of consent or no
consent in both cases.








 

E.                Did the trial judge err in his
application of the principle of reasonable doubt in the cases of all five
complainants?

 

100                          
The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in his application of
the principle of reasonable doubt to each of the charges against him in the
cases of all five complainants.  O’Neill J.A. in dissent held that the trial
judge made two notable errors.  First, in each case the trial judge failed to
consider all of the evidence in determining whether there was a reasonable
doubt in the manner set out by this Court’s decision in R. v. W. (D.), supra. 
Second, that in the cases of D.A.S. and T.R., the trial judge used language
that suggests that he reversed the onus on the burden of proof from the Crown
to the appellant.

 

101                          
At the beginning of his judgment, before dealing with any of the
individual charges, the trial judge specifically referred to W. (D.).  At
paras. 3-5 he held:

 

. . . it is important to ensure that one applies the presumption of
innocence to the accused in each of the cases.  The obligation is never lifted
from the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on
each of the counts.  It has been pointed out in numerous cases that proof
beyond a reasonable doubt is that degree of proof which “convinces the mind and
satisfies the conscience that the Crown has proven all the essential elements
of the offence”: see R. v. W. (D.). . . .

 

It has been said by a number of trial judges that
it is incorrect to approach these cases in terms of whether or not one believes
the defence’s evidence or the Crown’s evidence.  The correct approach is to ask
oneself; even if I do not believe the evidence of the accused, whether or not,
viewing the evidence as a whole, I have a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s
guilt. . .  .

 

It is important to review all of the testimony and consider the
evidence in its totality in the broader context of the presumption of innocence
and the requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to finally reach a
decision on each count.

 








102                          
The trial judge clearly directed himself properly as to the principle of
reasonable doubt.  His judgment also reveals a thorough review of the
evidence.  While he did not specifically advert to W. (D.) while dealing
with each count, this does not mean that he erred.  I agree with Green J.A. who
held at pp. 325-26:

 

. . . the trial judge, near the beginning of his reasons for judgment,
when dealing with general principles, specifically referred to and properly
stated, the effect of R. v. D. W. as it affects the application of the
principle of reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility.  The fact that he
did not repeat the admonition each time as he dealt with the facts of each
count does not necessarily mean that he failed to consider or apply the
principle in each case.  Just because a judge, after considering the evidence,
decides to accept a complainant’s version of events over that of an accused’s
does not mean he has fallen into the trap which R. v. D. W. warns
against.

 

103                          
With respect to the cases of T.R. and D.A.S., in the course of reviewing
the evidence, the trial judge said that he was “not convinced” that the
complainants consented to the sexual activity in question.  Read out of
context, these comments suggest that the trial judge may have reversed the
burden of proof.  However, in my view, this is simply plucking colloquial
elements of the trial judge’s thorough reasons.  I agree with Green J.A., who
held at p. 316:

 

It is not sufficient to “cherry pick” certain infelicitous phrases or
sentences without enquiring as to whether the literal meaning was effectively
neutralized by other passages.  This is especially true in the case of a judge
sitting alone where other comments made by him or her may make it perfectly
clear that he or she did not misapprehend the import of the legal principles
involved.  As McLachlin J. said in [R. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R.
717, at p. 737]: “[t]he fact that a trial judge misstates himself at one point
should not vitiate his ruling if the preponderance of what was said shows that
the proper test was applied and if the decision can be justified on the
evidence.”

 

I would
dismiss this ground of appeal.

Although he did not have the benefit of R. v. Mara, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 630,
and R. v. Tremblay, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 932, the trial judge carefully
considered all relevant factors in analyzing the standard of tolerance, which
he properly assessed.  More particularly, he was concerned with the nature and
character of the touching that took place between the dancers and the police,
and with the circumstances prevailing in the cubicle.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

Criminal law -- Charge to jury -- Reasonable doubt
-- Accused convicted of first degree murder -- Whether trial judge misdirected jury
on meaning of “beyond a reasonable doubt” by comparing it to degree of
certainty used to make decisions in everyday activities -- If so, whether new
trial should be ordered.

 








The accused was charged with first degree murder.  The
trial judge instructed the jury that although the phrase “beyond a reasonable
doubt” can cause considerable debate and confusion, it was really a very simple
concept.  He described a reasonable doubt as a real doubt, an honest doubt held
by a reasonable person.  He then explained, however, that a reasonable doubt is
that degree of certainty which one uses every day in important activities.  He
then gave an example relating in detail the steps which should be taken in
order to determine the level of oil in an automobile.  He suggested that when
the proper checks had been done, a person could feel certain “beyond a
reasonable doubt” that there was enough oil in the car to enable it to run
without damage.  The accused was convicted.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority
decision, upheld the conviction.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

Examples of what may constitute proof beyond a
reasonable doubt can give rise to difficulties.  First, they may tend to
indicate to a juror that the decision as to whether guilt has been proven
beyond a reasonable doubt can be made on the same basis as would any decision
made in the course of their daily routines.  Often those “everyday” decisions
in life are reached by utilizing a standard of probability.  They are based
upon experience and a consideration of routine risks and commonplace
alternatives.  To suggest that jurors may apply examples from everyday life in
determining proof beyond a reasonable doubt can thus be misleading and may well
lower the requisite standard.  Secondly, examples tend to be applied
subjectively.  The consideration of an example will often vary with the life
experiences and background of every individual juror.  The example used in this
case does seem to suggest to jurors that they can apply the same standard they
would use in everyday, routine decisions to the determination of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Since the directions of the trial judge give rise to a
reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the standard of proof, the
verdict must be set aside and a new trial directed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1                                  
Cory J. -- On this appeal,
consideration must be given to the problems which arise when examples are given
to illustrate the phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt”.

 

Factual Background

 

2                                  
As a result of the proposed disposition very little will be said about
the factual background.  The appellant was charged with and convicted of first
degree murder.  The sole issue is whether the directions with regard to
reasonable doubt were such that a new trial must be directed.

 








Directions Given in This Case

 

3                                  
At the outset it is important to remember that the directions in this
case and the consideration of them by the Court of Appeal took place before the
release of the decision of this Court in R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R.
320.  The trial judge instructed the jury that although the phrase “beyond a
reasonable doubt” can cause considerable debate and confusion, it was really a
very simple concept.  He stated that, while total, absolute, perfect certainty
does not exist, certainty beyond a reasonable doubt is that which is closest to
this ideal.  He described it as a real doubt, an honest doubt held by a
reasonable person.  He then explained, however, that a reasonable doubt is a or
that degree of certainty which one uses every day in important activities.  He
put it in this way:

 

[translation]  What is reasonable
doubt?  I will not hide from you the fact that it is a legal concept which has
provoked much debate, which has engendered much discussion, both on the part of
counsel and on the part of judges, and which is the source of confusion that is
sometimes quite unnecessary.  You will see that it is something very simple.

 

The expression reasonable doubt is in a sense a way of describing a
degree of certainty.  First, you should note, and obviously accept, the fact
that total, absolute, perfect certainty that someone is guilty of something,
does not exist.  Just as in most situations in our everyday life, total,
perfect, complete certainty does not exist, the closest that one can get to
this ideal state of certainty is precisely certainty beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

What then is a reasonable doubt?  A reasonable doubt is first and
foremost a real doubt, that is not imagined, not capricious, not frivolous.  It
is a real doubt, an honest doubt entertained in the mind of a reasonable
person.  A reasonable doubt is therefore a doubt that is reasonable.  It is
nothing other than that.  And it is a degree of certainty which you use every
day, in your important activities, whether at work, at home or in your leisure
activities.  It is a degree of certainty which you employ, which you have used
since you reached the age of reason, without perhaps having dissected it as we
are doing at present.

 








Therefore, this concept of reasonable doubt is in fact an expression,
or a manner, perhaps not always a good one, of expressing a degree of
certainty, certainty beyond a reasonable doubt.  I want to give you an example
to show you that it is a degree of certainty which you use, which you employ,
which you know, and which you are asked to use in determining the guilt of the
accused.  I am saying to you because others may read what I’m telling you, I’m
giving you the example I have used for years.  I will not change my example
because I like it, it does the job, I will not change it.

 

You know that in North America, the automobile is something as
essential as a refrigerator, as a telephone, because we live in a country which
is very large.  [Emphasis added.]

 

He then gave
an example.  It was replete with details and related with loving care the steps
which should be taken in order to determine the level of oil in an automobile. 
He suggested that when the proper checks had been done, a person could feel
certain “beyond a reasonable doubt” that there was enough oil in the car to
enable it to run without damage.  This example was given to illustrate the
degree of certainty required by the phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt”.

 

4                                  
The trial judge went on to observe that there are many situations such
as this which occur in daily life when a person reaches this requisite degree
of certainty beyond a reasonable doubt about the existence of something.  He
stated that what is asked in the trial is that one apply just the same degree
of certainty beyond a reasonable doubt in determining the guilt of the
accused.  He summed up his observations in this manner:

 

[translation] 
So, when you make all the checks which a car owner normally makes, when you
observe what is happening on your instrument panel when the motor is turning, I
would suggest to you that you have in your mind a certainty beyond a reasonable
doubt that there is in your automobile engine a sufficient level of oil so that
it can turn without causing damage.

 

There are many more examples of situations, of
important activities in your existence where you do in fact reach this degree
of certainty beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of something.  What you
are being asked here, in this trial, or in any other trial, is precisely to
apply this same degree of certainty beyond a reasonable doubt to the
determination of the accused’s guilt.

 








It is true, it may perhaps seem unnecessary to spell
it out for you, but it is true that one cannot make comparisons between
certainty beyond a reasonable doubt that someone is guilty of something and
certainty beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a sufficient level of oil in
an automobile engine.  There is no comparison because the things are
different.  You can’t compare oranges with pumpkins.

 

However, even if the things are different, the
degree of certainty that is required before concluding that someone is guilty
of something, is exactly the same degree of certainty, certainty beyond a
reasonable doubt, as the degree of certainty you use in important activities in
you life.  Reasonable doubt is no more than that, it is no less than that.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Court of Appeal, [1997]
R.J.Q. 286

 

5                                  
The majority of the Court of Appeal (per Gendreau and Baudouin
JJ.A.) was of the opinion that the example given with regard to reasonable
doubt did not warrant intervention by the Court of Appeal.  Fish J.A.
dissenting, concluded that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the
significance of the term “beyond a reasonable doubt” by comparing it to a degree
of certainty used to make decisions in everyday, ordinary affairs.  In his
view, the misdirection on this issue was fatal to the jury’s verdict.

 

Analysis

 

Examples:  The Problems They May Create

 








6                                  
No matter how carefully they may be crafted, examples of what may
constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt can give rise to difficulties. 
First, they may tend to indicate to a juror that the decision as to whether
guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt can be made on the same basis
as would any decision made in the course of their daily routines.  The same
danger exists even if these are important decisions.  So often those “everyday”
decisions in life are reached by utilizing a standard of probability.  They are
based upon experience and a consideration of routine risks and commonplace
alternatives.  To suggest that jurors may apply examples from everyday life in
determining proof beyond a reasonable doubt can be misleading and may well
lower the requisite standard.  Secondly, examples tend to be applied
subjectively.  The consideration of an example will often vary with the life
experiences and background of every individual juror.  An example which may
illustrate for one juror a decision of monumental importance may for another be
something that is routine or even mundane.

 

7                                  
The example used in this case does seem to suggest to jurors that they
can apply the same standard they would use in everyday, routine decisions to
the determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  To many jurors,
ascertaining the level of oil in their  car may have been one of the most
commonplace and mundane decisions in their everyday life.  These jurors, like
so many others, may well have accepted the oil level as satisfactory simply on
the basis that there was no red light showing on the instrument panel.  The
underlined portions of the directions serve to confirm that the jury was
encouraged to apply an everyday standard.

 

8                                  
Perhaps it would help to repeat portions of the reasons in Lifchus
which are appropriate to this decision.  At paras. 23‑24, the
following appears:

 

Perhaps a consideration of how to define the
expression can begin by setting out common definitions which should be
avoided.  For example, a reasonable doubt should not be described as an
“ordinary” concept.  Jurors should not be invited to apply to the determination
of guilt in a criminal trial the same standard of proof that they would apply
to the decisions they are required to make in their everyday lives, or even to
the most important of these decisions.  In this aspect, I agree with the
comments of Scott C.J.M. set out in the judgment below (at pp. 234‑35):

 








Reasonable doubt, no matter how elusive the concept,
cannot be equated to an ordinary everyday phrase.  It is not, as we have seen,
a “perfectly ordinary concept” ‑‑ far from it.  The reason for this
is that the word “reasonable” can, depending on the circumstances, have two
very different meanings.  The first is the meaning thoroughly canvassed by Wood
J.A. in Brydon.  The other more common use is that in ordinary
parlance:  we hold “reasonable” views, we have “reasonable” opinions, and we
make “reasonable” prognostications.  This is the standard by which we make
our everyday decisions and by which we habitually govern ourselves.  It is a
standard of probability and, often within that, at the low end of the scale. 
It is very different from the criminal standard of proof which requires a much
higher degree of certitude to arrive at a conclusion of guilt.

 

To instruct the jury that reasonable doubt means
nothing more than the “everyday sense” of the words is misleading and
constitutes reversible error.  (Emphasis added.)

 

Ordinarily even the most important decisions of a
lifetime are based upon carefully calculated risks.  They are made on the
assumption that certain events will in all likelihood take place or that
certain facts are in all probability true.  Yet to invite jurors to apply to a
criminal trial the standard of proof used for even the important decisions in
life runs the risk of significantly reducing the standard to which the
prosecution must be held.

 

9                                  
The importance of jurors applying the appropriate standard of proof
cannot be overemphasized.  It is fundamental to a criminal trial.  On this
issue, the following appears in Lifchus (at paras. 27 and 41):

 

First, it must be made clear to the jury that the
standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is vitally important since it is
inextricably linked to that basic premise which is fundamental to all criminal
trials:  the presumption of innocence. . . . If the presumption of
innocence is the golden thread of criminal justice then proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is the silver and these two threads are forever intertwined in
the fabric of criminal law.  Jurors must be reminded that the burden of proving
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime rests with the
prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused.

 

                                                                  .
 .  .

 

Further, it is possible that an error in the
instructions as to the standard of proof may not constitute a reversible
error.  It was observed in R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at
p. 758, that the verdict ought not be disturbed “if the charge, when read
as a whole, makes it clear that the jury could not have been under any
misapprehension as to the correct burden and standard of proof to apply”.  On
the other hand, if the charge as a whole gives rise to the reasonable
likelihood that the jury misapprehended the standard of proof, then as a
general rule the verdict will have to be set aside and a new trial directed.








10                              
Like Fish J.A., I am of the view that the directions given in this case
do indeed give rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the
standard of proof.  As a result the verdict must be set aside and a new trial
directed.

 

Other Issues Raised

 

11                              
The appellant also challenged the directions of the trial judge as to
consciousness of guilt and circumstantial evidence.  It was also said that the
conduct of the trial judge was sufficient in itself to warrant a new trial.  On
these issues, I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of the majority of
the Court of Appeal.  Whatever shortcoming there may have been with regard to
these matters they would not merit a direction for a new trial.

 

Disposition

 

12                              
The appeal is allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal is set aside and

Self‑defence ‑‑ Battered woman syndrome ‑‑ Charge
to jury ‑‑ Accused convicted of second degree murder after shooting
her abusive common law husband to death ‑‑ Whether trial judge’s
charge to jury adequately dealt with evidence of battered woman syndrome as it

The accused and the deceased were common law spouses
for about 19 years and had two children together.  The deceased abused the
accused physically, sexually, psychologically and emotionally.  She had gone to
the police, but the deceased was a police informant on drug deals and the
police told him of her complaints, resulting in an escalation of his violence
towards her.  A few months before the shooting, the deceased separated from the
accused, took their son and went to live with his girlfriend.  The accused and
their daughter continued to live at the deceased’s mother’s house.  Contact
between the deceased and the accused continued after the separation, as he
dropped by his mother’s home on a regular basis, often bringing his girlfriend
with him.  On the day of the shooting the accused was scheduled to go to a
medical centre with the deceased to get prescription drugs for use in his
illegal drug trade.  She took a pistol from the deceased’s gun cabinet, loaded
it and carried it in her purse.  After driving to the medical centre with the
deceased, she shot him to death.  She then took a taxi to his girlfriend’s
home, shot her and stabbed her with a knife.  The girlfriend survived and
testified as a Crown witness.  At trial, the accused testified to the extensive
abuse which she had suffered, and the Crown conceded that she had been subject
to terrible physical and mental abuse at the hands of the deceased.  The
accused led expert evidence to show that she suffered from battered woman
syndrome.  The jury found her guilty of second degree murder in the death of
the deceased and of attempted murder of his girlfriend.  The jury recommended
that because of the severity of the battered woman syndrome, the accused should
receive the minimum sentence.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the convictions in
a majority decision.  Only the accused’s conviction for second degree murder is
before this Court.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  In assessing whether a charge to the
jury was proper, it is the charge as a whole that must be examined for error. 
Pursuant to s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code , there are three constituent
elements of self‑defence where the victim has died:  (1) the existence of
an unlawful assault; (2) a reasonable apprehension of a risk of death or
grievous bodily harm; and (3) a reasonable belief that it is not possible to
preserve oneself from harm except by killing the adversary.  On the first
element, an honest but reasonable mistake as to the existence of an assault is
permitted where an accused relies upon self‑defence.  To the extent that
expert evidence respecting battered woman syndrome may assist a jury in assessing
the reasonableness of an accused’s perceptions, it is relevant to the issue of
unlawful assault.  Once the battered woman syndrome defence is raised, the jury
should be informed of how that evidence may be of use in understanding why an
abused woman might remain in an abusive relationship, the nature and extent of
the violence that may exist in a battering relationship, the accused’s ability
to perceive danger from her abuser, and whether the accused believed on
reasonable grounds that she could not otherwise preserve herself from death or
grievous bodily harm.

 








The trial judge properly charged the jury with respect
to the evidence on battered woman syndrome and how such evidence relates to the
law of self‑defence.  The trial judge’s instruction on the issue of
unlawful assault together with his review of the evidence adequately conveyed
to the jury which of the deceased’s actions may have constituted unlawful
assault.  It also communicated the accused’s perceptions in light of her experience
and knowledge of the deceased’s behaviours.  The trial judge’s charge
accurately conveyed to the jury the Lavallee principles regarding the
accused’s ability to perceive danger from the deceased and the reasonableness
of her perceptions that she could not otherwise preserve herself from death or
grievous bodily harm.  The jury were properly informed that the issues were to
be considered from the perspective of someone whose perceptions at the time of
the shooting may have been shaped by her prior experience of abuse.  While it
might have been desirable for the trial judge to have instructed the jury to a
greater extent in making the connection between the evidence of battered woman
syndrome and the legal issue of self-defence, a review of the trial judge’s
charge as a whole shows that the jury were left with a sufficient understanding
of the facts as they related to the relevant legal issues. 

 

Per L’Heureux‑Dubé
and McLachlin JJ.:  Major J.’s reasons and the result he reaches are agreed
with.  Given the evolving discourse in the legal community concerning evidence
of “battered woman syndrome” since this Court’s decision in R. v. Lavallee,
the reasons in Lavallee are discussed.  The decision in Lavallee
is significant for two principal reasons.  First, the Court accepted the need
for expert evidence in order to dispel the myths and stereotypes inherent in
our understanding of a battered woman’s experiences, and of the reasonableness
of her actions.  Second, the Court accepted that women’s experiences and
perspectives in relation to self-defence may be different from the experiences
and perspectives of men, and that the perspectives of women must now equally
inform the “objective” standard of the reasonable person. “Battered woman
syndrome” is not a legal defence in itself, but rather is a psychiatric
explanation of the mental state of an abused woman which can be relevant to
understanding a battered woman’s state of mind.  The utility of such evidence
is not limited to self-defence situations, but is potentially relevant to other
situations where the reasonableness of a battered woman’s actions or
perceptions is at issue.

 








When interpreting and applying Lavallee, these
broader principles should be kept in mind in order to avoid a too rigid and restrictive
approach to the admissibility and legal value of evidence of a battered woman’s
experiences.  Concerns have been expressed that the treatment of such evidence
has led to a new stereotype of the “battered  woman”.  Such a development must
be scrupulously avoided.  The legal inquiry must focus on the reasonableness of
a battered woman’s actions in the context of her personal experiences, and her
experiences as a woman, not on her status as a battered woman and her
entitlement to claim that she is suffering from “battered woman syndrome”.

1                                  
Major J. -- This appeal
raises the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury on the issue of
battered woman syndrome as a defence to the charge of murder. 

 








I.   Facts

 

2                                  
The appellant, Margaret Ann Malott, and the deceased, Paul Malott, were
common law spouses for about 19 years and had two children together.  The
appellant had previously been married for seven years to a man who violently
abused her and their five children.  Mr. Malott abused Mrs. Malott physically,
sexually, psychologically and emotionally.  She had gone to the police, but Mr.
Malott was a police informant on drug deals and the police told him of her
complaints, resulting in an escalation of his violence towards her.  A few
months before the shooting, Mr. Malott separated from the appellant, took their
son and went to live with his girlfriend, Carrie Sherwood.  Mrs. Malott and
their daughter continued to live at Mr. Malott’s mother’s house.  Contact
between Mr. and Mrs. Malott continued after the separation, as he dropped by his
mother’s home on a regular basis, often bringing Ms. Sherwood with him.

 

3                                  
On March 23, 1991, Mrs. Malott was scheduled to go to a medical centre
with the deceased to get prescription drugs for use in the deceased’s illegal
drug trade.  She took a .22 calibre pistol from Mr. Malott’s gun cabinet,
loaded it and carried it in her purse.  After driving to the medical centre
with Mr. Malott, she shot him to death.  She then took a taxi to Ms. Sherwood’s
home, shot her and stabbed her with a knife.  Ms. Sherwood survived and
testified as a Crown witness.

 








4                                  
At trial, the appellant testified to the extensive abuse which she had
suffered.  The Crown conceded that the appellant had been subject to terrible
physical and mental abuse at the hands of Mr. Malott.  The appellant led expert
evidence to show that she suffered from battered woman syndrome.  The appellant
raised three defences:  self-defence, drug-induced intoxication and
provocation, but relied primarily on self-defence.  The jury found the appellant
guilty of second degree murder in the death of Paul Malott and of attempted
murder of Carrie Sherwood.  The jury made a recommendation that because of the
severity of the battered woman syndrome, the appellant should receive the
minimum sentence.  

 

5                                  
The appellant appealed both convictions.  The appeal was heard by the
Ontario Court of Appeal on May 28, 1996.  It is only the conviction for second
degree murder of the deceased that is before this Court.

S.C.R. 852, namely, that the perception of the appellant, developed against the
background of her abuse, must be assessed in determining if her actions were
reasonable.

 








8                                  
In response to the complaint that the trial judge failed to detail the
evidence of the appellant’s expert, Dr. Jaffe, and relate it to the defence,
Finlayson and Austin JJ.A. noted that if anything this probably favoured the
appellant as Dr. Jaffe’s evidence was not entirely supportive of her.  Dr.
Jaffe conceded that his opinions were based in substantial part on his
interviews with the appellant.  He testified that many battered women who kill
their spouses in self-defence do so after a particularly savage physical
attack, which was not the case here.  Given these circumstances, Finlayson and
Austin JJ.A. were of the view that the uncritical manner in which the trial
judge left the evidence of Dr. Jaffe with the jury was fair and more than
sufficient, and dismissed that ground of appeal.  

 

(2)   Abella J.A., dissenting

 

9                                  
Abella J.A. held that the trial judge failed to adequately instruct on
s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  He did not tell
the jury which of the facts described by the appellant, if believed, could
constitute unlawful assault by her former spouse.  Abella J.A. stated that the
trial judge’s instructions with respect to the abuse of the appellant were
correct as far as they went, but did not go far enough in reviewing the expert
evidence as it pertained to the issue of the reasonableness of the appellant’s
perceptions and behaviour.  Nor did the trial judge provide a sufficient review
of the historical context of the abusive relationship, relied upon by the appellant
to explain the acts of the morning of the shooting.

 








10                              
Abella J.A. held that the trial judge failed to sufficiently relate the
evidence of abuse to the core issues in self-defence.  She found that the jury
did not have enough guidance from the trial judge to understand how they were
to assess the reasonableness of the appellant’s apprehensions and behaviour,
nor were they told how to link, if they chose to believe it, the expert
evidence on the phenomenon of battered women.  The number of questions the jury
asked, the fact that they did not find the appellant guilty of first degree
murder and made a voluntary request to the trial judge that the appellant
receive the minimum sentence, all indicated to her that had the jury been
properly charged, they might have come to a different verdict.

 

11                              
Abella J.A. agreed that the trial judge was correct in his charge that
self-defence was not available to the charge of attempted murder.

 

III.  Issue

 

12                              
The issue is whether the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal was
correct in concluding that the trial judge’s charge to the jury adequately
dealt with evidence of battered woman syndrome as it relates to the defence of
self-defence.  As stated, it is only the appellant’s conviction for second
degree murder of Paul Malott that is at issue in this appeal.

 

IV.  Statutory
Provisions

 

13                              
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

34. ...

 

(2)  Every one who is unlawfully assaulted and who
causes death or    grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified
if

 

(a) he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or
grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally
made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and

 

(b) he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise
preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.

 

V.  Analysis

 








A.  Standard
Required of a Jury Charge

 

14                              
A jury charge should provide the jurors with an understanding of their role
as triers of fact and the essence of the case before them.  See Azoulay v.
The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, per Taschereau J. at pp. 497-98:

 

The rule which has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in
a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare cases where it would be
needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the
jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and
effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they
find them.

 

15                              
Canadian jurisprudence is plain that a standard of perfection is not the
test when an appellate court reviews a jury charge.  R. v. Jacquard,
[1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, confirmed that while accused persons are entitled to properly
instructed juries, there is no requirement that a jury be perfectly
instructed.  A standard of perfection would be unattainable in most cases. 
Some have described a jury charge as an art rather than a science.

 

16                              
In assessing whether a charge to the jury was proper, it is the charge
as a whole that must be examined for error:  see R. v. Evans, [1993] 2
S.C.R. 629.  Also Jacquard, per Lamer C.J. speaking for the
majority at p. 326:

 

In many cases, a trial judge need only review relevant evidence once
and has no duty to review the evidence in a case in relation to every essential
issue.  See John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 781, Cluett v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 216.  As long as an appellate court, when looking at the trial
judge’s charge to the jury as a whole, concludes that the jury was left with a
sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to the relevant issues,
the charge is proper. 

 








17                              
In the present case, the charge as a whole should be examined to
ascertain whether the jury were given an adequate charge on battered woman
syndrome as it relates to self-defence.  

 

B.  Principles
Relevant to Battered Woman Syndrome and Self-Defence 

 

18                              
Pursuant to s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code , there are three
constituent elements of self-defence where the victim has died:  (1) the
existence of an unlawful assault; (2) a reasonable apprehension of a risk of
death or grievous bodily harm; and (3) a reasonable belief that it is not
possible to preserve oneself from harm except by killing the adversary:  see R.
v. Pétel, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3.  On the first element, a majority of this
Court held in Pétel that an honest but reasonable mistake as to the
existence of an assault is permitted where an accused relies upon
self-defence.  Accordingly, the jury must be told that the question is not “was
the accused unlawfully assaulted?” but rather “did the accused reasonably
believe, in the circumstances, that she was being unlawfully assaulted?”  To
the extent that expert evidence respecting battered woman syndrome may assist a
jury in assessing the reasonableness of an accused’s perceptions, it is
relevant to the issue of unlawful assault.

 

19                              
The relevance of evidence on battered woman syndrome to the issue of
self-defence was recognized in Lavallee, where the majority of this
Court held that expert evidence on the psychological effect of the battering of
spouses was admissible, as it was relevant and necessary in the context of that
case.

 








20                              
The admissibility of expert evidence respecting battered woman syndrome
was not at issue in the present case.  The admissibility of the expert evidence
of Dr. Jaffe on battered woman syndrome was not challenged.  However, once that
defence is raised, the jury ought to be made aware of the principles of that
defence as dictated by Lavallee.  In particular, the jury should be
informed of how that evidence may be of use in understanding the following:

 

1.  Why an
abused woman might remain in an abusive relationship.  As discussed in Lavallee,
expert evidence may help to explain some of the reasons and dispel some of the
misconceptions about why women stay in abusive relationships.

 

2.  The
nature and extent of the violence that may exist in a battering relationship. 
In considering the defence of self-defence as it applies to an accused who has
killed her violent partner, the jury should be instructed on the violence that
existed in the relationship and its impact on the accused.  The latter will
usually but not necessarily be provided by an expert.

 

3.  The
accused’s ability to perceive danger from her abuser.  Section 34(2) (a)
provides that an accused who intentionally causes death or grievous bodily harm
in repelling an assault is justified if he or she does so “under reasonable
apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm”.  In addressing this issue,
Wilson J. for the majority in Lavallee rejected the requirement that the
accused apprehend imminent danger.  She also stated at pp. 882-83:

 

Where evidence exists that an accused is in a
battering relationship, expert testimony can assist the jury in determining
whether the accused had a “reasonable” apprehension of death when she acted by
explaining the heightened sensitivity of a battered woman to her partner’s acts. 
Without such testimony I am skeptical that the average fact-finder would be
capable of appreciating why her subjective fear may have been reasonable in the
context of the relationship.  After all, the hypothetical “reasonable man”
observing only the final incident may have been unlikely to recognize the
batterer’s threat as potentially lethal. . . .

 








The issue is not, however, what an outsider would
have reasonably perceived but what the accused reasonably perceived, given her
situation and her experience. 

 

4.  Whether
the accused believed on reasonable grounds that she could not otherwise
preserve herself from death or grievous bodily harm.  This principle
was summarized in Lavallee as follows (at p. 890):

 

By providing an explanation as to why an accused did not flee when she
perceived her life to be in danger, expert testimony may also assist the jury
in assessing the reasonableness of her belief that killing her batterer was the
only way to save her own life.

 

21                              
These principles must be communicated by the trial judge when
instructing the jury in cases involving battered woman syndrome and the issue
of self-defence.

 

C.  Jury
Charge in this Case 

 

22                              
In the present case, I am satisfied that the trial judge properly charged
the jury with respect to the evidence on battered woman syndrome and how such
evidence relates to the law of self-defence.  At the beginning of the charge on
self-defence, the trial judge set out s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code . 
He then explained the legal meaning of “unlawful assault” and reviewed the
defence and Crown evidence relevant to the issue of whether or not an unlawful
assault occurred.  

 








23                              
In her dissent, Abella J.A. states that the trial judge did not tell the
jury which of the facts described by the appellant could, if believed,
constitute unlawful assault.  Nor did he explain how having been abused by Mr.
Malott could have affected the reasonableness of the appellant’s perception of
the extent to which she was in danger from him.  With respect, I disagree.  

 

24                              
Immediately after explaining that it is an assault to intentionally
apply force to another person, or to threaten by act or gesture to apply force
to another person, the trial judge stated:

 

Now that part becomes important ladies and gentlemen because we have
the evidence about Paul Malott attempting to get out of the car.  Well what
evidence is there supporting the defence position?  You have Mrs. Malott’s
evidence that on the way to the medical centre he got angry with her about the
income tax deduction for Jody and he grabbed her and angrily told her to
smarten up.  When they got to the medical centre he undid his seatbelt and
looked at her with that look on his face that indicated she was going to get it
sooner or later and usually sooner.  As she started to get out he leaned over
and grabbed her by the throat with his right hand and started choking her.  He
was very angry.  His seatbelt was not fastened at that time.  She went to the
medical centre door and it was locked.  As she walked back toward the car she
thought she was going to be in trouble because he needed the percocets for the
cocaine deal that he had lined up.  As she approached the car she told him the
door was locked.  He opened the driver’s side door.  He put his left foot on
the ground as if he was getting out.  If his seatbelt was then fastened he must
have done it up after she left the car and she did not know that.  As far as
she knew his seatbelt was still unfastened.  She believed that he was going to
hurt her again.

 

25                              
In my opinion, the trial judge’s instruction on the issue of unlawful
assault together with his review of the evidence adequately conveyed to the
jury which of the deceased’s actions may have constituted unlawful assault.  It
also communicated the appellant’s perceptions in light of her experience and
knowledge of the deceased’s behaviours.  I therefore conclude that the charge
on unlawful assault was proper. 

 








26                              
Abella J.A. also found that, with respect to the second and third elements
of self-defence, the trial judge did not sufficiently review the evidence of
the appellant and of Dr. Jaffe.  Nor did he sufficiently explain and connect
the expert’s evidence to the assessment of the reasonableness of the
appellant’s perceptions and behaviour.  Again, I respectfully disagree.  After
setting out the governing principles under s. 34(2)  for assessing an accused’s
apprehensions and actions, the trial judge stated:

 

Now you have heard of the assaults on the accused and of the threats of
violence to her made by Paul Malott over almost 20 years.  Such evidence can
support an inference that Paul Malott had a disposition for violence of a kind
likely to result in conduct of a kind that might cause the accused to consider
it life-threatening.  It can also be considered as support of her version of
the events. 

 

27                              
He then described the purpose for which the expert evidence on battered
woman syndrome had been admitted:

 

The evidence of Dr. Jaffe was admitted to explain why the accused
remained in the kind of relationship she described she had with the accused [sic]. 
You may think that it is relevant in assessing the nature and extent of the
abuse she alleged.  Expert testimony relating to the ability of an accused to
perceive danger goes to the issue whether she reasonably apprehended death or
grievous bodily harm on this occasion and believed on reasonable grounds that
she had no alternative but to shoot him.  If you accept her evidence of years
of abuse and violence, her mental state at the moment she shot her husband must
be understood in the cumulative effect of those years.  You may consider her
knowledge of his patterns of behaviour preceding violence and whether or not
she was able to anticipate the nature and extent of his violence.

 

28                              
In my opinion, these statements accurately conveyed to the jury the Lavallee
principles regarding the appellant’s ability to perceive danger from the
deceased and the reasonableness of her perceptions that she could not otherwise
preserve herself from death or grievous bodily harm.  The jury were properly
informed that the issues were to be considered from the perspective of someone
whose perceptions at the time of the shooting may have been shaped by her prior
experience of abuse.  In the following portion of the charge, the jury were
also directed to the relevant evidence:

 








Now what evidence is there to support the defence position that she
caused the death under a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily
harm and she believed on reasonable and probable grounds that she could not
otherwise preserve herself from death or grievous bodily
harm. . . . There is the evidence of Margaret Malott.  The evidence
of her remaining in an abusive relationship with her husband for seven years. 
Evidence of her remaining in an abusive relationship with Paul Malott for 19
years.  Most important is the evidence she gave of the nature and frequency of
the abuse.

 

The trial
judge told the jury that the appellant’s evidence was obviously of the greatest
importance and should be reviewed in detail.  He referred the jury to an
exhibit that summarized the abuse suffered by the appellant.  He also referred
to other evidence that supported the defence position of self-defence,
including the expert evidence of Dr. Jaffe.  

 

29                              
In reviewing Dr. Jaffe’s evidence, the trial judge summarized the
reasons that battered women do not leave the home in which they are being
abused.  He then stated:

 

The particulars of abuse set out in Exhibit 43 have a cumulative effect
and that resulted in an increased sense of helplessness as time went on.  She
had no sense of having a safe place to go.  She believed Paul Malott was all
knowing and all powerful.  She had no trust in the police or anyone else to
help her.  She was totally dependent on him and desperate to keep his love. 
While there were physical separations there was no psychological separation. 
She did not feel safe when he was gone and she never knew when he was coming
back.  In the last three weeks there was an increasing level of psychological
abuse.  It is an over simplification to say that she was just a woman scorned. 
She suffered an increasing sense of desperation.  On the last day she felt increasingly
threatened and got the gun.  During the ride to the medical centre she said
that he threatened her and she felt increasingly unsafe.

 








When she shot him she felt threatened which reminded her of the
previous abuse.  She said he was getting out of the car, coming after her. 
Although in cases where women have killed the batterer, they were assaulted
more frequently and more violently before doing so, that is not always the
case.  It may follow threats and psychological and emotional abuse as in this
case.  Although she did not tell Dr. Jaffe of any assault in the last six
months he said that threats can terrorize as much as an assault.  Although it
is rare for battered women to kill the man after he is living with another
woman, he has seen it in two or three cases.

 

30                              
In my opinion, this portion of the charge adequately conveyed to the
jury the utility of the expert evidence in understanding the reasons why an
abused woman might remain in a battering relationship.  It also referred the
jury to the exhibit that detailed the nature and extent of the violence that
existed between the appellant and the deceased, and described the effect that
this violence had on the appellant’s perceptions.  Accordingly, I conclude that
the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the Lavallee principles
outlined in the preceding section.

 

31                              
My conclusion that the jury charge was adequate does not mean it was
flawless.  As with most jury charges, there is room for debate.  In particular,
it could be argued that it may have been desirable for the trial judge to have
instructed the jury to a greater extent in making the connection between the
evidence of battered woman syndrome and the legal issue of self-defence. 
However, in reviewing the trial judge’s charge as a whole, I am satisfied that
the jury were left with a sufficient understanding of the facts as they related
to the relevant legal issues. 

 

32                              
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge in this case
was required to repeat verbatim comments made by this Court in Lavallee. 
In my view, such a requirement would impose an unnecessary and non-productive
obligation.  There is no precise formula that can be followed in instructing a
jury.  In reviewing a jury charge, an appellate court should not minutely
scrutinize the charge but should consider whether the trial judge reviewed the
evidence and related it to the relevant legal issues and principles in a manner
that would equip the jury to reach its verdict according to applicable law.








 

33                              
I would add that I do not accept the respondent’s submission that, in
view of the Crown’s concession that the abuse took place, it was not necessary
for the trial judge in this case to address the first and second principles
from Lavallee.  In my view, regardless of any concessions made by the
Crown, it is incumbent upon a trial judge to explain to the jury the purposes
for which expert evidence on battered woman syndrome is admitted in cases such
as the present one.

 

VI.  Disposition

 

34                              
The appeal is dismissed.

 

The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

35                      L’Heureux-Dubé J. -- I have read the reasons of my colleague
Justice Major, and I concur with the result that he reaches.  However, given
that this Court has not had the opportunity to discuss the value of evidence
of  “battered woman syndrome” since R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852,
and given the evolving discourse on “battered woman syndrome” in the legal
community, I will make a few comments on the importance of this kind of
evidence to the just adjudication of charges involving battered women.

 








36                      First, the significance of
this Court’s decision in Lavallee, which first accepted the need for
expert evidence on the effects of abusive relationships in order to properly
understand the context in which an accused woman had killed her abusive spouse
in self-defence, reaches beyond its particular impact on the law of
self-defence.  A crucial implication of the admissibility of expert evidence in
Lavallee is the legal recognition that historically both the law and
society may have treated women in general, and battered women in particular,
unfairly.  Lavallee accepted that the myths and stereotypes which are
the products and the tools of this unfair treatment interfere with the capacity
of judges and juries to justly determine a battered woman’s claim of
self-defence, and can only be dispelled by expert evidence designed to overcome
the stereotypical thinking.  The expert evidence is admissible, and necessary,
in order to understand the reasonableness of a battered woman’s perceptions,
which in Lavallee were the accused’s perceptions that she had to act
with deadly force in order to preserve herself from death or grievous bodily
harm.  Accordingly, the utility of such evidence in criminal cases is not
limited to instances where a battered woman is pleading self-defence, but is
potentially relevant to other situations where the reasonableness of a battered
woman’s actions or perceptions is at issue (e.g. provocation, duress or
necessity).  See R. v. Hibbert, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, at p. 1021.

 

37                      It is clear from the
foregoing that “battered woman syndrome” is not a legal defence in itself such
that an accused woman need only establish that she is suffering from the syndrome
in order to gain an acquittal.  As Wilson J. commented in Lavallee, at
p. 890: “Obviously the fact that the appellant was a battered woman does not
entitle her to an acquittal.  Battered women may well kill their partners other
than in self-defence.”  Rather, “battered woman syndrome” is a psychiatric
explanation of the mental state of women who have been subjected to continuous
battering by their male intimate partners, which can be relevant to the legal
inquiry into a battered woman’s state of mind.

 








38                      Second, the majority of the
Court in Lavallee also implicitly accepted that women’s experiences and
perspectives may be different from the experiences and perspectives of men.  It
accepted that a woman’s perception of what is reasonable is influenced by her
gender, as well as by her individual experience, and both are relevant to the
legal inquiry.  This legal development was significant, because it demonstrated
a willingness to look at the whole context of a woman’s experience in order to
inform the analysis of the particular events.  But it is wrong to think of this
development of the law as merely an example where an objective test -- the
requirement that an accused claiming self-defence must reasonably
apprehend death or grievous bodily harm -- has been modified to admit evidence
of the subjective perceptions of a battered woman.  More important, a majority
of the Court accepted that the perspectives of women, which have historically
been ignored, must now equally inform the “objective” standard of the
reasonable person in relation to self-defence. 

 

39                      When interpreting and
applying Lavallee, these broader principles should be kept in mind.  In
particular, they should be kept in mind in order to avoid a too rigid and
restrictive approach to the admissibility and legal value of evidence of a
battered woman’s experiences.  Concerns have been expressed that the treatment
of expert evidence on battered women syndrome, which is itself admissible in
order to combat the myths and stereotypes which society has about battered
women, has led to a new stereotype of the “battered woman”: see, e.g., Martha
Shaffer, “The battered woman syndrome revisited: Some complicating thoughts
five years after R. v. Lavallee” (1997), 47 U.T.L.J. 1, at
p. 9; Sheila Noonan, “Strategies of Survival: Moving Beyond the Battered Woman
Syndrome”, in Ellen Adelberg and Claudia Currie, eds., In Conflict with the
Law:  Women and the Canadian Justice System (1993), 247, at p. 254;
Isabel Grant, “The ‘syndromization’ of women’s experience”, in
Donna Martinson et al., “A Forum on Lavallee v. R.: Women and
Self-Defence” (1991), 25 U.B.C. L. Rev. 23, 51, at pp. 53-54; and Martha
R. Mahoney, “Legal Images of Battered Women: Redefining the Issue of
Separation” (1991), 90 Mich. L. Rev. 1, at p. 42.  

 








40                      It is possible that those
women who are unable to fit themselves within the stereotype of a victimized,
passive, helpless, dependent, battered woman will not have their claims to
self-defence fairly decided.  For instance, women who have demonstrated too
much strength or initiative, women of colour, women who are professionals, or
women who might have fought back against their abusers on previous occasions,
should not be penalized for failing to accord with the stereotypical image of
the archetypal battered woman.  See, e.g., Julie Stubbs and Julia Tolmie,
“Race, Gender, and the Battered Woman Syndrome: An Australia Case Study”
(1995), 8 C.J.W.L. 122.  Needless to say, women with these
characteristics are still entitled to have their claims of self-defence fairly
adjudicated, and they are also still entitled to have their experiences as
battered women inform the analysis.  Professor  Grant, supra, at p. 52,
warns against allowing the law to develop such that a woman accused of killing
her abuser must either have been “reasonable ‘like a man’ or reasonable ‘like a
battered woman’”.  I agree that this must be avoided.  The “reasonable woman”
must not be forgotten in the analysis, and deserves to be as much a part of the
objective standard of the reasonable person as does the “reasonable man”.

 








41                      How should the courts
combat the “syndromization”, as Professor Grant refers to it, of battered women
who act in self-defence?  The legal inquiry into the moral culpability of a
woman who is, for instance, claiming self-defence must focus on the reasonableness
of her actions in the context of her personal experiences, and her experiences
as a woman, not on her status as a battered woman and her entitlement to claim
that she is suffering from “battered woman syndrome”.  This point has been made
convincingly by many academics reviewing the relevant cases:  see, e.g.,
Wendy Chan, “A Feminist Critique of Self-Defense and Provocation in
Battered Women’s Cases in England and Wales” (1994), 6 Women & Crim.
Just. 39, at pp. 56-57; Elizabeth M. Schneider, “Describing and Changing:
Women’s Self-Defense Work and the Problem of Expert Testimony on Battering”
(1992), 14 Women’s Rts. L. Rep. 213, at pp. 216-17; and Marilyn
MacCrimmon, “The social construction of reality and the rules of evidence”, in
Donna Martinson et al., supra, 36, at pp. 48-49.  By emphasizing a
woman’s “learned helplessness”, her dependence, her victimization, and her low
self-esteem, in order to establish that she suffers from “battered woman
syndrome”, the legal debate shifts from the objective rationality of her
actions to preserve her own life to those personal inadequacies which
apparently explain her failure to flee from her abuser.  Such an emphasis
comports too well with society’s stereotypes about women.  Therefore, it should
be scrupulously avoided because it only serves to undermine the important
advancements achieved by the decision in Lavallee. 

 

42                      There are other elements of
a woman’s social context which help to explain her inability to leave her
abuser, and which do not focus on those characteristics most consistent with
traditional stereotypes.  As Wilson J. herself recognized in Lavallee,
at p. 887, “environmental factors may also impair the woman’s ability to leave
-- lack of job skills, the presence of children to care for, fear of
retaliation by the man, etc. may each have a role to play in some cases.”  To
this list of factors I would add a woman’s need to protect her children from abuse,
a fear of losing custody of her children, pressures to keep the family
together, weaknesses of social and financial support for battered women, and no
guarantee that the violence would cease simply because she left.  These
considerations necessarily inform the reasonableness of a woman’s beliefs or
perceptions of, for instance, her lack of an alternative to the use of deadly
force to preserve herself from death or grievous bodily harm.

 








43                      How should these principles
be given practical effect in the context of a jury trial of a woman accused of
murdering her abuser?  To fully accord with the spirit of Lavallee,
where the reasonableness of a battered woman’s belief is at issue in a criminal
case, a judge and jury should be made to appreciate that a battered woman’s
experiences are both individualized, based on her own history and
relationships, as well as shared with other women, within the context of a
society and a legal system which has historically undervalued women’s
experiences.  A judge and jury should be told that a battered woman’s
experiences are generally outside the common understanding of the average judge
and juror, and that they should seek to  understand the evidence being presented
to them in order to overcome the myths and stereotypes which we all share. 
Finally, all of this should be presented in such a way as to focus on the
reasonableness of the woman’s actions, without relying on old or new
stereotypes about battered women.  

 

44                      My focus on women as the
victims of battering and as the subjects of “battered woman syndrome” is not
intended to exclude from consideration those men who find themselves in abusive
relationships.  However, the reality of our society is that typically, it is
women who are the victims of domestic violence, at the hands of their male
intimate partners.  To assume that men who are victims of spousal abuse are
affected by the abuse in the same way, without benefit of the research and
expert opinion evidence which has informed the courts of the existence and
details of  “battered woman syndrome”, would be imprudent.

 








45                      In the present appeal, it
was uncontested that Margaret Ann Malott suffered years of horrible emotional,
psychological, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, Paul
Malott.  Dr. Peter Jaffe, the psychologist who testified on Mrs. Malott’s
behalf, described her as having “one of the most severe cases” of battered
woman syndrome that he had ever seen.  I agree with Abella J.A. that in such
circumstances, the trial judge could have more expansively explained and
emphasized the relevance of the expert evidence on battered woman syndrome to
Mrs. Malott’s claim of self-defence.  In this connection, the trial
judge’s charge to the jury was not perfect.  But as my colleague Major J.
correctly points out at para. 15, it is unrealistic for an appeal court to
review a trial judge’s charge to a jury based on a standard of perfection.  In
deference to this well-established principle, I agree with Major J.’s
conclusion that the charge was sufficient.  For these reasons, I would dismiss
the appeal.

The accused was charged with first degree murder.  At
trial, he had planned to testify in his own defence but, after the Crown closed
its case, his counsel made a Corbett application to have the accused’s
lengthy criminal record excluded.  The trial judge did not make a ruling at
that time, but rather indicated that he would prefer to wait until the accused
had given his testimony in chief, as one of the determining factors is the
nature of the evidence adduced by the defence.  The accused elected not to
testify.  He was later convicted and his conviction was upheld by the Court of
Appeal.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

Our criminal process is based upon the principle that before
the accused calls evidence in his own defence, he must have knowledge of the
case to be met.  The extent to which his criminal record will be admissible
against him will encompass part of that case.  Hence, a Corbett
application should be made by the defence and decided by the trial judge
immediately after the close of the Crown’s case.  If the trial judge believes
it to be necessary, a voir dire should be held in which the defence
discloses what evidence it intends to call, so the trial judge can make a fully
informed ruling on the application.  This voir dire is not “defence
disclosure” and creates no independent rights in the Crown.  The defence always
retains the right to lead evidence which was not disclosed at the voir dire. 
However, the trial judge’s ruling on the application  may be subject to
modification if the defence evidence departs significantly from what was
disclosed.  In this case, the trial judge refused to rule until after the
accused had testified, and in so doing, he erred.  Because the trial judge’s
error resulted in the accused declining to testify in his own defence, this is
not an appropriate case for the application of the curative proviso in
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . It cannot be said
with confidence that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would
have been different absent the error of law.

The Chief Justice --

 

I.  Introduction

 

1                                  
In R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, a majority of this Court
held that s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-5  (formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10), conferred a discretion on the trial judge
to exclude all or part of an accused’s prior criminal record, where the
probative value of that record is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  In
this case, the Court must decide at what stage in the trial proceedings an
accused is entitled to a ruling on his or her application to have all or part
of the record excluded (a so-called Corbett application).

 

II.  Facts
and Judgments Below

 

2                                  
It is not necessary to go into the facts in extensive detail, as most
are not relevant to the outcome of this appeal.  The appellant was charged with
first degree murder in the shooting of Patrick William Campbell.  After the
appellant changed counsel several times, the trial got under way.  The
appellant had planned to testify in his own defence but, after the Crown closed
its case, his counsel made a Corbett application to the trial judge. 
The appellant’s criminal record was extensive, to say the least.  He had been
convicted of numerous thefts, assaults of varying severity, robbery, some
weapons offences, threatening, wilful damage, failure to attend, failure to
appear, obstructing a peace officer, trafficking in a narcotic, and impaired
driving.

 








3                                  
The trial judge did not make a ruling at that time, but rather indicated
that he would prefer to wait until the appellant had given his testimony in
chief, as one of the determining factors is the nature of the evidence adduced
by the defence.  The appellant then advised his counsel that he would not be
testifying, and the defence closed its case.  The appellant was convicted of
first degree murder.

 

4                                  
In a unanimous, unattributed judgment reported at (1995), 174 A.R. 234,
102 W.A.C. 234, 102 C.C.C. (3d) 281, [1995] A.J. No. 906 (QL), the Alberta
Court of Appeal briefly reviewed the decision in Corbett and noted that
this Court did not decide at what point in the trial the Judge should rule on
the exclusion of the accused’s previous convictions.  The Court of Appeal
agreed with the trial judge that the Corbett application could not be
decided in a vacuum.  They therefore concluded that the appellant is not
entitled to have the admissibility of the record determined in advance of the
decision to testify.  The proper course would have been to conduct a voir
dire to determine the admissibility of the appellant’s record when the
trial judge believed he had all the requisite information.  However, it could
not be said that  the trial judge would have failed to conduct a voir dire
had the appellant elected to testify.

 

III.  Analysis

 

5                                  
The question which the Court must answer in this case is whether it is
an error of law to refuse to make a ruling on a Corbett application
before the accused has elected to testify and been examined in chief.  On the
one hand, it would be very undesirable to force the trial judge to make a
decision without all the relevant information.  On the other hand, the accused
must have an opportunity to make an informed decision whether to testify and,
accordingly, should know as much as possible about the consequences of that
decision in advance of having to make it.








 

6                                  
A balance must be struck between these two necessities.  However, the
balance must reflect that the ultimate goal of the procedural and substantive
protections in the criminal justice system are to ensure that trials are
scrupulously fair.  Our criminal process is based upon the principle that
before the accused calls evidence in his own defence, he must have knowledge of
the case to be met.  The extent to which his criminal record will be admissible
against him will encompass part of that case.  The “case-to-meet” principle is
a fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system, firmly rooted in the common
law and an integral part of the principles of fundamental justice (R. v. S.
(R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451), which are protected by s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  It is part of the broader principle
against self-incrimination, which has its roots in the presumption of innocence
and the power imbalance between the state and the individual.  See Dubois v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, and R. v. P. (M.B.), [1994] 1 S.C.R.
555, at p. 578.

 

7                                  
In this context, the case-to-meet principle suggests that the accused
should have a right to make a Corbett application, and to know its
outcome at the close of the Crown’s case.  It would be manifestly unfair to
force an accused to engage in what the appellant describes as “russian
roulette”, or what Professor Delisle, in an annotation to R. v. Hoffman
(1994), 32 C.R. (4th) 396, at p. 398, calls “blind man’s buff”.  I would adopt
the statements of Lederman J. in R. v. Ford (1995), 34 C.R.R. (2d) 143
(Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), at p. 146:

 

I ask rhetorically why should the accused not know
of this information at the close of the Crown’s case?  Why should counsel have
to guess at what the outcome of a Corbett application will be in making
the decision to call the accused as a witness?

 








There is no valid reason for delaying the
application so as to place the accused in the irrevocable position of having
given up his or her right to silence on the chance that a Corbett
application will go his or her way.

 








The Corbett application should not be a bear
trap for the accused.  Increasingly, courts have said that the accused should
know before he or she calls any evidence the full extent of the case he or she
has to meet.  In keeping with those principles the proper time to bring a Corbett
application is upon the completion of the Crown’s case.

 

 

8                                  
Although fairness requires that the ruling be made no later than the
close of the Crown’s case, there is always the possibility that the defence
evidence will influence the trial judge’s prior evaluation of the probative
value and prejudicial effect of the criminal record.  There are various ways of
dealing with this problem.  One is the possibility of making a preliminary
ruling, subject to reconsideration if necessary.  However, this may be no less
of a “bear trap” for the accused than refusing to make a ruling at all. 
Imagine the possible unfairness that would arise if the accused takes the stand
in reliance on a ruling that some or all of his prior convictions will be
excluded, and that ruling is subsequently reversed.

 

9                                  
In my view, the situation can be resolved by holding a voir dire
before the defence opens its case.  In this voir dire, the defence will
reveal the evidence which it intends to call, either through calling witnesses,
or through agreed statements of fact.  The trial judge can then consider the
factors set out in Corbett (the nature of the previous convictions, the
time since the previous convictions, and any attacks made on the credibility of
Crown witnesses) in the context of the defence evidence, and make a final
ruling on the Corbett application.

 








10                              
I would emphasize that the purpose of this voir dire is not
“defence disclosure”.  It creates no independent rights in the Crown, and,
therefore should not be treated as an excuse for the Crown to deeply probe the
case for the defence, as the defence is entitled to do to the Crown’s case at a
preliminary inquiry.  The point is to provide the trial judge with the
information he or she needs to make an informed decision, but  the Crown has no
right to require more than that.  There may even be cases in which the trial
judge believes he or she has sufficient information to make a decision without
such disclosure, such as where the nature of the defence is fairly clear or has
otherwise been disclosed (e.g. an alibi), or where the outcome of the
application is readily apparent without this information.  In those cases,
disclosure need not be given.

 

11                              
I should make it clear that this is not a form of “Stinchcombe in
reverse”.  The accused always retains the right to lead evidence which was not
disclosed at the voir dire.  However, if the accused fails to disclose
evidence, and the trial judge believes that the undisclosed evidence would have
had a material impact on the Corbett application, he or she can change
his or her ruling when that evidence is lead.

 

12                              
In the case at bar, the trial judge refused to rule on the Corbett
application until the appellant had elected to testify and been examined in
chief.  For the reasons described above, this was an error of law.  The Crown
has argued that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, and
the Court should apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,  to dismiss the appeal.  I must disagree.  It
is clear that the trial judge’s refusal to make a ruling adversely affected the
appellant’s decision whether to testify in his own defence, as he had a right
to do.  We have no way of knowing what the appellant might have said, and
therefore, we cannot say with confidence that there is no reasonable
possibility that the verdict would have been different absent the error of law
(which is the test for the application of the proviso — R. v. Bevan,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 599).

 

IV.  Conclusion

 








13                              
In summary, a Corbett application should be made after the close
of the Crown’s case.  If the trial judge believes it to be necessary, a voir
dire should be held in which the defence discloses what evidence it intends
to call, so he or she can make a fully informed ruling on the application. 
This ruling may be subject to modification if the defence evidence departs
significantly from what was disclosed.  In this case, the trial judge refused
to rule until after the appellant had testified, and in so doing, he erred. 
Because the trial judge’s error resulted in the appellant declining to testify
in his own defence, this is not an appropriate case for the application of the
curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii).  I would therefore allow the
appeal and order a new trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 








Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Confessions ‑‑ Parents of victims of sexual assault consulting with
police and deciding to trick accused into confession ‑‑ Statement
made to parent wielding knife and making death threat ‑‑
Out-of-court statement admitted without voir dire and without objection by
defence counsel ‑‑ Extent to which person in authority requirement
should remain part of confessions rule -- Whether voir dire should have been
held to determine whether statements made to person in authority and whether
statements made voluntarily ‑‑ Whether onus always rests on defence
to request voir dire ‑‑ If not, circumstances under which trial
judge should hold voir dire ‑‑ Evidence which triggers trial
judge’s obligation to hold voir dire.

 

The respondent confessed to sexually touching young
boys.  Two of the victims told their fathers who, in turn, discussed the matter
with the RCMP on two occasions and then decided to try to trick the
accused into confessing.  The father of one boy confronted the accused and,
when he denied the allegations, grabbed him by the hair, held a knife to his
throat and threatened him.  When the accused replied with an inculpatory statement,
the father punched him and forced him to apologize to the children.  Throughout
his statement to the police, the accused kept expressing surprise that it had
taken the father three days to have him arrested.  At trial, the statements
made by the accused to the father and the children were admitted into
evidence.  Defence counsel raised no objection to the admission of this
evidence, but argued to the jury that the statements were patently unreliable
in light of the circumstances under which they were made.  The accused was
convicted.  The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal and ordered a new trial.

 








At issue here is whether the trial judge erred in
failing to direct a voir dire of his own motion to determine whether the
statements made to the father of one of the complainants were given to a person
in authority and, if so, whether the statements were made voluntarily.  In
order to determine whether the trial judge erred several subsidiary issues
needed to be considered.  First, does the onus always rest with the defence to
request a voir dire to test the voluntariness of an accused’s out‑of‑court
statements?  If not, when and under what circumstances should a trial judge
hold a voir dire of his own motion?  Further, is the trial judge’s obligation
to hold a voir dire triggered only where the receiver of the confession
is a “conventional” person in authority, or should the obligation be construed
more broadly?  Lastly, to what extent should the “person in authority”
requirement remain part of the confessions rule?

 

Held (L’Heureux-Dubé
and Bastarache JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

Per Lamer C.J. and
Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci, Major and Binnie JJ.:  The applicable
principles and factors to be considered were set out in R. v. Hodgson,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 449.

 

The evidence adduced was sufficient to have alerted
the trial judge to the need for a voir dire.  Significantly, the
complainants’ parents visited and spoke to the police and, after their second
visit, planned to obtain an admission from the respondent by a trick.  In light
of the evidence, the trial judge should have inquired of defence counsel
whether or not he was willing to waive a voir dire in relation to
statements against interest made by the accused to the father.  There was
sufficient evidence before the judge to constitute this one of those “rare
cases” where the trial judge in the absence of a request by the accused to hold
a voir dire would be required to make an inquiry as to whether there
should be a voir dire to determine if the parents were persons in
authority for the purposes of the confessions rule. If, on retrial, the
respondent’s statements to the father were again admitted into evidence,
fairness requires that a direction, as suggested in Hodgson, be given
regarding these statements.

 








Per
L’Heureux-Dubé and Bastarache JJ. (dissenting): The pertinent definitions
and tests to be considered were established in the companion case of R. v.
Hodgson, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449.

 

The confessions rule excludes statements made by the
accused to persons in authority which are not proven voluntary beyond a
reasonable doubt by the Crown.  A “person in authority” is someone formally
involved in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused,
and whom the accused believes to have such authority.

 

As a general rule, the defence must raise the issue of
the accused’s statement being made to a “person in authority” and request a voir
dire to examine the statement’s voluntariness.  This basic obligation is
supplemented, however, by the trial judge’s duty to ensure the fair conduct of
a criminal trial, and therefore, in exceptional circumstances, she or he may
have to direct a voir dire proprio motu.  These
exceptional circumstances, and the duty to host a voir dire without any
request from counsel, arise where the evidence before the judge reveals the
realistic potential that the accused’s statement was made to a “person in
authority”.  In practical terms then, where the statement is made to a
non-obvious person in authority, there must be a realistic potential that the
person is acting as an agent of the state and the accused might have known of
this relationship for the voluntariness of the state to become a live issue and
the trial judge’s obligation to host a voir dire to arise.

 








Here, the evidence of a meeting of unknown content and
the father’s independent development of a plan to extract an incriminating
statement from the accused, fails to establish the realistic potential that the
father was a person in authority, and therefore, the trial judge’s duty to
conduct a voir dire prior to admitting the statements never arose.  Even
if the evidence established the reasonable possibility that the father met the
basic definition of a “person in authority”, as someone formally involved in
proceedings against the accused, there was no reasonable basis on which to
assume that this potential fact affected the voluntariness of the accused’s
statements.  It would
be unreasonable to assume that the accused  knew of the father’s visits  to the police and thus that the father had
authority under the confessions rule which affected the voluntariness of the
accused’s statements.

same issues must be resolved in both this appeal and that of R. v. Hodgson,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 449.

 

2         
In both cases, defence counsel did not request a voir dire to
test the voluntariness of certain out‑of‑court statements allegedly
made by the accused, and as a result, the statements were admitted into
evidence.  The appellants contend that the trial judge erred in failing to
direct a voir dire of his own motion to determine whether the statements
were given to a person in authority and if so, whether they were made
voluntarily.

In order to determine whether the trial judge erred it is necessary to
consider several subsidiary issues.  First, does the onus always rest with the
defence to request a voir dire to test the voluntariness of an accused’s
out‑of‑court statements?  If not, when and under what circumstances
should a trial judge hold a voir dire of his or her own motion? 
Further, is the trial judge’s obligation to hold a voir dire triggered
only where the receiver of the statement is a “conventional” person in
authority, or should the obligation be construed more broadly?  Lastly, to what
extent should the “person in authority” requirement remain part of the
confessions rule?

 

I.  Background

 

A.  Facts

 

4         
The respondent was an acquaintance of G.D., the father of the
complainant A.D.  When G.D. invited the respondent to stay at his home, G.D.
noticed that A.D.’s behaviour began to change, and he began wetting his bed. 
This prompted G.D. to ask A.D. if the respondent had been touching him
improperly but A.D. denied it.

 

5         
G.D. moved with his family to another town and refused to let the
respondent accompany them.  Shortly after the D. family moved, the respondent
showed up at their door.  G.D. allowed the respondent to stay with the family
for a couple of days.  During that time, T.T., a playmate of A.D., told his
father, S.T., that the respondent had touched his penis. S.T. and G.D., who
were friends, discussed the matter the following day at work.  After work, they
stopped at the local RCMP detachment and discussed the situation with a police
officer.  The evidence does not disclose the content of their discussions with
the police on either that occasion or on the visit of the following day.  Both
G.D. and S.T. testified that after the visits to the RCMP, they decided to try
to trick the respondent into confessing.  This plan elicited a response from
the respondent that he had accidentally touched T.T. while playing and that he
(the respondent) would explain it all to S.T.  The respondent told G.D. that he
was not the kind of man who touched young boys.

 








6         
G.D. then asked A.D. and C.M., G.D.’s nephew, if the respondent had
touched them.  The children admitted that he had.  G.D. confronted the
respondent with the allegations, and he denied them.  G.D. then grabbed the
respondent by the hair and held a bread knife to his throat.  He said he could
kill the respondent for what he had done to his children.  The respondent
replied, “I wish you would.  I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”  G.D. then
dropped the knife and punched the respondent once, cutting him above the eye. 
G.D. also forced the respondent to apologize to the children.  The respondent
told the children, “I never meant to hurt you and I was wrong for touching
you.  I’m sorry.”  G.D. took the children to see the RCMP the next day and the
day after that, the respondent was arrested.

 

7         
Throughout his statement to the police, the respondent kept expressing
surprise that it had taken G.D. three days to have him arrested.  He expressed
it in these words:

 

That was on a Tuesday, Tuesday of . . . around what?  Around two‑thirty
. . . no, around two . . . or two‑thirty, this
happened . . . when he came outta the bush and why it took him so long to
put out a warrant for me or have me arrested right on the spot, why?  It took
’em three days?

 

It was
conceded before the Court of Appeal that the word “him” referred to G.D.

 

8         
At trial, the statements made by the respondent to G.D. and the children
were admitted into evidence.  Defence counsel raised no objection to the
admission of this evidence, but argued to the jury that the statements were
patently unreliable in light of the circumstances under which they were made. 
The respondent was convicted.

 








II.  Judgments Below

 

A.  Supreme Court of British Columbia, [1994] B.C.J.
No. 2374 (QL)

 

9         
A jury found the respondent guilty of three counts of sexual
interference and two counts of sexual assault.

 

B.  British Columbia Court of Appeal (1996), 77
B.C.A.C. 129

 

10     
Hinds J.A. (Williams J.A. concurring) reviewed the evidence and
concluded that, in this case, it would appear on a subjective basis that the
respondent may well have believed that G.D. was capable of his “arrest” and had
some degree of power over him.  Thus, at the time that the respondent made the
statement to G.D. at knife point, and when he made the incriminating apology to
the children, he might have believed that G.D. was a person in authority. 
Hinds J.A. based this conclusion on the respondent’s statement to the RCMP that
he was surprised G.D. did not have him arrested on the spot, and that he had
taken so long to have him arrested.

 

11     
The Crown argued that the respondent had deliberately refrained from
raising the issue as to whether G.D. was a person in authority at trial in an
attempt to focus on the credibility of Crown witnesses.  Hinds J.A. disagreed,
and further held that the failure of counsel to raise this issue at trial was
not fatal.  Hinds J.A. allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

12     
In a separate judgment, McEachern C.J. (Williams J.A. concurring) added
that, if it had been argued, he would also have excluded the statements made by
the respondent under the threat of physical violence as they failed the test
for reliability.








 

III.  Analysis

 

13     
The basic issue in this appeal, as in Hodgson, is whether the
trial judge erred in failing to hold a voir dire of his own motion to
test the voluntariness of certain out‑of‑court statements made by
the accused before admitting them.  In order to resolve this issue, it is
appropriate to consider whether the confessions rule should continue to apply
only to statements made to persons in authority, or whether it should be
expanded so as to capture the out‑of‑court statements made by the
accused in this case.

 

14     
The applicable principles and factors to be considered are set out in
the reasons given in Hodgson.  It will suffice to repeat the summary set
out in Hodgson, at para. 48.

 

1.  The rule which is still applicable in
determining the admissibility of a statement made by an accused to a person in
authority is that it must have been made voluntarily and must be the product of
an operating mind.

 

2.  The rule is based upon two
fundamentally important concepts: the need to ensure the reliability of the
statement and the need to ensure fairness by guarding against improper coercion
by the state.  This results in the requirement that the admission must not
be obtained by either threats or inducements.

 

3.  The rule is applicable when the accused
makes a statement to a person in authority.  Though no absolute definition of 
“person in authority” is necessary or desirable, it typically refers to those
formally engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the
accused.  Thus, it would apply to person such as police officers and prison
officials or guards.  When the statement of the accused is made to a police
officer or prison guard a voir dire should be held to determine its
admissibility as a voluntary statement, unless the voir dire is waived
by counsel for the accused.

 

4.  Those persons whom the accused
reasonably believes are acting on behalf of the police or prosecuting
authorities and could therefore influence or control the proceedings against
him or her may also be persons in authority.  That question will have to be
determined on a case-by-case basis.

 








5.  The issue as to who is a person in
authority must be resolved by considering it subjectively from the viewpoint of
the accused.  There must, however, be a reasonable basis for the accused’s
belief that the person hearing the statement was a person in authority.

 

6.  The issue will not normally arise in
relation to undercover police officers.  This is because the issue must be
approached from the viewpoint of the accused.  On that basis, undercover police
officers will not usually be viewed by the accused as persons in authority.

 

7.  If it is contended that the recipient
of the statement was a person in authority in the eyes of the accused then the
defence must raise the issue with the trial judge.  This is appropriate for it
is only the accused who can know that the statement was made to someone
regarded by the accused as a person in authority.

 

8.  On the ensuing voir dire the
accused will have the evidential burden of demonstrating that there is a valid
issue for consideration.  If the accused meets the burden, the Crown will then
have the persuasive burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the
receiver of the statement was not a person in authority or if it is found that
he or she was a person in authority, that the statement of the accused was made
voluntarily.

 

9.  In extremely rare cases the evidence
adduced during a trial may be such that it should alert the trial judge that
the issue as to whether the receiver of a statement made by an accused was a
person in authority should be explored by way of voir dire.  In those
cases, which must be extremely rare in light of the obligation of the accused
to raise the issue, the trial judge must of his or her own motion direct a voir
dire, subject, of course, to waiver of the voir dire by counsel for
the accused.

 

10.  The duty of the trial judge to hold
a voir dire of his or her own motion will only arise in those rare cases
where the evidence, viewed objectively, is sufficient to alert the trial judge
of the need to hold a voir dire to determine if the receiver of the
statement of the accused was, in the circumstances, a person in authority.

 

11.  If the trial judge is satisfied that
the receiver of the statement was not a person in authority but that the
statement of the accused was obtained by reprehensible coercive tactics such as
violence or credible threats of violence, then a direction should be given to
the jury.  The jury should be instructed that if they conclude that the
statement was obtained by coercion, they should be cautious about accepting it,
and that little if any weight should be attached to it. [Emphasis in original.]

 

IV.  Application to this Appeal

 








15     
Although this case is not easy to resolve, the evidence adduced was, in
my view, sufficient to have alerted the trial judge to the need for a voir
dire.  To demonstrate this it is necessary to refer to the evidence.  When
G.D. testified during the Crown’s case in chief, he made the following
statements:

 

Q    You [and S.T.] had a conversation, did you,
about [T.T.]?

 

A    Yes, we did.

 

Q    And as a result then of that conversation
did you and he do something later that day?

 

A    Yes, we did.  We went in to the RCMP
station.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

Q    Okay.  And did you see a police officer
there?

 

A    Yes, we did.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

Q    Okay.  Now I presume you had some
conversations there and did [S.T.] also in your presence tell the police
officer what he told you?

 

A    Yes, he did.

 

Q    Okay.  And after your visit to the police
station, what did you and [S.T.] do?

 

A    Well, we went back to the house ‑‑
headed back towards Hixon and we decided that we were going to play a little
trick on Mr. Wells, not so much a trick as it was just to see if we thought
that he could do such a thing.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

A    ...The plan was we were going to see how Mr.
Wells would react to [S.T.] knowing about what had happened to [T.T.].

 

Q    Okay. And whose idea was it to carry out
this plan?

 

A    It was both of our ideas.  It wasn’t
really either one.  It was both of our ideas.

 

Q    And you planned this on the way back from
the police station on the way to Hixon?

 

A    Yes, it was.  [Emphasis added.]

 








16                              
Thus G.D. testified that he had contacted the police and informed them
of the situation, and that he and S.T. were planning, by means of a trick, to
obtain an admission from the respondent.  The content of the conversation with
the RCMP was not revealed.  It is significant that the complainants’ parents
visited and spoke to the police and, after that visit, planned to obtain an
admission from the respondent by a trick.  In light of the evidence, it is
reasonable to conclude that the trial judge should have inquired of defence
counsel whether or not he was willing to waive a voir dire in relation
to statements against interest made by the respondent to G.D.  It does appear
that there was sufficient evidence before the judge to constitute this one of
those “rare cases”.  The testimony was such that it required the trial judge
make an inquiry as to whether there should be a voir dire to determine
if the parents were persons in authority for the purposes of the confessions
rule.

 

17                              
A new trial should be directed for the respondent.  If, on retrial, the
respondent’s statements to G.D. are again admitted into evidence, fairness
requires a direction to be given regarding these statements.  It would be along
the lines suggested in Hodgson, at para. 30, and might be put in
this way:

 

. . .  A statement obtained as a result of inhuman or degrading
treatment or the use of violence or threats of violence may not be the
manifestation of the exercise of a free will to confess.  Rather, it may result
solely from the oppressive treatment or fear of such treatment.  If it does,
the statement may very well be either unreliable or untrue.  Therefore, if you
conclude that the statement was obtained by such oppression very little if any
weight should be attached to it.

 

V.  Disposition

 

18     
In the result, the appeal is dismissed and the order of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal directing a new trial is confirmed.








 

The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé
and Bastarache JJ. were delivered by 

 

19               L’Heureux-Dubé J.
(dissenting) -- This case addresses the same issues raised in R. v. Hodgson,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, where I set out my view as to the proper test for
determining who is a “person in
authority” under the confessions rule,
as well as the circumstances which give rise to an independent obligation for a
trial judge to conduct a voir dire into this possibility,
notwithstanding counsels’ failure to
request one.  Applying this test to the facts of this case, I would dispose of
it differently than my colleague Justice Cory. I find that the trial judge’s duty to conduct a voir dire on his
own motion never arose because whether the complainant’s father in this case was a “person in authority” was never a live issue.  On this basis, I would allow the appeal.

 

20                      My
colleague comprehensively reviews the relevant facts of this appeal, which
focuses on certain admissions made by the respondent Wells to G.D., the father
of the young complainant. I would only emphasize that the sole evidence
available prior to the admission of the impugned statements by Wells which
connected G.D. to the RCMP was two visits to the local detachment. 
Furthermore, G.D. specifically testified that it was he and S.T., the father of
another young boy, who decided they would try to trick Wells into confessing. 
As no objections were raised at trial, these incriminating statements were
admitted into evidence. Only on appeal did Wells argue that they were
inadmissible as they were extracted under the threat of harm from a person in
authority.

 








21                      The
confessions rule excludes statements made by the accused to persons in
authority which are not proven voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt by the
Crown. Its application to such evidence hinges on the pivotal concept of a “person in authority”.  In the companion case of Hodgson, I established that a “person in authority” is someone formally involved in the arrest, detention, examination or
prosecution of the accused, and whom the accused believes to have such
authority.  In other words, the proper test for “persons in authority” begins
with an objective threshold test and then subsequently examines the subjective
belief of the accused.

 

22                      As
a general rule, the defence bears the evidentiary burden of raising the issue
that the accused’s statement was made
to a “person in authority”, and of requesting a voir dire to
examine the statement’s voluntariness. 
This basic obligation is supplemented, however, by the trial judge’s duty to ensure the fair conduct of a criminal
trial, and therefore, in exceptional circumstances, she or he may have to
direct a voir dire proprio motu.

 

23                      These
exceptional circumstances, and the duty to hold a voir dire
without any request from counsel, arise where the evidence before the judge
reveals the realistic potential that the accused’s statement was made to a “person
in authority”. Essentially, the
evidence available to the trial judge prior to the admission of the statement
must show the reasonable possibility that the admission was made to a
representative of the state and the accused might objectively have known of
this authority.

 








24                      In
practical terms then, the trial judge must direct a voir dire proprio
motu, subject to informed waiver by the accused, where a statement is
made to an obvious “person in authority”.  In such a case, it can be reasonably inferred
that the accused knew of the person’s
authority.  Where the statement is made to a non-obvious person in authority,
however, the evidentiary burden on the accused is not met so easily.  In this
instance, there must be a realistic potential that the person is acting as an
agent of the state and that the accused might have known of this relationship
for the voluntariness of the statement to become a live issue and the trial
judge’s obligation to hold a voir
dire to arise.

 

25                      The
critical question in this appeal is whether this obligation arose on the facts
available to the trial judge prior to the admission of the impugned statements
made by Wells to G.D.  Contrary to my colleague, I find that there was no
realistic potential for G.D. to be a “person
in authority” on the evidence and,
therefore, no such duty ever arose.

 

26                      In
general, as the father of the complainant G.D. was not an obvious person in authority,
the accused bore the evidentiary burden of identifying the voluntariness of the
statements for this question to be a live issue.  There was no objection to the
statements’ admission though.  In the
alternative, for the judge’s obligation
to conduct a voir dire independently to arise, the evidence must
have revealed the reasonable possibility first, that the complainant’s father G.D. was acting as an agent of the state
and second, that the accused could have known of this fact.

 

27                      However,
G.D. was the first witness called by the Crown, and the evidence available to
the trial judge prior to admitting the incriminating statements of Wells
reveals only that G.D. and his friend S.T. had stopped at the local RCMP
detachment on two occasions to discuss the alleged sexual assaults on their
children. Nothing further was established about the content of these
discussions from which any relationship between G.D. and the authorities could
be inferred.  In fact, G.D. testified that it was he and his friend  who had
decided to trick Wells into confessing.  This idea was their own, and formed on
the way back from the RCMP.  

 








28                      In
my view, this evidence of a meeting of unknown content, and the fathers’ independent development of a plan to extract an
incriminating statement from Wells, fail to raise the reasonable possibility
that the men were acting as agents for the RCMP, or that either had any control
over prospective proceedings. Relying on the facts that G.D. attended the RCMP
prior to extracting the statements from the accused, subsequently formed a plan
to obtain an admission from Wells, and then returned to the RCMP, my colleague
concludes there was a “close connection” between G.D. and the authorities.  He finds, at
para. 15, that this evidence “was ...
sufficient to have alerted the trial judge to the need for a voir dire” and therefore, the trial judge erred in failing to
conduct a voir dire. 

 

29                      With
respect, I find that the connection between G.D. and the authorities on this
basis is extremely tenuous since, according to G.D.’s testimony, it was his and his friend’s idea to trick Wells into making a statement. Such
evidence fails to establish the reasonable possibility that G.D. was a person
in authority, and therefore, the trial judge’s duty to conduct a voir dire prior to admitting the
statements does not arise.

 








30                      In
the alternative, even if I were to accept for argument’s sake that this possibility arose objectively on
the evidence, and one could reasonably infer that the father was formally
acting under the directions of the police, I would still find that the trial
judge’s duty was not triggered. 
Indeed, there was nothing in the record to show that the accused could have
known of the visit to the RCMP and any alleged relationship between the RCMP
and the complainant’s father.  In other
words, even accepting for argument’s
sake that the evidence established the reasonable possibility that the father
met the basic definition of a “person
in authority”, as someone formally
involved in proceedings against the accused, there was no reasonable basis on
which to assume that this potential fact affected the voluntariness of  Wells’ statements. In the end, it would be unreasonable to
assume that Wells knew of G.D.’s visit
to the RCMP and thus that G.D. had authority under the confessions rule which
affected the voluntariness of Wells’
statements.

 

31                      I
observe that my colleague refers, in his summary of the facts,  to the fact
that the accused wondered why it took the authorities so long to arrest him.
This evidence, however, only came out at trial after the impugned evidence was
admitted and, therefore, it has no relevance to this Court’s review of whether an obligation to hold a voir
dire for purposes of the confessions rule arose. While my colleague’s reasons do not rely on this fact, I think it is
important to state its irrelevance to the issue at hand.

 

32                      In
conclusion, as I find that the trial judge’s obligation to direct a voir dire independently never
arose in the circumstances of this case, and the impugned statements were
properly admitted, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and restore the jury’s verdict at trial.

The trial judge admitted into evidence certain out‑of‑court
statements allegedly made by the accused and convicted him of sexual assault. 
The complainant and her parents had confronted the accused at work and all
testified that he admitted the sexual assaults.  The complainant’s mother then
went to call the police and, on her return, struck the accused.  At some point
after receiving the statement, the complainant’s father held the accused at
knife-point, allegedly to prevent him from leaving before the police arrived. 
At trial, the accused denied making a confession but testified that he was
neither frightened nor threatened during the confrontation.  His counsel raised
no objection to the admission of the out-of-court statement at trial.

 

At issue is whether the trial judge erred in failing to direct a voir
dire of his own motion to determine whether the statements made to the
complainant and her family were given to persons in authority and if so,
whether the statements were made voluntarily.  Several subsidiary issues
required consideration.  First, does the onus always rest with the defence to
request a voir dire to test the voluntariness of an accused’s out‑of‑court
statements?  If not, when and under what circumstances should a trial judge
hold a voir dire of his or her own motion?  Further, is the trial
judge’s obligation to hold a voir dire triggered only where the receiver
of the confession is a “conventional” person in authority, or should the
obligation be construed more broadly?  Lastly, to what extent should the
“person in authority” requirement remain part of the confessions rule?








Held:  The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

Per Lamer C.J. and Gonthier, Cory,
McLachlin, Iacobucci, Major and Binnie JJ.:  A statement made by an accused to
a person in authority must be made voluntarily and must be the product of an
operating mind.  This rule is based upon two fundamentally important concepts: 
the need to ensure the reliability of the statement and the need to ensure
fairness by guarding against improper coercion by the state.  This results in
the requirement that the admission must not be obtained by either threats or
inducements.  The person in authority requirement is grounded in the underlying
rationales for the confessions rule and should remain part of the rule.  

 

The definition of “person in authority” typically refers to those
formally engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the
accused and so applies to police officers and prison officials or guards.  When
an accused makes a statement to a police officer or prison guard a voir dire
should be held to determine its admissibility as a voluntary statement, unless
the voir dire is waived by the defence.  In addition, those persons whom
the accused reasonably believes are acting on behalf of the state and could
therefore influence or control the proceedings against him or her may also be
persons in authority.  That issue must be resolved by considering it from the
viewpoint of the accused.  The receiver’s status as a person in authority
arises only if the accused has knowledge of that status.  In addition, there
must be a reasonable basis for the accused’s belief that the person hearing the
statement was a person in authority.  This issue will not normally arise in
relation to undercover police officers because, from the accused’s viewpoint,
they will not usually be viewed as persons in authority.

 








The defence must raise the “person in authority” issue with the
trial judge.  This is appropriate for it is only the accused who can know that
the statement was made to someone regarded by the accused as a person in
authority.  On the ensuing voir dire, the accused will have the
evidential burden of demonstrating that there is a valid issue for consideration. 
If the accused meets the burden, the Crown will then have the persuasive burden
of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the receiver of the statement
was not a person in authority, or if it is found that he or she was a person in
authority, that the statement was made voluntarily.

 

In extremely rare cases, the evidence adduced during a trial, viewed
objectively, may indicate that the issue as to whether the receiver of a
statement of the accused was a person in authority should be explored by way of
voir dire.  In those cases, the trial judge must of his or her own
motion direct a voir dire.  Evidence which clearly demonstrates that the
receiver of the statement was closely connected to the authorities should alert
the trial judge to the need for a voir dire on the issue.  This evidence
progresses along a spectrum.  Where the receiver of the statement is a
“conventional” person in authority, such as a police officer or prison guard,
the trial judge must clearly proceed to a voir dire to test the
voluntariness of the statement.  Similarly, where the evidence discloses a
close connection between the receiver and the authorities such that, if known
to the accused, he or she could reasonably have believed that the receiver was
acting as an agent of the prosecuting authorities, the trial judge should
inquire whether the defence is prepared to discharge its evidential burden on
the person in authority issue or whether it waives a voir dire on this
issue.  However, the further away the receiver of the statement is from the
conventional person in authority, the less likely it will be that the evidence
will alert the trial judge to the need to hold a voir dire and the
greater the obligation of the accused to raise the issue.

 








If the trial judge is satisfied that the receiver of the statement
was not a person in authority but that the statement of the accused was
obtained by reprehensible coercive tactics such as violence or credible threats
of violence, then a direction should be given to the jury.  The jury should be
instructed that if they conclude that the statement was obtained by coercion,
they should be cautious about accepting it, and that little if any weight
should be attached to it.

 

The evidence at trial did not disclose any evidence that was sufficient
to trigger the trial judge’s obligation to hold a voir dire.  When the
statements were admitted into evidence, there was nothing to suggest that the
complainant or her family members had spoken to the police or anyone else in
authority or were even considering making a complaint.  Similarly, there was
nothing to suggest that the accused subjectively believed the complainant’s
family to have control over criminal proceedings. The trial judge properly used
the evidence of the confession to confirm the complainant’s testimony.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé and Bastarache JJ.:
The result of Cory J. was agreed with but his test with respect to the proper
interpretation of “persons in authority” was not agreed with.  

 








The confessions rule is a specific and delimited
exception to the basic rule that it is for the trier of fact to assess the
truth of statements in all the surrounding circumstances, as well as the
recognition that statements made by the accused against his or her interest are
inherently reliable. Interpretation of its integral concept of “person in authority” must be bound by applicable policy rationales which justify the
confessions rule’s exclusion of
relevant evidence.  Essentially where policy
concerns  historically related to the confession’s reliability, modern
rationales of the confessions rule now focus on state conduct and individual
fairness.  Basic fairness in the criminal process unifies the two rationales of
reliability and state deterrence, and questions of truth have given way to a
focus on voluntariness.  The confessions rule
is only concerned with voluntariness, however, where statements are made to
persons in authority.  Indeed, the general unfairness
of utilizing involuntary statements resulting from private coercion has never
been the focus of the confessions rule, even when the rule was justified by
policy concerns for reliability.  Its modern rationales explicitly affirm that
the rule is concerned only with voluntariness within the relationship between
the state and the individual.

 

As such, legislative change to the
confessions rule altering the requirement of a person in authority is neither
appropriate nor desirable.  The best rule is still that, once it is
accepted that the confession of the accused was not made to a person in
authority, it is properly admissible without any requirement for the Crown to
establish that it was voluntary. Strict retention of this rule promotes
clarity, is consistent with modern rationales
justifying the exclusion of relevant evidence and serves the general public
interest by facilitating the pursuit of truth. The “person in authority” requirement is, and should remain, the pivotal concept in the
confessions rule. 

 








The proper test for  “person in
authority” examines first the objective status of the person to whom the
confession or statement was made, and only where they are identified as someone
formally engaged in the arrest, detention, interrogation or prosecution of the
accused is it then necessary to examine whether the accused believed that the
person could influence or control the proceedings against him or her.  Only in
the rarest of cases will non-traditional persons in authority fall into this
category, and it still must be objectively established on the facts that such persons
had actual control in the proceedings.  This
approach furthers the modern principles underlying the confessions rule, and
does not erect additional unwarranted barriers to the admission of relevant
evidence. It recognizes that a subjective approach to the test for “persons in authority” was primarily adopted to address the circumstance of undercover state
agents.  The necessary prerequisite, however, remains an actual person in
authority or “instrumentality” of the state.

 

As a general rule, the defence has the onus of  requesting a voir
dire,  raising the issue that the accused’s statement was made to a “person
in authority” and thus putting the statement’s admissibility into question.  In
exceptional circumstances, the trial judge may have the duty to conduct a voir
dire where the evidence reveals the realistic potential that the admission
was made to a representative of the state and the accused might objectively
have known of this authority.  Only evidence available on the record prior to
the admission of the accused’s statement is relevant to the determination of
what the trial judge’s duty was.   This
duty will automatically arise in cases of obvious persons in authority, subject
to informed waiver by the accused, since in such cases it is reasonable to
infer the accused’s knowledge of this
authority.  In the case of non-obvious persons in authority, however, the
evidence must reveal both the reasonable possibility that the person was an
agent of the state and that the accused could have known of this status.

 

Here, there was no realistic possibility that the complainant and
her immediate family constituted persons in authority for purposes of the
confessions rule, and therefore the trial judge had no duty to host a voir
dire.

Major and Binnie JJ. was delivered by

Cory J. ‑‑ The
same issues must be resolved in both this appeal and that of R. v. Wells,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 517.

 

2                                  
In both cases, defence counsel did not request a voir dire to
test the voluntariness of certain out‑of‑court statements allegedly
made by the accused  and, as a result, the statements were admitted into
evidence.  The appellants contend that the trial judge erred in failing to
direct a voir dire of his own motion to determine whether the statements
were given to a person in authority and if so, whether they were made
voluntarily.

 








3                                  
In order to determine whether the trial judge erred it is necessary to
consider several subsidiary issues.  First, does the onus always rest with the
defence to request a voir dire to test the voluntariness of an accused’s
out‑of‑court statements?  If not, when and under what circumstances
should a trial judge hold a voir dire of his or her own motion? 
Further, is the trial judge’s obligation to hold a voir dire triggered
only where the receiver of the statement is a “conventional” person in
authority, or should the obligation be construed more broadly?  Lastly, to what
extent should the “person in authority” requirement remain part of the
confessions rule?

 

I.  Factual
Background

 

4                                  
The appellant was a friend of the complainant’s family and occasionally
babysat the complainant and her siblings.  The complainant, who was sixteen
years old at the time of trial,  testified that commencing when she was
approximately seven or eight years of age and continuing until she was
approximately eleven years of age, the appellant sexually assaulted her on
several occasions.  The complainant testified that she never told anyone about
the incidents because she was afraid and because the appellant told her that
she would get in trouble if she did.

 

5                                  
The complainant testified that in 1993, she finally told her mother
about these incidents.  When the allegations were revealed, the complainant,
her mother, her father, and her stepfather went to the appellant’s place of
employment and confronted him.  They all testified that the appellant confessed
to having sexually assaulted the complainant on several occasions, that the
appellant had said he was sorry, and that he had said he “knew it would catch
up with him”.  The complainant’s mother went to call the police, and when she
returned she struck the appellant.  At some point, the complainant’s father
pulled out a knife and held it to the appellant’s back.  The father, stepfather
and mother testified that the father pulled the knife after the appellant
confessed in order to prevent the appellant from leaving before the police
arrived.

 








6                                  
At trial, the appellant testified that he was confronted at work by the
complainant and her family about the sexual assaults, but he denied making a
confession.  He stated that he was stunned, shocked and upset by the
confrontation and did not want the situation to get blown out of proportion,
but that he was neither frightened nor threatened during the confrontation.

 

7                                  
At trial, the appellant raised no objection to the admission of the
confession evidence.  The trial judge relied on this evidence and convicted the
appellant.

A.  Ontario
Court (General Division) (Paisley J.)

 

8                                  
The trial judge noted that the appellant had previously been of good
character, and he found that this enhanced the appellant’s credibility. 
Nevertheless, the trial judge found the confession evidence “overwhelming”,
notwithstanding the appellant’s denial.  Paisley J. also found the testimony of
the complainant to be credible.  The trial judge recognized that even if he
disbelieved the evidence of the appellant, he was still bound to assess the
weight of the Crown’s evidence to see whether or not it had proven its case
beyond a reasonable doubt.  He concluded that the Crown had discharged its
burden, and that there was no rational basis for coming to any other conclusion
than that the appellant was guilty of the acts of sexual assault.  The
appellant was convicted and sentenced to four and a half years’ imprisonment.

 








B.  Court
of Appeal (1996), 91 O.A.C. 298 (Finlayson J.A. for the court)

 

9                                  
Finlayson J.A. relied on R. v. A.B. (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 17
(Ont. C.A.), for the proposition that in some circumstances, persons other than
those engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of an
accused may be considered persons in authority.  In particular, he noted that
the court in A.B., supra, found that in certain circumstances,
the parent of an infant complainant may be considered to be a person in
authority.

 

10                              
However, Finlayson J.A. noted that to determine whether some or all of
the persons confronting the appellant in this case were persons in authority
would require a careful factual investigation, and found that it would not be
proper to decide the matter on the limited record available.  Moreover, he held
that when a statement is made to a person not ordinarily engaged in the arrest,
detention, examination or prosecution of an accused person, the defence has a
responsibility to raise the issue at trial and ask for a voir dire to
determine whether the receiver of the confession was a person in authority. 
Finlayson J.A. found that the defence bears this responsibility because the subjective
reaction of the accused to his or her interrogator is essential to the ultimate
determination of voluntariness.  Absent the presence of a conventional
authority figure at the time when an inculpatory statement is made, the trial
judge must be placed on notice that the voluntariness of the statement is a
live issue.  Thus the trial judge did not err in failing to hold a voir dire
to test the voluntariness of the appellant’s confession.

 








11                              
Finlayson J.A. held that in this case, the question as to whether any or
all of the family members confronting the appellant were persons in authority
was not a live issue.  The admissibility of the statement was not challenged,
and the only issue at trial was the weight to be given to it.  The trial judge
gave it considerable weight, and found it to be important, as he was entitled
to do.  The trial judge found that the complainant was credible, and it was
open to him to use the evidence of the appellant’s confession as confirmation
of the complainant’s testimony.  The appeal from conviction was dismissed.

 

III.  Analysis

 

12                              
It “can now be taken to be clearly established in Canada that no
statement made out of court by an accused to a person in authority can be
admitted into evidence against him unless the prosecution shows, to the
satisfaction of the trial judge, that the statement was made freely and
voluntarily”.  See Erven v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 926, at
p. 931, per Dickson J., as he then was.  This, of course, is the
confessions rule.

 

13                              
The basic issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in
failing to hold a voir dire of his own motion to test the voluntariness
of certain out‑of‑court statements made by the accused before
admitting them.  In order to resolve this issue, it is appropriate to consider
whether the confessions rule should continue to apply only to statements made
to persons in authority, or whether it should be expanded so as to capture the
out‑of‑court statements made by the accused in this case.  It will
therefore be helpful to begin by examining the history of the confessions rule
generally, and the person in authority requirement in particular, in order to
understand the purpose and function of the rule in the criminal law.

 

A.  The
Confessions Rule and its Relation to the Person in Authority Requirement

 








14                              
Evidence of a confession has always been accorded great weight by triers
of fact.  This is a natural manifestation of human experience.  It is because
of the tremendous significance attributed to confessions and the innate
realization that they could be obtained by improper means that the
circumstances surrounding a confession have for centuries been carefully
scrutinized to determine whether it should be admitted.  A confession is not
excluded, however, simply because of the risk that a conviction may result, but
because of the greater risk that the conviction will be unfairly obtained and
unjust.  The unfairness of admitting a confession has historically been
addressed by a consideration of two factors.  First, the voluntariness of the
statement; and second, the status of the receiver of the statement, that is to
say, whether the receiver was a person in authority.

 

15                              
As to the first factor, a statement is said to be voluntary when it is
made without “fear of prejudice or hope of advantage”:  see Ibrahim v. The
King, [1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.), at p. 609, adopted in Canada in Prosko
v. The King (1922), 63 S.C.R. 226.  In Boudreau v. The King, [1949]
S.C.R. 262, at p. 269, Rand J. explained that “the rule is directed
against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions”. 
Voluntariness also requires that the statement must be the product of an
operating mind:  see Ward v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 30, at
p. 40, per Spence J. and Horvath v. The Queen, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 376, at p. 425, per Beetz J.  Voluntariness is determined by
a careful investigation of the circumstances surrounding the statement of the
accused, and involves a consideration of both objective and subjective factors.

 

16                              
Second, the person in authority requirement generally refers to anyone
formally engaged in “the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the
accused”:  see, e.g., A.B., supra, at p. 26.  This
definition may be enlarged to encompass persons who are deemed to be persons in
authority as a result of the circumstances surrounding the making of the
statement.  For the moment, however, let us consider the purpose of each of
these factors as they pertain to the admissibility of statements of the accused.








 

17                              
Historically the insistence that a confession must be voluntary related
to concerns about the reliability of the evidence.  Indeed, the basis for the
admission of a statement of the accused as an exception to the rule against
hearsay is that what people freely say which is contrary to their interest is
probably true.  However, where a statement is prompted by a threat or
inducement held out by a person in authority, it can no longer be presumed to
be true.  Initially when considering the admissibility of confessions some
judges focused exclusively on reliability concerns as the sole rationale for
the confessions rule.  This is made readily apparent in the case of R. v.
Warickshall (1783), 1 Leach 263, 168 E.R. 234, at p. 263 and at
pp. 234‑35, respectively:

 

It is a
mistaken notion, that the evidence of confessions and facts which have been
obtained from prisoners by promises or threats, is to be rejected from a regard
to public faith:  no such rule ever prevailed.  The idea is novel in theory,
and would be as dangerous in practice as it is repugnant to the general
principles of criminal law.  Confessions are received in evidence, or
rejected as inadmissible, under a consideration whether they are or are not
intitled [sic] to credit.  A free and voluntary confession is
deserving of the highest credit, because it is presumed to flow from the
strongest sense of guilt. . . .  [Emphasis added.]

 

18                              
There is also strong historical precedent for the proposition that the
confessions rule is rooted in a concern for the administration of justice and
fundamental principles of fairness, in particular the principle against self‑incrimination. 
In a treatise on the law of evidence written by Lord Chief Baron Gilbert and
published in 1754, the author makes the following comment:

 








. . .
the voluntary Confession of the Party in Interest is reckoned the best
Evidence; for if a Man’s swearing for his Interest can give no Credit, he must
certainly give most Credit when he swears against it; but then this
Confession must be voluntary and without Compulsion; for our Law differs from
the Civil Law, that it will not force any Man to accuse himself; and in this we
do certainly follow the Law of Nature, which commands every Man to endeavor his
own Preservation; and therefore Pain and Force may compel Men to confess
what is not the Truth of Facts, and consequently such extorted confessions are
not to be depended upon.  [Emphasis added.]

 

See Lawrence Herman, “The
Unexplored Relationship Between the Privilege Against Compulsory Self‑Incrimination
and the Involuntary Confession Rule (Part I)” (1992), 53 Ohio St. L.J.
101, at p. 153, citing Sir Geoffrey Gilbert, The Law of Evidence
(1769).  Thus, it is apparent that from its very inception, the confessions
rule was designed not only to ensure the reliability of the confession, but
also to guarantee fundamental fairness in the criminal process.

 

19                              
Of particular significance is the relationship between these two
concerns of reliability and fairness.  It must be recognized that the purpose
of the confessions rule is to exclude putatively unreliable statements, not
actually unreliable statements.  In other words, the confessions rule excludes
statements obtained by force, threat or promises as somehow inherently
unreliable, but does not inquire into the actual truth or falsity of the
statement.  If the concern of the confessions rule were truly the reliability
of the statement, then the court’s inquiry would focus on objective
corroboration of the confession evidence; if additional evidence confirmed the
confession was accurate, it should be admitted under a reliability rationale.

 








20                              
Instead, the confessions rule asks only if the statement was voluntary,
not if the statement is true.  DeClercq v. The Queen, [1968] S.C.R.
902.  This focus on voluntariness allows a court to analyse the circumstances
surrounding the statement and effectively acts as a check on the abuse of state
power.  In other words, if the state were left with the option of simply
corroborating forced confessions, there would be little incentive to refrain
from reprehensible investigative measures.  That is why the confessions rule
automatically excludes involuntary statements, regardless of their veracity. 
As stated by Professor Mark Berger in “The Exclusionary Rule and Confession
Evidence:  Some Perspectives on Evolving Practices and Policies in the United
States and England and Wales” (1991), 20 Anglo‑Am. L. Rev. 63, at
p. 71:

 

. . .
it is inescapable that the decision to reject all involuntary confessions
incorporates policies that find fault with the use of coercive tactics to
extract statements, independent of their impact on reliability.  In short, the
exclusion of involuntary confessions, at least as practised in the United
States and formerly in England, is designed as a response to improper police
interrogation tactics as much as, if not more than, it is aimed at ensuring
evidence reliability.

 

This aspect of the confessions
rule ‑‑ which focuses on voluntariness over truth ‑‑
indicates that the rule is not concerned solely with accuracy or reliability.

 

21                              
This approach to the rule determining the admissibility of a statement
of the accused also accords with the view that the quality, weight or
reliability of evidence is a matter for the jury, and that the admission of
evidence which may be unreliable does not per se render a trial unfair: 
see, e.g., R. v. Buric (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.), aff’d [1997] 1
S.C.R. 535, and R. v. Charemski, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 679.  The
confessions rule does not force a trial judge to exclude “unreliable” evidence
that is highly probative of guilt.  Rather it focuses on putative reliability,
by analysing the circumstances surrounding the statement and their effect on
the accused, regardless of the statement’s accuracy.  Thus the “reliability”
rationale and the “fairness” rationale for the confessions rule blend together,
so as to ensure fair treatment to the accused in the criminal process by
deterring coercive state tactics.

 








22                              
Indeed, when considering this notion of fairness, several courts have
found that the confessions rule is based upon the principle against self‑incrimination. 
Two decisions of the House of Lords, Commissioners of Customs and Excise v.
Harz, [1967]  1 A.C. 760, and R. v. Sang, [1979] 2 All E.R. 1222,
suggest that this is the modern basis for the rule.  The relationship between
the principle against self‑incrimination and the confessions rule has
also been noted in dicta in a number of Canadian decisions.  See, e.g., DeClercq,
supra, at p. 923, per Hall J. (dissenting); Piché v. The
Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 23, at p. 26, per Cartwright C.J.; Rothman
v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at pp. 653‑54, per
Estey J. (dissenting).  More recently, McLachlin J. in R. v. Hebert,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 173 specifically linked the confessions rule to
fundamental notions of fairness and the principle that accused persons should
not be conscripted to provide evidence against themselves.  She put it in this
way:

 

. . .
one of the themes running through the jurisprudence on confessions is the idea
that a person in the power of the state’s criminal process has the right to
freely choose whether or not to make a statement to the police.  This idea is
accompanied by a correlative concern with the repute and integrity of the
judicial process.  This theme has not always been ascendant.  Yet, its
importance cannot be denied.  It persists, both in Canadian jurisprudence and
in the rules governing the rights of suspects in other countries. 

 

23                              
I recognize, as did McLachlin J. in Hebert, supra, at
p. 173, Iacobucci J. in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, at
pp. 500‑501, and Sopinka J. in R. v. Whittle, [1994] 2 S.C.R.
914, at p. 932, that the self‑incrimination basis for the
confessions rule “must be historically qualified” (S. (R.J.), at
p. 499) and that “[i]n Canada, a rationale for the confessions rule
extending beyond trustworthiness has not always been easy to locate” (S.
(R.J.), at p. 500).  Nevertheless, I must recognize, as did my
colleagues, that in a modern sense, the confessions rule has clearly been
associated with these ideas.  Indeed, in the Report of the
Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence (1982), the Task
Force concluded at p. 175 that “the clear common law principle that the
Crown must establish its case without the assistance of the accused
. . . is the primary rationale of the Confessions Rule today”.

 








24                              
For this reason, the person in authority requirement is properly seen as
an integral component of the confessions rule.  The emphasis on voluntariness
has two main effects:  it both avoids the unfairness of a conviction based on a
confession that might be unreliable, and has a deterrent effect on the use of
coercive tactics.  This deterrent effect is properly focused upon the
prosecutorial authority of the state, not the personal authority of private
individuals.  It cannot be forgotten that it is the nature of the authority
exerted by the state that might prompt an involuntary statement.  As Estey J.
stated in Rothman, supra, at pp. 650‑51, “their
very authority might, by promise or threat, express or implied, produce a
statement whether or not the accused was truly willing to speak” (emphasis
added).  In other words, it is the fear of reprisal or hope of leniency that
persons in authority may hold out and which is associated with their official
status that may render a statement involuntary.  The rule is generally not
concerned with conversations between private citizens that might indicate
guilt, as these conversations would not be influenced or affected by the
coercive power of the state.  This limitation is appropriate since most
criminal investigations are undertaken by the state, and it is then that an
accused is most vulnerable to state coercion.

 








25                              
On a practical level, the Crown would obviously face an overwhelming
burden if it had to establish the voluntariness of every statement against
interest made by an accused to any person.  See the Law Reform Commission of
Canada, Report on Evidence (1975), at p. 62.  In particular, as the
intervener the Attorney General of Canada notes, the elimination of the person
in authority requirement would have serious consequences for undercover police
work and for the admissibility of wiretap evidence, where the identity of the
receiver of the accused’s statement is often unknown.  For example, if the
Crown were to intercept a phone call between an accused and a confederate who
is senior to him in a criminal hierarchy, the Crown would obviously have
difficulty tendering the requisite evidence if it were forced to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the statements were made without “fear of prejudice or
hope of advantage”.  Moreover, all statements to undercover police officers
would become subject to the confessions rule, even though the accused was
completely unaware of their status and, at the time he made the statement,
would never have considered the undercover officers to be persons in authority.

 

26                              
Practical considerations alone lead to the conclusion that the person in
authority requirement should remain a part of the confessions rule.  Yet there can
be no doubt that there may well be great unfairness suffered by the accused
when an involuntary confession obtained as a result of violence or credible
threats of imminent violence by a private individual is admitted into
evidence.  For this reason, the British  Criminal Law Revision Committee in
1972 recommended eliminating the person in authority requirement from the
confessions rule.  See Eleventh Report, Evidence (General) (1972), at
p. 39.  The Committee focused on reliability concerns and realistically
concluded that a false confession could just as readily result from threats and
inducements offered by a private individual as from a person in authority.  The
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, 1984 (U.K.), c. 60, was later
enacted to implement some of these suggestions.  Section 76 of that Act
provides that where it is represented to the court that a confession was
obtained “by oppression of the person who made it” or “in consequence of
anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances existing at the
time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made by him in
consequence thereof”, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
confession was not obtained in this manner.  “[O]ppression” is defined to
include “torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the use or threat of
violence”.

 








27                              
In Australia, the common law confessions rule is similar to the rule in
Canada, but in addition, a statement of the accused may be excluded where “it
is not made in the free exercise of the will, because this will was overborne
by the conduct of a person other than the accused”:  see Peter Gillies,
Law of Evidence in Australia (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 537.  Moreover the
Commonwealth government and the government of New South Wales have enacted
legislation that specifically provides for the exclusion of a confession
influenced by “violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct” or the threat
of such conduct.  See Evidence Act 1995, 1995 (Australia), No. 2,
s. 84, and Evidence Act 1995, 1995 (N.S.W.), No. 25,
s. 84.  However, under both the common law and the relevant Australian
statutes, the Crown is only required to prove voluntariness on a balance of
probabilities.

 

28                              
It is significant that these changes to the common law of England and
Australia were effected through legislative reform.  Indeed, the House of Lords
refused to eliminate the person in authority requirement judicially.  In
Deokinanan v. R., [1968] 2 All E.R. 346 (P.C.), Viscount Dilhorne, for the
court, stated as follows at p. 350:

 

The fact that
an inducement is made by a person in authority may make it more likely to
operate on the accused’s mind and lead him to confess.  If the ground on which
confessions induced by promises held out by persons in authority are held to be
inadmissible is that they may not be true, then it may be that there is a
similar risk that in some circumstances the confession may not be true if
induced by a promise held out by a person not in authority, for instance if
such a person offers a bribe in return for a confession.  There is, however, in
their lordships’ opinion, no doubt that the law as it is at present only
excludes confessions induced by promises when those promises are made by
persons in authority.

 








29                              
The last sentence quoted reflects the present law in Canada.  The
confessions rule, including the burden on the Crown to prove voluntariness
beyond a reasonable doubt, is carefully calibrated to ensure that the coercive
power of the state is held in check and to preserve the principle against self‑incrimination. 
The elimination of the person in authority requirement would represent a
fundamental change to the confessions rule, and a significant change to the
common law which could bring about complex and unforeseeable consequences for
the administration of justice.  This change involves the recognition of a new
concept.  It does not, as in other cases, simply involve the interpretation of
an amendment to a statute, such as the Criminal Code .  The unfairness of
admitting statements coerced by private individuals should be recognized. 
However, it is the sort of change which should be studied by Parliament and
remedied by enactment.  See Watkins v. Olafson, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750; R.
v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654; Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v.
Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1210, at para. 93; Winnipeg
Child and Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G. (D.F.), [1997] 3 S.C.R.
925.  Because of the very real possibility of a resulting miscarriage of
justice and the fundamental unfairness of admitting statements coerced by the
violence of private individuals, I would hope that the study will not be long
postponed.

 

30                              
In the meantime I would suggest that in circumstances where a statement
of the accused is obtained by a person who is not a person in authority by
means of degrading treatment such as violence or threats of violence, a clear
direction should be given to the jury as to the dangers of relying upon it. 
The direction might include words such as these:  “A statement obtained as a
result of inhuman or degrading treatment or the use of violence or threats of
violence may not be the manifestation of the exercise of a free will to
confess.  Rather, it may result solely from the oppressive treatment or fear of
such treatment.  If it does, the statement may very well be either unreliable
or untrue.  Therefore, if you conclude that the statement was obtained by such
oppression very little if any weight should be attached to it.”  However, if a
private individual resorts to violence or threatens violence after the
statement has been made, this conduct will not as a general rule be a factor
affecting the voluntariness of the statement and the suggested direction will
not be needed.

 








B.  Limits
of the Person in Authority Requirement

 

31                              
It has been seen that the person in authority requirement is grounded in
the underlying rationales for the confessions rule, and as a result it should
remain part of the rule.  Consideration must now be given as to who should come
within the designation “person in authority”.

 

32                              
“Person in authority” typically refers to those persons formally engaged
in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused:  see A.B.,
supra, at p. 26.  However, it may take on a broader meaning. 
Canadian courts first considered the meaning of “person in authority” in R.
v. Todd (1901), 4 C.C.C. 514 (Man. K.B.).  In that case, the accused made a
statement to two men he believed to be fellow prisoners, but who were in fact
acting as agents of the police.  It was held, at pp. 526‑27, that:

 

A person in authority means, generally speaking, anyone who has
authority or control over the accused or over the proceedings or the
prosecution against him. . . . [T]he authority that the accused knows such
persons to possess may well be supposed in the majority of instances both
to animate his hopes of favour on the one hand and on the other to inspire him
with awe, and so in some degree to overcome the powers of his
mind. . . .  [Emphasis added.]

 

Thus, from its earliest inception
in Canadian law, the question as to who should be considered as a person in
authority depended on the extent to which the accused believed the person could
influence or control the proceedings against him or her.  The question is
therefore approached from the viewpoint of the accused.  See also R. v.
Roadhouse (1933), 61 C.C.C. 191 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 192.

 








33                              
The subjective approach to the person in authority requirement has been
adopted in this Court.  See Rothman, supra, at p. 663.  The
approach adopted by McIntyre J.A. (as he then was) in R. v. Berger
(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 357 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 385‑86 is, in my view,
a clear statement of the law:

 

The law is
settled that a person in authority is a person concerned with the prosecution
who, in the opinion of the accused, can influence the course of the
prosecution.  The test to be applied in deciding whether statements made to
persons connected in such a way with the prosecution are voluntary is
subjective.  In other words what did the accused think?  Whom did he think he
was talking to? . . .  Was he under the impression that the failure
to speak to this person, because of his power to influence the prosecution,
would result in prejudice or did he think that a statement would draw some
benefit or reward?  If his mind was free of such impressions the person
receiving this statement would not be considered a person in authority and the
statement would be admissible.

 








34                              
However, to this statement I would add that the accused’s belief that he
is speaking to a person in authority must also be reasonable, in the context of
the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement.  If the accused were
delusional or had no reasonable basis for the belief that the receiver of the
statement could affect the course of the prosecution against him, the receiver
should not be considered a person in authority.  Since the person in authority
requirement is aimed at controlling coercive state conduct, the test for a
person in authority should not include those whom the accused unreasonably
believes to be acting on behalf of the state.  Thus, where the accused speaks
out of fear of reprisal or hope of advantage because he reasonably believes the
person receiving the statement is acting as an agent of the police or
prosecuting authorities and could therefore influence or control the
proceedings against him or her, then the receiver of the statement is properly
considered a person in authority.  In other words, the evidence must disclose
not only that the accused subjectively believed the receiver of the statement
to be in a position to control the proceedings against the accused, but must
also establish an objectively reasonable basis for that belief.  For example,
if the evidence discloses a relationship of agency or close collaboration
between the receiver of the statement and the police or prosecution, and that
relationship was known to the accused, the receiver of the statement may be
considered a person in authority.  In those circumstances the Crown must prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made voluntarily.

 

35                              
Over the years, the courts have determined when and in what
circumstances a person will be deemed a person in authority for the purposes of
the confessions rule. See, e.g., R. v. Trenholme (1920), 35 C.C.C. 341
(Que. K.B.) (complainant’s father was held to be a person in authority where he
has control over the prosecution of the accused); R. v. Wilband, [1967]
S.C.R. 14 (psychiatrist is not a person in authority where he cannot control or
influence the course of the proceedings); R. v. Downey (1976), 32 C.C.C.
(2d) 511 (N.S.S.C.A.D.) (victim is a person in authority if the accused
believed that the victim had control over the proceedings); A.B., supra
(a parent is not, in law, a person in authority if there is no close connection
between the decision to call the authorities and the inducement to a child to
make a statement); R. v. Sweryda (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 325 (Alta.
C.A.)(a social worker is a person in authority if the accused knew the social
worker was investigating allegations of child abuse and believed it could lead
to his arrest).  These cases have not departed from the governing rule that
defines a person in authority in relation to the accused’s perception of the
receiver’s involvement with the investigation or prosecution of the crime nor
have these decisions defined a person in authority solely in terms of the personal
authority that a person might wield in relation to the accused.  Moreover, in
concluding that the receiver of the statement was a person in authority, the
courts have consistently found the accused believed the receiver was allied
with the state authorities and could influence the investigation or prosecution
against the accused.

 








36                              
The important factor to note in all of these cases is that there is no
catalogue of persons, beyond a peace officer or prison guard, who are
automatically considered a person in authority solely by virtue of their
status.  A parent, doctor, teacher or employer all may be found to be a person
in authority if the circumstances warrant, but their status, or the mere fact
that they may wield some personal authority over the accused, is not sufficient
to establish them as persons in authority for the purposes of the confessions
rule.  As the intervener the Attorney General of Canada observed, the person in
authority requirement has evolved in a manner that avoids a formalistic or
legalistic approach to the interactions between ordinary citizens.  Instead, it
requires a case‑by‑case consideration of the accused’s belief as to
the ability of the receiver of the statement to influence the prosecution or
investigation of the crime.  That is to say, the trial judge must determine
whether the accused reasonably believed the receiver of the statement was
acting on behalf of the police or prosecuting authorities.  This view of the
person in authority requirement remains unchanged.

 

37                              
Finally, something must be said about the respective burdens which must
be borne by the accused and the Crown on a voir dire to determine
whether a statement of the accused to a person in authority should be
admitted.  The Crown, of course, bears the burden of proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that the statement was made voluntarily.  However, in relation
to the person in authority requirement, the evidence required to establish
whether or not a person should be deemed a person in authority will often lie primarily
with the accused.  The accused therefore must bear some burden in relation to
this aspect of the confessions rule.  The burden should be an evidential and
not a persuasive one.  See, e.g., R. v. Scott (1984), 1 O.A.C. 397, at
p. 399.  John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman and Alan W. Bryant, in The
Law of Evidence in Canada (1992), at pp. 56‑57, explain the
difference between the two burdens:

 








The term evidential burden means that a party has the responsibility to
insure that there is sufficient evidence of the existence or non‑existence
of a fact or of an issue on the record to pass the threshold test for that
particular fact or issue. . . . In contrast, the term legal burden of
proof means that a party has an obligation to prove or disprove a fact or issue
to the criminal or civil standard.  The failure to convince the trier of fact
to the appropriate standard means that party will lose on that issue.

 

The evidential burden on an
accused in a criminal case is described as follows (at p. 138):

 

Where an evidential burden for an issue rests on the defendant in a
criminal case, for example self‑defence, the accused has the obligation
to ensure that there is some evidence on the record to make it a live issue. 
The evidence necessary to satisfy an evidential burden may arise in the case
for the Crown or the defence.

 

38                              
In the vast majority of cases, the accused will meet this evidential
burden by showing the accused’s knowledge of the relationship between the
receiver of the statement and the police or prosecuting authorities.  For
example, the fact that the statement was made to a police officer who was in
uniform or identified himself or herself as a peace officer will satisfy the
accused's evidential burden in relation to the person in authority
requirement.  See, e.g., Morris v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1041, at
p. 1066.  Once the accused satisfies this evidential burden, the ultimate
burden of proof rests with the Crown.  See R. v. McKenzie, [1965] 3
C.C.C. 6 (Alta. S.C.A.D.), at p. 28.  In R. v. Postman (1977), 3
A.R. 524, at p. 542, the Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division held,
correctly in my view, that where a witness is not prima facie a person
in authority (in that case, a doctor), “it is open to defence counsel to
challenge the prima facie case and require evidence to be given to
determine the facts of the matter”.  Thus, once the defence discharges its
burden and establishes that there is an evidential basis to the claim that the
receiver of a statement made by the accused is a person in authority, the
burden shifts to the Crown to establish beyond a reasonable doubt either that
the receiver is not a person in authority, or, if this burden cannot be
discharged, that the statement was made voluntarily.








 

39                              
The receiver’s status as a person in authority arises only if the
accused had knowledge of that status.  If the accused cannot show that he or
she had knowledge of the receiver’s status (as, for example, in the case of an
undercover police officer) or close relationship to the authorities (as in the
case of persons acting on behalf of the state), the inquiry pertaining to the
receiver as a person in authority must end.  It is therefore appropriate to
consider at the outset the reasonable belief of the accused.  It may not be
useful to have the trial judge undertake a full analysis of the objective
relationship between the receiver of the statement and the authorities, as
Justice L’Heureux-Dubé suggests (para. 83), only to have those findings
vitiated if the accused is later found to have no knowledge of this
relationship.  In addition, it is important to recognize that focusing the
trial judge’s inquiry on the reasonable belief of the accused accords with the
allocation of the burden of proof on the voir dire.

 

C.  The
Trial Judge’s Obligation to Hold a Voir Dire

 

40                              
The issue as to whether the trial judge in this case erred in failing to
hold a voir dire before admitting the confession into evidence can now
be considered.

 








41                              
The trial judge has a duty “to conduct the trial judicially quite apart
from  lapses of counsel”:  see R. v. Sweezey (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 400
(Ont. C.A.), at p. 417.  This includes the duty to hold a voir dire
whenever the prosecution seeks to adduce a statement of the accused made to a
person in authority:  see pp. 417‑18.  However, where the defence
has not requested a voir dire and a statement of the accused is admitted
into evidence, the trial judge will only have committed reversible error if
clear evidence existed in the record which objectively should have alerted him
or her to the need for a voir dire notwithstanding counsel’s silence. 
Thus, the test for holding a voir dire is assessed by an appellate
court’s objective review of the evidence in the record to determine whether
something should have triggered the trial judge’s obligation to conduct an
inquiry.  This test is different from the test applicable on the voir dire,
which requires the trial judge to undertake an examination of the reasonable
belief of the accused and the circumstances surrounding the making of the
statement to determine both whether the receiver is a person in authority and
whether the statement was made voluntarily.

 

42                              
These tests are easily confused, as it is possible to assert that the
evidence which alerts the trial judge to the need for a voir dire must
relate to the accused’s state of mind, since only this type of evidence could
demonstrate that the accused believed the receiver of the statement to be a
person in authority.  This approach is too narrow.  The subjective view of the
accused might never be ascertained unless there is a voir dire.  To hold
that the trial judge has no obligation to hold a voir dire unless
evidence of the accused’s mental state is already in the record would render
the obligation meaningless.  Certainly evidence relating to the accused’s state
of mind may well trigger the need for a voir dire, but the standard
should be set lower.

 

43                              
This is demonstrated by the Court’s decision in Erven, supra. 
In that case, the Court had to decide whether a voir dire is always
needed in respect of a statement made by the accused to a person in authority,
or whether it is unnecessary in circumstances where the statement was
“obviously volunteered” (p. 929).  Dickson J.,  writing for a plurality of
the Court, held at p. 940, “a rule requiring a voir dire only after
there is some evidence suggesting involuntariness is neither clear nor easily
applied”.  He stated, at p. 937:

 








It is a most important right of the accused to call witnesses and
present argument separately on the issue of the admissibility of a statement
directly after the Crown’s evidence on this matter has been adduced.  This
right would be totally lost if a statement of the accused could be admitted
without a voir dire as part of the Crown’s evidence because nothing in
that evidence cast doubt on its voluntariness. . . .  The testimony of the
accused may be the only evidence which indicates involuntariness.

 

Although this statement of
principle pertains to a voir dire held to determine voluntariness, it is
also applicable to one held to determine whether the receiver of a statement
made by the accused is a person in authority.

 

44                              
Specifically, the reasoning in Erven, with which I agree, has two
implications for the present case.  First, the requirement that a voir dire
be held cannot be founded upon the presence of evidence which is conclusive of
the very issue to be examined on the voir dire.  Second, a voir dire
is required in respect of any statement made by an accused person to a “person
in authority”.  See Erven, supra, at p. 931.  Thus, given
the highly prejudicial nature of confession evidence, the trial judge has an
obligation to hold a voir dire of his or her own motion, notwithstanding
the absence of any request by counsel, wherever the Crown seeks to adduce a
statement made by an accused to a person in authority.  Clearly, counsel for
the accused may waive the voir dire.  Once the waiver is given, it is
unnecessary to hold the voir dire.

 








45                              
However, the trial judge’s obligation is triggered only where the
evidence makes the need for a voir dire clear.  Evidence which clearly
demonstrates that the receiver of the statement made by the accused was closely
connected to the authorities should alert the trial judge to hold a voir
dire.  This evidence progresses along a spectrum.  That is, where the
receiver of the statement is a “conventional” person in authority, such as a
police officer or prison guard, the trial judge clearly has an obligation to
proceed to a voir dire.  In such a case, the connection to the
authorities is readily apparent. Similarly, where the evidence clearly
discloses a close connection between the receiver of the statement and the
authorities which indicates that the receiver was, in the circumstances, acting
as a person in authority, this may be sufficient to trigger the trial judge’s
obligation to hold a voir dire.

 

46                              
Specifically, the trial judge must be satisfied that if the accused had
been aware of the connection between the receiver of the statement and the
authorities, the accused could reasonably believe the receiver was acting as an
agent of the police or prosecuting authorities or as part of the prosecution
team and was therefore capable of influencing the prosecution against him or
her.  If the evidence establishes this sort of connection, the trial judge
should inquire whether the defence is prepared to discharge its evidential
burden on the person in authority issue or whether it waives a voir dire
on this issue.  Thus, evidence of close association with the authorities might
provide an entry to the voir dire procedure but the inquiry on the voir
dire will still focus on an analysis to determine whether the receiver of
the statement, assessed from the point of view of the accused, is a person in
authority and ultimately whether the statement was made voluntarily.  However,
the further away the receiver of the statement is from the “conventional” case,
the less likely it will be that the evidence will alert the trial judge to the
need to hold a voir dire, and the greater the obligation of the accused
to raise the issue.

 








47                              
It should be emphasized that only rarely will a trial judge have heard
sufficient evidence to trigger the need for a voir dire on the person in
authority issue where the receiver of the statement is not a conventional
person in authority.  This follows because the evidence must establish more
than the mere status of the receiver of the statement.  Status or personal
authority alone will not as a general rule provide evidence from which it can
be inferred that the receiver of a confession is, in the eyes of the accused, a
person in authority.  Rather, in order to demonstrate the need for a voir
dire, the evidence must show that the receiver of the statement was closely
associated with the authorities prior to obtaining the statement, and that
there was as well a close connection in time between the contact with the
authorities and its receipt.  The evidence must suggest that the receiver was
acting in concert with the police or prosecutorial authorities, or as their
agent, or as part of their team.  Only in these circumstances will the trial
judge be obliged to hold a voir dire of his or her own motion on the
person in authority issue, subject to waiver of the voir dire by counsel
for the accused.

 

IV.  Summary

 

48                              
Perhaps it may be of some assistance to set out in summary form the
applicable principles pertaining to the admission of statements made by the
accused to persons in authority and some of the factors to be taken into
consideration with regard to them.

 

1.  The rule which is still applicable in determining the
admissibility of a statement made by an accused to a person in authority is
that it must have been made voluntarily and must be the product of an operating
mind.

 

2.  The rule is based upon two fundamentally important
concepts:  the need to ensure the reliability of the statement and the need to
ensure fairness by guarding against improper coercion by the state.  This
results in the requirement that the admission must not be obtained by
either threats or inducements.

 








3.  The rule is applicable when the accused makes a statement
to a person in authority.  Though no absolute definition of “person in
authority” is necessary or desirable, it typically refers to those formally
engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused. 
Thus, it would apply to person such as police officers and prison officials or
guards.  When the statement of the accused is made to a police officer or
prison guard a voir dire should be held to determine its admissibility
as a voluntary statement, unless the voir dire is waived by counsel for
the accused.

 

4.  Those persons whom the accused reasonably believes are
acting on behalf of the police or prosecuting authorities and could therefore
influence or control the proceedings against him or her may also be persons in
authority.  That question will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

 

5.  The issue as to who is a person in authority must be
resolved by considering it subjectively from the viewpoint of the accused. 
There must, however, be a reasonable basis for the accused’s belief that the
person hearing the statement was a person in authority.

 

6.  The issue will not normally arise in relation to
undercover police officers.  This is because the issue must be approached from
the viewpoint of the accused.  On that basis, undercover police officers will
not usually be viewed by the accused as persons in authority.

 








7.  If it is contended that the recipient of the statement
was a person in authority in the eyes of the accused then the defence must
raise the issue with the trial judge.  This is appropriate for it is only the
accused who can know that the statement was made to someone regarded by the
accused as a person in authority.

 

8.  On the ensuing voir dire the accused will have the
evidential burden of demonstrating that there is a valid issue for
consideration.  If the accused meets the burden, the Crown will then have the
persuasive burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the receiver
of the statement was not a person in authority or if it is found that he or she
was a person in authority, that the statement of the accused was made
voluntarily.

 

9.  In extremely rare cases the evidence adduced during a
trial may be such that it should alert the trial judge that the issue as to
whether the receiver of a statement made by an accused was a person in
authority should be explored by way of voir dire.  In those cases, which
must be extremely rare in light of the obligation of the accused to raise the
issue, the trial judge must of his or her own motion direct a voir dire,
subject, of course, to waiver of the voir dire by counsel for the
accused.

 

10.  The duty of the trial judge to hold a voir dire
of his or her own motion will only arise in those rare cases where the
evidence, viewed objectively, is sufficient to alert the trial judge of the
need to hold a voir dire to determine if the receiver of the statement
of the accused was, in the circumstances, a person in authority.

 








11.  If the trial judge is satisfied that the receiver of the
statement was not a person in authority but that the statement of the accused
was obtained by reprehensible coercive tactics, such as violence or credible
threats of violence, then a direction should be given to the jury.  The jury
should be instructed that if they conclude that the statement was obtained by
coercion, they should be cautious about accepting it, and that little if any
weight should be attached to it.

 

V.  Application
to this Appeal

 

49                              
The appellant contends that the fact that the confession was made to the
complainant and her immediate family should have alerted the trial judge to the
need for a voir dire since they are capable of being persons in
authority for the purpose of the confessions rule.  It is true the complainant
and her family members are capable of being persons in authority.  Indeed,
anyone is capable of being a person in authority where a person becomes
sufficiently involved with the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of
an accused, and the accused believes that the person may influence the process
against him or her.  It does not follow that simply because it has been held,
in the circumstances presented in other cases, that a family member was a
person in authority, that the trial judge should have been alerted to the need
for a voir dire.  Virtually any category of person ‑‑
parents of the accused, parents of the complainant, teachers, psychiatrists,
physicians ‑‑ may, in light of the particular evidence adduced, be
considered to be a person in authority.  As the respondent observed, to hold
that the trial judge committed an error on the basis that the receiver of the
confession is merely capable of being a person in authority is to require a voir
dire (or waiver) for every statement against interest made by every accused
person to anyone.  It cannot be forgotten that it is the accused who is in the
best position to demonstrate that the receiver of the statement was in his or
her eyes a person in authority.

 








50                              
In this case, the evidence at trial did not disclose any evidence that
was sufficient to trigger the trial judge’s obligation to hold a voir dire. 
The confrontation at the appellant’s workplace was first described by the
complainant.  She testified as to the events leading up to the confrontation. 
She stated (1) that her mother questioned her about whether she was pregnant
and whether she had had intercourse; (2) that in the course of that
conversation, she told her mother that the appellant had sexually assaulted
her; (3) that her mother telephoned her father; (4) that she and her mother
visited a walk‑in clinic in Mississauga where it was confirmed that the
complainant was pregnant (her boyfriend at the time was the father); (5) that
the complainant, together with her mother, father, stepfather and cousin went
to confront the appellant.  The complainant then related, without objection by
the defence, the statements made by the appellant.  Thus, when the statements
were admitted into evidence, there was nothing to suggest that the complainant
or her family members had spoken to the police or anyone else in authority or
were even considering making a complaint.  Similarly, there was nothing to
suggest that the appellant subjectively believed the complainant’s family to
have control over criminal proceedings.  In those circumstances, the trial
judge cannot be said to have committed an error by failing to hold a voir
dire on his own motion.

 

51                              
The appellant, in an alternative argument, relied upon the Privy Council
decision in Thongjai v. The Queen, [1998] A.C. 54.  There it was held
that where there is no allegation of mistreatment by the police and the defence
is an absolute denial that the statement was made, it is not necessary to hold
a voir dire to consider whether the statement was voluntary.  That
argument could not be raised in the case at bar.  The person in authority issue
was not raised in Thongjai.  In the circumstances presented in this
case, it would be inappropriate to deal with this alternative argument.

 








52                              
Finally, the appellant also contended that even if the evidence of the
confession was properly before the trial judge, the judge erred by relying upon
this evidence almost exclusively in convicting the appellant.  The appellant
submits that the trial judge relied on the confession evidence without fully
weighing and considering the reliability of the evidence in light of the
circumstances surrounding the making of the confession.  These submissions
cannot be accepted.  The record clearly reveals that the trial judge carefully
reviewed the appellant’s testimony relating to the confrontation with the
complainant’s family before concluding that the confession evidence was
“overwhelming” and that “[t]here [was] no plausible basis for [his]
disbelieving the evidence that [the accused] admitted his involvement”.  The
trial judge also found the complainant to be credible.  In these circumstances
he could properly use the evidence of the confession to confirm the
complainant’s testimony.  The reasons of the learned trial judge disclose no
error.

 

VI.  Disposition

 

53                              
The appeal is therefore dismissed.

 

//L’Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

The reasons of
L’Heureux-Dubé and Bastarache JJ. were delivered by

 

54                      L’Heureux-Dubé
J. -- This case is about the scope of a trial judge’s
duty to direct independently a voir dire in order to determine whether out-of-court statements made by
an accused were to persons in authority and, if so, are voluntary.  Its
resolution on the facts of this case is inextricably linked to the more general
determination of who constitutes a “person in authority” under the
confessions rule.  








55                      I have had the benefit of
reading the reasons of my colleague Justice Cory.  While I agree with his
ultimate disposition of this appeal, I differ with respect to the proper
interpretation of “persons in authority”, as a pertinent component of the
confessions rule, and thus the circumstances which give rise to a trial judge’s duty to direct
a voir dire proprio motu for the following reasons.

 

I.   The Confessions Rule in Context

 

56                      My
colleague Cory J. has set out the relevant facts, and as stated, I ultimately
agree with his disposition of this appeal.  My differences with his reasons
arise in relation to the proper formulation of the “person in authority” element of the confessions rule.

 

57                      The
basic formulation of the confessions rule is uncontroversial: a statement
obtained by hope of advantage or fear of prejudice held out by a person in
authority must be proven voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt before
admission into evidence by the Crown (see Ibrahim v. The King, [1914]
A.C. 599 (P.C.)).  As the
expansive body of divergent case law demonstrates, however, the rule’s precise scope
and meaning have perplexed courts.  In this regard, providing some clarity and
certainty to the “person in authority” component of the rule, which is the
foundation of a trial judge’s duty to independently direct a voir dire,
is essential. We cannot forget that common law rules
are moulded by judges, and therefore, it is our province, and indeed our duty,
to ensure that they serve the interests which they bind (R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531).  The challenge must be to properly
construe the confessions rule -- this “rule
of policy” -- and its element of “person in authority” in light of its underlying rationales as they have evolved from
the 18th century into the modern criminal justice system.

 








58                      It
is worthwhile to observe at the outset how dramatically different the original
criminal context was which gave rise to the confessions rule, for with changing
conditions, underlying concerns have inevitably shifted.  Lord Hailsham in D.P.P.
v. Ping Lin, [1976] A.C. 574 (H.L.), at p. 600, directed
his attention to its origins:

 

By the judiciary, though [the
confessions rule] ought not to be extended, it must by no means be whittled
down.  It bears, it is true, all the marks of its origin at a time when the
savage code of the eighteenth century was in full force. At that time almost
every serious crime was punishable by death or transportation. The law
enforcement officers formed no disciplined police force and were not subject to
effective control by the central government, watch committees or an
inspectorate. There was no legal aid. There was no system of appeal. To crown
it all the accused was unable to give evidence on his own behalf and was
therefore largely at the mercy of any evidence, either perjured or oppressively
obtained, that might be brought against him. The judiciary were therefore
compelled to devise artificial rules designed to protect him against dangers
now avoided by other and more rational means. Nevertheless, the rule has
survived into the twentieth century, not only unmodified but developed. . . .

 

 

As an artificial rule designed to protect accused
against dangers which are now avoided by other, more rational means like
individual rights, the basic counsel that, in spite of this evolution, the
confessions rule should not be extended must be taken
to heart. It is a policy rule which must be carefully construed in light of
modern conditions.

 

59                      In
addition to ensuring that our understanding of the confessions rule reflects
modern concerns, it is also important to take account of the rule’s artificial and exceptional character.  Pointedly,
the confessions rule is an exception to the basic principle of evidence that
all relevant evidence should be admitted to the trier of fact, whose role it is
to assess its quality and ultimately, get to the truth of the matter.  As
explained by McLachlin J. in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p.
609:

 








It is fundamental
to our system of justice that the rules of evidence should permit the judge and
jury to get at the truth and properly determine the issues. . . . [E]verything
which is probative should be received, unless its exclusion can be justified on
some other ground. A law which prevents the trier of fact from getting at the
truth by excluding relevant evidence in the absence of a clear ground of policy
or law justifying the exclusion runs afoul of our fundamental conceptions of
justice. . . .

 

 

Our criminal justice system has assigned triers of
fact the crucial role of assessing the reliability of evidence. Unlike the
early days of the confessions rule, today the defence has a full opportunity to
impugn and explore factors relevant to the reliability of evidence and
credibility of witnesses before the triers of fact. As judges, we must guard
against interfering with this pivotal and fair process.  The confessions rule
must be justified by its policy rationales, taking account of the inclusionary
gist of basic evidence rules which typically do not justify exclusion on
reliability concerns.

 

60                      In
summary, the confessions rule is a specific and delimited exception to
the basic rule that it is for the trier of fact to assess the truth of
statements in all the surrounding circumstances, as well as the recognition
that statements made by the accused against his or her interest are inherently
reliable (Hardy’s Trial (1794), 24 State Tr. 199). Therefore, interpretation of its
integral concept of “person in
authority” must be bound by applicable
policy rationales which justify the confessions rule’s exclusion of relevant evidence, to which I will
now turn.

 

II.   The Cardinal Role of the “Person in Authority” Element

 








61                      My
colleague Cory J. carefully reviews the history of the confessions rule and
appropriately sets its underlying policies in a contemporary context, and there
is no need to repeat this exercise.  Essentially where, historically, policy
concerns related to the confession’s
reliability, modern rationales for the confessions rule now focus on state
conduct and individual fairness.  Basic fairness in the criminal process
unifies the two rationales of reliability and state deterrence, and questions
of truth have given way to a focus on voluntariness.

 

62                      The
confessions rule is only concerned with voluntariness, however, where
statements are made to persons in authority. This latter concept becomes
all the more critical when, as my colleague has properly held, we accept that
regardless of reliability, the predominant modern rationales for the
confessions rule are individual fairness in the criminal process and state
accountability.  In my view, these rationales explicitly endorse a focus on the
relationship between individuals and the state or its representatives, and
should define our notion of “person in
authority”.  

 

63                      While
judicial recognition of these rationales has been cautious thus far, Cory J.’s reasons reflect their cogency and ultimate
acceptance. Modern developments of the confessions rule bolster this conclusion. 
In Clarkson v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, at p. 391, Wilson J. assessed for the
majority how the “operating mind” test as a component of the confessions rule
logically revealed:

 

. . . a concern not so much for the
probative value of the statement as for adjudicative fairness in the criminal
process and for control of police conduct in interrogating accused persons.

 

Similarly, in its study, the Report of the
Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence (1982) the Task
Force concluded at p. 175 that the modern-day rationale for the confessions
rule is:

 








. . . based on the principle that the
Crown cannot require the accused to provide evidence against himself.  The
rationale puts the Rule in a party and party context, and accordingly does not
apply to outsiders.  The Crown therefore is not precluded from taking
advantage of relevant evidence obtained as the result of actions by someone
other than a Crown agent or representative. The Task Force unanimously
concludes that the Confessions Rule should only apply to statements made to
persons in authority, and that inducements emanating from other sources, where
there is no implied authority from the Crown, should only affect the weight of
any answer given by the accused. [Emphasis added.]

 

My colleague accepts this view which implies that
the confessions rule has no justification without the policy of deterrence.  In
other words, without state presence as required by the “person in authority” component, the confessions rule would stand in direct conflict with
the basic rule of evidence that the reliability of evidence is a matter for the
trier of fact.  Given the rule’s
infidelity to the principle of reliability, it is important to both affirm its
inextricable relationship with concerns about the integrity of the justice
system, the fairness of criminal procedure and the conduct of state agents, and
reflect this affirmation in our interpretation of the “person in authority” element.

 

64                      While
accepting these modern rationales for the confessions rule, my colleague,
surprisingly, does not similarly endorse the Task Force’s strong conclusion regarding “persons in authority” such that, absent Crown conduct, a lack of voluntariness should only
affect the weight of statements and not their admissibility.  Indeed, Cory J.
allows that “the person in authority
requirement should remain a part of the confessions rule” (para. 26); however, he also suggests that
Parliament should consider and ultimately enact its elimination in order to
redress the “unfairness of admitting
statements coerced by private individuals”
(para. 29).  I respectfully disagree that such a recommendation is appropriate
or desirable, and maintain that general involuntariness should not affect the
admissibility of statements.

 








65                      First,
this suggestion contradicts the affirmation that the confessions rule is now
primarily directed toward deterring improper use of prosecutorial state
authority, which ultimately implies that some presence of the state or its
agents is crucial.  Therefore, any instances of private coercion fall beyond
the scope of the confessions rule.  The general unfairness of utilizing
involuntary statements resulting from private coercion has never been the focus
of the confessions rule, even when the rule was justified by policy concerns
for reliability.  Its modern rationales explicitly affirm that the rule is
concerned only with voluntariness within the relationship between the state and
individual.

 

66                      Indeed,
I find the recommendation to eliminate the person in authority requirement to
be inconsistent with Cory J.’s own
acknowledgment (at para. 24) that “it
is the nature of the authority exerted by the state that might prompt an
involuntary statement”(emphasis added);
and further (at para. 29), how the confessions rule “is carefully calibrated to ensure that the coercive
power of the state is held in check and to preserve the principle against
self-incrimination”.  These rationales,
and thus the confessions rule itself, are concerned with state action, as
affirmed by Sopinka J. in R. v. Whittle, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914,  at p.
932:

 

The preoccupation
of the common law and Charter cases in preserving for the suspect the
right to choose has been in relation to state action. Did the action of
police authorities deprive the suspect of making an effective choice by reason
of coercion, trickery or misinformation or the lack of information? [Emphasis
added.]

 

Essentially, an expansion of the confessions rule to
private instances of coercion would not serve the modern principles which
justify its exclusionary character and, therefore, I do not agree with my
colleague’s suggestion in this regard. 
The confessions rule is not concerned with private conversations, but rather a
state’s criminal investigations in
which private persons are most vulnerable to the coercive power of the state.

 








67                      Finally,
we must consider how an expansion of the confessions rule to private instances
of coercion should account for the public interest in placing probative
evidence before juries.  In assessing an expansion of the confessions rule,
White J. for the U.S. Supreme Court in Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477 (1972), fittingly observed at pp. 488-89:

 

Without good cause, we are unwilling to expand
currently applicable exclusionary rules by erecting additional barriers to
placing truthful and probative evidence before state juries and by revising the
standards applicable in collateral proceedings. . . . [T]he exclusionary rules
are very much aimed at deterring lawless conduct by police and prosecution and
... the public [has an] interest in placing probative evidence before juries
for the purpose of arriving at truthful decisions about guilt or innocence.

 

 

Indeed, not only does an expansion of the
confessions rule to private instances of coercion not serve its modern
underlying rationales, but it would also erect
additional barriers keeping relevant evidence from the triers of fact and thus
unjustifiably impede their task of ascertaining the truth of the matter before
them.  Failing to serve any legitimate
purpose within the confines of this policy rule, I conclude that the
expansion suggested by my colleague is inappropriate and undesirable. Any
private threats and inducements which affect the reliability of confessions are
for the trier of fact to assess.

 

68                      I
similarly find that the special jury directions provided by my colleague for
cases of private coercion (para. 30) unnecessary in any categorical sense.
These statements will be subject to cross-examination and refutation by the
defence before the trier of fact, who scrutinizes them carefully in all the
surrounding circumstances before assigning them with any weight. Special
warnings are no more necessary in these circumstances to supplement the basic
fairness of the existing process than other types of evidence like, for
example, alibi or identification evidence. The prospect of special warnings in
every instance of evidence prejudicial to the accused does not foster an
effective administration of justice.

 








69                      In
summary, legislative change to the confessions rule altering the requirement of
a person in authority is neither appropriate nor desirable.  The best rule
remains, as stated by Martland J. in Rothman v. The
Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 664:

Once it is accepted that the
confession of the appellant was not made to a person in authority, it was
properly admissible without any requirement for the Crown to establish that it
was voluntary.  The confession was in
the same position as if it had been made to someone other than a police officer.

 

 

Strict retention of this rule promotes clarity, is consistent with modern rationales justifying the
exclusion of relevant evidence and serves the general public interest by
facilitating the pursuit of truth. At the end of the day, the “person in authority” requirement is, and should remain, the pivotal concept in the
confessions rule.  The next relevant question is how to interpret this concept
properly.

 

III.   Defining “Person in Authority”

 








70                      The
general definition of “person in
authority” is “someone [formally] engaged in the arrest, detention,
examination or prosecution of the accused” (emphasis added) (see R. v. Paonessa (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 300
(Ont. C.A.), at p. 306, aff’d [1983] 1
S.C.R. 660).  This includes both formal representatives and agents of the
state.  In my view, this remains the basic test and I have difficulties with my
colleague’s largely subjective approach
to this concept, which, I fear, leaves undue scope for encompassing private
persons.  Given my conclusion as to the cardinal role of the concept of “persons in authority” in the confessions rule, and how it directs the latter toward state
conduct, I find that a broad and subjective interpretation of “persons in authority” has the danger of excluding evidence derived from purely private
conversations and thus indirectly achieving what we have rejected above as
inappropriate. Indeed, as examined below, logic and the applicable authorities
persuade me that the analysis of “person
in authority” should begin with an
objective test that mirrors the general definition, and only subsequently turn
to examine the subjective belief of the accused.

 

71                      According
to my colleague, the broad principled test for “persons in authority” is: “persons whom the accused reasonably believes are
acting on behalf of the police or prosecuting authorities and could
therefore influence or control the proceedings against him or her may also be
persons in authority” (para. 48,
principle 4, emphasis added). 
This issue should be resolved by “considering
it subjectively from the viewpoint of the accused”, although there must be “a reasonable basis for the accused’s belief that the person hearing the statement was a
person in authority” (para. 48, principle 5).  This reasonableness element
involves, in his view, a consideration of the “circumstances surrounding the making of the statement” (para. 34), and appears to necessitate an objective
assessment of the accused’s particular
perceptions (at para. 34):

 

. . . where the accused speaks out of
fear of reprisal or hope of advantage because he reasonably believes the person
receiving the statement is acting as an agent of the police or prosecuting
authorities and could therefore influence or control the proceedings against
him or her, then the receiver of the statement is properly considered a person
in authority. 

 

 

On his test, anyone is capable of being a person in
authority -- parents of the accused or complainant, teachers, psychiatrists,
physicians -- depending on the particular evidence adduced and what it reveals
of the accused’s perceptions (para.
49).  One can immediately see the vagueness of the test and the uncertainty
that this approach will generate.

 








72                      There
is considerable disagreement in the authorities as to the nature of the “person in authority” test.  My colleague, like a number of lower courts, draws on the
highly subjective test advocated by Fred Kaufman in The Admissibility of
Confessions (3rd ed. 1979), at p. 81, which asks:

 

Did the accused truly believe, at
the time he made the declaration, that the person he dealt with had some degree
of power over him? [Emphasis in
original.]

 

 

See, for example, R. v. A.B.
(1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 17 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused [1986] 1 S.C.R.
v; R. v. Stewart (1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d) 93 (Alta. C.A.); R.
v. Fowler (1982), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Nfld. C.A.); and R. v.
Collins (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 304 (Alta. S.C.).  

 

73                      At
the other hand of the spectrum, in Paonessa, supra, a highly
objective approach was adopted.  In the Court of Appeal, Zuber J.A. for the
majority, in a judgment affirmed by our Court, held at p. 306 that a “person in authority” was only someone actually engaged in criminal proceedings against the
accused:

 

The confession rules apply only where
the accused makes a statement to a “person
in authority”, i.e., someone
engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused. 
Paquette’s evidence at his bail hearing
was a public statement in open Court presided over by a Magistrate (Provincial
Court Judge). . . . The Magistrate, as investigator or interrogator is no
longer a part of the Canadian system of criminal justice and as a result the
modern Magistrate is not a “person
in authority” so as to
attract the operation of the rules of evidence relating to confessions. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

Such emphasis on the objective status of “persons in authority” is warranted. Indeed, it should serve as a threshold requirement for
the application of the exclusionary rule, before the subjective belief of the
accused comes into play.  This approach has support in the authorities, and
more importantly, is required by the rule’s
modern rationales directed toward state conduct.  In addition, a purely
subjective test is inappropriate because it effectively collapses the “person in authority” requirement into an assessment of subjective voluntariness.  I will
review these arguments in turn.








74                      Cory
J. relies on the majority judgment of this Court in Rothman, supra,
for his conclusion that the relevant test is based on “the extent to which the accused believed the person
could influence or control the proceedings against him or her” (para. 32 (emphasis added)).  However, the
subjective test adopted by Martland J. must be understood in its particular
context, for Rothman addressed the admissibility of a statement made to
an undercover police officer during incarceration. Therefore, the objective
requirement of state presence, a traditional person in authority, was never in
doubt which explains why both parties conceded to the application of a
subjective test in the case.  Indeed, Martland J. himself, at p. 664, specified
that:

 

.  . . a subjective test should be
applied in the circumstances of this case. I also agree with [the] conclusion
that McKnight [the undercover police officer] was not a person in authority
because he was not regarded as such by the appellant.

 

75                      Martland
J., at p. 663, quoted Jessup J.A., who in turn had quoted Kaufman, The
Admissibility of Confessions, to the effect that notwithstanding the
presence of a person who, “from a
purely objective point of view, was in a position of undoubted authority”, the rules which attach to this status under the
confessions rule will only apply if the accused believed that the person could
make good on the promises or threats.  In such cases, a consideration of the effect
of the inducement on the mind of the accused in the known circumstances is
called for.  This subjective effect only became relevant once the objective
threshold test was first met -- the statement was made to a person formally
engaged in the detention of the accused, without doubt otherwise, a person in
authority.

 

76                      This
view of the Court’s test in Rothman
is bolstered by the evident and laudable concern of the majority not to impede
police investigations unduly, nor keep clearly relevant information from the
trier of fact.  Lamer J., as he then was, outlined this germane concern in
concurring reasons, at p. 697:








 

It must also be borne in mind that the
investigation of crime and the detection of criminals is not a game to be
governed by the Marquess of Queensbury rules. The authorities, in dealing with
shrewd and often sophisticated criminals, must sometimes of necessity resort to
tricks or other forms of deceit and should not through the [confessions] rule
be hampered in their work.

 

This policy concern, the potential for the
confession rule to hamper police investigation, and the objective reality of
state involvement, precipitated the Court’s
examination of the accused’s subjective
belief.  In other words, in order to avoid giving the confessions rule an
overly broad scope, the objective threshold test for person in authority was
nuanced with a subjective element.  As assessed by Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant
in The Law of Evidence in Canada (1992), at p. 351,  A.B.,
supra, determined that “even if
it can be established on objective criteria that the person who obtains the
statement could be characterized as an authority figure, that is not
determinative of the issue”.

 

77                      The
dissenting comments of Estey J. in Rothman are also instructive. 
Embracing the more modern rationales of the confessions rule, Estey J.
affirmed, at p. 650, the
irrelevance of subjective belief where there is not, objectively, a state
representative:

 

The principle [of voluntariness]
itself, of course, requires (and this is an absolute requisite) that the
statement in fact be made to a person in authority; and if this qualification
is not met, then it matters not whether the person is known to the accused to
be one in authority. This is
because the principle adopted for the protection of the integrity of the
administration of justice is founded upon the realization that persons in
authority, instrumentalities of the State, must observe certain basic rules.
[Emphasis added.]

 








In my view, this passage properly demonstrates how
the confessions rule is, first and foremost, concerned with state conduct.
However, given the concern of unduly hampering legitimate investigative work,
the majority properly determined that subjective belief also becomes relevant
where there is, in fact, an “instrumentality
of the State” present. In Rothman,
although the disguised police officer was in fact a person in authority, he was
not to be regarded as such under the confessions rule because the accused did
not believe him to be so.

 

78                      Rothman,
therefore, stands for the proposition that, in some instances, a person with
undoubted objective authority will not retain this status under the confessions
rule because the accused was unaware of this authority and it cannot be said
that the latter bore upon the voluntariness of the admission.  In such
circumstances, the confessions rule promulgates the fiction that a police
officer is not a “person in authority”.  This fiction is only necessary, as Lamer J.
noted, at p. 680, where the rule
is couched in terms of voluntariness as opposed to reliability, and the
subjective impact of the actual authority held out is assessed.  In summary, I
conclude that the adoption in Rothman of a subjective test must be taken
in its evident state context, where there was never any question that the
objective threshold of a traditional person in authority was met.  The same
reasoning applies to the case of R. v. Todd (1901), 4
C.C.C. 514 (Man. K.B.), which also involved undercover agents of the state.

 

79                       I,
therefore, cannot agree with my colleague’s
assertion at para. 32 that “from its
earliest inception in Canadian law, the question as to who should be considered
as a person in authority depended on the extent to which the accused believed
the person could influence or control the proceedings against him or her”.  The authorities suggest on the contrary, in my
view, that the first requirement is that such a person has actual authority or
control over the proceedings against the accused, and that  the subjective
belief is an additional requirement.  Pointedly, Rothman depicts the
utility of a subjective test in undercover cases, whereby the scope of “persons in authority” is narrowed, the fiction propagated that objective persons in
authority were not to be recognized as such, and the relevant evidence admitted
before the trier of fact.








80                      The
pivotal relationship of the confessions rule with objective state conduct was
affirmed in R. v. McIntyre (1993), 135 N.B.R. (2d) 266 (C.A.), aff’d [1994] 2 S.C.R. 480.  There the accused had been
released by the police, and five months later made statements to undercover
officers who passed themselves off as criminals.  Considering the concern
expressed in Rothman that police may sometimes of necessity resort to
tricks, the Court of Appeal held at p. 277 that there was no reason to exclude
the statement in the circumstances because:

 

. . . there was no reason to protect
the appellant from the power of the State. He was free in his comings and
goings and he was in no way being restricted by the police. There was no
coercion in this case. The appellant could have left the police officers and
had nothing further to do with them at any time. The statement should therefore
be received in evidence. It would then be the responsibility of the jury to
determine the weight to be given to the statement.

 

81                      McLachlin
J.’s examination of the confessions
rule in R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, also suggests this approach. 
In examining the nature of the choice protected by the confessions rule, she
elaborated at p. 165 that the detained person only has a negative right:

 

... the right not to be tortured or coerced into
making a statement by threats or promises held out by a person who is
and whom he subjectively believes to be a person in authority. [Emphasis
added.]

 

Clearly both objective and subjective elements are
present in this definition.  However, a consideration of subjective factors is
relevant only in so far as they are linked to the police methods employed (R.
v. Amyot (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 312 (Que. C.A.), at p. 322) because it is the “person in authority” factor which triggers concerns about voluntariness. See also R. v.
Frewin (1855), 6 Cox C.C. 530; R. v. McKenzie, [1965] 3 C.C.C. 6
(Alta. S.C.A.D.); Collins, supra.  Therefore, the test is not
only whether the person is one whose promise or threat would influence the
accused, but also, and above all, whether that person had control over the
course of the prosecution.








82                      This
test for “person in authority” preserves the original sense of the confessions
rule that voluntariness need only be established where statements are made to
representatives or agents of the state because it does not resort to
definitions of authority that are structured by factors of voluntariness. In
this regard, I am persuaded by the cogent reasoning of Laycraft C.J. in R.
v. Sweryda (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 325 (Alta. C.A.), as to the problems with
premising the “person in authority” test on the subjective belief of the accused. He
identifies, at pp. 329-30, the difficulty with a highly subjective test to be
that it reverses the proper method of analysis.

 

. . . the [subjective] rule . . . is
that if the accused believes the maker of the threats or promises can make good
on them, that fact alone transforms the maker into a person in authority
regardless of his previous status. The usual method of analysis is thus
reversed. One first uses voluntariness as the test to determine whether the
maker of the threat or promise is a person in authority. If a threat or promise
induced the statement, the analysis concludes at once because the maker thereby
becomes a person in authority. Indeed, the rule as formulated might be stated
in simpler terms without going through the formality (or the subterfuge) of
finding the maker of the threat or promise to be a person in authority: If a
statement is induced by a promise or a threat which the accused thinks the
maker could make good, the statement is inadmissible. [Emphasis in original.]

 

In other words, if we begin the analysis by focusing
on the effects of threats or inducements in relation to subjective
beliefs, and allow this to define “persons
in authority”, we effectively collapse
the cart into the horse, as it is the provision and effect of inducements which
come to define inappropriately who are “persons
in authority”. Such an approach not
only unduly expands the exceptional rule of evidence, but is also inconsistent
with our recognition of the essential role played by the concept of “person in authority” in the confessions rule.

 








83                      In
summary, the proper test for “person in
authority” examines, first, the
objective status of the person to whom the statement was made, and only where
they are identified as someone formally engaged in the arrest, detention,
interrogation or prosecution of the accused, is it then necessary to examine
whether the accused believed that the person could influence or control the
proceedings against him or her.  While Cory J. adds a “reasonableness”
element to the latter subjective element, I respectfully find this to be an
inadequate objective requirement that continues to focus on the belief of the
accused.

 

84                      Furthermore,
I think that my colleague’s remarks at
para. 39 concerning my test play both ways and also apply to his proposed
procedure.  Indeed, according to his view, a trial judge may similarly see his
findings relating to the reasonable belief of the accused “vitiated” if
the receiver is found afterwards not to be a person in authority.  The “vitiating”
risk exists in both inquiries.  Therefore, in my opinion Cory J.’s comments are not convincing and do not alter my
conclusion that the assessment of the objective status of the receiver should
be made prior to the examination of the accused’s belief.

 

IV.   Categories of “Persons in Authority”

 

85                      Who
then might fall into the category of “persons
in authority” under the confessions
rule?  As mentioned earlier, Cory J. on the basis of his test concludes at
para. 49  that “[v]irtually any
category of person -- parents of the accused, parents of the complainant,
teachers, psychiatrists, physicians -- may, in light of the particular evidence
adduced, be considered to be a person in authority”.  In contrast, upon the threshold objective test
outlined above, I find that the concept may not encompass persons beyond those
formally engaged, including agents, in the arrest, detention, examination or
prosecution of the accused.  Only in the rarest of cases will non-traditional
persons in authority fall into this category, and it still must be objectively
established on the facts that such persons had actual control in the
proceedings.

 








86                      In
this regard, where early cases like R. v. Trenholme (1920), 35 C.C.C.
341 (Que. K.B.), extended the status of “person
in authority” to a complainant’s parents, this perspective must be confined to its
historical realities.  As Peter K. McWilliams observes, this case reflects the
social condition of the time where there were no modern police forces and the
complainants had to prosecute crimes for themselves (Canadian Criminal
Evidence, vol. 2 (3rd ed. 1988 (loose-leaf)), at para. 15:10730). I agree
that cases which, today, find the complainant to be a person in authority are
inappropriate carry-overs from such days.  

 

87                      Indeed,
such authority must be objectively proven on the facts. For example, in Sweryda,
supra, the Alberta Court of Appeal reasonably found that a social worker
was a “person in authority” on the basis that she was investigating a criminal
act and had the statutory power to institute proceedings against the accused. 
The court correctly began with this objective fact concerning the authority
vested in the social worker under the Child Welfare Act, before then
examining the subjective perception of the accused.

 

88                      Today,
however, complainants, their parents or witnesses do not have the discretion to
decide whether or not to proceed against an accused, and thus they typically
cannot constitute persons in authority.  And where they are, in fact, formally
acting as agents of the state, the accused must have subjective knowledge of this
relationship before they can be considered “persons in authority” under the
confessions rule.

 








89                      Thus,
the case of A.B., supra, properly held that an accused child’s subjective belief that his mother was a person in
authority did not render her to be one. In this instance, Cory J.A., as he then
was, found at p. 28 that there was no “realistic
and close connection” between the
mother’s decision to call the
authorities and the offered inducement to make a statement. While I agree with
this conclusion, I find the “close
connection” test not only too weak an
objective requirement of state involvement, but also a vague and confusing
criterion, fraught with uncertainty in the law and difficult to apply.

 

90                      In
R. v. Kyle (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 286, on the basis of A.B.’s close connection test, the Ontario Court of Appeal
held that a 15-year-old complainant who had tape-recorded a confession of the considerably
older accused was a person in authority because he had the intention to go to
the police armed with this statement and made threats on this basis.  In my
view, this case demonstrates the shortcoming not only of the “close connection” test, but also of an approach to the definition of “person in authority” which requires no more than the power to influence proceedings against
the accused. The reality is that every complainant typically has the power to “influence”
proceedings in so far as they may only ever commence upon his or her
complaint.  Such powers of influence similarly reside with all witnesses and
various judicial actors, including undercover agents, jailhouse informants and
state doctors.  All can be said to have a “realistic and close connection”
to the prosecuting state.

 








91                      Indeed
in McKenzie, supra, at p. 28, it was acknowledged that witnesses,
complainants and doctors always have the power to influence the course of the prosecution
by withholding or colouring evidence, even to the extent of affecting the
verdict.  However, this did not make them “persons in authority”.  See
also Wilband v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 14, where the Court determined
that the confessions rule did not apply to statements made to psychiatrists
examining the convicted offender under Criminal Code  provisions. 
The crucial point is that not only do such persons not have control over
proceedings, but also the police themselves have no control over the conduct of
either the accused or complainant.  Therefore, the exclusion of privately
induced statements at that stage would not serve any principle of deterrence or
fair treatment at the hands of the state.  Essentially, state involvement must
be explicit.  It is not enough to allege that a person might “influence”
proceedings.

 

92                      The
basic power to influence proceedings cannot be enough to satisfy the objective
threshold of state involvement, and there is no need to examine the accused’s subjective beliefs in such a scenario.  Regardless
of a person’s prospective intention to
contact the authorities, as in Kyle, the accused’s reasonable apprehension of the complainant’s power over him, and the evident involuntariness of
his statements, it would not serve the interests of the confessions rule to
exclude such statements. The defence has ample opportunity to impugn their
reliability in the course of the trial, and the statements should be admitted,
like any other evidence, subject to the scrutiny and weight attached to them by
the triers of fact.

 

93                      As
this discussion shows, I cannot agree with the “close connection” test set out
in A.B., supra.  Such a test has the potential, I fear, to
reappear in the test for “person in
authority” adopted by my colleague in
this case, which invokes the same “power
of influence” standard and rests on an
ambiguous assessment of what might make a subjective belief “reasonable”. 
In practice, the two tests have the likely potential to amount to the same
uncertain standard, which I find to be an unacceptable proposition.  And
indeed, as examined below, this precise test surfaces in my colleague’s approach to when the trial judge has a duty to
conduct a voir dire.  If it is coercive state action which the
confessions rule aims to deter, how is this principle served by excluding
evidence acquired by the questionable conduct of private parties?  In my view,
it is not.

 








94                      This
objective threshold test for “persons
in authority” reflects the practical reality
of the law as it has long been applied in Canada and conforms to the modern
rationales of the confessions rule. Significantly, it is clear and
straightforward to apply. Without some state presence, there is no legitimate
purpose served in excluding evidence.  In fact, the trier of fact’s important task of ascertaining the truth is
impeded and this imposes a substantial cost on the societal interest in law
enforcement. The public interest of placing probative evidence before juries
for the purpose of arriving at truthful decisions concerning guilt or innocence
should not be wholly misplaced by the confessions rule.  The discussion in R.
v. Unger (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 228 (Man. C.A.), at p. 247, which
quotes the majority in R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, is apt on
this basic point made in Corbett, at p. 697:

 

. . . basic principles of the law of
evidence embody an inclusionary policy which would permit into evidence
everything logically probative of some fact in issue, subject to the recognized
rules of exclusion and exceptions thereto. Thereafter the question is one of
weight. The evidence may carry much weight, little weight, or no weight at all.
If error is to be made it should be on the side of inclusion rather than
exclusion and our efforts in my opinion, consistent with the ever-increasing
openness of our society, should be toward admissibility unless a very clear
ground of policy or law dictates exclusion. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

95                      In
conclusion, the proper “person in
authority” test explicitly includes
both an objective and subjective element. First, the objective status of the
person to whom the statement was made must be established, and only where they
are identified as someone formally engaged in the arrest, detention,
interrogation or prosecution of the accused, is it necessary to then examine
the subjective belief of the accused in this regard.  This approach furthers
the modern principles underlying the confessions rule, and does not erect additional
unwarranted barriers to the admission of relevant evidence. It recognizes that
a subjective approach to the test for “persons
in authority” was primarily adopted to
address the circumstance of undercover state agents.  However, it remains a
necessary prerequisite to find that the statement was made to an actual person
in authority or an “instrumentality” of the state.

 








V.   The Trial Judge’s Obligation to Direct a Voir Dire

 

96                      Having
set out this clear position of what constitutes the proper test for “persons in authority” under the confessions rule, I turn now to the question of when a trial
judge has an obligation to hold a voir dire and determine whether
a statement was made to a “person in
authority”, and if so, was voluntary. 
This obligation should be precisely defined in order to promote certainty and
help facilitate the judge’s difficult
task of judicially conducting a trial.

 

97                      As
a general rule, the defence has the onus of requesting a voir dire
raising the issue that the accused’s
statement was made to a “person in
authority” and thus putting the
statement’s admissibility into
question.  In the voir dire itself, as elaborated by my colleague
in para. 37, the accused has an evidential burden of ensuring there is enough
evidence on the record to make the issue of whether the statement was made to a
“person in authority” a live one such that voluntariness must be
established.

 

98                      The
imposition of this basic burden on the accused is reasonable because it
encourages parties to raise the issue of admissibility of evidence at trial,
and saves counsel from seeking a voir dire or waiver concerning
every statement made by the accused to anyone, in order to avoid the
possibility of a successful appeal on that basis.  More importantly, the
determination of who is a “person in
authority” derives from a close analysis
of the facts, to which the subjective belief of the accused is relevant. As
such, the imposition of this onus on the defence follows from the nature of the
inquiry. 

 








99                      In
addition, this onus is consistent with the basic role of defence counsel in our
adversarial system, whose competence in making tactical decisions and
responsibly representing their client’s
best interests we have recognized (R. v. Lomage (1991),  2
O.R. (3d) 621 (C.A.)).  In this regard, a failure to object to the admission of
evidence may be based on a conscious decision of what best serves the interests
of the defence. The basic duty to request a voir dire is
consistent with this reality, and reflects the importance of some judicial
deference to the competence of defence counsel and the avoidance of any undue
interference with their trial strategy.

 

100                    Notwithstanding
this responsibility borne by the accused, a trial judge still has the basic
duty of ensuring the fair conduct of a criminal trial apart from lapses of
counsel.  Thus, in exceptional cases, she or he may have the duty to conduct a voir
dire into the voluntariness of a confession even if there is no request
from counsel.  As Martin J.A.  held in R. v. Sweezey
(1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 400 (Ont. C.A.), a voir dire should be
held either where it is requested, or absent such a request, where there are
circumstances that cast doubt on the statement’s voluntariness.  In Erven v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R.
926, a plurality of this Court clarified that the very making of a statement to
a person in authority is sufficient to cast doubt on the statement’s voluntariness.  In other words, there is no need
for evidence of actual involuntariness.  In this regard, the trial judge’s duty to conduct a voir dire, absent
the accused’s waiver of this right, can
arise on the facts before him or her.

 

101                    The
critical issue upon which my colleague and I disagree is what circumstances
trigger the trial judge’s obligation to
hold a voir dire -- where does the evidence reveal the realistic
possibility that a statement has been made to a person in authority.  This
issue centres on the “person in authority” test, as it is the factor which triggers the
application of the confessions rule. Logically, therefore, the circumstances
under which the duty to hold a voir dire will arise should
consistently mirror its definition.

 








102                    As
a basic proposition, the duty to hold a voir dire is triggered
where the evidence shows the reasonable possibility that the accused’s statement was made to a person in authority. 
Mirroring the test for “person in authority” which I have adopted above, if the evidence reveals the reasonable
possibility that first, the admission was made to someone formally engaged in
the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused, and second,
the accused might objectively have known of this authority, then a voir dire
must be conducted.  At this stage, there is an air of reality to the claim that
the confession was made to a person in authority, voluntariness becomes a live
issue and the trial judge has a duty to hold a voir dire.

 

103                    Despite adopting a highly subjective approach to the person in
authority requirement, my colleague articulates a purely objective test for
when the trial judge’s obligation to
conduct an inquiry is triggered.  In his view, the evidentiary threshold is met
where the evidence demonstrates “that
the receiver of the statement made by the accused was closely connected to
the authorities” (para. 45,
emphasis added).  There is no need for any evidence as to the subjective belief
of the accused.

 

104                    My
concerns with this approach are two-fold. First, the vagueness of the “close connection” test generates unwarranted uncertainty. As examined above, it does not
adequately serve the principle of state deterrence which justifies the
confessions rule, and is difficult to apply.  As such, it fails to provide a
bright line defining the trial judge’s
responsibility to raise the issue of the confession’s admissibility.  As virtually anyone has the
potential to be closely connected with the authorities, judges will be inclined
to canvass the issue in a voir dire whenever an out-of-court
statement by the accused is tendered.  To enforce such a practice is
unacceptable because it contradicts basic rules of evidence, might unduly
interfere with defence counsel tactics and is contrary to the proper
administration of justice.








105                    These
concerns are in fact realized in the companion case of R. v. Wells, 
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 517, where my colleague finds that two visits to the RCMP
constituted a “close connection” sufficient to give rise to the trial judge’s duty to hold a voir dire.  On this
approach, any connection with the authorities becomes enough to constitute a “close connection”.  In my respectful view, this conclusion is incompatible with my
colleague’s assertion, at para. 47,
that the evidence must clearly show the person to be “acting in concert with the police or prosecutorial
authorities” and demonstrates the
unacceptable ambiguity of the “close
connection” test.  On this approach,
the exceptional duty to conduct a voir dire without requests by
counsel has the potential to arise in a number of unwarranted situations.

 

106                    My
second concern with the objective “close
connection” test of my colleague is
that it fails to include any recognition of the subjective element in the “person in authority” definition.  The subjective knowledge of the accused is assumed in
every case.  This assumption strikes me as unreasonable and unprincipled.  In
the situation of undercover agents, where the status of the person is hidden
from the accused, there is no reasonable basis for such an inference. In other
words, there is no air of reality to the claim that the statement was made to a
“person in authority” or was involuntary.  Along these lines, in R.
v. Pettipiece (1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 133 (B.C.C.A.), Branca J.A.
properly held that a voir dire was not necessary for statements
made to an undercover agent in jail, as he was not a person in authority. 
Indeed, to oblige a trial judge to hold a voir dire automatically
absent any evidence that the accused might have known of the person’s authority serves neither the rationale justifying
the exclusionary rule nor the pursuit of truth and is ultimately not in the
interest of the administration of justice.

 








107                    The
need for some evidence that the accused might have believed he was speaking
with a person in authority is not onerous, and would not render the trial judge’s obligation meaningless as alleged by my colleague
(para. 42).  Instead it consistently reflects the basic definition of “person in authority”, and reinforces the general onus on the defence to raise the issue of
voluntariness.  This approach is preferable to the “close connection” test which categorically calls for a voir dire even if
there is no possibility that the accused could have been influenced by any
authority.

 

108                    I
conclude, therefore, that the trial judge’s
duty to hold a voir dire arises where the evidence reveals the realistic potential that the
admission was made to a representative of the state and the accused might
objectively have known of this authority.

 

109                    Before
canvassing the different circumstances in which this duty will arise, it is
worth emphasizing that only evidence available on the record prior to
the admission of the accused’s
statement is relevant to the determination of what the trial judge’s duty was. Evidence introduced after its admission
does not bear upon this duty.  My colleague implies this requirement in his
statement, at para. 41, that “the trial
judge will only have committed reversible error if clear evidence existed in
the record which objectively should have alerted him or her to the need for a voir
dire notwithstanding counsel’s
silence”.  Obviously, a trial judge
cannot anticipate forthcoming evidence and what duty it might impose on him or
her, and a basic evidentiary burden on the accused in this regard is
justifiable.

 








110                    In
practical terms then, when might the trial judge’s duty arise?  In the most straightforward situation, where a statement
is made to an obvious representative of the state, and nothing indicates the
accused would be unaware of this fact, the evidential burden is met. The
voluntariness of the statement is a live issue, and the trial judge must hold a
voir dire to establish the statement’s admissibility, regardless of whether or not it is
requested by counsel.  Essentially, where the accused has made a statement to a
police officer, or to other obvious “persons
in authority”, it is reasonable to
infer the accused’s knowledge of this
authority, and the trial judge is obliged to hold a voir dire
unless this right is waived by the accused (see Powell v. The
Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 362; Erven, supra, and Park v.
The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 64). 

 

111                    The
more complicated situation involves non-obvious persons in authority, for the
evidential burden on the accused to make the admissibility of the statement a
live issue is not automatically met in such cases.  Not only can we not
automatically assume the accused’s
knowledge of any authority, but also there must be a realistic potential that
this person is acting as an agent of the state.  In the court below (R. v.
M.C.H. (1996), 91 O.A.C. 298), Finlayson J.A. addressed this situation as
follows (at p. 302):

 

When a statement is made to a person
or persons not ordinarily engaged in the arrest, detention, examination, or prosecution
of accused persons, it appears to me that the defence has a responsibility to
raise the issue at trial and ask for a voir dire to determine if the person to
whom the confession was made was in fact a person in authority.  The defence
bears this responsibility because the subjective reaction of the accused to his
or her interrogator is essential to the ultimate determination of
voluntariness. Absent the presence of a conventional authority figure at the
time when an inculpatory statement is made, the trial judge must be placed on
notice that the voluntariness of the statement is a live issue.

 

 

I agree with Finlayson J.A. that as a general rule
the accused has the duty to request a voir dire in the case of
non-obvious persons in authority.  Where requested, the trial judge has an
obligation to grant the accused the opportunity to establish that the statement
was made to a person in authority.

 








112                    In
the rarest of circumstances, however, even without any request by counsel,
there may be enough evidence on the record prior to the statement’s admission which should have alerted the trial
judge to the need for a voir dire.  As outlined above, there must
be the realistic potential that the person was formally acting for the state
and the accused could have known of this relationship. Otherwise, it would
serve no legitimate purpose to interrupt the trial to conduct a voir dire.

 

113                    In
summary, the trial judge has a duty to hold a voir dire where
there is a reasonable possibility that the statement was made to a person in
authority.  This will automatically arise in cases of obvious persons in
authority, subject to informed waiver by the accused.  In the case of
non-obvious persons in authority, however, the evidence must reveal both the
reasonable possibility that the person was an agent of the state and the
accused could have known of this status. As a general rule, the accused bears
the onus of requesting this trial within a trial. However, in exceptional
circumstances, the evidence itself will require the trial judge to conduct a voir
dire proprio motu. 

 

VI.   Application to the Facts

 

114                    In
the facts of this appeal, like my colleague, I have no trouble concluding that
there was no realistic possibility that the complainant and her immediate
family constituted persons in authority for purposes of the confessions rule,
and therefore the trial judge had no duty to hold a voir dire. 
There was absolutely no evidence available to the trial judge prior to the
admission of the statements that these persons were acting as agents of the
state and had control over any prospective proceedings against the accused. 
Indeed, it is clear that they were not persons in authority with any control
over the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused.  

 








115                    Therefore,
I agree with my colleague that the evidence failed to trigger the trial judge’s obligation to hold a voir dire and
the appeal should be dismissed.  The evidence was properly admitted to the
trier of fact for assessment of its reliability in all the surrounding
circumstances.

The respondent gas utility, whose rates and payment
policies are governed by the Ontario Energy Board, bills its customers on a
monthly basis, and each bill includes a “due date” for the payment of current
charges.  Customers who do not pay by the due date incur a late payment penalty
(“LPP”) calculated at five percent of the unpaid charges for that month.  The
LPP is a one‑time penalty which does not compound or increase over time. 
It was implemented in 1975 following a series of rate hearings conducted by the
Board.  In granting the respondent’s application to impose the penalty, the
Board noted that the primary purpose of the LPP is to encourage customers to
pay their bills promptly, thereby reducing the cost to the respondent of
carrying accounts receivable.  The Board recognized that if a bill is paid very
soon after the due date, the penalty can be shown to represent a very high rate
of interest, but it noted that customers could avoid such a charge by paying
their bills on time.  The appellant commenced an action on behalf of a large
number of the respondent’s customers alleging that the LPP violates s. 347 
of the Criminal Code  because ‑‑ for a significant number of
customers each month ‑‑ it constitutes interest at a rate exceeding
60 percent per year.  He submitted actuarial evidence showing that under the
normal billing plan, the LPP gives rise to an interest rate exceeding 60
percent per annum for customers who pay within 37 days after the due date. 
Under the equal billing plan, the point at which the interest rate falls below
60 percent is between 24 and 90 days after the due date, depending on the
month.  The appellant also submitted statistical evidence indicating that while
many of the respondent’s customers pay late, most pay only a few days late.  In
support of this action, the appellant applied for and received financial
assistance from the Ontario Class Proceedings Committee.  He also moved for
certification of a class proceeding on behalf of all customers who paid LPP
charges after April 1, 1981, when s. 347 of the Code came into
force.  Prior to the disposition of that motion both the appellant and the
respondent moved for summary judgment on various grounds.  A judge of the
Ontario Court (General Division) granted summary judgment in favour of the
respondent and dismissed the action.  The respondent moved for an order
amending the judge’s formal judgment.  The appellant refused to consent to the
motion.  The motion was granted and the judge assessed costs to be payable by
the appellant personally.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeal
of the dismissal of his action.

 

Held (Bastarache J. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and the
matter remitted to the Ontario Court (General Division).

 








Per L’Heureux‑Dubé,
Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci, Major and Binnie JJ.:  Section 347 of the Code
applies to the LPP imposed by the respondent.  For the purposes of s. 347 ,
“interest” is an extremely comprehensive term which expressly includes charges
or expenses “in the form of a . . . penalty”.  However, not every
charge or expense will be subject to the criminal interest rate provision.  In
order to constitute “interest” under s. 347 , a charge ‑‑
whatever its form ‑‑ must be “paid or payable for the advancing of
credit under an agreement or arrangement”.  Under s. 347(2), “credit
advanced” encompasses not only “the money” advanced under an agreement or
arrangement, but also “the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits”
which may be so advanced.  The most plausible interpretation of s. 347(2)
is that an “advance” of “the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits”
means a deferral of payment for such items.  The respondent provides goods and
services to its customers, for which a specified amount of money is payable
each month on a certain date.  The deferral of that payment past the due date
constitutes “credit advanced” within the meaning of s. 347(2), assuming
that such deferral is permitted under the payment relationship which exists
between the parties.  Moreover, the credit is advanced by the respondent to its
customers “under an agreement or arrangement”.  The arrangement between the
parties creates two payment options:  a short‑term option, which costs
nothing, and a longer‑term option, which involves an additional charge. 
While it is clear that the respondent neither encourages late payments nor
seeks to profit from them, under the terms prevailing between the parties
customers are permitted to defer their payment, albeit for a price.  That is an
arrangement for the advancing of credit under the broad language adopted in
s. 347 .  On the facts of this case, a penalty incurred, pursuant to the
terms of a standing arrangement between the parties, for the deferral of
payment of a specified amount of money owing for goods, services or benefits is
an “interest” charge within the meaning of s. 347  and is subject to that
law’s prohibitions against requiring or receiving interest at a criminal rate. 

 








Section 347  creates two separate offences.  Section 347(1)(a)
makes it illegal to enter into an agreement or arrangement to receive interest
at a criminal rate, while s. 347(1)(b) makes it illegal to receive
a payment or partial payment of interest at a criminal rate.  Section 347(1)(a)
should be narrowly construed.  Whether an agreement or arrangement for credit
violates the provision is determined as of the time the transaction is entered
into.  If the agreement or arrangement permits the payment of interest at a
criminal rate but does not require it, there is no violation of s. 347(1)(a),
although s. 347(1)(b) might be engaged.  It is clear that there is no
violation of s. 347(1)(a) in this case.  The arrangement between
the respondent and its customers does not, on its face, require the payment of
interest at a criminal rate.  Section 347(1)(b) should be broadly
construed.  Whether an interest payment violates the provision is determined as
of the time the payment is received.  For the purposes of s. 347(1)(b),
the effective annual rate of interest arising from a payment is calculated over
the period during which credit is actually outstanding.  Pursuant to the
decision in Nelson, there is no violation of s. 347(1)(b)
where a payment of interest at a criminal rate arises from a voluntary act of
the debtor, that is, an act wholly within the control of the debtor and not
compelled by the lender or by the occurrence of a determining event set out in
the agreement.  The actuarial evidence submitted in this case shows that if a
regular billing customer waits 38 days or longer to pay, the annual interest
rate represented by the five percent charge drops below the criminal threshold
of 60 percent per annum.  It cannot be said, however, that payment of the LPP
within 38 days is a “voluntary” act within the meaning of Nelson.  While
strictly speaking, it is true that customers may delay their payment of the LPP
beyond 38 days, there is clearly no invitation to do so, and it would be
disingenuous to conclude that customers actually perceive themselves to be at
liberty to wait that long.  Statistical evidence submitted by the appellant
strongly supports the opposite conclusion.  

 

The motions judge erred in awarding costs against the
appellant in his personal capacity.  The purpose of s. 59.4 of the Law
Society Act is to protect class representatives from personal exposure to
costs in actions where financial support has been granted by the Class
Proceedings Fund.  Since the appellant has successfully applied for support
from the Class Proceedings Fund, he should not be exposed to personal liability
for any costs arising in this action, including costs incurred in the context
of procedural motions. 

 








Per Bastarache J.
(dissenting):  While the definition of “interest” includes the notion of “penalty”,
the application of s. 347  is also predicated upon the existence of an
“agreement or arrangement” for the advancement of credit.  On the facts of this
case, the respondent has not entered into an agreement or arrangement to give
credit to the appellant or to any other customers who have paid the LPP. 
Far from being a consensual extension of credit, the respondent’s LPP
represents an effort to prevent or deter customers from unilaterally taking
credit.  The decisions of the Ontario Energy Board approving the LPP confirm
that the penalty is not “paid or payable for the advancing of credit”, but is
an incentive for timely payment.  Further indicia supporting this view are the
fact that the penalty is not compounded, the fact that it is a one‑time
payment which does not increase over time, the fact that there is no sanction
for the non‑payment of the penalty, and the fact that the penalty
triggers contemporaneously with the account becoming overdue.  Since s. 347 of
the Code is not applicable, the action should be dismissed.  A contract
for the extension of credit should not be implied in every case where there is
late payment pursuant to a sale of goods.  This case involves a regulated
industry and a rate approval scheme has been established with the specific
purpose of protecting consumer interests.  To limit the choice of means of the
regulator by resorting to the criminal law power is inappropriate and
unwarranted.

1                                  
Major J. -- This appeal
concerns the interpretation and application of s. 347  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  -- the “Criminal Interest Rate” provision. 
Section 347  makes it an offence to enter into an agreement for, or to receive,
interest at a rate exceeding 60 percent per year.  The respondent sells natural
gas to Ontario residents.  Customers who do not pay their bills on or before a
specified date each month are subject to a five percent penalty for late
payment.  The main issue is whether that penalty, depending on when it is paid,
may be said to constitute “interest at a criminal rate” within the meaning of
s. 347 of the Code.  

 

2                                  
A subsidiary issue is whether the trial judge erred in awarding $500 in
costs against the appellant personally in connection with a procedural motion. 
The appellant submits that because this putative class action has been approved
for support by the Ontario Class Proceedings Committee, any award of costs must
be assessed against the Class Proceedings Fund and may not be awarded against
him in his personal capacity. 

 

I.  Facts

 

3                                  
The respondent, Consumers’ Gas Company Limited (“Consumers’ Gas” or
“CG”), is a regulated utility which provides natural gas to commercial and
residential customers throughout Ontario.  Its rates and payment policies are
governed by the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB” or “Board”) pursuant to the Ontario
Energy Board Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.13, and the Municipal Franchises Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. M.55.  The respondent cannot sell gas or charge for gas-related
services except in accordance with rate orders issued by the Board.  

 








4                                  
Consumers’ Gas bills its customers on a monthly basis, and each bill
includes a “due date” for the payment of current charges.  The due date
normally falls on the 10th day (for commercial customers) or the 16th day (for
residential customers) after the bill is issued.  Customers who do not pay by
the due date incur a late payment penalty (“LPP”) calculated at five percent of
the unpaid charges for that month.  The LPP is a one-time penalty, and does not
compound or increase over time.  Customers can avoid the LPP by participating
in a pre-authorized payment system, whereby the amount of their monthly bill is
deducted automatically on the due date from a designated bank account.

 

5                                  
Consumers’ Gas offers its customers two billing plans.  Under the normal
plan, customers are simply billed for the cost of goods and services which they
consume each month.  Under the “Equal Billing Plan”, CG estimates the
customer’s yearly consumption, bills an equal amount each month for 10 months,
settles any balance in the 11th month, and bills for actual use in the 12th. 
About half of CG’s customers subscribe to each type of plan.  Late-paying
customers are subject to the LPP regardless of which plan is used.

 

6                                  
The LPP was implemented in 1975 following a series of rate hearings
conducted by the OEB.  In granting CG’s application to impose the penalty, the
Board noted that the primary purpose of the LPP is to encourage customers to
pay their bills promptly, thereby reducing the cost to CG of carrying accounts
receivable.  The Board also held that such costs, along with any special
collection costs arising from late payments, should be borne by the customers
who cause them to be incurred, rather than by the customer base as a whole.  In
approving a flat penalty of five percent, the OEB rejected the alternative
course of imposing a daily interest charge on overdue accounts.  The Board
reasoned that an interest charge would not provide sufficient incentive to pay
by a named date, would give little weight to collection costs, and might seem
overly complicated.  The Board recognized that if a bill is paid very soon
after the due date, the penalty can, if calculated as an interest charge, be
shown to represent a very high rate of interest.  However, it noted that
customers could avoid such a charge by paying their bills on time, and that in
any event in the case of the average bill the dollar amount of the penalty
would not be very large.

On several occasions since its adoption, the LPP has been reviewed and
re-approved by the OEB in essentially the same form.  From 1981 until 1989,
rate orders issued by the Board with regard to Consumers’ Gas incorporated the
following provision (applicable to residential customers):

 

PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT:

 

When payment in full is not made within sixteen
(16) days of the date of mailing, or the hand delivery of the bill, a penalty
of five per cent (5%) of the current amount billed shall be levied....  

 

Beginning in
1989, CG rate orders incorporated this statement from the respondent’s Handbook
of Rates and Distribution Services (applicable to all customers):

 

SECTION F - PAYMENT CONDITIONS

 

Payment in full should be received by the Company ... on or before the
due date specified in the monthly bill, which date is at least ten (10) days
(sixteen (16) days in the case of Rates 1, 2, 6 and 9), after the date of
rendering the bill.  A penalty of five (5) percent of the unpaid portion of the
current amount billed shall be added to the amount due if payment is not
received as outlined above....

 

The record
indicates that every rate order of the OEB regarding the respondent issued
between 1981 and the filing of this action has incorporated the LPP as a
component of the respondent’s rate structure.

 








8                                  
Customers are made aware of the LPP in several ways.  The due date for
payment of current charges appears at the top of every residential bill, and is
defined on the reverse as “the date that your account must be paid to avoid a
late payment penalty”.  The significance of the due date is also conveyed by
the fact that two different amounts payable appear on the face of the bill: 
one amount is “payable by due date” while the other, somewhat higher, is “payable
after due date”.  In addition, a variety of informational brochures are
provided by CG to its customers.  The pamphlet entitled “Getting to Know Us”
includes the following definitions of terms contained in the monthly bill: 

 

6.    Payable by due date -- This is the total
amount payable on or before the due date in order to avoid a late payment
penalty charge....

 

7.    Due date -- The date on which your account
must be paid in full in order to avoid a late payment penalty charge.

 

8.    Payable after due date -- The total amount
payable after the due date.  This amount includes the late payment penalty
charge.

 

Elsewhere in
the same brochure, it is explained that:

 

You should pay your gas bill on or before the due date shown on the
bill, in order to avoid late payment charges.  These charges are designed to
encourage late-paying customers to pay their accounts promptly, thus minimizing
the cost of carrying outstanding accounts....

 

If you do not pay your account by the due date, you must pay the amount
“payable after due date” that includes a late payment penalty.

 

9                                  
The appellant, Gordon Garland, is a resident of Ontario and has been a
Consumers’ Gas customer since 1983.  He and his wife paid approximately $75 in
LPP charges between 1983 and 1995.  Garland asserts that the LPP violates s.
347  of the Criminal Code  because -- for a significant number of
customers each month -- it constitutes interest at a rate exceeding 60 percent
per year.  He commenced an action on behalf of over 500,000 Consumers’ Gas
customers seeking restitution of LPP charges received by the respondent in
violation of s. 347 of the Code. 

 








10                              
Garland contends that because the LPP is a one-time charge, the effective
rate of interest arising from it depends on when a customer actually pays his
or her overdue bill.  Actuarial evidence submitted by Garland shows that, under
the normal billing plan, the LPP gives rise to an interest rate exceeding 60
percent per annum for customers who pay within 37 days after the due date.  It
is only on the 38th day after the due date that the interest rate falls below
60 percent and so within the legal limit.  It thereafter decreases gradually
from 60 percent until paid.  Under the Equal Billing Plan, the calculation is
more complex -- Garland’s actuarial evidence indicates that for such customers,
the point at which the interest rate falls below 60 percent is between 24 and
90 days after the due date, depending on the month.  For the purpose of this
appeal, these calculations are presumed to be accurate.

 

11                              
Garland has also submitted statistical evidence indicating that while
many of the respondent’s customers pay late, most pay only a few days late. 
Specifically, the evidence shows that between 1981 and 1991, an average of 34.3
percent of customers failed to pay by the due date on at least one of their
bills, but 81 percent of those customers paid within 10 days thereafter.  Thus,
overall during that period, 27.9 percent of CG’s customers paid an LPP charge
within 10 days after the due date, i.e., well within the time period during
which the rate of interest arising from that charge is alleged to have exceeded
60 percent.  Again, these figures are presumed to be true for the purposes of
this appeal.    

 








12                              
Finally, Garland has submitted documentary evidence showing that for
budgeting purposes, Consumers’ Gas makes and relies on forecasts of the revenue
it will receive from LPP charges each year.  For 1994, the estimate was $7.1
million, and for 1995, the budget forecast was $7.4 million.  Garland has also
submitted evidence showing that the total of LPP charges received by CG between
1981 and 1993 was $71.2 million.   

 

13                              
In support of this action, Garland applied for and received financial
assistance from the Ontario Class Proceedings Committee, pursuant to s. 59.2 of
the Law Society Act, R.S.O 1990, c. L.8.  Garland also moved, pursuant
to the Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6, for certification
of a class proceeding on behalf of all customers who paid LPP charges after
April 1, 1981, when s. 347 of the Code came into force.  Prior to the
disposition of that motion, both Garland and Consumers’ Gas moved for summary
judgment on various grounds.  Summary judgment was granted in favour of
Consumers’ Gas and the action was dismissed.  Garland’s appeal was dismissed by
the Ontario Court of Appeal.  This appeal follows.

 

II.  Relevant

contrary, proof of the effective annual rate without proof of the signature or
official character of the person appearing to have signed the certificate.

 

III.  Judicial
History

 

A.  Ontario
Court (General Division) (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 451

 








15                              
As noted, cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by Garland and
Consumers’ Gas before this action was certified as a class proceeding.  By
agreement of the parties, a hearing was held before Winkler J. on the threshold
question raised in CG’s motion, i.e., whether s. 347  has any application to the
circumstances of this case. 

 

16                              
Consumers’ Gas raised three arguments to support its contention that s.
347  does not apply and that Garland’s action should be dismissed.  First, it
asserted that the purpose of the LPP is to encourage timely payment, not to
achieve a rate of return on an advancement of credit, and therefore the LPP is
not “interest” within the meaning of s. 347 .  In particular, CG pointed out
that unlike an interest charge, the LPP is a one-time penalty which does not
increase over time.  Second, CG argued that s. 347  is intended to cover loans
of money, and does not apply where, as here, the alleged “credit” consists
solely of the value of goods, services or benefits advanced.  Finally, CG relied
on the decision in Nelson v. C.T.C. Mortgage Corp. (1984), 16 D.L.R.
(4th) 139 (B.C.C.A), aff’d [1986] 1 S.C.R. 749, to argue that even if the LPP
is a charge for the advancement of credit, it cannot violate s. 347  because the
payment of the penalty and the interest rate arising from it are determined by
voluntary acts of the customer, not by any agreement between the parties.

 








17                              
In response, Garland argued that “credit advanced” need not involve a
loan of money.  He asserted that the arrangement between CG and its customers,
which allows for the deferral of payment for goods and services, is a credit
arrangement within the meaning of s. 347 .  Garland further contended that the
LPP is, in substance, an interest charge payable for the advancement of such
credit.  Finally, Garland asserted that the decision in Nelson is
distinguishable from this action, because incurring and paying the LPP are not
“voluntary” acts of the customer within the meaning of Nelson.  In his
submission, the actual receipt of interest at a criminal rate by CG constitutes
a violation of para. (b) of s. 347(1) , even if such an interest rate is
not necessarily required on the face of the arrangement between the parties.

 

18                              
Winkler J. focused his analysis largely on the significance of the Nelson
decision.  In his view, Nelson established three principles applicable
to the case at bar (at p. 467):

 

[F]irst, that whether an agreement or arrangement violates s. 347  must
be determined at the time the agreement is entered into; second, that whether
the lender is in breach of s. 347  cannot turn on the voluntary conduct of the
borrower, and third, that there is no violation of s. 347  where the payment of
a criminal interest is not required by the agreement or arrangement.

 

Applying these
principles, Winkler J. concluded that the LPP could never give rise to an
offence under s. 347  because the payment of the penalty at a criminal rate of
interest turns on the voluntary conduct of the customer.  Winkler J. found
that, as in Nelson, no payment of illegal interest is required under the
arrangement between Consumers’ Gas and its customers, at the time that arrangement
is entered into.  If the customer pays on time, no LPP will be levied. 
Likewise, if the customer misses the due date but then further delays payment
of the LPP for a sufficient amount of time (e.g., 38 days), the resulting rate
of interest falls below 60 percent.  Winkler J. gave no weight to statistical
evidence indicating that a consistent percentage of CG’s customers every month
do in fact pay an LPP at an illegal interest rate.  He held that in any given
case, it is always the customer who determines whether or not to incur the LPP
and whether to pay it during the window of time when it may be considered a
criminal rate.

 








19                              
Despite this conclusion, Winkler J. went on to consider whether the LPP
may be said to constitute “interest” payable for the “advancing of credit under
an agreement or arrangement” within the meaning of s. 347 .  He noted that s.
347  is broadly written and covers a wide range of transactions.  In particular,
he rejected the contention that the provision applies only to lenders and
borrowers of money, and held that “credit advanced” can also refer to the
deferral of payment for goods or services.  However, he did not agree that any
late payment is necessarily a deferral of payment or an advancement of credit,
particularly where, as here, substantial efforts have been made to encourage
the customer to pay on time.  He stressed the distinction between the situation
where a customer simply fails to pay by a stipulated time -- which he held to
be the case on the facts before him -- and the situation where a lender agrees
to delay its demand for payment in exchange for consideration.  He found that
s. 347  applies only to the latter situation.  Winkler J. emphasized that the
LPP is a one-time payment which does not compound over time, and that there are
no immediate consequences for failing to pay it by a given date once it has
been incurred.  He concluded that the LPP is not levied in order to allow
customers to take more time in paying their bills, but rather to discourage them
from so doing.  Accordingly, he found that the LPP is not an interest charge
within the scope of s. 347 .    

 

20                              
Winkler J. granted summary judgment in favour of Consumers’ Gas and
dismissed the action.

 

B.  Ontario
Court of Appeal (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 4l4

 








21                              
The Ontario Court of Appeal (Doherty, Abella and Charron JJ.A.) agreed
with the conclusion of Winkler J. that Nelson is dispositive, and noted
in particular that the reasons in Nelson were substantially affirmed by
this Court.  In obiter dictum, the Court of Appeal also agreed that s.
347  applies to transactions where the alleged “credit advanced” consists
entirely of the value of goods, services, or benefits.  However, the court
expressed no opinion on the question of whether the LPP can be characterized as
“interest” payable for the “advancing of credit under an agreement or
arrangement” within the meaning of s. 347 . The appeal was dismissed.

 

IV.  Issues

 

22                              
(1)   Does the late payment penalty charged by Consumers’ Gas come
within the scope of s. 347  of the Criminal Code ?

 

(2)               Did the motions judge err in
awarding costs against Garland in his personal capacity?

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Does
the late payment penalty charged by Consumers’ Gas come within the scope of s.
347 of the Criminal Code?

 








23                              
Section 347 (formerly s. 305.1) of the Criminal Code , which came
into effect on April 1, 1981, created Canada’s first general anti-usury
provision since Confederation.  Prior to the adoption of s. 347 , lenders and
borrowers enjoyed absolute freedom under federal law to agree upon any rate of
interest, subject only to the contractual restraints imposed at common or civil
law and the special disclosure requirements arising under the Interest Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. I-15  (formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. I-18).  The main exception to
that rule was the Small Loans Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-11, s. 3, which
limited the imposition of interest and other charges on loans of $1,500 or
less.  That Act, which was designed to protect borrowers seeking small personal
loans, was repealed by the bill which created s. 347.  See William E.
Thomson  Associates Inc. v. Carpenter (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 545 (C.A.), at
pp. 548-49.  The current provision goes far beyond the scope of the Small
Loans Act, both by criminalizing a particular interest rate for the first
time, and by imposing a generally applicable ceiling on all types of credit
arrangements without regard to the sophistication of the parties or the amount
in issue. 

 

24                              
Under s. 347, an effective annual rate of interest which exceeds 60
percent of the credit advanced under an agreement or arrangement is a criminal
interest rate.  The statute creates two offences with regard to such interest. 
Section 347(1) (a) makes it illegal to enter into an agreement or
arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate.  Section 347(1) (b)
makes it illegal to receive a payment or partial payment of interest at a
criminal rate.  The scope of the language in s. 347 is extremely broad. 
Interest is defined, with the exception of six specific items, as the aggregate
of all charges and expenses, in any form, that are paid or payable for the
advancing of credit under an agreement or arrangement.  The definition of
credit is similarly expansive.  It includes the aggregate of the money and the
monetary value of any goods, services or benefits advanced under an agreement
or arrangement, minus any fees, commissions or similar charges incurred by the
creditor.

 








25                              
The ostensible purpose of s. 347  was to aid in the prosecution of loan
sharks.  See House of Commons Debates, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., vol. III,
July 21, 1980, at p. 3146; Thomson, supra, at p. 549.  However,
it is clear from the language of the statute -- e.g., its reference to
insurance and overdraft charges, official fees, and property taxes in mortgage
transactions -- that s. 347  was designed to have a much wider reach, and in
fact the section has most often been applied to commercial transactions which
bear no relation to traditional loan-sharking arrangements.  Although s. 347 is
a criminal provision, the great majority of cases in which it arises are not
criminal prosecutions.  Rather, like the case at bar, they are civil actions in
which a borrower has asserted the common-law doctrine of illegality in an
effort to avoid or recover an interest payment, or to render an agreement
unenforceable.  For this reason, the provision has attracted criticism from
some commercial lawyers and academics, and calls have repeatedly been made for
its amendment or repeal.  See, e.g., J. S. Ziegel, “The Usury Provisions in the
Criminal Code :  The Chickens Come Home to Roost” (1986), 11 C.B.L.J.
233; “Section 347  of the Criminal Code ” (1994), 23 C.B.L.J. 321. 
Nevertheless, it is now well settled that s. 347  applies to a very broad range
of commercial and consumer transactions involving the advancement of credit,
including secured and unsecured loans, mortgages and commercial financing
agreements. 

 

26                              
The extent of s. 347 ’s scope is the subject of this appeal.  At issue is
whether the section applies to penalties for late payment, and in particular
the five percent LPP imposed by Consumers’ Gas on customers who fail to pay
their bills by a prescribed due date.  The question has two parts.  The first
is whether the LPP can be said to constitute “interest” under s. 347 , as
opposed to being simply an incentive for timely payment.  The second is whether
the principles set forth in the  Nelson case preclude the application of
s. 347  here on the ground that any interest rate arising from the LPP depends
on the voluntary conduct of the customer.  These issues will be addressed in
turn.  

 

1.  Is the LPP “interest” within the meaning of s. 347 ?

 

27                              
Pursuant to s. 347(2) , “interest” is defined as:

 

... the aggregate of all charges and expenses, whether in the form of a
fee, fine, penalty, commission or other similar charge or expense or in any
other form, paid or payable for the advancing of credit under an agreement or
arrangement ... but does not include any repayment of credit advanced or any
insurance charge, official fee, overdraft charge, required deposit balance or,
in the case of a mortgage transaction, any amount required to be paid on
account of property taxes;

 








It is apparent
from this definition that for the purposes of s. 347  “interest” is an extremely
comprehensive term, encompassing many types of fixed payments which would not
be considered interest proper at common law or under general accounting
principles.  In particular, charges or expenses “in the form of a ... penalty”
are expressly included as interest under s. 347 .  At common law, interest is a
charge for the use or retention of money which accrues day by day; it does not
include penalties.  See Tomell Investments Ltd. v. East Marstock Lands Ltd.,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 974, at p. 983; Immeubles Fournier Inc. v. Construction
St-Hilaire Ltée, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 2, at pp. 10-11; Attorney-General for
Ontario v. Barfried Enterprises Ltd., [1963] S.C.R. 570.

 

28                              
In adopting s. 347 , Parliament opted for the more inclusive “cost of the
loan” concept derived from the Small Loans Act, which s. 347  replaced. 
Section 2 of that Act provided:

 

2. ...

 

 “cost” of a loan means the whole of the cost of
the loan to the borrower whether the cost is called interest or is claimed as
discount, deduction from an advance, commission, brokerage, chattel mortgage
and recording fees, fines, penalties or charges for inquiries, defaults or
renewals or otherwise....

 

The broad
language of s. 347  was presumably intended (as it was in the Small Loans Act)
to prevent creditors from avoiding the statute simply by manipulating the
form of payment exacted from their debtors -- a practice which has historically
undermined the effectiveness of anti-usury laws applying a strict definition of
interest: Thomson, supra, at pp. 548-49; see also K. Keest, The
Cost of Credit (1995), at p. 38.  It is the substance, and not merely the
form, of a charge or expense which determines whether it is governed by s. 347 .

 








29                              
The LPP at issue in this appeal is a fixed payment, rather than a charge
which accrues day by day.  The motions judge emphasized that point in
concluding that the LPP does not come within the scope of s. 347 .  At p. 473,
he stated in part: 

 

First, the penalty is not compounded.  Although it is expressed as a
percentage of the amount owing, it is in fact a lump sum which is charged only
if payment is not made by the due date.  Second, the penalty is a one-time
payment which does not increase over time.

 

The same
argument has been advanced by the respondent in this appeal.  To distinguish
between fixed and time-sensitive charges is inconsistent with the plain
language of s. 347 , and to the extent the motions judge relied on such a
distinction, such reliance was unfounded.  As noted, Parliament expressly expanded
the meaning of interest under s. 347  to include one-time charges, whether
payable at the outset of a transaction (e.g., fees and commissions) or after
repayment is due (e.g., fines and penalties).  A time factor, while essential
to the definition of common-law interest, is not necessary to bring a payment
within the ambit of s. 347 , and the LPP cannot be excluded on that ground.

 

30                              
It is equally clear, however, that not every charge or expense will be
subject to the criminal interest rate provision.  In order to constitute
“interest” under s. 347 , a charge -- whatever its form -- must be “paid or
payable for the advancing of credit under an agreement or arrangement”
(emphasis added).  To contend that the LPP comes within the scope of s. 347 
simply because it is a “penalty” is a formalistic and unpersuasive argument. 
The issue is whether that penalty constitutes, in substance, a cost incurred by
customers to receive credit under an arrangement with Consumers’ Gas. 

 








31                              
There is a basic disagreement in this case about how the LPP should
properly be characterized for the purposes of s. 347 .  The appellant asserts
that the LPP is a price paid by customers for the privilege of retaining money
that is owed to Consumers’ Gas beyond a certain date.  As such, he submits, it
is in essence a charge for credit under a standing arrangement between the
parties.  The respondent submits that the LPP is merely an incentive for timely
payment and has nothing to do with credit.  It asserts that because it lends no
money to its customers, but merely bills them for goods and services, there is
no extension of credit within the meaning of s. 347 .  Furthermore, it submits
that even if the deferral of payment for those goods and services is in fact a
form of credit, such credit is unilaterally taken by late-paying customers, not
advanced under any agreement or arrangement between the parties.  

 

32                              
The dispositive question, therefore, is whether the LPP may be said to
constitute a charge or expense “paid or payable for the advancing of credit
under an agreement or arrangement”.  In answering that question, the Court
should look to the substance, not merely the form, of the payment relationship
which exists between Consumers’ Gas and its customers.  The basic features of that
relationship are not in dispute and may be briefly stated:  Consumers’ Gas
provides goods and services to its customers, but does not bill them
immediately upon delivery or performance.  Instead, it issues a bill each month
for the total charges incurred in the preceding service period.  The amount
owing on the bill is due by a specified date.  Customers who do not pay by that
date must pay the amount owing plus an additional five percent penalty.  

 

“Credit Advanced”

 








33                              
As a first step, it is necessary to determine whether the relationship
between Consumers’ Gas and its customers involves any advancement of credit
within the meaning of s. 347.  Although s. 347 is not confined to
loan-sharking, in general the section arises in transactions which involve an
advance of money in some form, whether in a conventional loan, a mortgage, a
commercial financing agreement or otherwise.  This case presents a more unusual
situation, since it is clear that Consumers’ Gas does not actually lend any
money to its customers.  

 

34                              
In keeping with the thrust of the section in general, “credit advanced”
is broadly defined in s. 347(2) : 

 

“credit advanced” means the aggregate of the money
and the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits actually advanced or
to be advanced under an agreement or arrangement minus the aggregate of any
required deposit balance and any fee, fine, penalty, commission and other
similar charge or expense directly or indirectly incurred under the original or
any collateral agreement or arrangement;

 

Notably, this
definition encompasses not only “the money” advanced under an agreement or
arrangement, but also “the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits”
which may be so advanced.  The scope of s. 347 therefore is not confined
exclusively to loans of money.  The respondent submits, however, that the reach
of s. 347 is limited to cases in which at least some money has been
advanced.  This argument is based on a grammatical analysis of s. 347(2) , since
“money” is preceded by the definite article “the”, whereas the phrase “goods,
services or benefits” is modified by the indefinite article “any”.  Both the
motions judge and the Court of Appeal rejected that contention as overly
formalistic, and I agree.  Section 347 applies to arrangements involving the
monetary value of goods, services or benefits even in the absence of an
outright advance of money. 

 








35                              
The most plausible interpretation of s. 347(2)  is that an “advance” of
“the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits” means a deferral of
payment for such items.  A debt is deferred -- and credit extended -- when
an agreement or arrangement permits a debtor to pay later than the time at
which payment would otherwise have been due.  See R. M. Goode, Consumer
Credit Law (1989), at p. 109.  The substance of such “credit” is a
determined amount of money which is payable over time.  Unlike the principal of
a loan, however, such credit is not initially paid out to the debtor in the
form of money, but arises when a debt is incurred for goods, services or
benefits, and that debt is then deferred in full or in part by agreement of the
parties. 

 

36                              
An example is a credit sale. Such transactions are analogous to loans
even though no money actually changes hands.  In place of borrowing funds to
pay for goods or services which have been provided, the debtor retains
possession of his or her own money and the vendor assumes the position of a
creditor by virtue of deferring the debt.  Ordinarily in such circumstances, a
premium is charged on the deferred amount, reflecting the value of the money
which is now owed to the creditor but remains in the control of the party who
has been permitted to delay payment.  Under this interpretation of s. 347, the
retailer who provides financing on a sale at an interest rate exceeding 60
percent per year is subject to the same criminal sanctions as the loan shark
who lends money directly at such a rate.

 

37                              
It is crucial to bear in mind that the “credit advanced” in such
situations  consists of “monetary value” -- a specific amount of money that is
owed for goods, services or benefits pursuant to an agreement or arrangement --
and not the goods, services or benefits themselves.  If every sale, performance
of services or conveyance of benefits were understood to be an advance of
“credit”, there would be virtually no limit to the application of s. 347.  That
section, despite its broad scope, is essentially concerned with regulating the
relationship between creditors and debtors, not the relationship between
commercial actors in the ordinary course of business.  

 








38                              
This distinction can be illustrated with an example.  Assume the
purchase of a car for $1,000.  Payment of the purchase price will normally be
due at a date specified in the sale agreement or when the car is tendered.  No
credit exists in such a situation, regardless of whether the seller is in fact
paid on time, because the car is not advanced to the purchaser as “credit”. 
However, if the seller and purchaser enter into an arrangement to delay payment
of the purchase price for one month, then credit has been advanced and any
premium charged by the seller for that extension of time must comply with the
requirements of s. 347.  The “monetary value” of the car is now a fixed amount
-- $1,000 -- under their agreement, and the advancement of that credit begins
at the moment when payment would otherwise have been due. 

 

39                              
The car itself, which may in reality be worth more or less than $1,000,
is not the “credit advanced” and is not relevant for the purposes of s. 347. 
If the opposite were true, it would be virtually impossible to calculate an
interest rate arising from such a transaction, since the value of the credit
would be undefined.  In addition, and more importantly, any transaction
involving an “advance” of goods, services or benefits -- such as a rental or
leasing agreement -- would be swept within the ambit of s. 347, and many such
transactions would undoubtedly give rise to “interest” exceeding the legal
limit.  Assume that instead of being purchased, the car is rented for a day at
a price of $50.  If the car were to constitute credit advanced under s. 347(2) ,
then the return of the car to the rental agency would presumably be a repayment
of principal, and the charge paid for the advancing of that credit -- $50 for
one day -- would give rise to an astronomical interest rate based on the value
of the car.  Such an absurd result could not have been intended by Parliament
when it adopted s. 347.  For the deferral of a debt to constitute “credit
advanced” under s. 347, there must be a specified amount owing, and that amount
must actually be due in the absence of an arrangement permitting later payment.

 








40                              
In the case at bar, Consumers’ Gas provides goods and services to its
customers, for which a specified amount of money is payable each month on a
certain date.  In light of the principles stated above, the deferral of that
payment past the due date constitutes “credit advanced” within the meaning of
s. 347(2) , assuming that such deferral is permitted under the payment
relationship which exists between the parties.  The remaining question,
therefore, is whether credit is advanced by Consumers’ Gas to its customers
“under an agreement or arrangement”. 

 

“Agreement or Arrangement”

 

41                              
As noted at the outset, “interest” under s. 347 is a charge which is
“paid or payable for the advancing of credit under an agreement or
arrangement”.  Consumers’ Gas contends that even if credit may be said to
include the deferral of payment for goods or services, no “agreement or
arrangement” for the advancing of such credit exists where a customer simply
fails or refuses to pay a bill on time and thereby takes such “credit”
unilaterally.  In the respondent’s view, an agreement or arrangement for credit
only arises when the creditor agrees to delay its demand for payment,
normally in exchange for some form of consideration.  

 








42                              
The respondent submits that in the case at bar there is no such
consensual arrangement -- the LPP is imposed not as compensation for credit but
as a means to deter customers from paying late.  The respondent emphasized, as
it did in the courts below, that the LPP does not have the “characteristics
which one would expect” of a charge for credit, since it is a one-time payment
which does not repeat, compound or increase over time, and no additional
penalties accrue if a customer fails to pay it by any particular date.  It is
contended that the LPP is more akin to the late payment penalties which are
authorized under federal and provincial statutes, such as the Excise Tax Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. E-15 , s. 7(1) , the Income Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 1
(5th Supp .), ss. 163.1 and  227(9), and the Commercial Concentration Tax Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. C.16, s. 15(10).  The respondent submits that Parliament could
not have intended for those provisions to constitute agreements or arrangements
for the advancing of credit within the meaning of s. 347 .

 

43                              
The respondent also relies on decisions of the OEB to support its
argument regarding the purpose of the LPP.  In particular, it cites the
original order of the OEB approving the implementation of the penalty.  In that
decision, the Board emphasized the deterrent effect of such penalties, and
specifically rejected the option of imposing a conventional interest charge on
overdue accounts.  See Reasons for Decision, E.B.R.O. 302-II (September 4,
1975).  The Board held at pp. 116-18: 

 

The primary objective of this charge is to encourage customers to pay
promptly and thus minimize the growing cost of carrying accounts
receivable....  The Applicant [Consumers’ Gas] submits that these costs as well
as extraordinary collection costs should be borne by customers who cause them
to be incurred.

 

...

 

The late payment penalty charge is a well established and practical
device in widespread use in Ontario and elsewhere to encourage prompt payment
of utility bills....

 

The Board recognizes that a few regulatory Boards and text-book
writers  have been critical of a penalty charge of the kind used by the
Applicant.  However, the Board does not think that a monetary incentive for
prompt payment is wrong in principle.  Interest charged on over-due accounts on
a daily basis has an appeal on theoretical grounds, but it gives little
incentive to pay by a named date, gives little weight to collection costs and
seems complicated.

 








Similarly, in
1988 the OEB reviewed the fairness of the LPP and concluded that it should be
maintained in its existing form.  See Reasons for Decision, E.B.R.O. 452
(December 21, 1988).  In so finding, the Board noted at p. 330 that “the late
payment penalty should be large enough to deter those customers who otherwise
might be tempted to defer payment”.   Consumers’ Gas submits that the Board’s
characterization of the LPP should be accorded curial deference by this Court. 

 

44                              
The respondent’s arguments on this point were accepted by the motions
judge, who held as follows at pp. 469-71: 

 

From the foregoing [OEB] decisions, it is apparent
that the OEB does not view the LPP charged by Consumers’ Gas as an interest
charge for the advancing of credit.  Instead, as the defendant submits, the OEB
considers it to be an incentive for timely payment....

 

                                                                    ...

 

I accept the plaintiff’s argument that a deferral of payment
constitutes credit.  However, I do not agree that just because a customer does
not pay on time means that there has been a deferral of payment or that credit
has been advanced, particularly where the company has done what it could to
encourage the customer to pay on time.  A distinction must be drawn between the
situation in which a customer fails to pay within a stipulated time, because of
inadvertence, choice or because he does not have the money, and the situation
in which an agreement is entered into whereby the lender of money or issuer of
goods agrees to delay its demand for payment, in exchange for the consideration
of an additional charge.  In my view, s. 347 is applicable only to the latter
situation.  The facts before me reveal the former situation.

 

The Court of
Appeal dismissed Garland’s appeal on separate grounds and declined to reach the
issue of whether the LPP is a charge “payable for the advancing of credit under
an agreement or arrangement”.  

 








45                              
It is true that there is an important difference between the consensual
granting of credit and the unilateral taking of it.  See, e.g., Goode, supra,
at p. 108.  As noted, s. 347 does not apply to situations in which a buyer or
consumer fails to pay on time, without the consent of the other party, for
goods, services or benefits provided.  The facts in this case, however, present
a different situation.  The payment relationship which exists between
Consumers’ Gas and its customers is defined by a standing arrangement.  The
terms of that arrangement are imposed by Consumers’ Gas, after approval by the
OEB.  They are clearly conveyed to every customer and do not change from month
to month.  Those terms provide, in plain language, that a customer’s gas bill
may be paid either before or after the due date.  As the motions judge observed
at p. 466:

 

[T]he bill received by the customer states the amount “payable by due
date”, the “due date” and the amount “payable after due date”.  The bill does
not indicate that payment must be made by the due date and I question the
ability of Consumers’ to sue as soon as the due date has passed.

 

It is also
made clear, however, that Consumers’ Gas prefers to receive payment by the due
date, and that customers who, for whatever reason, fail to meet that deadline
must pay a price of five percent on top of the amount owing for that month.

 

46                              
In short, the arrangement between the parties creates two payment
options: a short-term option, which costs nothing, and a longer-term option,
which involves an additional charge.  The motions judge recognized this as well
in the closing words of his decision, when he observed (at pp. 473-74) that the
transaction between the parties “is a two-price system by which customers can
opt to pay one price by the due date or another price thereafter”.  He
concluded that such an arrangement “represents a discount which is forfeited if
payment is not made by the due date” (p. 474).  It can just as easily be said
that the LPP represents a premium imposed when payment is made over the longer
period.  Customers who do not like these terms presumably may end their
relationship with the respondent; by continuing to subscribe to its services
they accept the terms of the prevailing arrangement, including the imposition
of the LPP.  It cannot properly be contended that Consumers’ Gas, having
designed those terms itself, does not consent to the customer acting in
accordance with them.








 

47                              
The respondent does not deny that the LPP is imposed under an
arrangement, but disputes the nature of that arrangement.  As noted, it argues
that the intended purpose of the LPP is not to exact a price for credit
but to discourage the taking of credit in the first place.  That assertion is
not entirely supported by the record.  The OEB found that deterrence of late
payments is the “primary objective” of the LPP.  However, it also held that
when such deterrence is not effective, another purpose of the penalty is to
ensure that the “cost of carrying accounts receivable” is recovered from
customers who, by delaying payment, cause such costs to be incurred (Reasons
for Decision, E.B.R.O. 302-II, supra, at p. 116).  Before approving the
respondent’s request to implement the LPP in 1975, the OEB held a series of
hearings, during which the Associate Comptroller of the respondent was examined
with regard to the purpose of the LPP.  He stated in part:

 

Q:   The cost of money is a real problem is it?

 

A:    Yes, sir.

 

Q:   You don’t want the customers to be sitting
with lots of the company’s money for long periods of time.  You require cash
flow.  Is that fair?

 

A:    Yes, sir, that is correct.

 

Q:   It costs the company money to borrow money?

 

A:    Yes, sir.

 

                                                                    ...

 

 

Q:   Isn’t this late payment charge then a charge
to the customer for keeping the money past a certain time period, for keeping
the money for a certain length of time?

 

A:    Partly that and partly to recover our
collection costs.

 








Transcript of
Examination of D. C. Morton, January 24, 1975 (Case on Appeal, at pp. 376-77). 
Similarly, in one of its informational brochures (“Some special billing
charges”), Consumers’ Gas explains the purpose of the LPP to its customers as
follows (Case on Appeal, at p. 680): 

 

The primary purpose of this charge is to encourage our customers to pay
on or before the due date and thereby maintain the company’s cash flow. 
Revenue from this penalty helps to offset our costs of carrying outstanding gas
accounts receivable and collecting delinquent accounts. 

 

Compensation
for the cost of payment deferred is the hallmark of a credit arrangement.   

 

48                              
Even if deterrence were the only intended purpose of the LPP, that would
not be determinative of the issue before the Court.  The nature of the
arrangement between Consumers’ Gas and its customers is a question of law. 
That question turns on how the LPP operates in substance, not on what the
respondent hopes to achieve by imposing it.  Nor does the Court owe curial
deference to the OEB with regard to the characterization of the penalty.  It is
clear that Consumers’ Gas neither encourages late payments nor seeks to profit
from them.  The issue, however, is not what the company would prefer but what
it has consented to.  Under the terms prevailing between the parties, customers
are permitted to defer their payment, albeit for a price.  That is an
arrangement for the advancing of credit under the broad language adopted in s.
347.  As the OEB recognized, a five percent penalty is an effective deterrent
precisely because it constitutes a high cost, in economic terms, for the
retention of money.  It is the severity of that cost which, in the view of the
appellant, runs afoul of s. 347.  

 








49                              
This conclusion is not affected by the fact that late payment penalties
exist in certain federal and provincial statutes.  Such penalties are readily
distinguishable from the LPP at issue here.  The contractual relationship
between a public utility and its customers regarding the payment of monthly
charges is not comparable to the political relationship between a government
and its citizens regarding the payment of taxes.  There is no agreement or
arrangement between the latter parties governing the imposition of taxes, let alone
permitting the payment of one amount by a due date and another amount
thereafter.  In any event, for the purposes of s. 347, tax is not the monetary
value of goods, services, or benefits provided by the government, and the
deferral of tax, even if such deferral were permitted, would not constitute
“credit” within the meaning of s. 347(2) .  See Delta v. Active Chemicals
Ltd. (1984), 57 B.C.L.R. 213 (C.A.), at p. 217.

 

50                              
For these reasons, I conclude that the LPP imposed by Consumers’ Gas is
a “charg[e] ... in the form of a ... penalty ... payable for the advancing of
credit under an agreement or arrangement”.  As such it is an interest charge
for the purposes of s. 347. 

 

51                              
The conclusions reached in this appeal may not follow intuitively from
the concepts of “credit” and “interest” as those terms are employed at common
law and in everyday life.  The result here is mandated by the extremely broad
compass given to those terms by Parliament under s. 347.  As Huddart L.J.S.C.
observed in Mira Design Co. v. Seascape Holdings Ltd. (1981), 34
B.C.L.R. 55, at p. 60:

 

The thrust of the definitions of “credit advanced”
and “interest” is to cover all possible aspects of any transaction to ensure
that the cost of using someone else’s money never exceeds the criminal rate.  Thus,
they focus on the actual benefit given to the borrower and the real cost of
borrowing.  The actual benefit is the real amount in the borrower’s hands minus
all the penalties, commissions and other costs incurred.  The cost of borrowing
is also widely defined.  Clearly the intention of the legislature was to
concentrate on the substance of the transaction, not on its mechanics or form.

 








52                              
It should be noted however that s. 347 is a deeply problematic law. 
Some of its terms are most comfortably understood in the narrow context of
street-level loan sharking, while others compel a much broader application. 
The two facets of the statute do not comfortably co-exist.  The Court is aware
that the present decision may have the effect of increasing the importance of
s. 347 in some consumer and commercial transactions.  Given the interpretive
difficulties inherent in the provision and the volume of civil litigation which
it has already spawned, it is with some reluctance that we are legally driven
to this conclusion.  However, the plain terms of s. 347 must govern its
application.  If the section is to be given a more directed focus, it lies with
Parliament, not the courts, to take the required remedial action.  

 

53                              
In any event, the result reached in this appeal is limited.  On the
facts of this case, a penalty incurred, pursuant to the terms of a standing
arrangement between the parties, for the deferral of payment of a specified
amount of money owing for goods, services or benefits is an “interest” charge
within the meaning of s. 347 and is subject to that law’s prohibitions against
requiring or receiving interest at a criminal rate. 

 

2.    Is the Application of s. 347 Precluded by
the Principles Set Forth in  Nelson v. C.T.C. Mortgage Corp.?

 








54                              
As noted, s. 347  creates two separate offences.  Section 347(1) (a)
makes it illegal to enter into an agreement or arrangement to receive
interest at a criminal rate.  Section 347(1) (b) makes it illegal to receive
a payment or partial payment of interest at a criminal rate.  The
relationship between these two provisions has been the subject of much comment
in the courts below and in academic writings.  In particular, controversy
exists about whether an agreement which does not expressly require the payment
of criminal interest at the time it is entered into may nevertheless give rise
to an actual payment of interest at an illegal rate.  Such cases can arise if
an additional charge is incurred while credit is outstanding, or if the actual
period for repayment is shortened by the occurrence of a determining event or
an act by one of the parties.  See, e.g., Mira Design, supra; Aectra
Refining & Marketing Inc. v. Lincoln Capital Funding Corp. (1991), 6
O.R. (3d) 146 (Gen. Div.); S. Antle, “A Practical Guide to Section 347  of the
Criminal Code  -- Criminal Rates of Interest” (1994), 23 C.B.L.J. 323, at
p. 334; Ziegel, “The Usury Provisions in the Criminal Code : The Chickens Come
Home to Roost”, supra, at p. 240; M. Feldman, “Criminal Interest Rates
in the Context of Early Payment of a Debt Obligation” (1985), 2 Bus. &
L. 70.  

 

55                              
The leading decision on this issue is Nelson, supra.  The
facts and judgments in Nelson are set forth in detail in the companion
case to this appeal, Degelder Construction Co. v. Dancorp Developments Ltd.,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 90, and need not be fully repeated.  Briefly, the Nelsons were
guarantors of a mortgage on which a number of fixed fees were payable in
addition to conventional interest.  Had the mortgage been repaid when it was
due, the fees and interest would have produced an effective interest rate of
52.49 percent per annum.  However, the mortgage contained a right of prepayment
which was exercised by the debtor early in the life of the agreement.  When the
interest rate was calculated over the term during which the mortgage was
actually outstanding, it was 84.1 percent per annum.  The Nelsons sued the
lender alleging that the mortgage agreement was void and unenforceable under s.
305.1 (now s. 347 ).  

 








56                              
The issue at trial and on appeal was whether the rate of interest should
be calculated over the full term of the mortgage as stated in the agreement, or
over the shorter period that the mortgage was actually outstanding.  The
British Columbia Court of Appeal split on the question.  Hutcheon J.A.,
dissenting, held that the case turned on the distinction between ss. 347(1) (a)
and 347(1) (b).  In his view, subs. (1)(a) prohibits entering into
an agreement which, on its face, requires the payment of illegal interest; he
found that such a situation was not before him.  However, he held that subs.
(1)(b) prohibits the actual receipt of an illegal interest payment, and
the rate in such situations must be based on the time elapsed since the money
was advanced, even if that period differs from the term foreseen in the
agreement.  The majority, per Seaton J.A., found that such an approach
would produce an absurd result in a situation where the period of repayment is
within the exclusive control of the debtor.  As Seaton J.A. held at pp. 144-45,
Parliament cannot have intended that “an innocent mortgagee who has entered
into a perfectly lawful agreement should as the result of the voluntary act of
the mortgagor in prepaying the mortgage become guilty of an offence under [s.
347(1) (b)]”.  The majority recognized that the same might not be true if
a mortgage were payable on the demand of the creditor rather than at the
debtor’s option.  The reasons of the majority were agreed to in substance by
this Court.

 

57                              
The gravamen of Nelson is that an agreement or arrangement for
credit which is legal on its face cannot become illegal under s. 347  through
the voluntary act of the debtor.  Consumers’ Gas contends that this principle
precludes the application of s. 347  in the case at bar, because incurring and
paying the LPP are voluntary acts of the customer.  The motions judge accepted
the argument that Nelson is dispositive of this case and dismissed the
action on that basis.  The Ontario Court of Appeal agreed.  In particular, the
Court of Appeal noted that the decision in Nelson was affirmed by this
Court.  

 

58                              
The reasons in Dancorp, which are being released simultaneously
with this decision, revisit Nelson and set forth the following general
principles governing the interpretation of s. 347  (at para. 34):  

 








(1)   Section 347(1) (a) should be narrowly
construed.  Whether an agreement or arrangement for credit violates s. 347(1) (a)
is determined as of the time the transaction is entered into.  If the agreement
or arrangement permits the payment of interest at a criminal rate but
does not require it, there is no violation of s. 347(1) (a),
although s. 374(1)(b) might be engaged.                                       

 

(2)   Section 347(1) (b) should be broadly
construed.  Whether an interest payment violates s. 347(1) (b) is
determined as of the time the payment is received.  For the purposes of s.
347(1) (b), the effective annual rate of interest arising from a payment
is calculated over the period during which credit is actually outstanding. 

 

(3)   There is no violation of s. 347(1) (b)
where a payment of interest at a criminal rate arises from a voluntary
act of the debtor, that is, an act wholly within the control of the debtor and
not compelled by the lender or by the occurrence of a determining event set out
in the agreement. [Emphasis in original.]

 

59                              
Applying the first principle stated above, it is clear that there is no
violation of s. 347(1) (a) in this case.  The arrangement between
Consumers’ Gas and its customers does not, on its face, require the payment of
interest at a criminal rate.  The payment of such interest depends on the
occurrence of subsequent events.

 

60                              
With regard to s. 347(1) (b), Consumers’ Gas makes two arguments. 
First, it contends that a customer can avoid the LPP entirely by paying on
time, and therefore any customer who incurs the penalty does so voluntarily. 
Second, it contends that the amount of time which passes between the due date
and the actual payment of the LPP -- and therefore the effective rate of
interest arising from the penalty -- is entirely within the control of the
customer.  Consumers’ Gas submits that under the third principle stated above,
receipt of the LPP cannot constitute a violation of s. 347(1) (b).

  








61                              
The respondent’s assertion that customers “voluntarily” pay the LPP
is unpersuasive.  The prepayment of the mortgage in Nelson was a
voluntary act because it was wholly at the debtor’s initiative and was not
compelled by the lender’s demand or by a determining event set out in the
agreement.  A customer’s failure to pay the LPP by a named date is not
voluntary in the same sense.  The LPP is automatically triggered by an event
specified in the arrangement between the parties, i.e. the passage of time. 
The fact that the respondent consents to the possibility of late payment, and
thereby presents its customers with the option of paying before or after the
due date, does not mean that a customer “voluntarily” incurs the LPP when he or
she fails to pay on time.  A penalty is not “voluntary” simply because it could
conceivably be avoided through prompt payment.  If that were the case, then all
penalties could be considered voluntary, and the inclusion of the term
“penalty” in s. 347(2)  would become meaningless.  When a penalty is specified
in an agreement or arrangement for credit, the lender bears the risk that the
payment of that penalty might give rise to a violation of s. 347(1) (b). 


 

62                              
It is unnecessary, in the context of this appeal, to create a
general rule regarding which kinds of payments are “voluntary” within the
meaning of Nelson.  It bears noting in particular that the
“voluntariness” of certain automatic payment terms, such as acceleration
clauses triggered by the debtor’s default or insolvency, remains an open
question.  Some writers have suggested that a distinction should be drawn
between clauses which accelerate repayment automatically, and those which give
the lender the option of demanding repayment upon the occurrence of a stated
event.  In the latter case, it would be the lender’s demand which attracts s.
347 , and the lender could avoid liability by declining to accelerate
repayment.  See, e.g., Antle, supra, at p. 327.  In my view, such a
distinction is not required in this case, since the issue presented here
concerns a penalty -- which is provided for explicitly in s. 347  -- and not an
acceleration clause.  

 








63                              
The respondent’s second argument with regard to “voluntariness” presents
a closer question.  The actuarial evidence submitted in this case shows that if
a regular billing customer pays the LPP within 38 days of incurring it, the
five percent charge represents an annual interest rate exceeding 60 percent per
annum.  If the customer waits 38 days or longer to pay, the rate drops below
the criminal threshold.  The respondent submits that because the LPP does not
compound or increase over time, and because no further sanctions are imposed by
the company for late payment once the due date has passed, it is open to the
customer to pay the LPP at any time after it has been incurred, including after
the date when the interest rate arising from the penalty would no longer be
illegal.  It is claimed that to find liability under s. 347  in such
circumstances would offend the principle of “voluntariness” set forth in Nelson. 


64                              
This case is unlike Nelson in several important respects.  In Nelson,
the mortgage was not yet due when the debtor chose to repay it and he was presumably
under no pressure from the lender to pay early.  Here, by contrast, payment of
the monthly bill is overdue and the LPP is already owing at the time the
customer actually pays Consumers’ Gas; the question is not whether to pay
early, but rather how late is too late.  Because there is no specific
contractual term governing the time for payment after the imposition of the
LPP, technically it may be argued that there is an indefinite extension
of credit.  It is obvious, however, that that is not really the case -- the
customer does not have the option of never paying his or her bill. 
There is an implied limit to the term for which credit is extended, after which
the respondent will undertake to recover the money that is owed to it.  The
record does not disclose if or when Consumers’ Gas would actually sue a
customer for non-payment or discontinue service.  However, in one of its
informational brochures (“To Your Credit”), the respondent explains to its
customers the procedures which it employs for “collecting past due bills” (Case
on Appeal, at p. 687):

 

We send out a broad range of bill messages and notices to remind
customers to pay past due bills.  The sequence of bill messages and notices
depends upon a customer’s credit rating and the particular circumstances
surrounding the account.

 








The respondent
gives examples of “what happens if bills are not paid on time”, including the
following (Case on Appeal, at p. 688):

 

Probability of the gas supply being cut-off to severely overdue
accounts.  This will result in personal inconvenience, a service reconnection
charge  and a security deposit payment.

 

65                              
Strictly speaking, it is true that customers may delay their payment of
the LPP beyond 38 days, but there is clearly no invitation to do so, and it
would be disingenuous to conclude that customers actually perceive themselves
to be at liberty to wait that long.  Statistical evidence submitted by the
appellant strongly supports the opposite conclusion.  Approximately 81 percent
of late payers pay the penalty within 10 days of incurring it, that is, at an
effective rate of interest far beyond the criminal limit.  Consumers’ Gas and
the OEB have been aware of such statistics since at least 1988.  See E.B.R.O.
452, at pp. 325-26.  Indeed, the respondent tracks such statistics carefully
for the purpose of budgeting revenue collected under the LPP as a component of
its cash flow.  In light of these facts, it cannot be said that payment of the
LPP within 38 days is a “voluntary” act within the meaning of Nelson.  

 

66                              
For the foregoing reasons, the LPP charged by Consumers’ Gas comes
within the scope of s. 347  of the Criminal Code .

 

B.  Did the
motions judge err in awarding costs against Garland in his personal capacity?

 








67                              
 On September 13, 1995, Consumers’ Gas moved for an order
amending the formal judgment of the motions judge.  Garland refused to consent
to that motion.  The motion was granted, and the judge assessed $500 in costs
“payable to the defendant ...  by the plaintiff personally, forthwith”. 
Garland asserted that that award contravenes s. 59.4 of the Law Society Act,
which was added by s. 3 of the Law Society Amendment Act (Class Proceedings
Funding), 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 7.  

 

68                              
Section 59.4 provides:

 

59.4__(1)  A defendant to a
proceeding may apply to the board for payment from the Class Proceedings Fund
in respect of a costs award made in the proceeding in the defendant’s favour
against a plaintiff who has received financial support from the Class
Proceedings Fund in respect of the proceeding.

 

                                                                    ...

 

(3)  A defendant who has the right to apply for
payment from the Class Proceedings Fund in respect of a costs award against a
plaintiff may not recover any part of the award from the plaintiff.

 

The purpose of
this provision is to protect class representatives from personal exposure to
costs in actions where financial support has been granted by the Class
Proceedings Fund.  Such protection is important for promoting the purposes of
the Class Proceedings Act, 1992.  Garland has successfully applied for
support from the Class Proceedings Fund.  Accordingly, he should not be exposed
to personal liability for any costs arising in this action, including costs
incurred in the context of procedural motions.  The award of personal costs
against Garland is set aside.     

 

VI.  Conclusions
and Disposition

 








69                              
The appeal is allowed with costs in the cause.  (i) Section 347  of the Criminal
Code  applies to the LPP imposed by the respondent.  The LPP is an interest
charge within the meaning of s. 347(2) , and the law’s application is not
precluded by the principles set forth in the Nelson decision.  Summary
judgment is set aside, and this action is remitted to the Ontario Court
(General Division) for proceedings in accordance with the Class Proceedings
Act, 1992.  (ii) The award of costs in the amount of $500 against the
appellant in his personal capacity is set aside. 

 

The following
are the reasons delivered by

 

70                              
Bastarache J.  (dissenting)
-- The late payment policy of the Consumers’ Gas Company Limited provides that
bills rendered to residential customers which are not paid on the due date will
be subject to a penalty of five (5) percent of the unpaid amount.

 

71                              
Between 1981 and 1989, the late payment penalty policy clause contained
in Consumers’ rate schedules for residential customers read:

 

PENALTY FOR
LATE PAYMENT:

 

When payment in full is not made within sixteen (16) days of the date
of mailing, or the hand delivery of the bill, a penalty of five per cent (5%)
of the current amount billed shall be levied.  Where payment is made by mail,
payment will be deemed to be made on the date postmarked.

 

72                              
Commencing in 1989, the provision for late payment penalties was
contained in Consumers’ Handbook of Rates and Distribution Services as follows:

 

SECTION F -
PAYMENT CONDITIONS

 








Payment in
full should be received by the Company, or by an institution authorized by the
Company to accept payments on its behalf, on or before the due date specified
in the monthly bill, which date is at least ten (10) days (sixteen (16) days in
the case of Rates 1, 2, 6 and 9), after the date of rendering the bill.  A
penalty of five (5) percent of the unpaid portion of the current amount billed
shall be added to the amount due if payment is not received as outlined above. 
When payment is mailed, the penalty will be added if the postmark on the
envelope containing such payment is later than the specified due date.

 

73                              
It is the appellant’s position that Consumers’ Gas offers two payment
options to its customers, the no-credit option and the credit option.  By the
appellant’s reasoning, all customers who pay their bills on time adhere to the
no-credit option.  By contrast, customers who do not pay on time receive credit
commencing on the due date and ending when the bill is paid.  In my view, no
such option exists.  Customers have only one option, which is to pay on time. 
The only question remaining is then the characterization of the late payment
policy.

 

74                              
Section 347(2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
defines “interest” in these terms:

 

“interest” means the aggregate of all charges and expenses, whether in
the form of a fee, fine, penalty, commission or other similar charge or expense
or in any other form, paid or payable for the advancing of credit under an
agreement or arrangement, by or on behalf of the person to whom the credit is
or is to be advanced, irrespective of the person to whom any such charges and
expenses are or are to be paid or payable, but does not include any repayment
of credit advanced or any insurance charge, official fee, overdraft charge,
required deposit balance or, in the case of a mortgage transaction, any amount required
to be paid on account of property taxes;

 

75                              
The definition of interest includes the notion of “penalty”.  However,
the application of s. 347  is also predicated upon the existence of an
“agreement or arrangement” for the advancement of credit.  The term “agreement”
is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), as “an
arrangement between two or more persons as to a course of action”.  The term
“arrangement” is defined as a “settlement of mutual relations or claims between
parties”.

 








76                              
The application of s. 347  is then predicated upon a consensual extension
of credit.  There is a critical difference between, on the one hand, a
unilateral taking of credit and, on the other hand, an extension of credit by
mutual consent between the debtor and the creditor.  As R. M. Goode, in his
book Consumer Credit Law (1989), states, at p. 108:

 

If a person
takes credit without having been granted it — as where he is slow in paying his
dentist’s bill or his solicitor’s account — there is no extension of credit
within the Consumer Credit Act. . . .  [I]f a person allows
delay in settlement of a debt without binding himself to grant time to the
debtor, there is no agreement for credit.  This is so whether the delay in the
demand for payment arises from inadvertence or inactivity — as where the
supplier is simply dilatory in sending out his accounts — or is an intentional
indulgence, as where the supplier agrees to allow further time to pay or to
accept payment by instalments.  Only where this deferment is not just an
indulgence but contractual is there an agreement for credit
. . . .

 

77                              
On the facts of this case, there is no such consensual extension of
credit.  I believe that Consumers’ Gas has not entered into an agreement or
arrangement to give credit to the appellant or to any other customers who have
paid the late payment penalty.  Indeed, far from being a consensual extension
of credit, the respondent’s late payment penalty represents an effort to
prevent or deter customers from unilaterally taking credit.  It is simply a
penalty exacted by the respondent because the appellant has not paid his bills
on a timely basis.  To illustrate my view, here is a statement from an American
case:  Coffelt v. Arkansas Power & Light Co., 451 S.W.2d 881 (Ark.
1970), per Smith J., at p. 884:

 








The late charge, far from being an exaction of excessive interest for
the loan or forbearance of money, is in fact a device by which consumers are
automatically classified to avoid discrimination.  Its effect is to require
delinquent ratepayers to bear, as nearly as can be determined, the exact
collection costs that result from their tardiness in paying their bills.  The
appellant’s argument actually means in substance not that the utility company
be prevented from collecting excessive interest but that its customers who pay
their bills promptly be penalized by sharing the burden of collecting costs not
of their making.

 

See also State ex rel.
Utilities Commission v. North Carolina Consumers Council, Inc., 198 S.E.2d
98 (N.C. Ct. App. 1973).

 

78                              
In the present case, there is no agreement whereby the customers of
Consumers’ Gas are permitted or even encouraged to pay late.  Rather, customers
are encouraged to pay on time by the imposition of a penalty to be added to
payments which are overdue.

 

79                              
The decisions of the Ontario Energy Board approving the late payment
penalty confirm that the penalty is not “paid or payable for the advancing of
credit”.  Instead, the Ontario Energy Board considers it to be an incentive for
timely payment.  In fact, the Board specifically rejected the credit option in
its decision on the rate application in these terms (E.B.R.O. 302-II, September
4, 1975, at pp. 118-19):

 

. . . the
Board does not think that a monetary incentive for prompt payment is wrong in
principle.  Interest charged on over-due accounts on a daily basis has an
appeal on theoretical grounds, but it gives little incentive to pay by a named
date, gives little weight to collection costs and seems complicated.  If
interest is charged on a monthly basis, it is subject to the same
criticism. . . .

 

80                              
While this is not determinative of the issue, it is one of several
indicia to be considered in characterizing the late payment penalty.  Winkler
J., of the trial court, also considered the fact that the penalty is not
compounded; the penalty is a one-time payment which does not increase over
time; there is no sanction for the non-payment of the penalty; the penalty
triggers contemporaneously with the account becoming overdue.








 

81                              
Because in this case there is no consensual extension of credit, it
follows that the late payment penalty is not “paid or payable for the advancing
of credit under an agreement or arrangement” within the definition of
“interest”.  Section 347  of the Criminal Code  is not applicable and
therefore the action should be dismissed.  I adopt Winkler J.’s conclusion on
this issue, 22 O.R. (3d) 451, at p. 471:

 

I accept the
plaintiff’s argument that a deferral of payment constitutes credit.  However, I
do not agree that just because a customer does not pay on time [this] means
that there has been a deferral of payment or that credit has been advanced,
particularly where the company has done what it could to encourage the customer
to pay on time.  A distinction must be drawn between the situation in which a
customer fails to pay within a stipulated time, because of inadvertence, choice
or because he does not have the money, and the situation in which an agreement
is entered into whereby the lender of money or issuer of goods agrees to delay
its demand for payment, in exchange for the consideration of an additional
charge.  In my view, s. 347  is applicable only to the latter situation.  The
facts before me reveal the former situation.

 

82                              
Section 347  of the Criminal Code  cannot be interpreted as a
complete code for consumers.  The protection of consumers against such penalty
clauses cannot be done by way of an undue extension of these terms.  Other
options, such as to invalidate abusive penalty clauses, are available to
protect consumers.  I do not believe that a contract for the extension of
credit should be implied in every case where there is late payment pursuant to
a sale of goods.  This implication, in my view, is an interference with the
freedom to contract.  I would also note that in the present case, we are
dealing with a regulated industry and that a rate approval scheme has been
established with the specific purpose of protecting consumer interests.  To
limit the choice of means of the regulator by resorting to the criminal law
power is inappropriate and unwarranted.

 








83                              
For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Criminal law ‑‑ Criminal interest rate ‑‑
Criminal Code defining criminal interest rate as effective annual rate of
interest exceeding 60 percent of credit advanced under agreement or arrangement
‑‑ Developer receiving mortgage loan from trust company to finance
completion of construction project ‑‑ Debt to be repaid after 11
months but not in fact repaid for more than three years ‑‑ Whether
effective annual rate of interest should be calculated on basis of contractual
term of loan or period during which credit was actually outstanding ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 347(1) (b).

 








The appellant obtained a mortgage loan from the
respondent trust company to finance the completion of a construction project. 
The loan agreement required the appellant to pay substantial fees and bonuses
in addition to a conventional interest rate.  The term of the agreement was for
11 months, but the loan was not in fact repaid for more than three years.  The
appellant subsequently challenged the validity of the loan, claiming the trust
company had received payments of interest at a criminal rate, contrary to
s. 347(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .  Under s. 347(2),
“criminal rate” is defined as an effective annual rate of interest that exceeds
60 percent on the credit advanced under an agreement or arrangement, and
“interest” is defined as “the aggregate of all charges and expenses
. . . paid or payable for the advancing of credit under an agreement
or arrangement”.  In support of its contention, the appellant filed a
certificate stating that the bonuses, fees and interest received under the
mortgage loan produced an effective rate of interest exceeding 75 percent per
annum.  These calculations assumed a hypothetical repayment of the entire debt
on December 31, 1990, as contemplated in the loan agreement.  The trust company
submitted evidence establishing that when interest was calculated over the
period during which credit was actually outstanding, the effective rate fell
below 20 percent per annum.  The appellant’s claim was dismissed following a
summary trial.  The Court of Appeal affirmed that decision.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 








Section 347  of the Criminal Code  defines two
offences:  s. 347(1) (a) makes it illegal to enter into an agreement
or arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate, while s. 347(1) (b)
makes it illegal to receive a payment or partial payment of interest at a
criminal rate.  The claim in this appeal relates exclusively to s. 347(1) (b). 
Section 347(1) (a) should be narrowly construed.  That offence is
complete upon the formation of an agreement or arrangement for credit, and
provable by its terms.  Section 347(1) (a) is violated if a credit
agreement expressly imposes an annual rate of interest above 60 percent, or if
the agreement requires payment of interest charges over a period which
necessarily gives rise to an annual rate exceeding the legal limit.  Section
347(1) (b) should be broadly construed.  A payment of interest may be
illegal under s. 347(1) (b) even if the loan agreement under which
it is made did not itself violate s. 347(1) (a) at the time it was
entered into.  The relevant time frame for calculating the interest rate at
this stage in the analysis is the period over which credit is actually repaid. 
While in some cases this interpretation will require a wait‑and‑see
approach to determining the lender’s liability, a lender who enters into an
agreement to receive interest under ambiguous terms bears the risk that the
agreement, in its operation, may in fact give rise to a violation of
s. 347 .  Moreover, the principle established in Nelson, that a
transaction which is legal when entered into cannot become illegal under
s. 347  through a voluntary act of the debtor, protects the lender from
incurring such liability in circumstances that are beyond its control.

 

Assuming that the amounts deducted by the trust
company from its loan advances to the appellant were in fact payments of
interest within the meaning of s. 347(1)(b), the interest rate
arising from them would exceed the criminal limit only if calculated over the
contractual term of the loan, and not when based on the actual period of
repayment.  When calculated over the appropriate period, which is the more than
three years during which credit was actually outstanding, the interest payments
received by the trust company from the appellant do not constitute interest at
a criminal rate.  The voluntariness principle enunciated in Nelson has
no application here.

1                                  
Major J. --  This appeal
accompanies Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co., [1998] 3 S.C.R. 112, and
raises the interpretation of the “Criminal Interest Rate” provision in s. 347 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  

 

2                                  
The appellant obtained a mortgage loan from the respondent Metropolitan
Trust Company of Canada (“Metropolitan”) to finance the completion of a
construction project.  The loan agreement required the appellant to pay
substantial fees and bonuses in addition to a conventional interest rate.  The
term of the agreement was for 11 months, but the loan was not in fact repaid
for more than three years.  

 








3                                  
The appellant subsequently challenged the validity of the loan, claiming
the respondent had received payments of interest at a criminal rate, contrary
to s. 347(1)(b) of the Code.  The issue is whether the effective
annual rate of interest arising from the payments should be calculated on the
basis of the contractual term of the loan, or the period during which credit
was actually outstanding.

                   

I.  Factual
Background

 

4                                  
The appellant, Dancorp Developments Ltd. (“Dancorp”), owned and
developed a condominium project in Coquitlam, British Columbia.  The project
was initially financed by a mortgage obtained from Metropolitan for
$16,689,000.  On the date of that agreement, May 1, 1989, virtually all of the
condominium units had been presold to offshore buyers.  The presale contracts
stipulated that construction would be completed, and title transferred to the
purchasers, by December 31, 1990.  

 

5                                  
Construction began in mid-1989 to be finished by October 20, 1990. 
During the summer of 1989, a design defect was discovered which required the
partially completed project to be demolished and rebuilt.  This setback
increased construction costs and forced Dancorp to seek additional financing. 
Metropolitan initially refused to provide the extra money, particularly in
light of the increased risk that the project would not be completed by the
deadline contained in the presale agreements.  Dancorp did not obtain
alternative financing from other sources. 

 

6                                  
On January 10, 1990, following lengthy negotiations, Metropolitan agreed
to provide the additional funds to Dancorp to cover remedial costs and the
completion of the project.  The agreement between the parties contained the
following terms: 

 








(1)   Metropolitan agreed to advance up to $2.5
million to Dancorp.  Dancorp was entitled to draw down all, some or none of
those funds, according to its needs.  

 

(2)   The $2.5 million loan was secured by a
second mortgage with a face value of $3.25 million.  The difference between the
two amounts represented a 30 percent bonus to Metropolitan, to be deducted from
the gross amount of each loan advance.  That is, for every dollar of principal
drawn down by Dancorp, $1.30 of debt would be incurred against the mortgage. 

 

(3)   An additional bonus of 5 percent was payable
on any principal advanced in excess of $1.55 million, again to be deducted from
gross advances.    

 

(4)   Interest on all principal advanced was to be
calculated at the Bank of Nova Scotia prime rate plus 2 percent per annum,
compounded and payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month.

 

(5)   Dancorp agreed to pay a one-time “placement
and processing fee” of $77,500.

 

(6)   Dancorp agreed to pay the fees of
Metropolitan’s solicitors relating to the mortgage.

 

(7)   The mortgage was repayable in full on December 31, 1990.  

 








7                                  
Between January 17 and December 10, 1990, Dancorp received loan advances
more or less on a monthly basis.  Metropolitan deducted interest, bonuses and
legal fees from each gross advance.  Under the terms of the loan agreement,
those amounts were deemed to have been advanced to Dancorp before being
deducted, and were included in Dancorp’s debt under the mortgage.  Dancorp did
not, however, make any direct payments to Metropolitan during this period.  

 

8                                  
On December 27, 1990, for reasons which are not relevant to this appeal,
a receiver was appointed by Metropolitan to take over the project, and
construction was completed under the receiver’s control.  Proceeds from the
sale of the condominium units were used to pay the debt which had accrued under
the second mortgage loan.  The first of those payments was received by
Metropolitan on April 10, 1992, and the loan was fully repaid on January 29,
1993, more than two years after the contractual maturity date.  

 








9                                  
Dancorp subsequently challenged the validity of the second mortgage
loan, alleging that the amounts which Metropolitan had deducted from the loan
advances were illegal interest payments under s. 347(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code .  In support of that contention, Dancorp filed a certificate stating
the annual rate of interest, by Ian Karp, a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of
Actuaries.  Mr. Karp took into account the  actual amounts drawn down, and
based his calculations on the contractual term of the loan -- i.e., he assumed
a hypothetical repayment of the entire debt on December 31, 1990, as
contemplated in the loan agreement.  Based on that assumption, he concluded
that the bonuses, fees and interest received under the second mortgage loan
produced an effective rate of interest exceeding 75 percent per annum.  The
respondent submitted evidence establishing that when interest was calculated
over the period during which credit was actually outstanding, the effective
rate fell below 20 percent per annum.  For the purposes of this appeal, those
figures are presumed to be accurate. 

 

10                              
Dancorp’s claim under s. 347 of the Code was dismissed following
a summary trial.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed Dancorp’s
appeal.

Columbia Supreme Court (1994), 16 B.L.R. (2d) 188 

 

12                              
A summary trial was held before Preston J. in accordance with R. 18A of
the British Columbia Supreme Court Rules.  In the context of those proceedings,
Dancorp raised the claim that Metropolitan had violated s. 347(1) (b) of
the Criminal Code  by receiving payments of interest at a criminal rate
under the second mortgage loan.  The crucial question before the trial judge
was whether, for the purposes of s. 347(1) (b), the appropriate repayment
date to be used for calculating the interest rate of the loan was the payment
date contemplated in the agreement (December 31, 1990) or the date on which
repayment was actually completed (January 29, 1993).  








 

13                              
Preston J. considered Nelson v. C.T.C. Mortgage Corp. (1984), 16
D.L.R. (4th) 139 (B.C.C.A.), aff’d [1986] 1 S.C.R. 749, a case in which a
debtor had exercised a prepayment option on a mortgage, thereby shortening the
actual term of the loan and increasing the effective annual interest rate.  The
court in Nelson found that the rate of interest should be calculated
over the contractual term of the mortgage, not the period during which credit
was actually outstanding.  In addition, he noted that the criminal rate of
interest in that case resulted from the unilateral act of the debtor in paying
out the mortgage before it was due.  

 

14                              
Preston J. held that ss. 347(1) (a) and (b) created two
separate offences, one of entering into an agreement to receive interest at a
criminal rate, and the other of actually receiving interest at that rate.  He
found that the first offence is complete upon the entering into the agreement
and is provable by the terms of the agreement itself.  The actus reus of
the second offence, by contrast, is the actual receipt of payment or partial
payment of interest at a criminal rate.  The trial judge noted that no claim
for breach of subs. (1)(a) had been advanced by Dancorp, and that it was
unclear in any event whether the mortgage violated that provision, since the
amounts to be drawn down were not defined in advance.  With regard to subs.
(1)(b), the trial judge found that “receipt” of interest did not occur
until January 29, 1993.  He stated at p. 210:

 

[Counsel for Metropolitan] contends that receipt by
Metropolitan of interest payments is shown by the accounting entries which
credit Metropolitan with interest payments as the funds are advanced to
Dancorp.  That cannot be so.  Receipt of a payment or partial payment of
interest in subs. (b) must be given its normal meaning, that is: a
payment of interest by Dancorp to Metropolitan.

  

 








and concluded
that in the circumstances of this case, the period to be used for calculating
the interest rate under s. 347(1) (b) was the period during which credit
was actually outstanding.  Calculated on that basis, he held that Metropolitan
had not received interest at a criminal rate.  Dancorp’s claim under s. 347  was
dismissed.

 

B. British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1996), 21 B.C.L.R. (3d) 112

 

15                              
The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.  Newbury
J.A., writing for the court, assumed without deciding that the amounts deducted
by Metropolitan from the loan advances were interest payments within the
meaning of s. 347(1) (b).  She then considered what period of time should
be used to calculate the interest rate at which those payments were received,
and concluded that the appropriate time frame was the period during which
credit was outstanding.  She agreed with the trial judge that Metropolitan had
not received interest at a criminal rate.   

 

IV.  Issue

 

16               
For the purposes of s. 347(1) (b) of the Criminal Code ,
should the calculation of the effective annual rate of interest arising from a
loan be based on the contractual term of the loan or the period during which
credit was actually outstanding? 

 

V.  Analysis

 








17   
A general discussion of s. 347  of the Criminal Code  is included
in  Garland, supra, which was released with this decision. 
Section 347  provides that an interest rate exceeding 60 percent per annum is a
“criminal rate” of interest.  The statute defines two offences with regard to
such interest:  s. 347(1) (a) makes it illegal to enter into an
agreement or arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate, while s.
347(1) (b) makes it illegal to receive a payment or partial payment
of interest at a criminal rate.  The claim in this appeal relates exclusively
to the latter offence.  The issue is whether the Court of Appeal erred in
finding that a “criminal rate of interest” for the purposes of subs. (1)(b)
should be calculated by reference to the period over which credit was actually
repaid, as opposed to the contractual term of the loan.  

 

18   
The importance of the period of repayment results in part from the broad
definition of “interest” contained in s. 347 .  As discussed in Garland,
that definition includes not only common-law interest -- i.e., a price for
money which accrues day by day -- but also fixed payments, such as fees,
commissions and penalties, which may be incurred by a borrower for the
advancing of credit.  The effective annual interest rate which arises from such
payments is intrinsically related to the period of time during which credit is
actually extended.  A fee or commission paid over a short term will yield a
much higher rate of interest than the same amount paid over a longer period. 
The same holds true for an annual interest rate arising from a bonus or flat
percentage charge.

            

19   
For the purposes of s. 347(1) (a), the appropriate time period for
calculating an interest rate is the term of repayment set forth in the loan
agreement.  If that period produces a criminal rate of interest, then the
entire agreement is illegal on its face under subs. (1)(a).   

 








20   
Ascribing an interest rate to a “payment or partial payment of interest”
under subs. (1)(b), however, is more complicated.  In some cases, the
period over which a loan will actually be repaid is not clearly defined in
advance, for instance where the agreement grants a right of prepayment or
acceleration, or where the period of repayment simply differs in fact from what
was contemplated by the parties.  In either case, the period during which
credit is actually extended -- and therefore the  rate at which an interest
payment is actually received -- may vary from the rate which appears on the
face of the agreement, particularly where, as here, the transaction involves
substantial fees, commissions, penalties, or flat percentage charges such as
bonuses.  The question is whether liability under subs. (1)(b) should
reflect that variation in rates, or whether, as a matter of law, a “criminal
rate” of interest under subs. (1)(b) should be grounded in the same
contractual terms which govern liability under subs. (1)(a). 

 

A.  The
Nelson Decision

 

21   
The interpretation of s. 347  was addressed by the British Columbia Court
of Appeal in Nelson, supra.  The Nelsons were guarantors of a
commercial mortgage under which a number of fixed fees were payable in addition
to a conventional interest rate.  The mortgage was due after six months,
subject to the borrower’s right to prepay the entire loan at any time prior to
maturity.  Taken together, the fees and interest would have produced an
effective interest rate of 52.5 percent per annum had the mortgage been repaid
at the end of its full six-month term.  In fact, however, the borrower
exercised its prepayment option early in the life of the agreement, and the
resulting shorter term gave rise to an effective interest rate of 84.1 percent
per annum.  The Nelsons and the borrower subsequently sued the lender, alleging
that the mortgage exacted a criminal rate of interest contrary to s. 305.1 (now
s. 347 ) of the Criminal Code .  

 








22   
The issue in Nelson, as in the present appeal, was whether the
“effective annual rate of interest” arising from a mortgage should be based on
the contractual repayment date of the loan or the actual repayment date.  The
Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but were divided on the question.  The
majority, per Seaton J.A., held that the appropriate time frame was the
full term of the loan as set forth in the agreement.  In reaching that result,
the majority placed special emphasis on the fact that the actual period of
repayment in Nelson was within the control of the borrower.  Seaton J.A.
stated at p. 143: 

 

(1)        Any other interpretation would lead to
an absurd result.  For example, in a mortgage containing a prepayment option in
favour of the mortgagor, if the mortgage were paid off at an early date, the
amount of the legal fees alone, would in many cases exceed 60%.  Parliament
could not have intended that a mortgagee in such circumstances would be guilty of
an indictable offence.

 

(2)        It seems more consonant with reason that
the interest rate (including all the items spelled out in the definition of
interest) should be calculated over the term of the mortgage.  In other words,
the interest rate should be determined by the terms of the document and not by
the act of the borrower in paying off the mortgage.

 

The majority
held that in the context of a prepayment by the debtor, the calculation of an
interest rate should be the same under subss. (1)(a) or (1)(b) of
the statute.  Seaton J.A. wrote at pp. 144-45:

 

(4)  The construction proposed by the appellants
that the “effective annual rate of interest” be calculated over the period of
time that the mortgage is outstanding would mean that the meaning of “criminal
rate” in [s. 347(1) (a)] would be different from the meaning of “criminal
rate” in [s. 347(1) (b)].  The “agreement or arrangement” in [s. 347(1) (a)]
was to receive interest at a legal rate (interest over the term of the
mortgage).  If, however, the mortgage was prepaid prior to the end of the term,
as here, the respondent would be receiving a “payment of interest at a criminal
rate”.  Parliament cannot have intended that the words “criminal rate” have two
different meanings, within the same section or that an innocent mortgagee who
has entered into a perfectly lawful agreement should as the result of the
voluntary act of the mortgagor in prepaying the mortgage become guilty of an
offence under [s. 347(1) (b)].

 

The purpose of [s. 347 ] was to make unlawful agreements or arrangements
which require the borrower to pay interest at a “criminal” rate.  The
mortgage here does not require payment of interest at an unlawful rate.
The exercise of an option by a borrower does not, therefore, fall within [s.
347(1) (a) or (b)].

 

Section [347(1)(b)] was intended to catch those persons
receiving “interest at a criminal rate” where the agreement required the
borrower to pay “interest at a criminal rate” and thus the words “criminal
rate” have the same meaning in both paragraphs.  [Emphasis in original.]








 

The majority
recognized that the same conclusion might not follow in the case of a mortgage
payable “on demand or at the instance of the mortgagee on the happening of a
stated condition”, rather than at the debtor’s option (at p. 145).

 

23   
In dissent, Hutcheon J.A. emphasized the distinction between subss. (1)(a)
and (1)(b) of s. 347 .  In his view, subs. (1)(a) prohibits
entering into an agreement which, on its face, requires the payment of illegal
interest.  He agreed that such a situation was not before them.  However, he
parted company with the majority with respect to the purpose and operation of
subs. (1)(b).  He stated at pp. 150-51:

 

[W]hen the right of prepayment is exercised by payment, as it was in
this case, or a demand for payment is made, I think that [s. 347(1) (b)]
is applicable.  The question is: did the mortgagee receive a payment of
interest at a criminal rate?  That question is to be answered by an analysis of
what has been received in fact and a calculation based upon the period that has
elapsed since the money was advanced.

   

 

Hutcheon J.A.
concluded that the lender had violated subs. (1)(b) by receiving
interest at a rate exceeding 60 percent.

 

B. 
Revisiting Nelson: A Framework for Interpreting Section 347

 








24   
The reasons of the majority in Nelson were affirmed in substance
by this Court.  In the appellant’s submission, Nelson stands for the
principle that a “criminal rate” of interest under s. 347 must always be
calculated by reference to the contractual term of the loan.  Accordingly, it
submits that Nelson is dispositive of this appeal.  The appellant’s
interpretation is overly broad.  The holding of Nelson was that a
transaction which was legal when entered into cannot become illegal under s.
347 through a voluntary act of the debtor.  That conclusion was affirmed
by this Court.  Nelson does not exclude the possibility of a criminal
interest rate arising during the course of a loan at the initiative of the
lender or for other reasons.  Indeed, the majority in Nelson expressly
recognized such a possibility in the context of a demand mortgage.

 

25   
The Nelson decision is not a comprehensive framework for
interpreting s. 347.  In particular, it did not consider those credit
agreements which, though legal in form, may become usurious in practice.  A
complete understanding of s. 347 must address the operation of the law as a
whole, and in particular should recognize the different purposes served by
subss. (1)(a) and (1)(b).  As noted in Garland at para.
54: 

 

The relationship between these two provisions has been the subject of
much comment in the courts below and in academic writings.  In particular,
controversy exists about whether an agreement which does not expressly require
the payment of criminal interest at the time it is entered into may
nevertheless give rise to an actual payment of interest at an illegal rate. 
Such cases can arise if an additional charge is incurred while credit is
outstanding, or if the actual period for repayment is shortened by the
occurrence of a determining event or an act by one of the parties.

 








26   
The appellant contends that subs. (1)(b) prohibits the receipt of
interest if the loan agreement, on its face, requires such interest to
be paid at a criminal rate.  In its view, subss. (1)(a) and (1)(b)
define two parts of a single offence, namely, creating an illegal agreement and
then collecting its fruits.  The appellant maintains that the “criminal rate”
of interest underlying those two acts must be calculated in the same way under
subss. (1)(a) and (1)(b) -- i.e., by reference to the contractual
term of the loan. The appellant’s approach would have the advantage of
promoting clarity and consistency in the application of s. 347.  A legal credit
transaction would remain legal regardless of subsequent events, thus permitting
lenders to predict and avoid criminal liability with confidence.  At the same
time, a transaction which violates subs. (1)(a) would remain illegal
throughout its duration, and the receipt of any interest under it would
immediately trigger liability under subs. (1)(b) as well.  The appellant
submits that it would be anomalous to have to await the full repayment of a
loan before an interest payment could be identified as illegal under subs. (1)(b).

 

27   
The flaw in such an approach is that it would render subs. (1)(b)
virtually meaningless, as it would be impossible for a lender to violate that
provision without first having violated subs. (1)(a).  In effect, the
act of entering into an illegal credit agreement would be the sine qua non
of both crimes.  In such circumstances, lenders would inevitably be encouraged
to draft credit agreements with open or ambiguous terms, so as to accelerate
repayment or trigger the bulk of interest charges during the course of the
loan.  Unless such transactions could somehow be brought within the scope of
subs. (1)(a), they would escape the reach of s. 347 entirely.  Such a
result would defeat the basic purpose of the statute, which is to prohibit the
imposition of usurious interest rates without regard to the form of the
transaction.  See Garland, supra, at para. 28; William E.
Thomson Associates Inc. v. Carpenter (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 545 (C.A.), at
pp. 548-49.  For that reason, the appellant’s interpretation fails.

 

28   
The respondent submits that subss. (1)(a) and (1)(b) are
separate and independent provisions:  the first targets transactions that are
inherently illegal, and the second catches transactions that are illegal in
their operation.  In the respondent’s submission, subs. (1)(b) may be
violated even if the “criminal rate” at which an interest payment is received
is not ascertainable as such on the face of the loan agreement.  This
interpretation was adopted by the trial judge, who held (at pp. 209-10):

 

 

[Section] 347(1) creates two offences:

 








1.  The offence of entering into an agreement or arrangement to receive
interest at a criminal rate.  The actus reus of this offence is the
entering into the agreement or arrangement. . . . 

 

2.  The receipt of a payment or partial payment of interest at a
criminal rate.  The actus reus of this offence is receiving the payment or
partial payment.

  

This approach
provides a coherent framework for the interpretation of s. 347.  For the
purposes of subs. (1)(a), the relevant question is: “what rate of
interest does the agreement require?”  For subs. (1)(b), the
question is: “at what rate of interest has a payment actually been received?” 
As the respondent contends, a payment of interest may be illegal under subs.
(1)(b) even if the loan agreement under which it is made did not itself
violate subs. (1)(a) at the time it was entered into. 

 

29   
It follows from the foregoing that s. 347(1) (a) should be
narrowly construed.  That offence is complete upon the formation of an
agreement or arrangement for credit, and provable by its terms.  As Borins J.,
then of the Ontario Court (General Division), observed in Aectra Refining
& Marketing Inc. v. Lincoln Capital Funding Corp. (1991), 6 O.R. (3d)
146, at p. 150: 

 

 

. . . the critical time at which a lender commits an offence contrary
to s. 347(1) (a) . . . is when the lender “enters into an agreement . . .
to receive interest”.  It is at that time that the court must determine whether
the rate of “interest”, which is very broadly defined in s. 347(2), provided
for by the agreement constitutes the “criminal rate” which is also defined in
s. 347(2).

 








Subsection
(1)(a) is violated if a credit agreement expressly imposes an annual
rate of interest above 60 percent, or if the agreement requires payment of
interest charges over a period which necessarily gives rise to an annual rate
exceeding the legal limit.  See, e.g., R. v. Duzan (1993), 79 C.C.C.
(3d) 552 (Sask. C.A.).  However, if there is merely a possibility that
the rate of interest could become illegal under the agreement, subs. (1)(a)
is not violated.  That case can arise where the period of repayment is subject
to change, or where a substantial interest charge is payable on demand or upon
the occurrence of a named event.  On the face of the agreement, there is no requirement
of criminal interest in such cases; the effective annual rate of interest
remains speculative until the actual amount of interest and the actual period
of repayment are known.  

 

30   
It is the function of subs. (1)(b) to catch violations of s. 347
in those circumstances.  The provision must be construed broadly enough to
account for interest payments that are actually received by the lender at a
criminal rate.  The relevant time frame for calculating the interest rate at
this stage in the analysis is the period over which credit is actually repaid. 
As Newbury J.A. stated for the Court of Appeal at p. 133:

 

On balance . . . I am persuaded that since the essence of [subs. (1)(b)]
is the receipt of interest -- a matter of fact -- it would not be
sensible to employ, in calculating the interest rate under that subparagraph, a
period that was not in fact the period during which the credit was
outstanding.  No authority has been cited for a “hybrid” construction of the
provision that would combine the factual aspect of receipt with the
hypothetical aspect of the repayment date stated in the loan documents.
[Emphasis in  original.]

 

It is true
that in some cases, this interpretation will require a wait-and-see approach to
determining the lender’s liability.  The appellant contended that such a result
would be inconsistent with basic principles of criminal law.  I disagree.  A
lender who enters into an agreement to receive interest under ambiguous terms
bears the risk that the agreement, in its operation, may in fact give rise to a
violation of s. 347.  The principle in Nelson protects the lender from
incurring such liability in circumstances that are beyond its control.  As
previously noted, to tailor subs. (1)(b) to the form, rather than the
substance, of a credit transaction could invite manipulation by lenders and
would defeat the basic purpose of s. 347. 

 








31   
Subsections 347(1)(a) and (1)(b) create separate but
complementary offences.  The provisions are not mutually exclusive.  An
agreement which is illegal under subs. (1)(a) may in many cases also
give rise to liability under subs. (1)(b).  This will always be the case
where the interest rate does not depend on the actual term of the loan.  The
receipt of any “payment” or “partial payment” of interest in such cases would
immediately constitute a violation of subs. (1)(b).  

 

32   
Where a time factor is present, it is not possible to calculate a
“criminal rate” of interest under subs. (1)(b) until the lender has been
fully repaid and the actual term of the loan has then been defined.  In those
cases, subss. (1)(a) and (1)(b) operate independently.  A loan
which violates subs. (1)(a) will also violate subs. (1)(b) if
payments are received as contemplated in the agreement; if the actual period of
repayment is sufficiently prolonged, however, the transaction -- though still
illegal under subs. (1)(a) -- will not give rise to additional liability
under subs. (1)(b).  

 

33   
If a loan agreement permits but does not require the payment of illegal
interest, there is no breach of subs. (1)(a), and the analysis shifts to
whether a payment of illegal interest was in fact received by the lender. 
Liability under subs. (1)(b) may arise during the course of the loan, so
long as it does not result from the voluntary act of the borrower.  By the same
token, the lender may be released from liability entirely in cases where a
charge has been paid over such a long period of time that the resulting
interest rate does not exceed the criminal limit. 

 

C.  Summary
of Applicable Principles

 

34   
For the foregoing reasons, s. 347 should be interpreted according to the
following general principles:








 

 

(1)  Section 347(1) (a) should be narrowly
construed.  Whether an agreement or arrangement for credit violates s. 347(1) (a)
is determined as of the time the transaction is entered into.  If the agreement
or arrangement permits the payment of interest at a criminal rate but
does not require it, there is no violation of s. 347(1) (a),
although s. 347(1) (b) might be engaged.     

 

(2)  Section 347(1) (b) should be broadly
construed.  Whether an interest payment violates s. 347(1) (b) is
determined as of the time the payment is received.  For the purposes of s.
347(1) (b), the effective annual rate of interest arising from a payment
is calculated over the period during which credit is actually outstanding. 

 

(3)  There is no violation of s. 347(1) (b)
where a payment of interest at a criminal rate arises from a voluntary
act of the debtor, that is, an act wholly within the control of the debtor and
not compelled by the lender or by the occurrence of a determining event set out
in the agreement.  

 

D. 
Application to the Case at Bar      

 








35   
As noted, s. 347(1) (a) was not raised in this appeal, and there
is no need to assess whether the mortgage, on its face, would have violated
that provision.  Dancorp’s claim is that Metropolitan violated s. 347(1) (b)
by actually receiving payments of interest at a criminal rate under the second
mortgage loan.  Assuming, as the Court of Appeal did, that the amounts deducted
by Metropolitan from its loan advances to Dancorp were in fact “payments of
interest” within the meaning of subs. (1)(b), it is common ground that
the interest rate arising from them would exceed the criminal limit only if
calculated over the contractual term of the loan, and not when based on the
actual period of repayment.  The appropriate time frame for calculating the
rate of interest under subs. (1)(b) is the period during which credit is
actually outstanding.  Calculated over that period -- i.e., more than three
years -- the interest payments received by Metropolitan from Dancorp do not
constitute interest at a criminal rate.

 

36   
The “voluntariness” principle enunciated in Nelson has no
application in this appeal.  It is true that, as in Nelson, the
effective annual rate of interest here was changed by the voluntary act of the
borrower.  However, that is where the similarity ends.  The rationale of Nelson
was that a lender who has entered into a lawful agreement should not, as the
result of the voluntary act of the debtor, be guilty of a criminal offence. 
That danger is not present in this case.  On the contrary, the effect of the
debtor’s voluntary act here was to release the lender from liability
where an illegal rate of interest might otherwise have arisen under subs. (1)(b). 
Any attempt to apply the Nelson rule in this case would require turning
that rule on its head.

  

37   
For these reasons, we agree with the decision of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal and the appeal is dismissed with costs.

Two women were murdered some two-and-a-half years
apart in the same city and in similar circumstances. 

 

The accused was arrested after the first murder.  He
gave the investigating officers scalp and pubic hair samples when asked if he
was interested in helping them eliminate him as a suspect.  The samples were to
be used to determine whether any of his hair was found where the victim was
found and he was released when none matched the samples taken from the victim’s
coat.  (Use for DNA analysis was not contemplated at the time.)  The officer
advised him that any evidence gathered as a result of the hair sample would be
used in court.

 








During the investigation of the second murder, the
accused refused to provide samples for DNA testing.  Cigarette butts belonging
to him, however, were taken after his police interview, analysed as to DNA
composition and found to match the semen fraction taken from the second
victim.  The scalp and pubic hairs taken from the accused during the first
murder investigation were analysed as to DNA composition and found to match the
analysis of the cigarette butts and the semen. The accused was arrested and
charged with the first degree murder of the second victim and then re‑arrested
and charged with the first degree murder of the first victim as well.

 

Defence counsel twice unsuccessfully applied to sever
the two murder counts in the indictment, before the trial and at the end of a
lengthy voir dire.  Counsel also objected to the admissibility of the
samples taken and used by the police for DNA analysis and the DNA evidence
itself.  The evidence was ruled admissible.  A jury convicted the accused on
both counts.  His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

 

Two principal issues arose here.  First, whether a
jury, to draw conclusions from similar fact evidence, was to be satisfied on a
civil or criminal standard of proof that the same person committed the acts in
question, and if the civil standard applied, whether the principles of
fundamental justice (s. 7 ) and the right to be presumed innocent
(s. 11 (d)) in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
would be offended.   Second, did the admission into evidence of hair samples
obtained by consent for one police investigation and used in connection with
the separate later investigation offend the accused’s right to be free from
unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed in ss. 7  and 8  of the Charter ?

 








Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

In considering whether similar
fact evidence should be admitted the basic question to be determined is whether
the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect. Therefore, in cases where
identity is at issue and the accused is shown to have committed acts with a
striking similarity to the alleged crime the jury is not asked to infer from
the accused’s habits or disposition that he or she is the type of person who
would commit the crime.  Instead the jury is asked to infer from the
distinctiveness or uniqueness that exists between the manner in which the crime
under consideration was committed and the similar act that the accused is the
very person who committed the crime.  This inference is made possible only if
the high degree of similarity between the acts renders the likelihood of
coincidence objectively improbable.  Once this preliminary determination is
made, the evidence related to similar fact (or count, in a multi-count
indictment) may be admitted to prove the commission of another act (or count).

 








Several suggestions were put forward to assist judges
in their approach to similar fact evidence.  Where similar fact evidence is
adduced to prove identity, a high degree of similarity between the acts is
required since in order to be admissible the similar fact evidence must have
the requisite probative value necessary to outweigh its prejudicial effect. 
The similarity between the acts may consist of a unique trademark or signature
on a series of significant similarities.  In assessing the similarity of the
acts, the trial judge should only consider the manner in which the acts were
committed and not the evidence as to the accused’s involvement in each act. 
There may well be exceptions but as a general rule, if upon assessing the
similarity of the acts in this manner, the trial judge is satisfied that there is
such a degree of similarity between the acts that they were likely committed by
the same person, the similar fact evidence will ordinarily have sufficient
probative force to outweigh its prejudicial effect and may be admitted.  The
jury will then be able to consider all the evidence related to the alleged
similar acts in determining the accused’s guilt for any one act.  The test for
admissibility of similar fact evidence adduced to prove identity is the same
whether the alleged similar acts are definitively attributed to the accused, or
are the subject of a multi‑count indictment against the accused.

 

Where the similar acts are alleged as part of a multi‑count
indictment, the consideration of the admissibility of similar fact evidence
must be taken into account in deciding whether the counts should be severed.  A
motion to sever must be brought by the accused, who bears the burden of
establishing on a balance of probabilities that the interests of justice
require an order for severance.  The burden of demonstrating that similar fact
evidence should be admitted must be borne by the Crown.

 

Where the similar fact evidence adduced to prove
identity suggests that the same person committed the similar acts, then
logically this finding makes the evidence linking the accused to each similar
act relevant to the issue of identity for the offence being tried. Similarly,
in a multi‑count indictment, the link between the accused and any one
count will be relevant to the issue of identity on the other counts which
disclose a striking similarity in the manner in which those offences were
committed.

 








A link between the accused and the alleged similar
acts is also a precondition to admissibility.  The evidence linking the accused
to the similar acts does not have to link the acts to the accused as well. 
Once the trial judge has concluded that the similar acts were likely committed
by one person and there is evidence linking the accused to the acts it is not
necessary to conclude that the acts were likely committed by the accused.  This
question must be determined by the trier of fact on the basis of all the
evidence relating to the acts.  Evidence of mere opportunity showing no more
than the possibility that the similar act is that of the accused will not
suffice to show the accused’s participation in the alleged similar act.

 

The proper standard to apply to the primary inference
drawn from the similar fact evidence is proof on a balance of probabilities. 
Since the probative value of similar fact evidence, as circumstantial evidence,
lies in the unlikelihood of coincidence, it simply does not make sense to
require one of the allegations to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt as a
prerequisite to the trier of fact’s consideration of it.  Though the similar
fact evidence, standing alone, may fall short of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, it can be relied upon to assist in proving another allegation beyond a
reasonable doubt.  (The general rule that preliminary findings of fact may be
determined on a balance of probabilities is departed from in those certainly
rare occasions when admission of the evidence may itself have a conclusive
effect with respect to guilt.)   The correct approach to a consideration of
similar fact evidence by a jury is therefore the “cumulative” or “pooling”
approach.  Thus, as a general rule where similar fact evidence is adduced
to prove identity, the jury should be instructed that once they have concluded
that there is sufficient likelihood that the same person committed the alleged
similar acts, they may consider all the evidence relating to the similar acts
in considering whether the accused is guilty of the act in question. 

 

The following should be included in a proper charge to
the jury where similar fact evidence is admitted to prove identity in a multi‑count
indictment situation:

  

(1) The trial judge should instruct the jury that they
may find from the evidence, though they are not required to do so, that the
manner of the commission of the offences is so similar that it is likely they
were committed by the same person.

  








(2) The judge should then review the similarities
between the offences.

   

(3) The jury should then be instructed that if they
conclude it is likely the same person committed more than one of the offences,
then the evidence on each of those counts may assist them in deciding whether
the accused committed the other similar count or counts.

  

(4) The trial judge must instruct the jury that if it
accepts the evidence of the similar acts, it is relevant for the limited
purpose for which it was admitted. 

 

(5) The jury must be warned that they are not to use
the evidence on one count to infer that the accused is a person whose character
or disposition is such that he or she is likely to have committed the offence
or offences charged in the other count or counts.  

 

(6) If they do not conclude that it is likely the same
person committed the similar offences, they must reach their verdict by
considering the evidence related to each count separately, and put out of their
minds the evidence on any other count or counts. 

 

(7) Finally, the trial judge must make it clear that
the accused must not be convicted on any count unless the jury are satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she is guilty of that offence.

 








The trial judge’s charge to the jury that, if they
concluded both counts were likely committed by the same person, they could use
the evidence on each count to assist in deciding the appellant’s guilt on both
counts does not offend s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Charter . 
The additional charge instructing the jury to decide whether the appellant was
guilty of the second murder and to decide whether both counts were committed by
one person before using the evidence on both counts in respect of either count
could not have prejudiced the accused. 

 

If consent to the provision of bodily samples is to be
valid it must be an informed consent. Yet if neither the police nor the
consenting person limit the use which may be made of the evidence then, as a
general rule, no limitation or restriction should be placed on the use of that
evidence.  The obligation imposed on the police in obtaining a valid consent
extends only to the disclosure of those anticipated purposes known to the
police at the time the consent was given.  In the absence of any limitation
placed by the police or the consenting party on the use to be made of the hair
sample, there is nothing inherently unfair or illegal about the police
retaining evidence obtained in connection with one investigation and using it
in connection with a later investigation which was not anticipated by the
police at the time the consent was given. Once the accused’s hair samples were
taken by the police with his unconditional and reasonably informed consent, he
ceased to have any expectation of privacy in them.  It was not necessary to
consider whether the accused may have had a subsisting privacy interest in the
samples or in the information that could be obtained from them after he gave
his unconditional consent to the authorities to take the samples.

1                                  
Cory J. --  There are two
principal issues raised in this appeal.  First, should a jury be instructed
that they may draw conclusions from similar fact evidence on a balance of
probabilities?  The appellant contends that such an instruction offends the
principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and the right to be presumed innocent under
s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

2                                  
Second, does the admission into evidence of hair samples obtained by
consent for one police investigation and used in connection with a separate
investigation two-and-a-half years later offend the appellant’s right to be
free from unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed in ss. 7  and 8  of the
Charter ?

 

I.  Factual Background

 

3                                  
Marnie Blanchard was last seen at approximately 2:00 a.m. on
November 22, 1989, standing alone outside a bar in Prince George, British
Columbia.  A taxi driver saw a lone male driver of what he believed was a small
grey Toyota or Nissan pickup truck pull up beside Marnie Blanchard.  He saw
that the driver of the truck had black shoulder‑length hair and some hair
on the side of his face.  He observed Ms. Blanchard hesitate and then get
into the truck, which drove away.

 








4                                  
Almost three weeks later, a cross‑country skier found a human
jawbone in a clearing approximately 10 kilometres from downtown Prince George. 
Police later found a skull and various human bones in the clearing.  The
remains had been disturbed by animals, and as a result medical examiners were
unable to establish a cause of death.  A pathologist testified that there had
been no pre‑death injury to the bones.  A comparison of dental records
established the identity of the body as that of Marnie Blanchard.

 

5                                  
Police also discovered Ms. Blanchard’s coat, sweater and a piece of
nylon pantyhose in a pile.  The remainder of her clothes, as well as portions
of clothing and personal possessions were scattered around the clearing.  There
was evidence that a sharp‑edged implement had been used to cut some of
the clothing (the skirt in the area of the zipper and the camisole) and that
the victim’s sweater had been extensively damaged by cutting or tearing.  A
hair and fibre analyst also testified that animal chewing could have caused
some of the damage to the clothes.

 

6                                  
The Crown’s forensic pathologist expressed the opinion that the death
was the result of homicidal violence for three reasons: the clothing had been
cut and torn, then placed where it was found; the area was remote; the
skeletonization of the bones and scattering by animal activity did not fit with
a natural death.

 








7                                  
Thorone Fontaine, an acquaintance of the appellant, testified that he
went out drinking with the appellant one evening in November 1989, though he
was not sure of the date.  When the appellant dropped off Mr. Fontaine at the
end of the evening, he noticed that the appellant drove back downtown, the
opposite direction to where he lived.  The next day the appellant went to Mr.
Fontaine’s home and told him that he had arrived home late because he had
picked up a young woman and driven her to Vanderhoof.  The appellant told Mr.
Fontaine that when he dropped her off, the woman had left some jewellery on his
dashboard.  Mr. Fontaine observed that the sleeve around the gear shift in the
appellant’s truck was damaged and that the arm controlling the signal switch
and windshield wipers was broken.

 

8                                  
Evidence was given by Sharon Olson, another acquaintance of the
appellant, that on or about November 22, 1989, the appellant told her that he
had dropped off a friend with whom he had been drinking, and then picked up an
attractive blonde woman and drove her home.  He gave Ms. Olson the impression
that he had had sex with the woman and that she had given him jewellery in
exchange.  He told Ms. Olson that his common-law wife found the jewellery in
his pocket.  Arlene Spencer, another acquaintance, testified that on or about
November 23, 1989, the appellant also told her that the night before he had
picked up a girl and had driven her to Vanderhoof.  She did not have the money
she had promised him for gas, so she gave him some jewellery instead.  The
appellant had said his wife was upset when she found the jewellery in his
pocket.

 

9                                  
On April 18, 1990, police searched a grey Nissan pickup truck registered
in the name of the appellant’s common-law wife.  In the driver’s door pocket
they found a double‑edged knife with a four‑inch blade.  Under the
passenger seat they found a small silver ring that was later identified as Ms.
Blanchard’s by several of her friends.  In searching the pickup, the officers
also recovered two small purple fibres from the carpet underneath the passenger
seat area, and they cut out a section of the carpeting.  A hair and fibre
expert testified that he examined those fibres and others he extracted from the
carpet.  He compared them to Ms. Blanchard’s sweater found in the clearing with
her remains.  He concluded that the fibres taken from the vehicle were
consistent with the fibres used in the manufacture of the purple sweater.








 

10                              
On July 26, 1990, the appellant was arrested for the second degree
murder of Ms. Blanchard.  The appellant was advised of his Charter 
rights and given an opportunity to call a lawyer.  After his call to a lawyer,
the appellant told police that he had been advised not to say anything. 
Nevertheless, the officers questioned the appellant for approximately 25 minutes,
during which the appellant insisted that he did not pick up a girl in
November.  One of the officers then asked the appellant if he would be
interested in helping them eliminate him as a suspect.  The appellant replied,
“That would be great with me” and agreed to give scalp and pubic hair samples. 
He was informed that the samples would be used to determine whether any of his
hair was found where Ms. Blanchard’s body was discovered.  He acknowledged that
he did not have to give this sample.  The officer further informed the
appellant that if he gathered any evidence as a result of the hair sample, it
would be used in court.

 

11                              
It is common ground that the investigating officers did not contemplate
using the hair samples for DNA analysis; the use of the technology was not
common in July 1990.  The hair samples were forwarded to the RCMP forensic
laboratory in Vancouver for physical comparisons with hairs found at the scene
where Ms. Blanchard’s body was discovered.  The appellant’s hair did not match
with 16 hair samples taken from Ms. Blanchard’s coat and other items.

 

12                              
Following a preliminary inquiry into the charge for the murder of Marnie
Blanchard, the provincial court judge declined to commit the appellant for
trial.  He was discharged and released on December 17, 1990.

 








13                              
On February 13, 1993, Theresa Umphrey arrived in Prince George and drank
with friends at several pubs.  Between 2:20 and 3:40 a.m. on February 14 she
was seen near a convenience store.  She was intoxicated.  She asked some men
for a ride home and they drove her around, but when she was unable to identify
where she lived, they returned her to the vicinity of the convenience store. 
At approximately 2:30 p.m. on February 14, Ms. Umphrey’s nude, partially
frozen body was found on a snowbank approximately 50 kilometres southwest of
Prince George.

 

14                              
The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on the body of
Ms. Umphrey testified that death was caused by manual strangulation and
then ligature strangulation.  The ligature marks were consistent with being
caused by shoelaces such as those found at the scene.  There were numerous
scrapes on her body consistent with having been dragged over a rough surface. 
Her skull was severely crushed.  A portion of her hair close to the scalp wound
had been cut short with a sharp instrument such as scissors or a knife.  The
pathologist confirmed that Ms. Umphrey had sexual intercourse some time during
the last 24 to 28 hours of her life, based on sperm found in her vaginal
cavity.  There was no physical evidence of sexual assault.  Semen was also
found on Ms. Umphrey’s sweatshirt.

 

15                              
Most of Ms. Umphrey’s clothes were found at the scene scattered down the
embankment near her body in a pattern consistent with having been thrown.  Her
brassiere was found at the side of the road 1.4 kilometres north of her body. 
An RCMP expert in fibre analysis and damage to fabrics testified that the
brassiere was cut apart between the cups and knotted at the back where it is
normally fastened.  One of the shoelaces was also cut.  The cuts had been made
by a sharp‑edged instrument.  Other articles of Ms. Umphrey’s clothing
did not disclose any evidence of damage.

 








16                              
While out of custody and prior to being charged, the appellant was
interviewed by the police on several occasions.  During the last interview, a
police officer told the appellant that some human tissue not belonging to Ms.
Umphrey had been found on her body and asked the appellant to provide samples
for DNA testing.  The officer said they were in the process of comparing the
appellant’s hair sample taken in 1990 to the human tissue sample taken from the
body of Ms. Umphrey.  The appellant refused to give samples for DNA testing.

 

17                              
During the interview, the appellant had been allowed to smoke several of
his own cigarettes.  After the interview, an officer returned to the interview
room and gathered the butts of the cigarettes that the appellant had been
smoking and which he had placed in an ashtray.  A few days later, an officer
executed a search warrant at the RCMP forensic laboratory in Vancouver and took
possession of the appellant’s scalp and pubic hairs that had been taken from
him on July 26, 1990.

 

18                              
Barbara Fraser, a forensic biology specialist employed at the RCMP
forensic laboratory found there was a five‑probe visual match between the
pubic hairs obtained from the appellant on July 26, 1990, the cigarette butts
retrieved from the interview room and the semen fraction located in the vagina
of Ms. Umphrey and the semen fraction located on her sweater.  Ms. Fraser
explained in her testimony that a five‑probe match occurs when there is a
match between five different regions in two samples of DNA.  A five-probe match
is an extremely rare event to occur between unrelated individuals.  Based on
these results, Ms. Fraser expressed the opinion that this frequency of
occurrence in the Canadian Caucasian population was less than one in 31
billion.

 








19                              
Ms. Fraser also compared the DNA from the cigarette butts with DNA from
the blood of the appellant’s natural mother and father over five probes.  The
analysis showed that the rules of inheritance were followed, with one of the
appellant’s DNA bands matching one of his father’s DNA bands and the other
matching one of his mother’s DNA bands.  Ms. Fraser concluded that in her
opinion it was 30 million times more likely that the DNA in the semen samples
came from a biological child of the appellant’s parents than from an individual
selected randomly from the Canadian population.

 

20                              
On October 4, 1993, the appellant was arrested and charged with the
first degree murder of Theresa Umphrey.  The appellant was also re‑arrested
and charged with the first degree murder of Marnie Blanchard.

 

21                              
Prior to trial, defence counsel twice applied to sever the two murder
counts in the indictment.  These applications were refused.  Counsel also
objected to the admissibility of the samples taken and used by the police for
DNA analysis and the DNA evidence itself.  The evidence was ruled admissible. 
A jury convicted the appellant of the two counts of first degree murder.  His
appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

 

II.  Judgments Below

 

A.  Supreme Court of British Columbia, [1995] B.C.J.
No. 882 (QL), (Parrett J.)

 

1.    The Rulings on
Severance

 








22                              
On October 13, 1994, the appellant applied under s. 591(3) (a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , to sever the two
murder counts.  The trial judge noted that on such an application, the onus is
on the accused to show that the interest of justice requires severance.  The
defence pointed to the discharge of the appellant at the preliminary inquiry into
the Blanchard murder in 1990, and submitted that the Crown was attempting to
use the similar fact evidence of the Umphrey murder to establish primarily that
Ms. Blanchard’s death was the result of homicide.  Defence counsel argued there
was no precedent for this use of similar fact evidence.  The defence further
submitted that there was no nexus in time between the two murders, that there
are numerous differences between the two events, and that the similarities that
do exist are not unique.

 

23                              
The Crown opposed the application and asserted that even in the case of
severance, it would seek to adduce the evidence of each offence in the other
trial as similar fact evidence.  The Crown conceded that unless the evidence
concerning the Umphrey murder was admissible to establish that the accused
committed the Blanchard murder, there should be a severance of the two counts. 
However, the Crown argued that there were many similarities between the two
events indicative of pattern and design.

 

24                              
The trial judge noted that medical examiners were unable to determine
the cause of Ms. Blanchard’s death.  He noted that her clothing was found near
her body and that some of it was torn and some of it appeared to have been cut
with a sharp instrument such as a knife.  The trial judge found it was a fair
inference that Ms. Blanchard’s death was not natural and that her clothing
had been removed prior to her body’s being left in the snow.

 








25                              
The trial judge reviewed the evidence related to the murder of Theresa
Umphrey.  The trial judge noted that the Crown submitted the crimes were
similar in that the victims were young single females who were vulnerable and
who were without funds or transportation in the early morning hours; there was
evidence that each was picked up by the accused in a grey pickup truck; the
Umphrey case clearly involved sexual intercourse, while in the Blanchard murder
a sexual purpose could be inferred; the victims were left in isolated but
accessible areas outside Prince George; the victims’ clothes were found
discarded nearby; there was evidence that in both cases a sharp‑edged
instrument such as a knife was used.

 

26                              
The trial judge further noted that in the Umphrey case, the DNA analysis
linked the accused to the victim.  In the Blanchard case, circumstantial
evidence also linked the accused to the victim, e.g., the testimony of a
witness who saw Ms. Blanchard get into a pickup truck similar to one used
by the appellant; the ring found in the appellant’s truck identified as
belonging to Ms. Blanchard; the purple fibres in the truck found to be
consistent with Ms. Blanchard’s sweater.  The Crown submitted that this
evidence demonstrates a system and method by which the accused seeks out and
identifies his victims, as well as the way he deals with them and disposes of
the bodies.

 

27                              
The trial judge reviewed the governing authorities on similar fact
evidence, the similarities between the two offences and the potential prejudice
to the appellant.  He found that the appellant had not met his burden under
s. 591 of the Code.  He found “significant and striking
similarities” between the two deaths.  The trial judge concluded that if the
evidence linking the appellant to both victims on the nights they disappeared
were admitted, then the evidence related to the Umphrey killing “is both
relevant and highly probative of material issues in the Blanchard case”.  The
trial judge denied the appellant’s motion for severance, but invited the
appellant to renew the application for severance once the rulings on
admissibility were completed.

 

28                              
At the end of a lengthy voir dire, the defence renewed its
application for severance.  The trial judge found that although some evidence
had been excluded, the Crown’s case remained essentially unchanged.  The
application for severance was again denied.  There was no separate
consideration of the admissibility of the similar fact evidence aside from the
motion for severance. 








 

2.    Ruling on Admissibility of Hair Samples
and DNA Evidence

 

29                              
Several voir dires were held to determine the admissibility of
the hair samples obtained from the appellant in 1990.  The trial judge found
that the central issue in determining whether the hair samples and DNA evidence
derived from them were admissible was not whether the appellant’s consent in
1990 was limited to the Blanchard investigation, but whether an informed and
valid consent can be limited in law.  In his opinion, there was no principle in
law that made it unreasonable or unlawful for the police to resort to the samples
already in their possession as a result of the consent given in 1990.  The
appellant’s later refusal to provide a hair or blood sample in 1993 did not
affect this conclusion.  Moreover, the trial judge found that the initial
consent to the taking of the hair samples was not limited either to using those
samples for the purposes of a simple comparison with hairs found at the scene
of the Blanchard murder or to using those samples only for the purposes of the
1990 investigation. Such a limitation would contradict the appellant’s own
understanding that any information obtained from the samples could be used
against him.

 

3.    Charge to the Jury

 








30                              
The trial judge instructed the jury on the use of the similar fact
evidence.  He stated that the evidence on the Blanchard killing was admissible
in proving the guilt of the appellant for the Umphrey killing and vice versa. 
The jury could use this evidence only for the purpose of deciding that the
appellant was the person who committed the offences described in both counts,
i.e., to resolve the issue of identity.  When examining the evidence on both
counts, they were instructed not to conclude that the appellant was a person
whose character or disposition was such that he likely committed the offences. 
The trial judge stated that they could infer from the evidence, although they
were not required to do so, that the incident mentioned in the Blanchard count
and the incident mentioned in the Umphrey count had characteristics in common
that were so strikingly similar that it was likely that they were committed by
one person.  When deciding whether there were similarities between the two
incidents, they should examine all the evidence and consider whether or not the
acts were strikingly similar and demonstrated a unifying pattern.  The trial
judge then gave the jury some examples of the similarities between the counts.

 

31                              
The trial judge went on to tell the jury that if they concluded that the
Blanchard count and the Umphrey count were likely committed by one person, then
the evidence on each count could assist them in deciding whether the appellant
committed the offences charged in both counts.  If, however, they did not draw
the inference that the two offences were likely committed by one person, then
in reaching a decision on any count they must only consider the evidence
relating to that count and put out of their minds the evidence on the other
count.  The trial judge also stated that if they accepted the evidence on the
Umphrey count and concluded that the appellant was guilty of that count, and
they also concluded that the Blanchard count was likely committed by the same
person, they could use the evidence, particularly of the use of the sharp‑edged
instrument, to confirm or support the evidence of the other witnesses and the
finding of the ring and the purple fibres.  The trial judge concluded by
telling the jury that they must keep in mind that the appellant could not be
convicted of either the Blanchard count or the Umphrey count unless they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty as charged.

 








B.  Court of Appeal (1997), 92 B.C.A.C. 286 (Hinds J.A. for the
court)

 

32                              
The appellant argued before the Court of Appeal that the trial judge’s
charge regarding similar fact evidence was based on R. v. Simpson
(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 337 (Ont. C.A.), which should not be followed in light
of decisions from other courts of appeal that take a different approach. 
However, Hinds J.A. found that the Simpson decision was followed by the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Lawson (1994), 45 B.C.A.C.
14.  Lawson, in turn, was referred to with approval in another British
Columbia Court of Appeal decision, R. v. Doan (1996), 81 B.C.A.C. 192. 
In Lawson, the court held at p. 21 as follows:

 

Counsel for the appellant made two points.

 

The first was that the word “likely” used by the
trial judge sets the wrong standard.  He says that the standard in relation to
the element of identity and the element of intent should be that at least those
elements must be established beyond a reasonable doubt on the count that is
said to be similar without resort to evidence outside that count before using
the evidence on that count to help to prove intent or identity on the count
actually being considered.  By that he meant that at least one count must be
proved beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of evidence relating exclusively
to that count.  As counsel said “there must be at least one anchor”.  In my
opinion, that point is not in accordance with the authority of R. v. Simpson
and I would not accede to it.

 








33                              
Hinds J.A. concluded that the present law in British Columbia on the use
of similar fact evidence is set forth in Lawson, and is based on the
principles in Simpson.  He found that the trial judge’s charge was in
conformity with those principles and followed the suggested wording set forth
in G. Ferguson, CRIMJI:  Canadian Criminal Jury Instructions (3rd
ed. 1997 (loose-leaf)), vol. 1, 4.61.  Furthermore, the trial judge’s
instructions on the use to which the jury could put similar fact evidence
complied with the principle expressed in R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
345, at pp. 360‑62, that the criminal standard of proof applies to
the determination of the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence and not to
individual items of evidence.

 

34                              
The appellant also argued that the hair samples given in 1990 should not
have been used in a subsequent police investigation.  The appellant contended
that the subsequent use of the samples vitiated the consent given in 1990, and
that the seizure of the samples therefore violated his rights under s. 8 
of the Charter .  He further contended that the DNA evidence should not
have been admitted under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  Hinds J.A. noted
that this issue was left undecided by this Court in R. v. Borden, [1994]
3 S.C.R. 145.  Counsel for the appellant argued that the effect of the police
using the hair samples taken in July 1990 for the investigation of the Umphrey
murder was to enable them to maintain a DNA bank.  The government is
specifically prohibited from maintaining DNA samples under the recent DNA
legislation.  See the Code, ss. 487.04 et seq.

 

35                              
Hinds J.A. disagreed with that submission.  He felt that the legislation
pertaining to the seizure of DNA material is not relevant to the use of those
substances that a person willingly provides to the police.  The appellant’s
scalp and pubic hairs had not been taken by force or threat of force and thus did
not constitute conscripted evidence.  The obtaining of the appellant’s hair
samples on July 26, 1990 did not violate his s. 8  rights.  Thereafter, the
samples remained in the custody and control of the RCMP.  The appropriate time
to determine whether the appellant’s s. 8  rights were violated was on July
26, 1990, the date upon which the samples were obtained by the police.

 








36                              
Even if the appropriate date for the determination was March 16, 1993
when the samples were retrieved from the RCMP laboratory, the appellant’s
s. 8  rights were not violated.  On March 16, 1993, the appellant had no
reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the hair samples and the
police seized the samples in accordance with a validly issued search warrant.  The
appeal from conviction was dismissed.

 

III.  Analysis

 

A.  Admissibility of Similar Fact Evidence

 

1.    Probative Value

 

37                              
This appeal concerns the proper charge to a jury on the use of similar
fact evidence.  This issue necessarily requires a careful review of the role of
the trial judge in considering the admission of similar fact evidence.  This is
necessary in order to place the function of the jury in weighing similar fact
evidence in its proper context.

 

38                              
The rule allowing for the admissibility of similar fact evidence is
perhaps best viewed as an “exception to an exception” to the basic rule that
all relevant evidence is admissible.  Relevance depends directly on the
facts in issue in any particular case.  The facts in issue are in turn
determined by the charge in the indictment and the defence, if any, raised by
the accused.  See Koufis v. The King, [1941] S.C.R. 481, at p. 490. 
To be logically relevant, an item of evidence does not have to firmly
establish, on any standard, the truth or falsity of a fact in issue.  The
evidence must simply tend to “increase or diminish the probability of the
existence of a fact in issue”.  See Sir Richard Eggleston, Evidence, Proof
and Probability (2nd ed. 1978), at p. 83.  As a consequence, there is
no minimum probative value required for evidence to be relevant.  See R. v.
Morris, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, at pp. 199‑200.

 








39                              
Evidence of propensity or disposition (e.g., evidence of prior bad acts)
is relevant to the ultimate issue of guilt, in so far as the fact that a person
has acted in a particular way in the past tends to support the inference that
he or she has acted that way again.  Though this evidence may often have little
probative value, it is difficult to say it is not relevant.  In this regard, I
disagree in part with Lord Hailsham’s judgment in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421.  He wrote, at p. 451 that
“[w]hen there is nothing to connect the accused with a particular crime except
bad character or similar crimes committed in the past, the probative value of
the evidence is nil and the evidence is rejected on that ground”.  I think this
statement may go too far, and find the approach taken by Lamer J., as he then
was, in Morris, supra, is more accurate.  He stated, at
p. 203:

 

Disposition the nature of which is of no relevance to the crime
committed has no probative value and . . . for that reason excluded. 
But if relevant to the crime, even though there is nothing else connecting the
accused to that crime, it is of some probative value, be it slight, and it
should be excluded as inadmissible not as irrelevant.  [Emphasis added.]

 








40                              
Thus evidence of propensity or disposition may be relevant to the crime
charged, but it is usually inadmissible because its slight probative value is
ultimately outweighed by its highly prejudicial effect.  As Sopinka J. noted in
R. v. D. (L.E.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111, at pp. 127‑28, there
are three potential dangers associated with evidence of prior bad acts:  (1)
the jury may find that the accused is a “bad person” who is likely to be guilty
of the offence charged; (2) they may punish the accused for past misconduct by
finding the accused guilty of the offence charged; or (3) they may simply
become confused by having their attention deflected from the main purpose of
their deliberations, and substitute their verdict on another matter for their
verdict on the charge being tried.  Because of these very serious dangers to
the accused, evidence of propensity or disposition is excluded as an exception
to the general rule that all relevant evidence is admissible.

 

41                              
However, as Lord Hailsham stated in Boardman, supra, at p.
453, “what is not to be admitted is a chain of reasoning and not
necessarily a state of facts” (emphasis added).  That is, disposition evidence
which is adduced solely to invite the jury to find the accused guilty
because of his or her past immoral conduct is inadmissible.  However, evidence
of similar past misconduct may exceptionally be admitted where the prohibited
line of reasoning may be avoided.  In R. v. B. (C.R.),  [1990] 1 S.C.R.
717, McLachlin J. writing for the majority carefully reviewed the issue of
similar fact evidence.  She reviewed the reasoning put forward in Boardman,
supra, and, at p. 730 observed:

 

This view of similar fact evidence posits a test
which is related to, yet distinct from the general rule that evidence is not
admissible if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value:  see R.
v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272.  That rule is an exclusionary rule applied to
evidence which would otherwise be admissible.  The reverse is the case with
similar fact evidence.  In determining its admissibility, one starts from the
proposition that the evidence is inadmissible, given the low degree of
probative force and the high degree of prejudice typically associated with it. 
The question then is whether, because of the exceptional probative value of the
evidence under consideration in relation to its potential prejudice, it should
be admitted notwithstanding the general exclusionary rule.

 

After a review
of the other pertinent authorities she concluded at pp. 734‑35:

 








This review of the jurisprudence leads me to the
following conclusions as to the law of similar fact evidence as it now stands
in Canada.  The analysis of whether the evidence in question is admissible must
begin with the recognition of the general exclusionary rule against evidence
going merely to disposition.  As affirmed in Boardman and reiterated by
this Court in Guay, Cloutier, Morris, Morin and D.
(L.E.), evidence which is adduced solely to show that the accused is the
sort of person likely to have committed an offence is, as a rule,
inadmissible.  Whether the evidence in question constitutes an exception to
this general rule depends on whether the probative value of the proposed
evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.  In a case such as the present, where
the similar fact evidence sought to be adduced is prosecution evidence of a
morally repugnant act committed by the accused, the potential prejudice is
great and the probative value of the evidence must be high indeed to permit its
reception.  The judge must consider such factors as the degree of
distinctiveness or uniqueness between the similar fact evidence and the
offences alleged against the accused, as well as the connection, if any, of the
evidence to issues other than propensity, to the end of determining whether, in
the context of the case before him, the probative value of the evidence
outweighs its potential prejudice and justifies its reception.

 

42                              
It can be seen that in considering whether similar fact evidence should
be admitted the basic and fundamental question that must be determined is
whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. 
As well it must be remembered that a high degree of deference must be given to
the decision of a trial judge on this issue.  See B. (C.R.), supra,
at pp. 732‑33.

 

43                              
It follows that where identity is at issue in a criminal case and the
accused is shown to have committed acts which bear a striking similarity to the
alleged crime, the jury is not asked to infer from the accused’s habits or disposition
that he is the type of person who would commit the crime.  Instead, the
jury is asked to infer from the degree of distinctiveness or uniqueness that
exists between the commission of the crime and the similar act that the
accused is the very person who committed the crime.  This inference is made
possible only if the high degree of similarity between the acts renders the
likelihood of coincidence objectively improbable.  See Hoch v. The Queen
(1988), 165 C.L.R. 292 (Aust. H.C.).  That is, there is always a possibility
that by coincidence the perpetrator of the crime and the accused share certain
predilections or that the accused may become implicated in crimes for which he
is not responsible.  However, where the evidence shows a distinct pattern to the
acts in question, the possibility that the accused would repeatedly be
implicated in strikingly similar offences purely as a matter of coincidence is
greatly reduced.  Sopinka J. in Morin, supra, where similar fact
evidence was used to prove identity, made this point clear (at p. 367):








 

In similar fact cases it is not sufficient to
establish that the accused is a member of an abnormal group with the same
propensities as the perpetrator.  There must be some further distinguishing
feature.  Accordingly, if the crime was committed by someone with homosexual
tendencies, it is not sufficient to establish that the accused is a practising
homosexual or indeed has engaged in numerous homosexual acts.  The tendered
evidence must tend to show that there was some striking similarity between the
manner in which the perpetrator committed the criminal act and such evidence.

 

See also R.
v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 496, per
Martin J.A. (evidence of propensity is not admissible “unless the propensity is
so highly distinctive or unique as to constitute a signature”).

 

44                              
Because similar fact evidence is admitted on the basis of an objective
improbability of coincidence, the evidence necessarily derives its probative
value from the degree of similarity between the acts under consideration.  The
probative value must, of course, significantly outweigh the prejudice to the
accused for the evidence to be admissible.  See B. (C.R.), supra. 
However, the majority in B. (C.R.), at pp. 732‑33, rejected
the proposition that the evidence must show a “striking similarity” between the
acts in question in order for the evidence to have the requisite probative
value.  I agree that the requirement of “striking similarity” needs to be
qualified.  This point is carefully made in R. v. P., [1991] 3 All E.R.
337 (H.L.), where the accused was charged with the rape of both his daughters
and with committing incest with them.  The counts were tried together, and the
evidence of both daughters was admitted in relation to each count to prove the
commission of the crime (at p. 348):

 








When a question of the kind raised in this case
arises I consider that the judge must first decide whether there is material
upon which the jury would be entitled to conclude that the evidence of one
victim, about what occurred to that victim, is so related to the evidence given
by another victim, about what happened to that other victim, that the evidence
of the first victim provides strong enough support for the evidence of the
second victim to make it just to admit it, notwithstanding the prejudicial
effect of admitting the evidence.  This relationship, from which support is
derived, may take many forms and while these forms may include ‘striking
similarity’ in the manner in which the crime is committed, . . . the
necessary relationship is by no means confined to such circumstances. 
Relationships in time and circumstances other than these may well be important
relationships in this connection.  Where the identity of the perpetrator is
in issue, and evidence of this kind is important in that connection, obviously
something in the nature of what has been called in the course of the argument a
signature or other special feature will be necessary.  To transpose this
requirement to other situations where the question is whether a crime has been
committed, rather than who did commit it,  is to impose an unnecessary and
improper restriction upon the application of the principle.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

Since the
evidence of both girls described a prolonged course of conduct involving the
use of force and general domination, the circumstances, taken together, gave
strong probative force to the evidence of one in respect of the other,
notwithstanding that the manner of the commission of the alleged crimes did not
disclose a “striking similarity”.

 








45                              
Instead, a principled approach to the admission of similar fact evidence
will in all cases rest on the finding that the accused’s involvement in the
alleged similar acts or counts is unlikely to be the product of coincidence.  This
conclusion ensures that the evidence has sufficient probative force to be
admitted, and will involve different considerations in different contexts. 
Where, as here, similar fact evidence is adduced on the issue of identity,
there must be a high degree of similarity between the acts for the evidence to
be admitted.  For example, a unique trademark or signature will automatically
render the alleged acts “strikingly similar” and therefore highly probative and
admissible.  In the same way, a number of significant similarities, taken
together, may be such that by their cumulative effect, they warrant admission
of the evidence.  Where identity is at issue ordinarily, the trial judge should
review the manner in which the similar acts were committed ‑‑ that
is to say, whether the similar acts involve a unique trademark or reveal a
number of significant similarities.  This review will enable him or her to
decide whether the alleged similar acts were all committed by the same person. 
This preliminary determination establishes the objective improbability that the
accused’s involvement in the alleged acts is the product of coincidence and
thereby gives the evidence the requisite probative force.  Thus, where the
similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity, once this preliminary
determination is made, the evidence related to the similar act (or count, in a
multi‑count indictment) may be admitted to prove the commission of
another act (or count).

 

46                              
By way of summary, McLachlin J.’s statement of the law relating to the
admissibility of similar fact evidence in R. v. C. (M.H.), [1991] 1
S.C.R. 763, is apt.  She put the proposition with great clarity, at
pp. 771‑72:

 

Such evidence is likely to have a severe prejudicial effect by inducing
the jury to think of the accused as a “bad” person.  At the same time it
possesses little relevance to the real issue, namely, whether the accused
committed the particular offence with which he stands charged.  There will be
occasions, however, where the similar act evidence will go to more than
disposition, and will be considered to have real probative value.  That
probative value usually arises from the fact that the acts compared are so
unusual and strikingly similar that their similarities cannot be attributed to
coincidence.  Only where the probative force clearly outweighs the prejudice,
or the danger that the jury may convict for non‑logical reasons, should
such evidence be received.

 








47                              
C. (M.H.), supra, left open the issue as to the standard
of proof which should be applied by the trial judge where similar fact evidence
is adduced to prove identity.  In this regard, it must be remembered that the
admissibility of similar fact evidence involves an analysis not normally
undertaken by a trial judge.  As a general rule, a trial judge will admit
evidence shown to be relevant, and will not engage in an evaluation of the
probative value or weight of the evidence.  If the trial judge is called on to
make a preliminary finding of fact as a precondition to admissibility, this
finding is usually unrelated to the quality or reliability of the evidence
itself.  See R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at p. 474.  Indeed,
the judge must refrain from evaluating the quality, weight or reliability of
evidence when determining admissibility since the weight to be given to
evidence is properly the province of the jury.  See R. v. Charemski,
[1998] 1 S.C.R. 679.  However, in determining the admissibility of similar fact
evidence the trial judge must, to a certain extent, invade this province.  As
Professor Smith stated in Case and Comment on R. v. Hurren, [1962] Crim.
L. Rev. 770, at p. 771:

 

It should be noted that judges commonly distinguish
facts as going to weight rather than admissibility (see, e.g., R.
v. Wyatt); but it is submitted that, as regards similar fact evidence,
no sharp line can be drawn and that admissibility depends on weight.

 

48                              
Thus, where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove a fact in issue,
in order to be admissible, the trial judge should evaluate the degree of
similarity of the alleged acts and decide whether the objective improbability
of coincidence has been established.  Only then will the evidence have
sufficient probative value to be admitted.  Where the fact in issue is the
identity of the perpetrator of the crime, then in the usual course of events
the trial judge must assess the degree of similarity demonstrated by the manner
in which the acts in question were committed to determine whether it is likely
the same person committed the alleged similar acts.  Once it is determined on a
balance of probabilities that the same person committed the alleged similar
acts, the similar fact evidence may be admitted to prove that the accused
committed the offence or offences in question.

 








49                              
In determining whether similar fact evidence should be admitted to prove
identity, the trial judge must have regard to the manner in which the alleged
similar acts were committed.  In general, evidence linking the accused to each
alleged similar act should not be part of this evaluation.  As Peter K.
McWilliams, states in Canadian Criminal Evidence (3rd ed. 1988 (loose‑leaf)),
at p. 11‑26.1, “[t]he link [to the accused] . . . is
distinct from the link or nexus . . . which goes to the nature of the
act and relates to its similarity or relevancy which is such as to overcome the
general exclusionary rule” (emphasis in original).  This distinction is made
clear in Case and Comment on R. v. Brown, Wilson, McMillan and
McClean, [1997] Crim. L. Rev. 502, at p. 503 (as reported by
Richard Percival):

 

. . . There was evidence of striking
similarities between the two groups of offences, and there was a signature or
other special feature. . . . Once there was this link between the groups of
offences, then evidence that linked a defendant with each group of offences was
admissible against him on the other group.  [Emphasis added.]

 

See also R.
v. Barnes, [1995] 2 Cr. App. R. 491 (C.A.), at pp. 496‑98.  In
other words, the similarity of the acts indicates whether one person
committed the crimes; in most cases, evidence as to the accused’s connection to
each similar act indicates whether the accused committed the crimes. 
Only after the trial judge has considered the manner of the commission of the
similar acts and is satisfied that there is evidence which could lead the jury
to conclude that all the acts were committed by one person should he or she
admit the evidence related to each act for the jury’s consideration, including the
evidence of the accused’s involvement in each similar act.

 

50                              
In summary, in considering the admissibility of similar fact evidence,
the basic rule is that the trial judge must first determine whether the
probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.  In most
cases where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity it might be
helpful for the trial judge to consider the following suggestions in deciding
whether to admit the evidence:

 








(1)  Generally where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity
a high degree of similarity between the acts is required in order to ensure
that the similar fact evidence has the requisite probative value of outweighing
its prejudicial effect to be admissible.  The similarity between the acts may
consist of a unique trademark or signature on a series of significant
similarities.

 

(2)  In assessing the similarity of the acts, the trial judge should
only consider the manner in which the acts were committed and not the evidence
as to the accused’s involvement in each act.

 

(3)  There may well be exceptions but as a general rule if there is
such a degree of similarity between the acts that it is likely that they were
committed by the same person then the similar fact evidence will ordinarily
have sufficient probative force to outweigh its prejudicial effect and may be
admitted.

 

(4)  The jury will then be able to consider all the evidence related to
the alleged similar acts in determining the accused’s guilt for any one act.

 

Once again
these are put forward not as rigid rules but simply as suggestions that may
assist trial judges in their approach to similar fact evidence.

 

51                              
The test for admissibility of similar fact evidence adduced to prove
identity is the same whether the alleged similar acts are definitively
attributed to the accused, or are the subject of a multi‑count indictment
against the accused.  See Boardman, supra, at p. 896, per
Lord Wilberforce.

 








52                              
However, where the similar acts are alleged as part of a multi‑count
indictment, the consideration of the admissibility of similar fact evidence
will have to be taken into account in deciding whether the counts should be
severed.  Nevertheless, the trial judge should be careful not to confuse
admissibility with severance.  A motion to sever under s. 591(3)(a)
of the Code must be brought by the accused, who bears the burden of
establishing on a balance of probabilities that the interests of justice
require an order for severance.  Yet the burden of demonstrating that similar
fact evidence should be admitted must be borne by the Crown.  These respective
burdens may involve the consideration of similar factors, but as Lord Scarman
noted in R. v. Scarrott (1977), 65 Cr. App. R. 125 (C.A.), at p. 135,
“[i]t does not follow that because a multi‑count indictment has been
allowed to proceed that therefore the evidence given will be evidence on all
the counts contained in the indictment”.  Thus, to paraphrase the Manitoba
Court of Appeal in R. v. Khan (1996), 49 C.R. (4th) 160, at p. 167,
notwithstanding the trial judge’s refusal to sever the counts in a multi‑count
indictment, it remains open to him or her, as the evidence progresses at trial,
to determine as a matter of law that evidence on one count is not admissible as
similar fact evidence on the other counts.  The assessment of similar fact
evidence and the determination of its probative value and admissibility places
an onerous burden* on the trial judge.  It is a
task that must be undertaken with great care.

 

2.    Link to the Accused

 








53                              
Where the similar fact evidence adduced to prove identity suggests that
the same person committed the similar acts, then logically this finding makes
the evidence linking the accused to each similar act relevant to the issue of
identity for the offence being tried. Similarly, in a multi‑count
indictment, the link between the accused and any one count will be relevant to
the issue of identity on the other counts which disclose a striking similarity
in the manner in which those offences were committed.

 

54                              
A link between the accused and the alleged similar acts is, however,
also a precondition to admissibility.  This requirement was set forth in R.
v. Sweitzer, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949, at p. 954:

 

Before evidence may be admitted as evidence of
similar facts, there must be a link between the allegedly similar facts and the
accused.  In other words there must be some evidence upon which the trier of
fact can make a proper finding that the similar facts to be relied upon were in
fact the acts of the accused for it is clear that if they were not his own but
those of another they have no relevance to the matters at issue under the
indictment.

 

Similarly, in Harris
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1952] A.C. 694 (H.L.), it was held, at
p. 708, that “evidence of ‘similar facts’ cannot in any case be admissible
to support an accusation against the accused unless they are connected in some
relevant way with the accused and with his participation in the crime”.

 

55                              
Should the trial judge be required to conclude not only that the
evidence suggests that the acts are the work of one person with sufficient
force to outweigh the prejudicial effect of the evidence, but that they also
are likely the acts of the accused?  This is the approach advocated by
Professor R. Mahoney in “Similar Fact Evidence and the Standard of Proof”,
[1993] Crim. L. Rev. 185, at pp. 196‑97, and is implicitly
favoured by those courts which have endorsed the “anchor” or “sequential”
approach to similar fact evidence.  See, e.g., R. v. Ross, [1980] 5 W.W.R.
261 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. J.T.S., [1997] A.J. No. 125 (QL) (C.A.).

 








56                              
The suggestion that the evidence linking the accused to the similar acts
must also link the acts to the accused goes too far.  Once the trial judge has
concluded that the similar acts were likely the work of one person and that
there is some evidence linking the accused to the alleged similar acts, it is
not necessary to conclude that the similar acts were likely committed by the
accused.  The answer to this question may well determine guilt or innocence. 
This is the very question which the trier of fact must determine on the basis
of all the evidence related to the similar acts, including of course the
accused’s involvement in each act.  The standard set out in Sweitzer
should be maintained.  This only requires that the trial judge be satisfied
that there is some evidence which links the accused to the similar acts.

 

57                              
Nevertheless, it must be noted that both Sweitzer, supra,
and Harris, supra, suggest that evidence of mere opportunity will
not suffice to establish a sufficient “link to the accused” to render similar
fact evidence admissible.  This limitation is explained by Viscount Simon’s
statement in Harris, supra, at p. 708 that the similar acts
must be connected “in some relevant way with the accused and with his
participation in the crime” (emphasis added).  Evidence of mere opportunity
showing no more than the possibility that the similar act is that of the
accused will not suffice to show the accused’s participation in the alleged
similar act.  Though the low standard set in Sweitzer is appropriate and
flexible, evidence which discloses no more than a mere possibility that the
alleged similar act is the act of the accused will not suffice to render the
similar fact evidence admissible.

 

B.  Use of Similar Fact Evidence by the Jury

 








58                              
The provincial courts of appeal have employed two very different
approaches to the use of similar fact evidence.  The first approach, which has
been called a “pooling” or “cumulative” approach, is derived from the decision
of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Simpson, supra, per
Martin J.A.  See also Lawson, supra; R. v. Eng (1995), 56
B.C.A.C. 18.  On this approach, the jury is instructed to examine the
similarities between the counts charged in the indictment and to decide, as a
preliminary matter, whether the offences were likely committed by one person. 
Only if they are satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the offences were
committed by one person may they consider the evidence of each count in
determining whether the accused committed the other offences.  If they are
unable to make this preliminary finding, they must consider the evidence on
each count separately in determining the accused’s innocence or guilt.  The
jury must also be reminded that they may not convict the accused on any count
unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she is guilty of
that offence.

 

59                              
The trial judge in this case instructed the jury in accordance with Simpson. 
He stated:

 

If you conclude that Count 1 and Count 2 were
likely committed by one person, then the evidence on each count may assist you
in deciding whether Brian Arp committed the offences charged in both counts. 
However, if you do not draw the inference that the two offences were likely
committed by one person, then in reaching a decision on any count you must only
consider the evidence relating to that count and put out of your minds the
evidence  on the other count.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

Keep in mind that the accused cannot be convicted
of either Count 1 or Count 2 unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that he is guilty as charged.

 








60                              
The second approach, which has been called the “anchor” or “sequential”
approach, has been adopted primarily by the Alberta Court of Appeal:  see R.
v. Studer (1996), 181 A.R. 399; R. v. N. (R.S.) (1995), 31 Alta.
L.R. (3d) 424; Ross, supra.  This approach is normally used in
cases where the similar fact evidence arises from an uncharged act, rather than
from another count in the same indictment: see CRIMJI, supra,
4.60.  When applied in the context of a multi‑count indictment, the
approach requires that the jury must determine first that the accused committed
one of the offences charged beyond a reasonable doubt, using only the
evidence relevant to that count.  Only then may the jury proceed to
consider the circumstances of that offence as similar fact evidence with regard
to the remaining counts.

 

61                              
In the case at bar, the trial judge also instructed the jury in
accordance with this approach.  He stated:

 

If you accept the evidence in Count 2 of the
Indictment [the Umphrey murder] and conclude that Brian Arp is guilty of that
count, and you also decide that the offence in Count 1 [the Blanchard murder]
was likely committed by the same person, you may use the evidence, particularly
of the use of the sharp‑edged implement, to confirm or support the
evidence [relating to Count 1].

 

62                              
The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his charge to the
jury because he failed to direct the jury that before using the evidence
related to one murder count to support a finding of guilt on the other murder
count, they must first conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) that the
accused committed one of the two murder counts, using only the evidence
related to that count; or (2) that the same person committed both
counts.

 

63                              
To resolve these issues, it is necessary to determine not only the
applicable standard of proof where similar fact evidence is used by a jury, but
also to set out the correct approach to the use of that evidence.  The
algebraic possibilities raised by these two questions are impressive.  Rather
than attempt to evaluate each permutation or combination separately, a review
of basic principles will lead to the proper approach.








 

1.    Applicable Principles

 

64                              
The first point to be made is that no standard of proof applies to the
“use” of evidence or to evidence itself.  Standards of proof apply only to
issues of fact.  See Morin, supra.  When similar fact evidence
(like any other circumstantial evidence) is adduced to prove identity, the jury
is invited to draw inferences and make findings of fact from that evidence. 
The probative value of similar fact evidence is based on reasoning through
probability.  The force of the evidence subsists in the proposition that it is
unlikely that the accused would be implicated more than once in offences which
are unique or markedly similar.  It is the unlikelihood of coincidence that
gives the evidence its probative force.

 

65                              
The issue in every case is whether the probative value of the evidence
outweighs its prejudicial effect.  As noted earlier, as a general rule where
similar fact evidence is tendered to prove identity if the trial judge is
satisfied that it is likely that the same person committed both the similar act
and the act in question then the probative value of these similar acts will
outweigh its prejudicial effect and the evidence will be admitted.  If the jury
is to rely on similar fact evidence, they too must conclude that the same
person committed the alleged similar acts.  Any apparent overlap in the
functions of judge and jury exists because for similar fact evidence,
admissibility frequently depends on weight.  See Hurren comment, supra. 
As Martin J.A. stated in Simpson, supra, at pp. 345-46:

 








It was, of course, for the Judge to decide as a
question of law whether the evidence on each count was admissible on the
other.  His decision in that respect, in the circumstances, depended upon his
being satisfied that the similarities in the offences were such as to be
capable of supporting a reasonable inference that both offences were likely
committed by one man.  It was entirely within the province of the jury,
however, whether they would draw that inference; whether they drew such
inference would depend upon their view of the similarities in the circumstances
of the two offences.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Thus, the main
issue in this appeal is the proper standard of proof to apply to the primary
inference drawn from the similar fact evidence ‑‑ i.e., should the
jury be satisfied on a balance of probabilities or beyond a
reasonable doubt that the same person committed the acts in
question?

 

66                              
To state the issue in this manner effectively disposes of the anchor or
sequential approach.  This must follow because if the probative value of
similar fact evidence, as circumstantial evidence, lies in the unlikelihood
of coincidence, it simply does not make sense to require one of the allegations
to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt as a prerequisite to the trier of fact’s
consideration of it.  Though the similar fact evidence, standing alone, may
fall short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it can be relied upon to assist
in proving another allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.  Two separate
allegations can support each other to the point of constituting proof beyond a
reasonable doubt, even where a reasonable doubt may have existed in relation to
each in isolation.  See R. v. White, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, at para. 44,
citing R. v. Bouvier (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.), per
Martin J.A., aff’d [1985] 2 S.C.R. 485.

 








67                              
This reasoning certainly applies when similar fact evidence is admitted
to prove identity.  In those circumstances the reasoning process flows from the
similarity of the acts themselves.  As the intervener the Attorney General for
Ontario points out, the probative value of the evidence does not depend on a
finding that both offences were necessarily committed by the same person. 
Rather, it is the likelihood that they had the same perpetrator that
sufficiently narrows the scope for coincidence so as to give the evidence
legitimate probative value.  The unlikelihood of an accused’s twice being
implicated in two very similar offences may furnish circumstantial evidence of
his or her guilt for both.  That circumstance, when combined with other
evidence in support of each charge, may add up to guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt.

 

68                              
The appellant argues that it is contrary to the presumption of innocence
and principles of fundamental justice for an accused to be convicted on the
basis of evidence pertaining to a separate count or similar act, even though
the Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt the critical preliminary
fact that one person committed both counts.  I cannot accept this submission. 
As the Attorney General for Ontario stated, it cannot be presumed that because
a preliminary determination of fact is not proven to the criminal standard,
that the trier of fact is thereby invited to make use of evidence which lacks
its purported probative value.  It is not inherently unfair that an accused may
be convicted even though the jury entertains a doubt as to whether similarity
between the acts, on its own, establishes that the same person committed both
acts.  The appellant’s argument presumes that similarity proven to a lesser
degree of certainty is without probative value.  If the appellant is right,
then on the same reasoning, it would have to be concluded that R. v. Carter,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, was wrongly decided.

 








69                              
In Carter, it was held that in order for a jury to use the
statement of a co‑conspirator against an accused as an exception to the
hearsay rule, the jury must first conclude, on a balance of probabilities and
on the basis of evidence directly admissible against the accused, that the
witness and the accused were members of the same conspiracy.  Only after this
determination is made can the jury make substantive use of the hearsay
statements.  The Court declined to apply the reasonable doubt standard to that
preliminary finding of fact, since to do so would have short‑circuited
the jury’s determination of the ultimate issue in the case, i.e., the guilt of
the accused on the charge of conspiracy.

 

70                              
More generally, in R. v. Evans, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653, it was held
that a preliminary finding of fact governing the use of evidence is normally
subject to the civil standard of proof, whether the finding is made by the
trial judge at the stage of admissibility or by the jury at the outset of their
deliberations.  The type of evidence at issue in Evans was an admission
by the accused.  Sopinka J., writing for a majority of the Court, stated as
follows, at p. 668:

 

This Court has affirmed that preliminary questions of fact by the trier
of fact may be decided on a balance of probabilities. [Citing Carter, supra.]

 

                                                                   . . .

 

If there is some evidence to permit the issue to be submitted to the
trier of fact, the matter must be considered in two stages.  First, a
preliminary determination must be made as to whether, on the basis of evidence
admissible against the accused, the Crown has established on a balance of
probabilities that the statement is that of the accused.  If this threshold is
met, the trier of fact should then consider the contents of the statement along
with other evidence to determine the issue of innocence or guilt.

 

The general
principles enunciated in these cases indicate that the jury should determine,
on a balance of the probabilities, whether the similarities between the acts
establishes that the two counts were committed by the same person.  If that
threshold is met, the jury can then consider all the evidence relating to the
similar acts in determining whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused is
guilty.

 








71                              
However, the general rule that preliminary findings of fact may be
determined on a balance of probabilities is departed from in those certainly
rare occasions when admission of the evidence may itself have a conclusive
effect with respect to guilt.  For example, where the Crown adduces a statement
of the accused made to a person in authority, the trial judge must be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt of the voluntariness of the statement.  That evidence
may of itself, if accepted as true, provide conclusive proof of guilt.  Since
doubt about the statement’s voluntariness also casts doubt on its reliability,
proof beyond a reasonable doubt is warranted.  See Ward v. The Queen,
[1979] 2 S.C.R. 30.  If this were not the rule, the jury would be permitted to
rely on evidence which it could accept as extremely cogent even though the
inherent reliability of that evidence was in doubt.

 

72                              
Similar fact evidence, on the other hand, as circumstantial evidence,
must be characterized differently, since, by its nature, it does not carry the
potential to be conclusive of guilt.  It is just one item of evidence to be
considered as part of the Crown’s overall case.  Its probative value lies in
its ability to support, through the improbability of coincidence, other
inculpatory evidence.  As with all circumstantial evidence, the jury will
decide what weight to attribute to it.  The mere fact that in a particular
case, similar fact evidence might be assigned a high degree of weight by the
trier is entirely different from the concept that, by its very nature, the
evidence has the potential to be decisive of guilt.

 








73                              
As the intervener the Attorney General for Ontario concedes, it is, of
course, conceivable for a single item of circumstantial evidence to be the only
evidence of an essential element of the offence in a given case.  The criminal
standard of proof would have to be applied in those circumstances in order to
ensure compliance with the requirement that every essential element in a
criminal prosecution must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Thus where the
Crown’s case on the issue of identity is based entirely on the underlying unity
between the similar acts, it follows that the standard of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt will govern the jury’s determination whether one person must
have committed both acts.

 

74                              
The appellant argues that because similar fact evidence carries with it
the danger of prejudicial misuse by the trier, a high standard of proof should
be imposed as a precondition of its use.  However, the danger that a jury will
misuse similar fact evidence by engaging in the prohibited line of reasoning is
avoided by the strict test for admissibility which ensures that the evidence is
sufficiently probative to outweigh the risk of prejudicial misuse, coupled with
a cautionary instruction against making improper use of the evidence.  These safeguards
ensure that the evidence is possessed of legitimate probative value before it
reaches the trier of fact and that the jury will appreciate its true
relevance.  Depriving the jury of resort to proper use of the evidence once it
has been admitted would do nothing to guard against its improper use.



75                              
On this basis, the correct approach to a consideration of similar fact
evidence by a jury is the “cumulative” or “pooling” approach.  Thus, as a
general rule where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity, the jury
should be instructed that once they have concluded that there is sufficient
likelihood that the same person committed the alleged similar acts, they may
consider all the evidence relating to the similar acts in considering whether
the accused is guilty of the act in question.

 

2.    Use of Evidence
Underlying a Prior Acquittal as Similar Fact Evidence in a Subsequent
Proceeding Against the Same Accused

 








76                              
Finally, the appellant relies upon cases in which the Crown was
prohibited from adducing as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial of the
same accused, testimony given in proceedings in which the accused was
acquitted.  See, e.g., R. v. Cullen (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 459 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. Verney (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 363 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. M.
(R.A.) (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 459 (Man. C.A.); N. (R.S.), supra;
R. v. Merdsoy (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 517 (Nfld. C.A.).  The appellant
contends that these cases conflict with the basic concept that similar fact
evidence is available for use on the basis that two offences were likely
committed by the same person.  The appellant submits that if a conviction is
obtained on one count in a multi‑count indictment but the accused is
acquitted on the other count, then the conclusion must be that the same person
did not commit both offences, and the conviction is tainted to the extent that
it was based on the similar fact evidence.  As the appellant points out, the
problem of inconsistent verdicts would disappear if the jury were directed, at
the outset of their deliberations, to decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether
both offences were committed by the same person.  This approach fuses the two
counts together as a necessary consequence of using similar fact evidence, so
that the counts must stand or fall together.

 

77                              
Those cases which have restricted the use of evidence underlying an
acquittal as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial of the same accused
have done so on the basis of this Court’s decision in Grdic v. The Queen,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 810.  Lamer J. wrote for the majority of the Court, at
p. 825:

 

There are not different kinds of acquittals and, on
that point, I share the view that “as a matter of fundamental policy in the
administration of the criminal law it must be accepted by the Crown in a
subsequent criminal proceeding that an acquittal is the equivalent to a finding
of innocence”. . . . To reach behind the acquittal, to qualify it, is
in effect to introduce the verdict of “not proven”, which . . . has
never been . . . part of our law.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

However, this does not mean that, for the purpose
of the application of the doctrine of res judicata, the Crown is
estopped from re‑litigating all or any of the issues raised in the first
trial.  But it does mean that any issue, the resolution of which had to be in
favour of the accused as a prerequisite to the acquittal, is irrevocably deemed
to have been found conclusively in favour of the accused. . . .








78                              
The principle enunciated in Grdic is fundamental to our system of
justice.  It seeks to ensure that an accused need not repeatedly defend himself
against the same allegations.  Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, the fact
of an accused’s prior acquittal may have relevance to an ultimate issue in a
subsequent trial. For example, in R. v. Ollis, [1900] 2 Q.B. 758, the
accused was charged with obtaining money by false pretences.  He had obtained
funds in exchange for a cheque that was later dishonoured.  The accused was
acquitted at his first trial on the basis that when he gave the cheque to the
complainant, he expected to receive funds to cover it.  The accused was later
again indicted with obtaining money by false pretences, and at his second trial
the Crown adduced the evidence of the first complainant as relevant to the
accused’s guilty state of mind.  The court held that the evidence was properly
admissible.  As Widgery J. stated in G. (an infant) v. Coltart, [1967] 1
All E.R. 271 (Q.B.), at p. 276:

 

. . . it may well happen that evidence relating to the charge
giving rise to the acquittal will be called on the subsequent charge, but, if
it is so called, it will be called because it has relevance to the subsequent
charge quite independently of any question whether the accused was guilty or
innocent on the first charge. [Emphasis added.]

 

On the basis
of this reasoning, the evidence of the prior acquittal in Ollis was
correctly admitted.  It was admitted to prove intent.  Even if the accused was
acquitted of the first charge, the fact that he had been tried on similar
charges once before went to his knowledge of wrongdoing irrespective of his
guilt on the first charge.  The fact of his prior trial and acquittal could be
admitted for this limited purpose, but would of course require a careful
instruction from the trial judge.  Yet, in most situations, it will be unfair
and inappropriate to admit the evidence underlying the prior acquittal as
similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial of the same accused.

 








79                              
Even so, I cannot accept the proposition that the principle set out in Grdic,
supra, applies to verdicts rendered by the same trier of fact in respect
of charges tried together in a single proceeding.  There is nothing unfair or
logically irreconcilable about a jury having reasonable doubt whether the
accused committed an act while also finding that it is likely that he committed
it.  There may very well be good reasons to exclude similar fact evidence
underlying a prior acquittal in a subsequent proceeding.  However, the
principle has no application where the alleged similar acts are the subject of
a multi‑count indictment.  There a careful instruction from the trial
judge will be required.  It will be necessary to explain to the jury that
evidence adduced on one count upon which the jury would acquit may be used in
assessing the liability on another count or counts.

 

80                              
In summary, where similar fact evidence is admitted to prove identity in
a multi‑count indictment situation, a proper charge to the jury should
include the following factors considered by Martin J.A. in Simpson, supra,
and by this Court in Sweitzer, supra, and D. (L.E.), supra:

 

(1)   The trial judge should instruct the jury that they may find from
the evidence, though they are not required to do so, that the manner of the
commission of the offences is so similar that it is likely they were committed
by the same person.

 

(2)   The judge should then review the similarities between the
offences.

 

(3)   The jury should then be instructed that if they conclude it is
likely the same person committed more than one of the offences, then the
evidence on each of those counts may assist them in deciding whether the
accused committed the other similar count or counts.








(4)   The trial judge must instruct the jury that if it accepts the
evidence of the similar acts, it is relevant for the limited purpose for which
it was admitted.

 

(5)   The jury must be warned that they are not to use the evidence on
one count to infer that the accused is a person whose character or disposition
is such that he or she is likely to have committed the offence or offences
charged in the other count or counts.

 

(6)   If they do not conclude that it is likely the same person
committed the similar offences, they must reach their verdict by considering
the evidence related to each count separately, and put out of their minds the
evidence on any other count or counts.

 

(7)   Finally, the trial judge must of course make it clear that the
accused must not be convicted on any count unless the jury are satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt that he or she is guilty of that offence.

 

3.    Application to this Appeal

 

81                              
The trial judge’s charge to the jury, based on Simpson, supra,
that if they concluded both counts were likely committed by the same person,
they could use the evidence on each count to assist in deciding the appellant’s
guilt on both counts does not offend s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Charter . 
The additional charge instructing the jury to decide whether the appellant was
guilty of the Umphrey murder and to decide whether both counts were committed
by one person before using the evidence on both counts in respect of either
count could not have prejudiced the accused.  This ground of appeal must
therefore fail.








 

C.  Admissibility of Hair Samples

 

82                              
The appellant contends that the taking of his hair samples and their
subsequent use in the Umphrey murder investigation infringed his rights
under s. 7  and s. 8  of the Charter , and that the impugned
evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 
The appellant argues that the relevant time for determining whether there was a
seizure in this case was July 26, 1990, when the appellant consented to give
scalp and pubic hair samples in connection with the investigation of the
Blanchard murder.  The appellant contends that this consent did not extend to
the storage and subsequent use of the hair samples in the Umphrey
investigation, and thus the seizure of the samples for a purpose beyond the
scope of the original consent is unlawful.

 

83                              
The appellant further argues that even if this Court finds the relevant
time for determining whether there was a seizure is March 16, 1993 when the
police seized the samples from the RCMP laboratory pursuant to a search
warrant, an invalid consent on July 26, 1990 would undermine the lawfulness of
the warrant.  The police would not have grounds to “re‑possess” the hair
samples for use in the Umphrey investigation if their use was limited to the
Blanchard investigation.  Thus any seizure under the search warrant would also
violate s. 8  of the Charter .

 








84                              
Both the appellant’s submissions are based upon his position that the
taking of the samples for purposes beyond the scope of the consent he gave in
1990 constitutes an unlawful seizure.  As Iacobucci J. stated for the majority
in Borden, supra, at p. 160, a seizure occurs whenever there
is a non‑consensual taking by state officials of an item in which the
citizen has a reasonable expectation of privacy.  See also R. v. Dyment,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 417.  Where the police seek to obtain blood or hair samples
from a suspect, the expectation of privacy with respect to bodily integrity is
clear.  Thus, where the police do not possess statutory authority to demand
such a sample, it can only be taken with the consent of the suspect.

 

85                              
Iacobucci J. writing for the majority in the Borden case
carefully considered the meaning of consent.  In that case, two sexual assaults
occurred within a few months of each other.  The accused was arrested for the
second assault.  The accused complied with a police request to provide hair and
blood samples in connection with the second assault.  However, the police hoped
to use the blood sample to establish through DNA testing that the accused was
the assailant in the first assault.  The accused was given virtually no
indication that the samples were also being sought in connection with the first
assault.  The majority held that there is a “link between the scope of a valid
consent and the scope of the accused’s knowledge in relation to the
consequences of that consent” (at p. 163).  Iacobucci J. observed that for the
waiver to be valid the person purporting to consent must have sufficient
information to give a valid consent.  It was put in this way at pp. 162‑63:

 

In order for a waiver of the right to be secure against an unreasonable
seizure to be effective, the person purporting to consent must be possessed of
the requisite informational foundation for a true relinquishment of the right. 
A right to choose requires not only the volition to prefer one option over
another, but also sufficient available information to make the preference
meaningful. . . .

 

. . . [There is] a link between the scope of a valid consent
and the scope of the accused’s knowledge in relation to the consequences of
that consent.

 

He went on to
conclude, at pp. 164‑65, that:

 








It was incumbent on the police, at a minimum, to make it clear to the
respondent that they were treating his consent as a blanket consent to the use
of the sample in relation to other offences in which he might be a suspect.  I
express no opinion on the question of whether there would have been a seizure
if the intention of the police to use the sample in respect of the [earlier]
assault case, and the subsequent appropriation of the sample for that purpose,
did not exist until some time after the seizure of the blood for use in the
[later] case. . . .

 

The degree of awareness of the consequences of the
waiver of the s. 8  right required of an accused in a given case will
depend on its particular facts.  Obviously, it will not be necessary for the
accused to have a detailed comprehension of every possible outcome of his or
her consent.  However, his or her understanding should include the fact that
the police are also planning to use the product of the seizure in a different
investigation from the one for which he or she is detained.

 

Thus the
general principle to be taken from Borden is that the scope of a valid
consent may be limited by the extent of the accused’s knowledge and the
information given to the accused as to the consequences of giving his consent. 
The majority specifically left open the issue raised by the appellant in this
case.

 

86                              
It is noteworthy that both Lamer C.J. (Gonthier J. concurring) and
McLachlin J. expressed an opinion on this issue in obiter.  As Lamer
C.J. stated, at pp. 153‑54:

 

While I do not think it necessary or desirable to deal with the broader
question of what is required for a valid consent, I agree with Iacobucci J.
that the individual must be told about the anticipated purpose known to the
police when the consent is requested.

 

However, in agreeing, I would not wish to be
taken as accepting the general proposition that the consent, once validly given
in the criminal law context, constrains the uses that may be made of the sample
or the results of analysis thereof.  Such an approach runs the risk of
considering investigations and consents to searches and seizures in watertight
compartments.  [Emphasis added.]

 








McLachlin J.,
in short concurring reasons, agreed with the Chief Justice that the individual
must be informed of the “anticipated purpose known to the police when the
consent is requested” (at p. 171), but confined that observation to the facts
of the Borden case.  She noted, at p. 171, that there is an
important public interest in allowing the police to correlate evidence obtained
on one offence with other outstanding offences.  In this regard, the comments
of the Law Reform Commission in its Working Paper No. 34 on Investigative
Tests (1984), at pp. 68‑69, are apposite:

 

. . . we are inclined to believe that the destruction of some
records . . . is more likely to hamper the legitimate function of the
police in the detection of crime and the protection of society as a whole than
to constitute a useful and valuable safeguard for the privacy of innocent
individuals.  Fingerprint records . . . might be crucial in the
investigation of serious offences committed by persons who for one reason or
another have escaped conviction for other offences of which they were in fact
guilty.  Where they have been reasonably and lawfully obtained, can it be said
that their retention “unreasonably or arbitrarily (interferes) with individual
rights and freedoms . . .”?

 

87                              
Nevertheless decisions of this court make it clear that if consent to
the provision of bodily samples is to be valid it must be an informed consent. 
That is to say persons consenting must be aware of their rights and as far as
possible the consequences of their consent.  See Borden, supra,
at pp. 161‑62; and R. v. Mellenthin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 615, at
p. 624.  Yet if neither the police nor the consenting person limit the use
which may be made of the evidence then, as a general rule no limitation or
restriction should be placed on the use of that evidence.  As Iacobucci J.
explained in Borden, supra, at p. 164, “it will not be
necessary for the accused to have a detailed comprehension of every possible
outcome of his or her consent” in order for the consent to be valid.

 








88                              
I agree that the obligation imposed on the police in obtaining a valid
consent extends only to the disclosure of those anticipated purposes known to
the police at the time the consent was given.  To  impose any greater
obligation could, as the Chief Justice explained, at p. 154, “permit the
construction of what would amount to elaborate evidentiary privileges based
upon either the purposes for which the evidence was originally obtained or upon
the information supplied at the time consent was given”.  This view accords
with the majority’s finding, at p. 164, that “it will not be necessary for
the accused to have a detailed comprehension of every possible outcome of his
or her consent” in order for the consent to be valid.

 

89                              
In the absence of any limitation placed by the police or the consenting
party on the use to be made of the hair sample, there is nothing inherently
unfair or illegal about the police retaining evidence obtained in connection
with one investigation and using it in connection with a later investigation
which was not anticipated by the police at the time the consent was given.  The
police in this case could not possibly have foreseen that 30 months after they
had lawfully obtained the appellant’s hair samples, the appellant would again
be the suspect in another homicide.  Moreover, at the time the samples were
taken, the appellant was clearly informed that if the police gathered “any
evidence as a result of that hair sample, [it would be used] in court”
(emphasis added).  Thus it is apparent that the appellant’s consent was not
limited in any way, nor was it vitiated through a lack of knowledge as to the
consequences of that consent.  The seizure of his hair samples in 1990 was both
lawful and reasonable.

 

90                              
In my view, once the appellant’s hair samples were taken by the police
with the unconditional and reasonably informed consent of the appellant, he
ceased to have any expectation of privacy in them.  As the learned trial judge
stated in his ruling on admissibility of the evidence obtained from the hair
samples:

 

It is, in my view, both illogical and undesirable to suggest that when
a body sample, be it hair or blood, is voluntarily surrendered to the police
with full recognition that it is to be used in the course of investigation that
there continues to be any expectation of privacy extending to the
“informational content” of that sample.  In my view, no such expectation real
or implied existed. . . .

 








The trial
judge considered the issue of the validity of the consent to the use of hair
samples.  He considered the consent to be valid and on the evidence before him
he could properly reach that conclusion.  In those circumstances his decision
should be accepted.

 

91                              
However, for the purpose of this appeal, it is unnecessary to consider
whether the appellant may have had a subsisting privacy interest in the samples
or in the information that could be obtained from them after he gave his
unconditional consent to the authorities to take the samples.  The police
seized the samples from the RCMP laboratory in 1993 pursuant to a search
warrant.  The appellant has argued that an invalid consent on July 26, 1990
would undermine the lawfulness of the warrant, yet the consent given in 1990
was valid in all respects, and the validity of the warrant has not been
assailed in any other way.  Thus, even if the appellant had a subsisting
privacy interest in the hair samples, they were seized pursuant to a properly
issued warrant.  The validity of that warrant has not been directly challenged.

The accused was convicted by a jury of two counts of
first degree murder and one count of attempted murder. He was subsequently
committed to a mental health institution and examined by several psychiatrists,
one of whom diagnosed him as having a manic depressive disorder and concluded
that he was suffering from this illness at the time of the offences and should
have been found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder
(“NCRMD”).  The accused applied to the Court of Appeal to have the expert
evidence of the psychiatrist admitted as fresh evidence and to raise, for the
first time, the NCRMD defence.  The majority of the Court of Appeal held that
the fresh evidence should be admitted and ordered a new trial on the limited
issue of the mental capacity of the accused at the time of the offences. The
Crown appealed to this Court.

 

Held (L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting in part and
Lamer C.J. and Bastarache J. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed and a
full new trial ordered.

 








Per Cory, Iacobucci,
Major and Binnie JJ.: The Court of Appeal’s decision to admit the fresh
evidence, after balancing the relevant factors, was correct and should be
upheld.  While the fresh evidence failed the due diligence test in Palmer,
it is desirable that due diligence remain only one factor and its absence,
particularly in criminal cases, should be assessed in light of other
circumstances.  If the evidence is

compelling and the interests of justice require that it be admitted
then the failure to meet the test should yield to permit its admission.  Here,
the fresh evidence sought to be introduced was relevant, credible and, if
believed, could affect the verdict.  The accused’s failure to meet the due
diligence requirement is serious and in many circumstances would be fatal;
however, in the circumstances of this case, that failure was overborne by the
interests of justice.

 

In appropriate circumstances, it is permissible to
allow an accused to raise the NCRMD defence for the first time on appeal.
 Although the raising of a new defence on appeal is an exception to the
general rule,  the circumstances and evidence of this case run in favour of 
allowing the accused to raise the defence. It is a principle of fundamental
justice that a person who was  not criminally responsible at the time of the
offence should not be convicted.

 

The Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to order a new
trial. When the NCRMD defence is raised on appeal for the first time,  the
Court of Appeal has the power pursuant to s. 686(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code to set aside the conviction and find the accused NCRMD. However, if
the Court of Appeal concludes that it cannot make a determination on the NCRMD
issue,  it is within its jurisdiction in avoiding a miscarriage of justice to
order a new trial pursuant to ss. 686(1)(a)(iii) and 686(2)(b)
of the Code. While,  in most cases, it is likely that the Court of
Appeal would have sufficient evidence to determine the issue of mental
capacity, in cases where the facts are complex and the court concludes that
further evidence is required a new trial should be ordered.

 








The Court of Appeal erred, however, in limiting the
new trial to the NCRMD issue.  The principles enunciated by the majority in Thomas
indicate that orders issued pursuant to s. 686(8) of the Code are
ancillary in nature and cannot be inconsistent or at direct variance with a
court of appeal’s disposition under s. 686(2) .  When a new trial is
ordered pursuant to s. 686(2)  a court of appeal’s ability to make an
ancillary order pursuant to s. 686(8)  is limited by the condition that
justice requires that order. In light of these principles, the Court of Appeal
did not have jurisdiction to limit the scope of the new trial.  The
presumption of innocence is integral to ensuring a fair trial and the fair
trial principle is obviously offended by a trial that precludes a verdict of
not guilty.  A limited trial which restricts the accused’s right to control his
defence also offends a fundamental principle of justice.  The accused must have
the opportunity to put forward whatever defence he has.  In this case, if the
evidence of mental disorder was not sufficient to convince the trier of fact
that the accused was NCRMD, such evidence could be considered on the issue of
whether the accused had the requisite mens rea.  In this light,
it is evident that an accused’s ability to make full answer and defence could
be significantly prejudiced by restricting his trial to the NCRMD issue. 

 

Per L’Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting in part):  There is substantial
agreement with Major J.’s reasons, except on the issue of the Court of Appeal’s
jurisdiction to order a limited new trial. 

 








As a general rule, courts of appeal will not allow an
issue to be raised on appeal for the first time. There are, however,  a number
of exceptions, one of which is the admission of fresh evidence on appeal. The
failure to meet the due diligence criterion of the Palmer test is not
always fatal and must be weighed against the strength of the other criteria and
the interests of justice. The interests of justice must take into account the
special treatment our criminal justice system grants the NCRMD defence, as
reflected in Swain, s. 16  and s. 686(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code .  In the unusual circumstances of this case, the rule requiring due
diligence, the practice of not permitting new defences to be raised on appeal
and the need for finality must all give way to the principle that a person
incapable of criminal intent should not be convicted. Therefore, the
psychiatric evidence was properly admitted by the Court of Appeal and the
accused should be allowed to raise the NCRMD defence of mental disorder for the
first time on appeal. 

 

The power to order a new trial where fresh evidence is
admitted is found under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) in conjunction with
s. 686(2) (b).  Nothing in the wording of s. 686(1)(a)(iii)
restricts its application to evidence produced at trial. Sections 686(1)(a)(iii)
and 686(1)(d) read together provide the Court of Appeal with the
possibility of either ordering a new trial or substituting a verdict of NCRMD
in cases where the defence of NCRMD is raised for the first time on appeal. The
possibility of either ordering a new trial or substituting an NCRMD verdict is
consistent with the general rules concerning the admission of fresh evidence. 

 








For the reasons given by the minority in Thomas,
the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to order a limited new trial. Section
686(8) of the Code grants a court of appeal a broad jurisdiction to
decide what type of order would be appropriate considering the nature and the
extent of the wrong occasioned  at trial, including the power to restrict a new
trial. Further, such an order will be an exceptional one dictated by what
“justice requires”.  In the circumstances of this case,  a limited new trial on
the NCRMD issue was consistent with what “justice requires” since the Court of
Appeal’s order is compatible with a “Swain‑type hearing”.  A “Swain-type
hearing” is conducted after a finding that the accused committed the criminal
acts, but before a conviction is entered, to determine whether the accused is
NCRMD.  The Court of Appeal’s order does not offend the principles of
fundamental justice or the presumption of innocence enshrined in ss. 7  and
11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  First,
since the accused’s situation in this new trial will be the same as in a Swain‑type
hearing, he will not benefit from the presumption of innocence during the stage
where the issue of mental disorder is examined.  The Crown has already proved
all the elements of the offences and a jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused had committed the crimes. The fresh evidence only
relates to the issue of whether the accused is NCRMD.  Second, an order
compatible with the procedure established in Swain, which was found to
respect the principles of fundamental justice, cannot violate those same
principles.  Finally, the evidence of mental disorder cannot be considered on
the issue of whether the accused had the requisite mens rea.  In a Swain‑type
hearing, the trier of fact only has to determine whether the result of the
finding that the accused committed the essential elements of the offence should
be a conviction or an NCRMD finding.  The Court of Appeal’s order in this case
is to the same effect.

 

Per Lamer C.J. and
Bastarache J. (dissenting): The Court of Appeal properly exercised its
discretion in admitting the fresh evidence. Where the issue of mental illness
is raised for the first time on appeal by way of fresh evidence,
s. 686(1) (d)  of the Criminal Code , which refers
specifically to the question of mental illness, exclusively governs the Court
of Appeal’s jurisdiction.  This jurisdiction is limited to either upholding the
conviction or substituting a verdict of NCRMD. The court cannot order a new
trial on the basis of s. 686(1) (a)(iii) and s. 686(2) (b).
The application of s. 686(1) (a)(iii) involves an assessment of the
evidence before the trial judge so as to determine whether there was a
miscarriage of justice.  No miscarriage of justice can be found by the Court of
Appeal as a result of fresh evidence that was not before the original trier of
fact. The matter should be sent back to the Court of Appeal for disposition
according to the terms of s. 686(1) (d).

The powers of the Court of Appeal are set out in s. 686  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  The relevant provisions are as follows:

 

686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against
a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or
not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to
stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may
exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in
section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the
circumstances.

 

(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under
paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

 

(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

 

(b) order a new trial.

 

.
. .

 

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the
powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.

 








4                                  
Section 686(1) (d) refers specifically to the question of mental
illness. It creates an obligation on the Court of Appeal to exercise its powers
to set aside a conviction and find the accused unfit to stand trial or not
criminally responsible on account of mental disorder when such a case arises. 
This section confers no discretion to order a new trial.  The powers given
under this section mandate a court of appeal to hold a disposition hearing.  In
such a hearing, a court of appeal sits as a trier of fact and decides the issue
of mental disorder.  It does not, nor can it order that issues be returned to
the trial court.

 

 

5                                  
The appellant’s submission is that where an issue of mental illness is
raised for the first time on appeal, the Court of Appeal may act either under
s. 686(1) (d) to set aside the conviction and find the accused not criminally
responsible on account of mental disorder, or under s. 686(1) (a)(iii)
(in conjunction with s. 686(2) (b)) to order a new trial on the basis
that there has been a miscarriage of justice.  The appellant submits that by
enacting s. 686(1) (d) Parliament has not ousted the court’s jurisdiction
to act under s. 686(1) (a)(iii).

 

6                                  
The rules of interpretation applicable in the present circumstances do
not support the position of the appellant.  From reading the legislation in
context, the courts infer the legislature’s reasons for including a particular
provision or detail.  In drawing these inferences courts pay special attention
to the scheme of the legislation.  As R. Sullivan puts it in Driedger on the
Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), at pp. 56 and 248:

 

Inferences about purpose are often drawn from analyzing the structure
or scheme embodied in an Act.  In carrying out this analysis the court, in
effect, retraces the steps of the legislative drafter, examining the
relationship among provisions to surmise the overall plan.  It attempts to
discover why each provision was included and the contribution each makes toward
implementing the legislature’s goals.  It looks at the way provisions are
grouped under headings or divided into parts to discover a common theme or
rationale.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

When analyzing the scheme of an Act, the court tries to discover how
the provisions or parts of the Act work together to give effect to a plausible
and coherent plan.  It then considers how the provision to be interpreted can
be understood in terms of that plan.








7         
The court’s reasoning is described by Greschuk J. in Melnychuk v.
Heard (1963), 45 W.W.R. 257 (Alta. S.C.), at p. 263:

 

The court must not only consider one section but all sections of an Act
including the relation of one section to the other sections, the relation of a
section to the general object intended to be secured by the Act, the importance
of the section, the whole scope of the Act and the real intention of the
enacting body.

 

Reliance on
this type of analysis to determine purpose is also illustrated in Gould v.
Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 571; R. v. Chartrand,
[1994] 2 S.C.R. 864; Reference re Goods and Services Tax, [1992] 2
S.C.R. 445; R. v. Deruelle, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 663; Thomson v. Canada
(Deputy Minister of Agriculture), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 385; Waldick v.
Malcolm, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 456; Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 85, at pp. 130-34; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. 64576
Manitoba Ltd., [1990] 5 W.W.R. 419 (Man. Q.B.), aff’d [1991] 2 W.W.R. 323
(Man. C.A.); Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19, [1990] 1
S.C.R. 653; Rawluk v. Rawluk, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 70, at pp. 90 and 97-98; R.
v. Thompson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1111, at pp. 1160 and 1163-64, per
La Forest J., dissenting; Bell Canada v. Canada (Canadian
Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1722,
at pp. 1740-41, 1752 and 1756.

 

8                                  
Our position in regard to the proper interpretation of ss. 686(1) (d)
and 686(1) (a)(iii) is consistent with the reasons of this Court in R.
v. Mailloux, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1029, at p. 1040:

 








What was then the purpose of s. 1016(4) [the
predecessor section to s. 686(1) (d)]?  In seeking an answer one must not
overlook the fact that a new trial could be triggered through the general
provisions of s. 1014 [the predecessor section to s. 686(1) (a)] only if
there had been below an error of law, unreasonable findings, or miscarriage of
justice as regards the issue of insanity.  This could occur only if insanity
was an issue raised at trial.  In my view, s. 1016(4) was introduced to enable
a court of appeal to give some relief, albeit incomplete, to the accused when
the insanity issue was raised for the first time in appeal.

 

9                                  
The application of s. 686(1) (a)(iii) involves an assessment of
the evidence before the trial judge so as to determine whether there was a
miscarriage of justice.  However, no miscarriage of justice can be found by the
Court of Appeal as a result of fresh evidence that was not before the original
trier of fact.

 

10                              
Thus, where the issue of mental illness is raised for the first time on
appeal by way of fresh evidence, the Court of Appeal cannot order a new trial
on the basis of s. 686(1) (a).  Section 686(1) (d) exclusively
governs the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction in circumstances such as these.

 

11                              
Consequently, the admission of new evidence, in this case, calls for the
application of para. (d), which creates an obligation on the Court of
Appeal to exercise the same powers as the trial court and decide the litigious
issue of mental illness.  In this case, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial
on the limited issue of insanity.  It did so without statutory jurisdiction. 
We would therefore allow the appeal, quash the decision and send the matter
back to the Court of Appeal for disposition according to the terms of s.
686(1) (d).

 

12                              
In passing, we would add that if the Court of Appeal had had
jurisdiction to send it back for a new trial, we are then in full agreement
with Major J. for the majority that the new trial could not have been limited
to the issue of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder.

 








The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were
delivered by

 

//L’Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

13                      L’Heureux-Dubé J.
(dissenting in part) -- This appeal concerns the admission of a psychiatric
opinion as fresh evidence by the Court of Appeal, allowing the respondent to
raise for the first time the defence of not criminally responsible by reason of
a mental disorder (“NCRMD”), and its jurisdiction, on the basis of such
evidence, to order a new trial limited to the issue of whether the respondent
was NCRMD at the time of the commission of the offences. 

 

14                      I have had the benefit of the reasons of Major J. and of the
Chief Justice and Bastarache J.  I agree substantially with the reasons of
Major J. as they relate to the admission of the fresh evidence and the
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, on the basis of that evidence, to order a
new trial.  However, for reasons similar to those I expressed in R. v.
Thomas, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 535, judgment rendered concurrently, I disagree
with Major J.’s conclusion that the Court of Appeal did not have the power to
order a new trial limited to the question of the mental capacity of the
accused.

 

15                      Before addressing this last question, I wish to add some
comments on the question of the admission of fresh evidence on appeal.

 

I.   New
Issues Raised on Appeal

                   








16                      The general rule is that courts of appeal will not allow an
issue to be raised on appeal for the first time.  I stressed in my dissenting
opinion R. v. Brown, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918, at p. 923, that the rationale
for the severity of that rule is twofold: “first, prejudice to the other side
caused by the lack of opportunity to respond and adduce evidence at trial and
second, the lack of a sufficient record upon which to make the findings of fact
necessary to properly rule on the new issue”.  (See also Perka v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, R. v. R. (R.) (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont.
C.A.), R. v. Trabulsey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 147 (Ont. C.A.).)  I also
expressed in Brown, supra, at pp. 923-24, the basis for the
general ban against entertaining issues on appeal which were not raised at
trial:   

 

[T]he general prohibition against new arguments on appeal supports the
overarching societal interest in the finality of litigation in criminal matters. 
Were there to be no limits on the issues that may be raised on appeal, such
finality would become an illusion.  Both the Crown and the defence would face
uncertainty, as counsel for both sides, having discovered that the strategy
adopted at trial did not result in the desired or expected verdict, devised new
approaches. Costs would escalate and the resolution of criminal matters could
be spread out over years in the most routine cases.  Moreover, society’s
expectation that criminal matters will be disposed of fairly and fully at the
first instance and its respect for the administration of justice would be
undermined.  Juries would rightfully be uncertain if they were fulfilling an
important societal function or merely wasting their time. For these reasons,
courts have always adhered closely to the rule that such tactics will not be
permitted.

 

See also R.
v. Vidulich (1989), 37 B.C.L.R. (2d) 391 (C.A.), at pp. 398-99.

 

17                      In addition, this rule recognizes the important responsibility
of defence counsel to make decisions that represent his or her client’s best
interests and put forward all appropriate arguments throughout the trial. 
Counsel too has a responsibility to ensure the finality of the litigation process.         

 








18                      However, the general rule prohibiting new issues on appeal is
not absolute.  There are a number of exceptions, one of which is the admission
of fresh evidence on appeal.  The statutory power to admit fresh evidence on
appeal is granted by s. 683(1) (d) of the Criminal Code, 
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 :

 

683.  (1) For the purposes of an appeal
under this Part, the court of appeal may, where it considers it in the
interests of justice,

 

.
. .

 

(d) receive the evidence, if tendered, of any witness, including
the                    appellant, who is a competent but not compellable
witness;

 

19                      This Court’s decision in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1
S.C.R. 759, provides a framework for the exercise of that discretionary
power.   McIntyre J., writing for the Court, specified that a court of appeal’s
overriding consideration in exercising its discretion to admit fresh evidence
must be “the interests of justice” and formulated the following criteria at p.
775:

 

(1)   The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
diligence, it                could have been adduced at trial provided that
this general principle                                                                     will
not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases: see             McMartin
v. The Queen.

 

(2)   The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a
decisive                       or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

 

(3)   The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably
capable 

of belief, and

 

(4)   It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken
with                 the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have
affected the                                                                result.

 








20                           As the first criterion set out by McIntyre J. indicates,
the due diligence requirement will not be applied as strictly in criminal
cases, since the liberty of the subject is usually at stake.  As Major J.
notes, this Court has recognized that, in criminal cases, the lack of due
diligence will not always be fatal and will have to be weighed against the
strength of the other criteria and the interests of justice (McMartin v. The
Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484, R. v. McAnespie, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 501, and R.
v. Price, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 633).

 

21                      The interests of justice must take into account the special
treatment our criminal justice system grants the defence of NCRMD.  As noted by
Major J., the special treatment of the NCRMD defence emerges from the principle
of fundamental justice that a person who was “insane” at the time of the
offence should not be convicted of a crime (R. v. Swain, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
933; see also s. 16  of the Criminal Code ).  The special character of the
NCRMD defence is further reflected in the power granted to appellate courts
under s. 686(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  to set aside a conviction
and impose a finding of NCRMD, which effectively permits the defence to be raised
for the first time on appeal.  Pursuant to Swain, supra, the
common law also allows the defence of NCRMD to be raised after a finding that
the accused committed the guilty act but before the conviction is entered. 
Thus, the mental state of an accused at the time of the offence has always been
of primary importance in our criminal justice system.

 

22                           I agree with Major J. that all the criteria of the Palmer
test for the admission of fresh evidence were met in this case except for that
of due diligence.  Therefore, while the due diligence requirement of the Palmer
test was not met, I agree with McEachern C.J.B.C., for the majority of the
Court of Appeal, that “the rule requiring due diligence, the practice of not
permitting new defences to be raised on appeal, and the need for finality in
the trial process, must all give way in such unusual circumstances to the
principle that a person incapable of criminal intent should not be convicted”
((1997), 97 B.C.A.C. 137, at para. 72).  In the particular circumstances of
this case the respondent should be allowed to raise the defence of NCRMD for
the first time on appeal and, therefore, I agree with the conclusion of Major
J. that the psychiatric evidence was properly admitted by the Court of Appeal.








 

23                      This brings us to the proper remedy in cases where fresh
evidence is admitted on appeal.

 

II.   The
Remedy

 

24                      The power of a court of appeal to admit fresh evidence is
granted by s. 683(1) (d) of the Criminal Code .  However, s.
683 does not specify the appropriate remedy in such cases.  Appellate courts
have frequently ordered new trials in criminal matters when admitting fresh
evidence without specifically referring to a particular section of the Criminal
Code  (see McMartin, supra, and R. v. Stolar, [1988] 1
S.C.R. 480).  The jurisdiction to order a new trial in the context of fresh
evidence, in my view, comes from the general powers conferred on appellate
courts by s. 686  and in particular s. 686(1) (a).  The relevant
provisions read:

 

 

686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or    against
a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not    criminally
responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of    appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that 

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is                              unreasonable
or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

                                                                   .
. .                                     

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to
stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may
exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in
section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the
circumstances. 

 

(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under
paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and








(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

 

(b) order a new trial.

                                                                   .
. .

       (8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the         powers
conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order,                                                         in
addition, that justice requires.

 

 

25                      The very broad terms of s. 686(1) (a)(iii) in particular
support such an interpretation by spelling out the power to “allow the appeal
where it is of the opinion that on any ground there was a miscarriage of
justice” (emphasis added).  (See G. D. McKinnon, The Criminal Lawyers’ Guide
to Appellate Court Practice (1997), at p. 93; I. Lagarde, Droit pénal
canadien (2nd ed. 1974), vol. II, at p. 1685, and R. v. Thomson
(1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 350 (B.C.C.A.), where the Court of Appeal ordered a new
trial after it admitted fresh evidence in order to make sure that there was no
miscarriage of justice.)  This is consistent with the “free and unrestricted
discretion” vested to courts of appeal in allowing an appeal under s. 686(1) (a)(iii)
(Mahoney v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, per McIntyre J. at p.
845).  Therefore, I agree with Major J. that the power to order a new trial
where fresh evidence is admitted is found under s. 686(1) (a)(iii) in
conjunction with s. 686(2) (b).

 








26                      The position of the Chief Justice and Bastarache J. that “no
miscarriage of justice can be found by the Court of Appeal as a result of fresh
evidence that was not before the original trier of fact” (para. 9) is contrary
to the broad interpretation given to s. 686(1) (a)(iii) and its
application by appellate courts.  Their position greatly restricts the
jurisdiction of appellate courts under that section and essentially removes 
the jurisdiction of appellate courts to order a new trial after admitting fresh
evidence in all cases, and not only those relating to the NCRMD defence.  No
other subsection of s. 686  would apply in such a case.  There is nothing
in the wording of s. 686(1) (a)(iii) that restricts its application
to evidence produced at trial, and I fail to see any reason to do so.

 

27                      On the basis that no miscarriage of justice can be found under
s. 686(1) (a)(iii)  from evidence that was not before the trier of
fact, the Chief Justice and Bastarache J. conclude, for their part, that s.
686(1) (d) “exclusively governs the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction in
circumstances such as these” (para. 10) and, therefore, the matter should be
sent back to the Court of Appeal for disposition according to the terms of that
section (para. 11).  I disagree.  As noted by Major J., the plain wording
of s. 686(1) (d) and, in particular, the use of the word “may” do not
exclude the application of s. 686(1) (a) when dealing with mental
disorder issues.  Furthermore, I agree with Major J. at para. 66 that the
“reference to the issue of NCRMD in the opening passage of s. 686(1)  must
allow a court of appeal to order a new trial to prevent a miscarriage of
justice flowing from a failure to raise the issue of NCRMD at the trial”.  This
Court’s decision in R. v. Mailloux, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1029, is not
determinative of the jurisdiction issue raised here for the reasons expressed
by Major J.  Sections 686(1) (a)(iii) and 686(1) (d) read together
provide the Court of Appeal with the possibility of either ordering a
new trial or substituting a verdict of NCRMD in cases where the defence of
NCRMD is raised for the first time on appeal.

 

28                      I would add that this approach is consistent with the general
rules concerning the admission of fresh evidence developed in  Stolar, supra,
at p. 492, where this Court held that, once a court of appeal decides to admit
the evidence, it may either dispose of the matter immediately, if the evidence
is conclusive, or if not, order a new trial.

 








29                      To adopt the Chief Justice and Bastarache J.’s approach would
mean that in a case where the fresh evidence is not conclusive but could
potentially affect the verdict, such as the psychiatric evidence in this case,
the Court of Appeal could allow the appeal but it could not provide a remedy. 
As a result, the court would have no option, even if the admitted fresh
evidence were not tested in court, other than to allow the appeal and enter a
finding of NCRMD or to uphold the conviction.  This cannot be what justice
requires, particularly since it is not generally the function of a court of
appeal to act as a court of first instance and conduct a trial on this issue. 
In this connection McEachern C.J.B.C. observed at para. 64:

 

[T]he fact pattern here is complex and a number of witnesses, possibly
on  both sides, may be required.  In my view, it will be better if these
matters are decided in a new trial, presumably with a judge and jury. 

 

30                      Having concluded that the remedy of a new trial is the proper one
and that it is within a court of appeal’s jurisdiction, I will now deal with
the order made by the Court of Appeal limiting the new trial to the issue of
whether the respondent was NCRMD at the time of the commission of the offences.

 

 

III.   Power
to Order a Limited New Trial

 

31                      I cannot agree with Major J. that the Court of Appeal does not
have the authority to order a limited new trial.  In Thomas, judgment
released concurrently, I expressed the view that s. 686(8)  grants a court of
appeal a broad jurisdiction to decide what type of order would be “appropriate
considering the nature and the extent of the wrong occasioned below”, including
the power to restrict the new trial to manslaughter or second degree murder
verdicts (para. 74).  Further, such an order will be an exceptional one
dictated by what “justice requires” (s. 686(8) ) for the reasons I expressed in Thomas
to which I refer as if herein recited at length.

 








32                      The Court of Appeal in this case was concerned about the risk of
convicting someone who might be suffering from a mental disorder, since the
defence of NCRMD had not been raised at trial.  On the basis of the procedure
set out in Swain, supra, the court ordered a new trial limited to
the issue of whether the respondent was NCRMD at the time of the commission of
the offences.  

 

33                      This Court held in Swain, supra, that the issue of
whether the accused is NCRMD may be determined by a hearing conducted after a
finding that the accused committed the criminal acts, but before a conviction
is entered.  The issue of NCRMD may be tried by the jury after it has determined
that the accused committed the guilty act in order to decide whether the result
of that finding should be a conviction, or a finding of NCRMD.  This new common
law rule was found to be consistent with an accused’s right to have the Crown
prove all the elements of the offence before raising other matters.  The order
contemplated by the Court of Appeal in this case is of the same nature as a “Swain-type
hearing”, since the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent
committed the guilty act before the NCRMD defence was raised. Therefore, since
the trial process itself contemplates a two-stage procedure, I find the order
to be consistent with the NCRMD defence raised by the respondent on appeal.

 








34                      This Court’s judgment in Swain, supra, shows, in
my view, that a limited new trial on the issue of whether the accused is NCRMD
is consistent with what “justice requires” in these circumstances.  A new trial
is being granted because of the fresh evidence relating to the question of
whether the accused is NCRMD.  This evidence in no way relates to the
determination that the accused committed the guilty act.  Had the accused put
forward this evidence at trial after the jury found he had committed the guilty
act, it would have been considered in a Swain-type hearing, where the
only issue for determination by the jury would have been whether there should
be a conviction or a finding of NCRMD.  It is consistent with the requirements
of justice that the same procedure be followed when a new trial is granted, to
allow consideration of the fresh evidence.  This avoids determining for a
second time issues which have already been decided by the jury and which are in
no way implicated by the reasons for granting the new trial.

 

35                      There are ample precedents to support an order of this kind in
the context of entrapment, which also provides a two-stage procedure where the
defence of entrapment is separated from the issue of whether the accused
committed the essential elements of the offence (R. v. Mack, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 903).  In R. v. Pearson, [1998] S.C.R. 620, released
concurrently, this Court upheld the order limiting the new trial to the issue
of entrapment under s. 686(8) .  A new trial limited to the defence of
entrapment was ordered in R. v. Laverty (1990), 80 C.R. (3d) 231
(B.C.C.A.), where the procedural aspects of that order were based on s. 686(8) 
(see supplementary reasons delivered November 1, 1990, Victoria Registry
V00270; see also R. v. Barnes (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 368 (B.C.C.A.),
aff’d [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449; R. v. Maxwell (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 289
(Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, per Sopinka
J., at p. 1019, also per McLachlin J., at pp. 1017-18, both in
dissent on another issue).  It is worth mentioning that a five-member panel of
the Ontario Court of Appeal decided in Reference re Regina v. Gorecki (No.
2) (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 135, to order a new trial limited to the defence
of insanity, much before this Court decided in Swain, supra, that
the insanity issue could be raised after a finding that the accused committed
the guilty act.  These authorities clearly demonstrate that justice may require
an order limiting the new trial to the defence of NCRMD.

 








36                      The respondent contends that this order offends the principles
of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence enshrined in ss. 7  and
11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  I disagree
for the following reasons.  First, the situation of the respondent in this new
trial will be the same as in a Swain-type hearing and, accordingly, he
will not benefit from the presumption of innocence during the stage where the
issue of NCRMD is examined.  The Crown has already proved all the elements of
the offences and a jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
respondent had committed the crimes.  The only issue outstanding is whether he
possessed the mental capacity to be held criminally responsible for them.

 

37                      Second, contrary to Major J., I do not see how an order of the
same nature as the procedure established in Swain, supra, which
was found to respect the principles of fundamental justice, could possibly
violate those same principles.  Rather, I believe that the limited new trial in
this case guarantees the respondent’s opportunity to make a full answer and
defence.  Indeed, this Court held in Swain, supra, at p. 986,
that the new common law rule permitting the insanity defence to be raised after
a finding that the accused committed the criminal act “would safeguard an
accused’s right to control his or her defence”.  Under such a rule the accused
can present at trial any type of defence, even one that is inconsistent with
insanity.  If these defences are unsuccessful, and it is determined that the
accused committed the guilty act, the accused can still raise the insanity
defence.  In this case, the respondent presented a defence that his stepmother
had committed the crimes, this defence was rejected and the respondent was
found by a jury to have committed the essential elements of the offences.  The
Court of Appeal’s order allows him to present his NCRMD defence, and he will be
able to raise any evidentiary and Charter  issues he wishes on the issue
of NCRMD.  Therefore, the respondent will suffer no prejudice arising from the
Court of Appeal’s order for a limited new trial in this case.

 








38                      Third, Major J. referring to Swain, supra, 
alludes to the possibility that “if evidence led with respect to a mental
disorder was not sufficient to convince the trier of fact that the accused was
NCRMD, such evidence could be considered on the issue of whether the accused
had the requisite mens rea” (para. 74).  That possibility was discussed
in Swain, supra, concerning certain cases where the NCRMD defence
is raised during the course of the trial, but does not extend to the second
stage of the procedure provided in Swain, where the defence is raised
after a finding that the accused committed the guilty act has been rendered. 
As such, the post-verdict Swain hearing is not different from an entrapment
hearing which does not involve mens rea; see Pearson, supra. 
As I already mentioned above, this Court has established that in a Swain-type
hearing, the trier of fact only has to determine whether the result of that
finding that the accused committed the essential elements of the offence should
be a conviction or a finding of NCRMD.  The order made by the Court of Appeal
in this case is to the same effect. 

 

39                      The fresh evidence relates solely to the defence of NCRMD.
Therefore, there is no need to relitigate the jury’s findings that the
respondent committed the crimes, which is not the object of the appeal.  The
only issue raised by the respondent is his claim of NCRMD, and I believe that
justice will be done by ordering a new trial on this sole issue.  Therefore,
considering the nature of the NCRMD defence and the possible miscarriage of
justice the court’s order was made to remedy, I find that the Court of Appeal
correctly exercised its discretion to order a limited new trial on this issue
in the present case.

 

IV.   Disposition

 








40                      For these reasons, I would uphold the Court of Appeal’s order of
a new trial limited to the issue of whether the respondent was NCRMD at the
time of the commission of offences.  Therefore, I would dismiss the appeal.

I.  Facts

 

41                              
The respondent, Warsing, was convicted by a jury of two counts of first
degree murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to the death of his
two siblings and injuries to his stepmother.  The defence of not being
criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (“NCRMD”) was not raised
at trial.  Subsequent to his conviction, the respondent was committed to a
mental health institution and examined by several psychiatrists, one of whom
diagnosed the respondent as suffering from a “Manic Depressive Disorder”,
otherwise known as “Bipolar Affective Disorder”, and concluded that Warsing was
suffering from this illness at the time of the offences and should have been
found NCRMD.

 

42                              
The respondent applied to the British Columbia Court of Appeal to have
the expert evidence of the psychiatrist  admitted as fresh evidence and to
raise, for the first time, the defence of NCRMD.  The majority of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal held that Warsing was entitled to enter the
psychiatric evidence and ordered a new trial on the limited issue of NCRMD.

III.  Judicial
History

 

British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1997), 97 B.C.A.C. 137

 

(1)   Majority

 

44                              
McEachern C.J.B.C. (Finch J.A. concurring) identified three issues: 

 

(a) Does the fresh evidence meet the test for admissibility?

 

(b) If not, can the accused be permitted to adduce this new evidence
given his failure to disclose why he did not plead insanity at his trial?

 

(c) Is it possible for the accused to have a trial on the insanity
issue under  the authority of Swain?

 








45                              
McEachern C.J.B.C. held that the accused failed to meet the  test of due
diligence  set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
759.     He noted that the defence of NCRMD would have been apparent to anyone
who was familiar with the bizarre conduct of the accused and the statements 
made by him about the offences with which he had been charged.  In spite of
that, he concluded that the failure to satisfy the due diligence portion of Palmer
was not fatal to the accused’s appeal as  the other three requirements of
the Palmer test had been satisfied and it was in the interests of
justice to admit the evidence. 

 

46                              
On the second issue, McEachern C.J.B.C. held that R. v. Mailloux,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 1029, was not relevant.  He found that the appeal before
the court turned primarily on whether the accused having made a deliberate
decision not to plead insanity should now be entitled to raise that defence and
to introduce evidence with respect to it.  While in most cases the accused will
be barred from raising the defence of  NCRMD for the first time on appeal,
McEachern C.J.B.C. found that in light of the extraordinary circumstances
surrounding this case and the support found in R. v. Buxbaum (1989), 70
C.R. (3d) 20 (Ont. C.A.), the court should do what is just and admit the
evidence.

 

 

47                              
On the third issue, McEachern C.J.B.C. relying on R. v. Swain,
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, concluded that the fresh evidence should be admitted and
ordered a new trial on the limited issue of the mental capacity of the accused
at the time of the offences. 

 

(2)   Dissent

 

48                              
Ryan J.A. agreed with the majority that in extraordinary circumstances
it would be proper  to order a new trial notwithstanding that the  accused made
a strategic decision not to pursue an NCRMD defence at trial.   She dissented
because in her view there was insufficient evidence to convince her that it was
in the interests of justice to order a new trial. 

 








IV.  Issues

 

49                              
Four issues arise in this appeal:

 

(1)                Did the British Columbia Court
of Appeal err in admitting fresh evidence when all the conditions for the
admission of fresh evidence on appeal had not been met?

 

(2)               Did the British Columbia Court of
Appeal err by permitting the respondent to raise an entirely new defence on
appeal which was not raised at trial?

 

(3)               Did the British Columbia Court of
Appeal err in ordering a new trial based on the fresh evidence adduced on
appeal?

 

(4)               Did the British Columbia Court of
Appeal err in ordering a new trial   limited to the issue of NCRMD?

 

V.  Analysis

 

Issue 1

 

50                              
The rule for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal has been set out
in Palmer, supra, at p. 775:

 

(1)   The evidence should generally not be
admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided
that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case
as in civil cases: see McMartin v. The Queen.

 








(2)   The evidence must be relevant in the sense
that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

 

(3)   The evidence must be credible in the sense
that it is reasonably capable of belief, and 

 

(4)   It must be such that if believed it could
reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
have affected the result. 

 

The parties agree
that the evidence tendered meets the second test in Palmer, the
relevance criterion, but the appellant submitted that the first, third and
fourth criteria were not satisfied.

 

51                              
In this case  the psychiatric evidence was undoubtedly available upon 
the exercise of due diligence.  The respondent’s counsel at the Court of
Appeal, hampered by solicitor-client privilege, was unable to provide an
explanation as to why the evidence of NCRMD was not led.  This privilege could
have been waived by the respondent and his failure to do so would usually weigh
against admitting the fresh evidence, however that is only one factor.  See  McMartin
v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484, per Ritchie J., at p. 491:

 

In all the circumstances, if the evidence is
considered to be of sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the
verdict of the jury, I do not think it should be excluded on the ground that
reasonable diligence was not exercised to obtain it at or before the trial.

 

In R. v.
McAnespie, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 501, the Court rejected fresh evidence on
the appeal that was available at the sentencing portion of the trial; see
Sopinka J. at pp. 502-3: 

 

[W]e are of the opinion that the respondent failed to satisfy the
criterion of due diligence.  While this factor is not applied strictly in
criminal cases and is not to be considered in isolation, the strength of the
other factors is not such that failure to satisfy the due diligence
requirement in this case is overborne by the other factors.  [Emphasis in
original.]








It is
desirable that due diligence remain only one factor and its absence,
particularly in criminal cases, should be assessed in light of other
circumstances.  If the evidence is compelling and the interests of justice
require that it be admitted then the failure to meet the test should yield to
permit its admission.  

 

52                              
The appellant submitted that the evidence of insanity was  not credible 
and  failed the third component of the Palmer test.  The respondent was
examined by a psychiatrist within days of the murders but no finding of  mental
disorder was made.  However,  this examination was conducted to determine
whether the respondent was fit to stand trial, not to determine his mental
capacity at the time of the offences.  The appellant cited R. v. Stolar,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 480, for the proposition that an assessment of credibility
should be carried out against the whole background of the case and not
restricted to the fresh evidence application.  McEachern C.J.B.C. recognized this
proposition at para. 28 where he stated “it is credible, in the sense that it
is reasonably capable of belief when viewed in the context of other evidence
relevant to that issue” and at para. 63 where he referred to “the apparently
consistent psychiatric assessment based upon the facts and the family history
of the accused”.  It is apparent that the evidence is reasonably capable of
belief.  Whether it is actually believed is up to the trier of fact. 

 








53                              
Finally, the appellant submitted that the evidence, if admitted, should
be accorded no weight because it is an expert opinion based on self-reported
facts from the respondent that have not been proven:  R. v. Abbey, [1982]
2 S.C.R. 24; R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852.  This
submission overlooks the fact that there was some evidence adduced at the trial
related to the respondent’s family history and past conduct that supported the
findings of the psychiatrist.  In many cases  the  evidence of experts depends
on the hypothesis or assumptions that they are asked to make.   The value of
the opinion will depend on the validity of the assumptions and is related to
weight not admissibility.

 

54                              
The appellant’s submissions on the strict application of the rule in Abbey
should be assessed in light of Wilson J.’s later decision in Lavallee, which
considered Abbey.   Wilson J., there, set out four propositions which
represented the ratio of Abbey (at p. 893):

 

1.    An expert opinion is admissible if relevant,
even if it is based on second-hand evidence. 

 

2.    This second-hand evidence (hearsay) is
admissible to show the information on which the expert opinion is based, not as
evidence going to the existence of the facts on which the opinion is based. 

 

3.    Where the psychiatric evidence is comprised
of hearsay evidence, the problem is the weight to be attributed to the opinion.

 

4.    Before any weight can be given to an
expert’s opinion, the facts upon which the opinion is based must be found to
exist.

 

Wilson J. in
considering the fourth principle held that as long as there is some admissible
evidence on which  the expert’s testimony is based it cannot be ignored; but 
it follows that the more the expert relies on facts not in evidence, the weight
given  to the opinion will diminish. 

 








55                              
In the present appeal the issue of weight has not yet arisen  as the
Court of Appeal did not decide whether the respondent was NCRMD, but instead
found that the expert’s opinion convinced them that it was an issue that should
be heard.  The expert opinion combined with the fact that the respondent had
been diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder raised an issue regarding the mental
condition of the respondent at the time of the offences.  Such evidence was
credible, and depending on the findings of the trier of fact it could have
affected the outcome of the trial.   

 

56                              
While the fresh evidence failed the due diligence test in Palmer,
the evidence sought to be introduced was credible and if believed could affect
the verdict.  It is my opinion that the Court of Appeal’s decision to admit the
evidence after balancing the factors described was correct and should be
upheld.  The respondent’s failure to meet the due diligence requirement is
serious and in many circumstances would be fatal; however it is overborne by
the interests of justice and as Carthy J.A. stated in R. v. C. (R.) (1989),
47 C.C.C. (3d) 84 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 87, a failure to meet the due diligence
requirement should not “override accomplishing a just result”.

 

Issue 2

 

57                              
The appellant submitted that the finality of  litigation mitigated
against the respondent raising  a defence that was disavowed at trial:  R.
v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880; R. v. R. (R.) (1994), 91
C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.).  However, the Court of Appeal had a discretion to
allow a new issue or defence to be raised for the first time on appeal:  R.
v. Vidulich (1989), 37 B.C.L.R. (2d) 391, and in the absence of an error
that discretion should not be disturbed.  The record is not clear whether the
respondent actually disavowed the defence of NCRMD, and as the respondent  did
not waive his solicitor client privilege that avenue of information remains
closed. 

 








58                              
The defence of NCRMD is complex and relatively unclear.  While  Mailloux,
supra, is not directly applicable, it offers some guidance.  Mailloux was
accused of two second degree murders and at  trial he unsuccessfully raised
insanity as his primary defence.  On appeal, this Court examined s. 613(1)(d),
the predecessor to s. 686(1) (d), and Lamer J. (as he then was), in
obiter, held that it was enacted to permit a court of appeal to quash the
verdict even in those cases where there was no error of law made, but the issue
of insanity had not been raised at first instance.  Section  613(1)(d)
read:

 

613. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against  a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant not guilty
on account of insanity and order the appellant to be kept in safe custody to
await the pleasure of the lieutenant governor where it is of the opinion
that, although the appellant committed the act or made the omission charged
against him, he was insane at the time the act was committed or the omission
was made, so that he was not criminally responsible for his conduct . . . . 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Although there
have been considerable changes to the Code in this area, I am of the
view that Lamer J.’s comments support my position that it is permissible to
allow the accused to raise NCRMD for the first time on appeal under appropriate
circumstances. 

 








59                              
A second factor assisting the accused in raising the insanity defence
for the first time on appeal is Swain, supra, and the legislative
response to that decision.  Swain recognized that it would be unfair to
force the accused to plead insanity as an alternative defence, as this might
prejudice both his claim of insanity and his claim of innocence.  Swain allowed
the accused to wait until a finding of guilt had been made before the defence
of insanity had to be raised.  While an accused is seldom allowed to “hold
back” a defence in anticipation of using it on appeal if convicted, Swain provides
that option and confirms that the policy concerns about  raising an NCRMD
defence for the first time on appeal are not stringent because of the nature of
the defence of NCRMD.  Swain confirms that it is a principle of
fundamental justice that a person who was  not criminally responsible at the
time of the offence should not be convicted.   

 

60                              
This procedure is an exception to the general rule, but the circumstances
and evidence of this case run  in favour of allowing the respondent to raise
the defence of NCRMD for the first time at his appeal.  

 

Issue 3 

 

61                              
This issue relates to the  jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to order
a new  trial on the issue of insanity as contemplated by Swain.  The
appellant and respondent both take the position that the Court of Appeal has
the power pursuant to s. 686(1) (d) to set aside the conviction and find
the accused NCRMD, or order a new trial on the basis that there has been a
miscarriage of justice under ss. 686(1) (a)(iii) and 686(2) .   However,
the appellant submitted that the Court of Appeal has the ability to send the
trial back on a limited issue while the respondent argues that the trial should
be a trial de novo.

 

62                              
Section 686 (l)(a) and (d) and s. 686(2)  of the Criminal
Code  provide:

 

686. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand
trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of
appeal 

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, 

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 








                                               . . .

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to
stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may
exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in
section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the
circumstances.

 

(2)  Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under
paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

 

(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or 

 

(b) order a new trial.

 

63                              
In Mailloux it was held that a court of appeal should substitute
a verdict of NCRMD in place of a conviction  when insanity is raised for the
first time pursuant to s. 613(1)(d),  the predecessor of  s. 686(1) (d). 
In the present case, the Court of Appeal declined to make a finding with
respect to NCRMD and instead ordered a new trial because, as the majority
stated at para. 64, “the fact pattern here is complex and a number of
witnesses, possibly on both sides, may be required”.     

 

64                              
While the Criminal Code  clearly contemplates a court of appeal
making a determination on the issue of NCRMD, it is ambiguous as to whether a
court of appeal has the power to order a new trial if it comes to the
conclusion that it cannot make a dispositive determination with respect to
NCRMD.

 

In Mailloux
Lamer J. in discussing the predecessor sections to s. 686  stated at p.
1040:

 

What was then the purpose of s. 1016(4)?  In
seeking an answer one must not overlook the fact that a new trial could be
triggered through the general provisions of s. 1014 only if there had been
below an error of law, unreasonable findings, or miscarriage of justice as
regards the issue of insanity.  This could occur only if insanity was an issue
raised at trial.  In my view, s. 1016(4) was introduced to enable a court of
appeal to give some relief, albeit incomplete, to the accused when the insanity
issue was raised for the first time in appeal.








In Buxbaum,
supra, similar circumstances arose, and the Ontario Court of Appeal in
reviewing Mailloux was of the opinion that it was not open to a court of
appeal to order a new trial.  At pp. 32-33 the court held:

 

It appears then that in circumstances such as
these, when the defence of insanity was not raised at trial for whatever
reason, no appeal lies to this court under s. 686(1) (a) on the grounds
that there has been a miscarriage of justice, and there is no power to set
aside the verdict and direct a new trial on such grounds.  Nor have we the
power in such circumstances to direct a new trial before a jury limited to the
defence of insanity, as was done by this court in Gorecki, supra.

 

65                              
Mailloux dealt with the reasonableness of the jury’s finding on 
a defence of NCRMD, not with the defence of NCRMD being raised for the first
time at the  appeal.  To that extent and in the context of this appeal the
observations of Lamer J. are not determinative of the question raised here. 
McEachern C.J.B.C. distinguished Buxbaum on its facts, noting that it
did not involve the unusual  history and conduct of an accused like the
respondent.  It is my opinion that it is in the interests of justice that  Mailloux 
be  read  to recognize that where the defence of NCRMD is not raised at the
trial and if the court of appeal concludes that it cannot make a determination with
respect to NCRMD it is within the jurisdiction of the court of appeal in
avoiding a miscarriage of justice, to order a new trial.   In most cases it is
likely that the court of appeal would have sufficient evidence to determine the
NCRMD question.  It is only in cases where the facts are complex and the court
concludes that further evidence is required that  a new trial would be ordered.


 








66                              
Sections 686(1) (a)(iii) and 686(2) (b) provide a court of
appeal with the  jurisdiction to order a new trial.  The submission that s.
686(1) (d) is an all- encompassing stand-alone section regarding the
court of appeal’s jurisdiction governing an appeal from a conviction with
respect to an issue of NCRMD is not persuasive.  The reference to the issue of
NCRMD in the opening passage of s. 686(1)  must allow a court of appeal to order
a new trial to prevent a miscarriage of justice flowing from a failure to raise
the issue of NCRMD at the trial.

 

67                              
          Paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d)
of s. 686(1)  all begin with the permissive  word “may” clearly indicating that
Parliament was conferring permissive powers on the courts of appeal in this
regard.  The permissive nature of these paragraphs allows a court of appeal the
flexibility to act in the interests of justice as fully discussed in Buxbaum.  
 

 

68                              
This conclusion is buttressed by the comments of Lamer J.  in Mailloux
at pp. 1037-38  where a similar issue with respect to the interplay between
ss. 613(1)(a) and 613(1)(d), the predecessor sections to ss.
686(1)(a) and 686(1)(d), is discussed.   Allowing s. 686(1)(a)
to operate in conjunction with s. 686(1)(d) does not render s. 686(1)(d)
redundant.  Without s. 686(1)(d) a court of appeal would not be able to
substitute a verdict of NCRMD as ss. 686(1)(a) and 686(2)  alone do not
provide for this remedy.  

 

Issue 4 

 

69                              
While I agree with the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
to order a new trial I respectfully disagree with their decision to limit the
trial to the issue of NCRMD.  The appellant submitted that the Court of Appeal
is empowered to limit a new trial pursuant to s. 686(8) . 

 

686. . . .

 

(8)  Where a court of appeal exercises any of the
powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.








The appellant
submitted that the setting aside or quashing of a conviction does not
necessarily result in a full presumption of innocence for the accused on
re-trial unless the factual finding of guilt is set aside.  According to the
appellant this proposition is particularly so when dealing with the defence of
mental disorder as that defence is usually raised after a finding of guilt has
been made, but before a conviction has been entered.  This is in contrast to
most other defences that are raised prior to a finding of guilt.

 

70                              
The respondent countered  by raising concerns related to the
respondent’s right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence as guaranteed
by ss. 7  and 11 (d)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The
respondent disagreed with Doherty J.A.’s interpretation of ss. 686(8)  and
686(2)   in R. v. Wade (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 39 (Ont. C.A.).  While s.
686(8) overlaps with s. 686(2)  the respondent submitted that s. 686(2)  is a
specific provision and the general provision of s. 686(8)  cannot derogate from
it.  It is a rudimentary principle of statutory interpretation that general
words do not derogate from special provisions. 

 

71                              
The principles enunciated by the Chief Justice, for the majority, in R.
v. Thomas, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 535 (being released concurrently with these
reasons), are helpful in resolving the case on appeal.  Thomas was charged with
the second degree murder of his common law spouse and pleaded the defence of
intoxication in an effort to vitiate the specific intent element required for
second degree murder and raise the option of manslaughter.  The British
Columbia Court of Appeal ordered a new trial restricted only to whether Thomas
was guilty of second degree murder or the lesser included offence of
manslaughter. 

 








72                              
As determined  in Thomas, orders issued pursuant to s. 686(8) are
ancillary in nature and cannot be inconsistent or at direct variance with a
court of appeal’s disposition under s. 686(2) .  When a new trial is ordered
pursuant to s. 686(2)  a court of appeal’s ability to make an ancillary order
pursuant to s. 686(8) is caveated by the condition that justice requires  that
order.  In Thomas, the Chief Justice held that when a court of appeal
quashes a trial by jury conviction on the basis that a miscarriage of justice
has occurred and orders a new trial, it must order a full new trial.  Section
686(8) does not in such circumstances provide the authority to order a limited
new trial.

 

73                              
In following the principles of Thomas, the British Columbia Court
of Appeal did not have the jurisdiction to limit the scope of the new trial to
which the accused was entitled.  The Court of Appeal quashed the accused’s
conviction but restricted his new trial to the issue of NCRMD.  This order
restricted the outcome of the respondent’s trial to two possible verdicts, not
guilty by reason of NCRMD or guilty.  The presumption of innocence is integral
to ensuring a fair trial which is the mission of our criminal justice system. 
The principle of a fair trial is obviously offended by a trial that precludes a
verdict of not guilty.

 








74                              
A limited trial which restricts the  accused’s right to control his 
defence, offends a fundamental principle of justice and is an untenable
result.  The accused must be able to put forward whatever defence he has.  In
the circumstances of this case the respondent should be granted that
opportunity.  An accused is able to raise the defence of NCRMD at any time
during his or her trial or wait to raise the defence once the trier of fact has
made a determination of guilt.  Swain also contemplated that if evidence
led with respect to a mental disorder was not sufficient to convince the trier
of fact that the accused was NCRMD, such evidence could be considered on the
issue of whether the accused had the requisite mens rea.   In
this light, it is evident that an accused’s ability to make full answer and
defence could be significantly prejudiced in his defence by restricting his
trial to the issue of NCRMD.  In this respect, the issue of NCRMD is different
from the issue of entrapment and, as the reasons in R. v. Pearson,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 620 (released at the same time as these reasons), indicate, the
latter allows a distinct approach.

 

75                              
The appellant (Crown) in their supplementary factum raised the issue of
whether an appellant can leave this Court with less than obtained in the Court
of Appeal:  R. v. Barnes, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449, at p. 466, and Guillemette
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 356, at p. 364.  The respondent did not file
a cross appeal with respect to the issue of the limited trial and therefore if
the appellant (Crown) had not appealed to this Court the new trial would still
be limited to the issue of NCRMD.  Two difficulties arise from this
proposition.  Barnes and Guillemette both dealt with the position
of an accused person as opposed to that of the Crown.  In addition, the issue
of whether to order a  new trial or a limited trial is an issue of jurisdiction
and accordingly one that this Court can raise on its own.  Given our finding
that the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to order a limited trial,
this Court is left with no option but to order a new trial.  Section 695(1)  of
the Criminal Code  states:

 

695. (1)  The Supreme Court of Canada may,
on an appeal under this Part, make any order that the court of appeal might
have made and may make any rule or order that is necessary to give effect to
its judgment.

on appeal from the british columbia court of appeal 

 

Criminal law -- Appeals -- Powers of court of
appeal -- Accused convicted of second degree murder following jury trial --
Court of Appeal ordering new trial limited to issue of whether accused guilty
of second degree murder or manslaughter --  Whether Court of Appeal had
jurisdiction to make order for limited new trial -- Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , s. 686(8) .

 








The accused was charged with second degree murder in
relation to the shooting death of his common law partner.  The incident
occurred in the presence of an eyewitness who testified that the accused had
killed his partner.  The accused relied on the defence of intoxication in
support of his position that he should be convicted of manslaughter.  In his
closing address to the jury, defence counsel conceded that his client caused
the death of his partner by means of an unlawful act.  The accused was
convicted of second degree murder and, because of ineffective legal
representation, filed a notice of appeal more than two years after his
conviction. In the meantime, a number of trial exhibits were destroyed.  The
Court of Appeal granted the motion to extend time to file the notice of appeal,
allowed the appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial pursuant to
s. 686(2)  of the Criminal Code .  The court held that the trial
judge had not adequately answered questions from the jury on the issue of
intent and intoxication. The court also issued an ancillary order under
s. 686(8) , confining the new trial to the issue of whether the accused was
guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.

 

Held (L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The
appeal should be allowed and a full new trial ordered. 

 

Per Lamer C.J. and
Cory, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.:  Section 686(8)  does not
confer unlimited discretion on a court of appeal to issue ancillary orders.  In
addition to being constrained by what justice requires, a court of appeal
should not issue an order that is at direct variance with the court’s
underlying judgment.  Any order made under s. 686(8)  must also be
consistent with s. 686 when read in its entirety.  A court of appeal must
thus assess whether it has jurisdiction to issue a particular ancillary order
under s. 686(8)  having regard to the basis on which the appeal is disposed
of and its various powers under s. 686 generally. 

 








The Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to issue an
order limiting the accused’s new trial to the issue of whether he is guilty of
second degree murder or manslaughter.   Orders limiting the scope of a new
trial after granting an appeal from a jury verdict do not accord with the
principles underlying the powers granted to courts of appeal under
s. 686.  While s. 686(4) applies only to appeals from acquittal, and
this case deals with an appeal from a conviction, that subsection offers
guidance as to the extent of an appeal court’s jurisdiction under
s. 686(8)  to order a limited new trial in a jury case.  Under
s. 686(4)(b)(i), a court of appeal could not issue the kind of
order that was issued in this case.  To do so would be tantamount to entering a
partial conviction against the accused, which s. 686(4)(b)(ii)
specifically prevents the appeal court from doing.  Therefore, the words “new
trial” in s. 686(4)(b)(i) mean a full new trial and the same  words
in s. 686(2) (b) should be given a like meaning, at least where
there has been a jury trial. 

 

Further, there is  no power under s. 686(2) (b)
allowing an appellate court to substitute a finding of guilt for any other
offence.  The Court of Appeal’s order in this case amounts to a finding of
guilt for, at the least, manslaughter, constituting a substituted verdict for
the jury’s conviction of second degree murder.  Section 686(8)  does not extend
so far as to provide authority for such an order in the circumstances of a jury
trial.  As a matter of principle, appeal courts should not restrict the
plenitude of the jury’s jurisdiction on a new trial by confining the scope of
the issues normally within its province.  In ordering a limited new trial, the
Court of Appeal attempted to circumscribe the duties of the jury to deciding
between manslaughter and second degree murder.  The jury is precluded from
entering a verdict of not guilty.

 








This case also illustrates that there may be dangers
in restricting the ambit of new trials before a jury. Here, the questions posed
by the jury to the trial judge indicate that the jury struggled with the issue
of mens rea.  Given the fundamental nature of those questions, were it
not for the fact the accused’s counsel conceded to the jury that his client had
killed his partner and asked for a finding of guilty of manslaughter, it is
unlikely that the Court of Appeal would have had any confidence in the accused’s
liability even for manslaughter.  A limited new trial in this case  would bind
the accused to concessions made at the first trial which could limit his right
to full answer and defence at the second trial and impinge on his presumption
of innocence as protected by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Furthermore, since the accused’s trial,
there have been important developments in the law regarding the relationship
between mens rea, intent and intoxication, including the enactment of
s. 33.1  of the Criminal Code  with respect to the defence of
self-induced intoxication. It would be inappropriate in these circumstances to
constrain the issues to be placed before the second jury. 

 








Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  When a court of appeal orders a new
trial pursuant to s. 686(2)  of the Criminal Code , s. 686(8) 
allows the court to make “any order, in addition, that justice requires”.  In
this context, the remedial purpose of s. 686(8)  is to ensure that the
interests of justice are protected where ordering a new trial alone would not
ensure that justice is done.  This remedial purpose should be broadly construed
in order to enhance the ability of appellate courts to respond in a measured
way to the nature and extent of the error made at trial.  A court of appeal’s
jurisdiction under s. 686(8)  to make all kinds of orders, including any
ancillary order restricting the issues of a new trial, is limited only by what
“justice requires”. What “justice requires” in a particular situation will vary
and should be determined by the court of appeal on a case-by-case basis. The
determination of what “justice requires” is informed by the remedial purpose of
s. 686(8)  and involves a consideration of both the individual interest of
the accused in a fair trial and the collective interest in the proper
administration of justice.  In addition, the language of s. 686(8)  is
inconsistent with a determination that certain classes of orders are outside
its scope. While the discretion granted under s. 686(8)  to appellate
courts is not unlimited, the proper approach for this Court is to review the
exercise of that judicial discretion on a case-by-case basis and not to
conclusively place entire classes of orders outside the jurisdiction of a court
of appeal.  Section 686(4) , which is not at issue in this case, cannot be used
to limit the jurisdiction granted to appellate courts by s. 686(8) .

 

An order under s. 686(8)  restricting a new trial
to limited verdicts is an exceptional remedy that will be required by justice
in “special circumstances”.  Such an order may exceptionally be available where
it is beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the guilty act and the
only outstanding issue relates to the legal quality of that act.  In this
case,  identity was not an issue at trial.  Defence counsel admitted to the
jury that the accused had caused the death of his partner by means of an
unlawful act and that he was accordingly guilty of at least manslaughter. 
There was also overwhelming evidence tendered at trial against the accused.
This led the Court of Appeal to conclude that there was no doubt that the
accused killed his partner. In these special circumstances, the Court of
Appeal’s order restricting the new trial to limited verdicts of manslaughter or
second degree murder was appropriate and in accordance with the requirements of
justice.

 








The order is not inconsistent with the presumption of
innocence guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .   Here, the
Crown has already discharged its burden with respect to the other elements of
the crime and the jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
killed his partner.  The trial judge’s error relates to his instructions on the
issue of intent.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal only revived the elements
relevant to the issue of intent.  On those elements, the accused is entitled to
a full presumption of innocence and the Crown must prove the intent required
for second degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The same reasoning refutes
the suggestion that a new trial on restricted issues violates the right to a
jury trial guaranteed by s. 11 (f) of the Charter . 
Furthermore, the accused will suffer no prejudice arising from the order.  The
restricting order corrects the error made at trial, returns the accused to the
same position he was in at the conclusion of the trial, and permits him to
fully litigate the only live issue -- his level of intent -- that remains
undecided by a properly and fully instructed jury.  Lastly, the changes in the
law regarding intent and intoxication since the accused’s trial are not
relevant to this case because there is no suggestion that the accused was in a
state resembling that of extreme intoxication akin to automatism.

 

The Court of Appeal did not err in hearing the motion
to extend time at the same time as the appeal and in relying on the Crown’s
affidavits.

1                                  
The Chief Justice -- This
appeal, along with the two others being released with it, R. v. Warsing,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 579, and R. v. Pearson, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620,  deal with
the powers of courts of appeal under s. 686  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 . The particular issue that arises in this case is whether
on an appeal from a conviction, s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code , which
provides that a court of appeal may make “any [additional] order . . . that
justice requires”, authorizes it to order a new trial limited to the issue of
whether the accused is guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter. This
question was raised in another case which recently came before this Court but
that case was ultimately decided on other grounds:  R. v. Wade, [1995] 2
S.C.R. 737.  I wish to state at the outset that my decision in this case
focuses on an appellate court’s powers with respect to appeals from jury
verdicts.  I leave for another day the question of whether the same principles
would apply to appeals from decisions by a judge alone and whether, in that
case, s. 686(8)  might allow a court of appeal to limit the defences available
to an accused on a second trial.   In addition, for the reasons given by
Justice Major and myself in Pearson, the issue of entrapment presents
such a special set of circumstances for appeal courts that it justifies a
different approach to s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code  than that which I
take in this case.                                 

 

I.  Factual
Background

 

2                                  
The appellant, Mr. Thomas, was charged with second degree murder in
relation to the shooting death of his common law partner, Ms. Alexander.  The
incident occurred in the presence of a certain Ray Davis who testified that the
accused killed Alexander.  The only serious issue that arose at trial was
whether Mr. Thomas intended to cause the victim’s death, thereby committing
murder.  The appellant relied on the defence of intoxication in support of his
position that he should be convicted of the lesser included offence of
manslaughter.  In his closing address to the jury, counsel for the appellant
conceded that his client caused the death of Ms. Alexander by means of an
unlawful act.  The accused was convicted of second degree murder on March 19,
1993.  








 

3                                  
A notice of appeal against conviction was filed on Thomas’ behalf on May
29, 1995, almost two years out of time.  This delay in filing an appeal was
apparently attributable to the questionable conduct of the lawyer retained by
British Columbia Legal Services to advise the accused at that point in time. 
These regrettable circumstances resulted in a breakdown in communication
between the accused, his lawyer and the Legal Services Society of British
Columbia.  In the meantime, in September 1993, the Crown gave permission for
most trial exhibits to be destroyed.  Taken as a whole, these exhibits
confirmed the oral testimony of Davis, the only eyewitness to the shooting, and
assisted the Crown in establishing that Thomas killed Alexander.  

 

4                                  
Given the fact that the accused had fallen prey to ineffective, if not
negligent, legal representation, the Court of Appeal agreed to hear the
appellant’s motion to extend time for bringing an appeal against his
conviction.  In fact, the Court of Appeal heard the motion to extend time and
the appeal against conviction at the same time, on January 6, 1997.  The next
day, in oral reasons for judgment, the Court of Appeal granted the motion to
extend time, allowed the appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial
pursuant to s. 686(2)  of the Criminal Code : (1997), 85 B.C.A.C. 303. 
Lambert J.A. held that a new trial was required in light of the failure of the
trial judge to answer clearly the questions of the jury with respect to intent
and intoxication.  However, the Court of Appeal went on to issue an ancillary
order under s. 686(8) , confining the new trial to the issue of whether the
accused was guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.  It is the limited
character of this new trial order that Mr. Thomas challenges in this appeal. 

 

II.  The
Judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal

 








5                                  
The Court of Appeal decided to hear the motion for extension of time and
the appeal on the merits in a single hearing in order to save the court’s
time.  The Court of Appeal also proceeded in this manner because the Crown had
initially argued that an extension of time should only be granted if the appeal
were limited to the issue of whether the accused was guilty of second degree
murder or manslaughter.  

 

6                                  
The Court of Appeal allowed the appellant’s motion.  It held that the
failure of the trial judge to answer properly questions from the jury on the
relationship between intent and intoxication left the jury confused about the
state of the law.  In these circumstances, it was unsafe to uphold a conviction
resting on the jury’s verdict, and a new trial had to be ordered.  However, on
the basis of the evidence tendered at trial, there was no doubt that the appellant
had killed Ms. Alexander.  Identity was not in issue at the trial. 
Furthermore, some relevant exhibits had been destroyed before the appellant
filed his notice of appeal two years late.  For these reasons, the Court of
Appeal concluded that the new trial should be confined to the issue of whether
the verdict should have been one of second degree murder or manslaughter. 
Lambert J.A. held that the court had jurisdiction to make such an order by
virtue of s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code , as interpreted by the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Wade (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 39.  The court also
extended the time for the accused to bring an appeal on sentence.

 

III.   Issues
on Appeal

 








7                                  
In this Court, Mr. Thomas relied on a number of grounds for appeal.  In
his submission, not only did the Court of Appeal lack jurisdiction to order a
limited new trial, it should not have heard the appeal on the merits at the
same time as the motion for extension of time.  Furthermore, he argued that the
court should not have considered the affidavit evidence tendered by the Crown
to prove the destruction of exhibits.  It is suggested that taking this
affidavit into account on the appeal on the merits supplanted the production of
viva voce evidence.  The appellant also contended that the Court of
Appeal erroneously relied on the destruction of evidence to limit the issues to
be addressed on the new trial.  In his submission, the rights of an accused
should in no way be prejudiced by what he characterizes as the “negligence of
[his] former Counsel”.  Finally, the appellant argued that the “New Trial by
Jury cannot be bound to a restricted decision according to the Criminal Code 
and Charter of Rights ” (appellant’s factum at para. 4).  In particular, Mr.
Thomas submitted that the ancillary order deprived him of his right to be tried
by a jury.

 

8                                  
In my opinion, the central issue raised by this appeal relates to the
authority of the Court of Appeal to place limits on its order for a new trial
and thereby confine the issue before the jury to the question of whether the
accused is guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.  Given my conclusion
on this question, it is not necessary to consider the appellant’s other
arguments.  In any event, it seems to me that Mr. Thomas misinterprets the
reasons of the Court of Appeal.  On my reading of Lambert J.A.’s judgment, the
Court of Appeal would have ordered a limited new trial independent of the
destruction of evidence, for the sole reason that identity was not at issue. 
Be that as it may, with respect,  it is my opinion that the Court of Appeal
lacked authority to restrict the scope of the accused’s new trial in the manner
it did. 

 

IV.  The
Legislation

 

9                                  
The relevant portions of s. 686  of the Criminal Code  state:

 

686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against
a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or
not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal

 








(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not
properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted
on another count or part of the indictment,

 

(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any ground
mentioned in paragraph (a),

 

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any
ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred; or

 

(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial
court had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was
convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered
no prejudice thereby;

 

(c) may refuse to allow the appeal where it is of the opinion
that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion respecting the effect of a
special verdict, may order the conclusion to be recorded that appears to the
court to be required by the verdict and may pass a sentence that is warranted
in law in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court; or

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to
stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may
exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in
section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the
circumstances.

 

(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under
paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

 

(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

 

(b) order a new trial.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal, the court
of appeal may

 








(a) dismiss the appeal; or

 

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

(i) order a new trial, or

 

(ii) except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge
and jury, enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in
its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in
law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the
trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted
in law.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the
powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.

 

 

V.   The
Court of Appeal’s Jurisdiction Under Section 686(8)

 








10                              
The case at bar raises the important question of the scope of the powers
bestowed upon a court of appeal under s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code . 
It provides that a court of appeal issuing an order under s. 686(2) , (4) , (6) 
or (7)  “may make any order, in addition, that justice requires”.  Before us,
the Crown argued that this subsection calls for as generous an interpretation
as possible.  In its view, the unambiguous language of subs. (8) should be
given its plain, unfettered meaning:  a court allowing or dismissing an appeal
may make any additional order that justice requires.  Indeed, it
is a well-settled principle of statutory interpretation that “if the text is
clear, look no further”: P.-A. Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in
Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 241.  In the Crown’s submission, the general
wording of s. 686(8) , in contrast to the detailed language of other parts of s.
686 , confirms that subs. (8) must be read generously.  In light of the “broad
range of remedies” provided by s. 686 , the Crown argued that the remedial
powers of a court sitting on appeal should allow it to tailor remedies
proportionate to the harm found or said to have been occasioned as a result of
errors committed in the trial court (Crown’s factum at paras. 40-41).  Finally,
the Crown invoked the generous interpretation given by courts to phrases like
the “interest of justice” to argue that the British Columbia Court of Appeal
had jurisdiction to issue the order in appeal.  It also emphasized that an
examination of the requirements of justice must consider factors relevant both
to the accused and the overall administration of justice.

 

11                              
The Crown cited case law which does suggest that s. 686(8)  should be
interpreted purposively.  In Elliott v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 393, this
Court confirmed the power of a court of appeal to amend an indictment on a
count of possession of a restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.  The
original indictment charged the accused with trafficking in the specific drug
methylenedioxyamphetamine (“MDA”).  The evidence disclosed that the accused
trafficked in a salt of MDA.  The Court of Appeal held that the provisions of
the Food and Drugs Act  which listed among the restricted drugs MDA “or
any salt thereof” were insufficient to import a salt of MDA into a charge that
specified only MDA.  The Court of Appeal allowed an amendment to the indictment
to charge possession of a salt of MDA.   A new trial was ordered on that
charge.  The issue before our Court was whether the Court of Appeal exceeded
its powers in ordering the amendment of the original indictment to conform to
the evidence.  For the majority of the Court, Ritchie J. stated at p. 431: 

 

In my view when Parliament authorized the Court of
Appeal, in the exercise of its power, to order a new trial, to “make any order,
in addition, which justice requires” it must be taken as having authorized that
Court under those circumstances to make any additional order which the
ends of justice require whether the order for a new trial is dependent upon the
additional order or not. [Emphasis in original.]

 








12                              
A few years later, in R. v. Provo, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, Wilson J.
held that a court of appeal could issue an order remitting a matter to trial
for the purpose of entering a conviction on a sexual assault charge if the
proceedings on this count had previously been stayed on the basis of the Kienapple
principle (Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729).  In that
case, the conviction on a count of incest arising from the same delict had been
overturned on appeal.  In so doing, this Court stated at p. 19 that s. 686(8) 
grants “a broad ancillary jurisdiction” which should be interpreted “in a
generous manner consistent with its broad remedial purposes”.   Wilson J. also
held at p. 20 for a unanimous bench:  

 

There is, in my respectful view, no reasonable alternative to a broad
reading of the Court of Appeal’s ancillary jurisdiction under s. 613(8)
[now s. 686(8) ], given its broad wording and remedial purpose.  The section
gives the Court of Appeal a broad supplementary power to make any order that
justice requires when it exercises its appellate powers under the enumerated
subsections of s. 613.  [Emphasis added.]

 

13                              
These two cases support the Crown’s position up to a certain point.  
They make clear that s. 686(8)  does not prevent the issuance of orders that
serve the interests of the Crown in the administration of justice.  However,
they also underscore a key feature of orders issued under s. 686(8) , namely,
that they are ancillary in nature.  

 

14                              
In criminal matters, the jurisdiction of a court of appeal is purely
statutory: s. 674  of the Criminal Code .  See also Kourtessis v.
M.N.R., [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53, at p. 69, and R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1
S.C.R. 1764, at p. 1773.  As far as ordinary criminal appeals are concerned,
the jurisdiction and powers of a court of appeal are defined exhaustively in
Part XXI of the Criminal Code .  It is in light of this legislative
scheme that the specific power awarded by s. 686(8)  must be understood.  As
Justice R. E. Salhany notes (in Canadian Criminal Procedure (6th ed.
1994 (loose-leaf)), at p. 9-5):  “[i]t is often forgotten that the right of an
accused to appeal his conviction must be examined in light of the power of the
court of appeal to deal with that conviction”.  Other commentators confirm this
view (J. Sopinka and M. A. Gelowitz, The Conduct of an Appeal (1993), at
p. 111):








 

The statutory nature of appeals in criminal matters
reflects itself not only in the circumscription of appellate jurisdiction, but
in the scope of powers available to an appellate court in an appeal properly
brought before it.

 

Wilson J.
adopted this approach in Provo, supra, at p. 20, when she noted
that Parliament granted “broad supplementary power to make any order that
justice requires” to a court of appeal “when it exercises its appellate powers under
the enumerated subsections of s. 613” (now s. 686 ).  (Emphasis added.) 

 

15                              
This Court adopted a similar contextual interpretation of s. 686(8)  in R.
v. Hinse, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597.  In that case, the Court was asked to
reconsider an order refusing leave to appeal from an order of the Quebec Court
of Appeal quashing a conviction and staying proceedings for abuse of process. 
The Court confirmed that s. 686(8)  granted authority to a court of appeal to
stay criminal proceedings that violate the community’s sense of fairness.  The
majority also commented in more general terms about the scope of the power
granted by s. 686(8) .  It held that a s. 686(8)  order represents a
“fundamentally distinct judicial order” from an order for a new trial, but that
this former order is still “ancillary to the underlying judgment
rendered by the court” (emphasis in original): 

 

But the mere fact that a court of appeal may
exercise its power under s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code  independently of
a prior order under s. 686(2) (b) does not, in my view, change the
fundamentally ancillary and supplemental character of such an order. . . . The
court’s power under s. 686(8) , however, is not so inextricably wound up with
the fate of the appeal.  Indeed, the court’s power under s. 686(8)  is often
exercised with regard to considerations that are well removed from the issue of
the accused’s innocence or culpability.

 

(Hinse, supra, at paras. 24, 28 and 31.)

 

 








16                              
Turning to the question of whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear
appeals directed at s. 686(8)  orders, I concluded for the majority that there
were sound judicial policy reasons for allowing such orders to be appealed.  I
also commented, at para. 33, on the range of remedies available under s.
686(8) :

 

But a court of appeal’s residual order power under s. 686(8)  is not
subject to the same rigorous textual constraints as the court’s power under s.
686(2) (b).  Under its remedial power, a court of appeal may impose “any
order” which, in its discretion, “justice requires”.  As such, there is a
risk that a court of appeal may enter an order under s. 686(8)  which is at
direct variance with its underlying judgment.  A court of
appeal may allow an accused’s appeal and enter an acquittal under s. 686(2) (a),
but then, hypothetically, impose an order for costs against the accused for no
apparent reason notwithstanding the language of s. 683(3).  Or a court of
appeal could conceivably set aside an accused’s conviction, and then impose a
stay of proceedings for reasons completely unrelated to any alleged abuse of
process, thus transcending the limits upon a court of appeal’s discretion which
this Court articulated in Power, supra, at p. 620.  In both
such circumstances, the relevant discretionary order entered under s. 686(8) 
would be of questionable legality.  More importantly, the discretionary order
[could] be fundamentally incongruous with the court's disposition of the
appeal, arguably undermining the accused's success on the merits of her appeal.
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

After referring to the order issued by the Ontario Court of Appeal
in Wade, I added, at para. 34: 

 

Assuming without deciding the problematic question
of whether a court of appeal has the power under s. 686(8)  to direct a new
trial on certain limited issues, the policy risk presented by the unsupervised
exercise of this power is readily apparent.  A court of appeal could
effectively undermine an accused’s success on appeal by ordering a new trial
only on certain limited issues which are completely unrelated to the accused’s
underlying innocence or culpability.  The accused’s success in procuring a new
trial under s. 686(2) (b) would be eviscerated by the court’s “additional
order” under s. 686(8) .  [Emphasis added.]

 








17                              
The majority reasons in Hinse suggest that s. 686(8)  does not
confer unlimited discretion on a court of appeal.  In addition to being
constrained by what justice requires, a court of appeal should not issue an
order that is at direct variance with the court’s underlying judgment.      In
my view, a court of appeal must assess whether it has jurisdiction to issue a
particular ancillary order under s. 686(8)  having regard to the basis on which
the appeal is disposed of and its various powers under s. 686  generally.  

 

18                              
Before turning to the order made by the Court of Appeal in this case, I
note that the interpretation of s. 686(8)  I propose generally accords with the
many uses to which this provision has been put (see for example: R. v.
Stanley (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 216 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Cook (1979), 47
C.C.C. (2d) 186 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. B. (A.J.) (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 210
(Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Geauvreau, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 485; Kienapple, supra;
and Reference re Regina v. Gorecki (No. 2) (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 135
(Ont. C.A.)).  However, given the narrow basis on which I would dispose of this
case, I will say nothing about the propriety of those other uses of s. 686(8) . 
Its application in relation to entrapment is addressed in Pearson, supra.

 








19                              
In this case, the Court of Appeal determined that the trial judge did
not adequately answer questions from the jury on the issue of intent and
intoxication.  While the court does not specifically enumerate the paragraph of
s. 686(1) which is its basis for allowing the appeal, it can be inferred that
the Court of Appeal found there was a miscarriage of justice in that the jury’s
confusion was left unresolved.  In his reasons for judgment, Lambert J.A.
specifically found that it was “unsafe” to uphold the conviction (p. 306).  In
my view therefore, the basic or core judgment on appeal was that the jury’s
verdict was flawed and could not be affirmed.  In such circumstances, the
result must be a new trial (s. 686(2) ).  The question is whether the Court of
Appeal had jurisdiction to make an order for a restricted new trial.  I would
say at the outset that I do not dispute the Crown’s position that s. 686(8) 
provides courts of appeal with the power to make a considerable range of
ancillary orders.  (See, e.g., Pearson, supra.)  Nor would I
disagree with its suggestion that courts of appeal must have considerable
discretion in fashioning appropriate ancillary orders.  It is my view, however,
that there are limits on that power and discretion and, in this case, those
limits were exceeded.

 

VI.   The Operation of Section 686  with
Respect to Jury Trials

 

20                              
In addition to the above-noted limitations on a court of appeal’s powers
under s. 686(8) , I am of the view that any order made under it must be
consistent with s. 686  when read in its entirety.  That section provides the
jurisdiction of courts of appeal when disposing of appeals from conviction or
acquittal, including the power to order a new trial.  In making such an order
the court must obviously operate within the rules of its jurisdiction and
respect the principles underlying them.  

 

21                              
A very important limitation on the power of a court of appeal is
contained in s. 686(4).  In particular,  the powers accorded to a court of
appeal when allowing an appeal from a jury verdict of acquittal are
circumscribed by the language of subparas. (i) and (ii) of s. 686(4)(b)
which state:

 

(4)  Where an appeal is from an acquittal, the
court of appeal may

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

(i) order a new trial, or 

 

(ii) except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge
and jury, enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which,
in its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in
law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the
trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted
in law. [Emphasis added.]

 

 








The essence of
this provision is that where an acquittal is pronounced by a jury, a court of
appeal is powerless to substitute any finding of guilt, even for a lesser offence. 
Should the court wish to set aside the verdict, its only option is to order a
new trial pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(i).  

 

22                              
While this provision applies only to appeals from acquittal and we are
dealing here with an appeal from a conviction, I believe it offers guidance as
to the extent of an appeal court’s jurisdiction under s. 686(8)  to order a
limited new trial in a jury case.  It is clear to me that in ordering a new
trial under s. 686(4)(b)(i) a court of appeal could not issue the kind
of order that was issued in this case under the purported authority of s.
686(8) .  To do so would be tantamount to entering a partial conviction against
the accused which s. 686(4)(b)(ii) specifically prevents the appeal
court from doing.  Accordingly, a “new trial” for purposes of s. 686(4)(b)(i)
means a full new trial, not a limited one in the nature of that ordered
by the Court of Appeal in this case.  It further follows that the words “new
trial” in s. 686(2) (b) should be given a like meaning, at least in the
circumstances where there has been a jury trial.  

 

23                              
Section 686(2) provides that where an appeal court determines a
conviction is unreasonable, or that there was an error of law or a miscarriage
of justice, it may substitute an acquittal or order a new trial.   
There is no power to substitute a finding of guilt for any other offence.  The
court’s order in this case amounts to a finding of guilt for, at the least,
manslaughter, constituting a substituted verdict for the first jury’s conviction
of second degree murder.  Authority for such an order would have to be found in
s. 686(8)  and, for the reasons above, it is my view that that subsection does
not extend so far as to provide it in the circumstances of a jury trial.

 








24                              
The principle that is reflected in s. 686(4) is that great respect
should be shown to juries -- both the original jury that heard the case and,
more relevant for present purposes, the jury that will hear the new trial.  In
my view, appeal courts should not lightly restrict the plenitude of the jury’s
jurisdiction on a new trial by confining the scope of the issues normally
within its province.  Here, in ordering a new trial, the Court of Appeal
attempted to circumscribe the duties of the jury to deciding between manslaughter
and second degree murder.  In effect, the Court of Appeal’s order amounts to a
directed verdict for manslaughter, with instructions to the jury that it is
free to go further should it choose.  The jury is precluded from entering a
verdict of not guilty.  A limited new trial such as that proposed in this case
might be an option, a matter I refrain from pronouncing upon in this case, if a
court of appeal could send a matter back to the same jury.   In that
event, the jury could be reinstructed and asked to deal with the specific
issues of concern to the appellate court.  At the moment,
however, the Criminal Code  does not provide for a matter to be referred
back to the original trier of fact for a redetermination.

 

25                              
While the foregoing is sufficient to deal with this appeal, there are
other troubling aspects of the order granted by the court below that merit
comment.  The situation in this case, to my mind, illustrates the dangers of
restricting the ambit of a new trial before a jury.  Here, the jury posed two
specific questions to the trial judge: “What is the definition of intent?” and
“What role does impairment play in intent?”   Both of these questions clearly
demonstrate that the jury struggled with the issue of mens rea.  The Court
of Appeal found that the trial judge’s answers were limited and “unlikely to
resolve the jury’s confusion” (p. 306). 

 








26                              
Given the fundamental nature of those questions, were it not for the
fact that counsel for Mr. Thomas conceded to the jury that his client had
killed Ms. Alexander and asked for a finding of guilty of manslaughter, it is
unlikely that the Court of Appeal would have had any confidence in the
accused’s liability even for manslaughter.  This reinforces my view that orders
limiting the scope of a new trial after granting an appeal from a jury verdict
do not accord with the principles underlying the powers granted to courts of
appeal under s. 686 .  I would add that in this case such a limitation would in
effect bind the accused to concessions made at the first trial which could
limit his right to full answer and defence at the second trial and impinge on
his presumption of innocence as protected by ss. 7  and 11 (d)
respectively of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  

 

27                              
There is a further argument which illustrates the dangers of ordering
limited new trials.  In this case for example, Mr. Thomas’ first trial was held
in the spring of 1993.  Just over a year later, this Court released its
decision in R. v. Daviault, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 63.  Thereafter, Parliament
enacted s. 33.1  of the Criminal Code , with respect to the defence of
self‑induced intoxication.  Thus, there have been developments in the law
regarding the relationship between mens rea, intent and intoxication,
the very matters that concerned the Court of Appeal in this case.  In other
situations, the changes in the law between the first and second trials might be
even more dramatic.  To constrain the issues to be placed before a second jury
in such circumstances would be inappropriate.  

 

28                              
In light of the foregoing, I conclude that the Court of Appeal had no
authority to issue an order limiting the appellant’s new trial to the issue of
whether he is guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.  I specifically
leave aside the questions of whether such an order would be permissible in the
context of a trial by judge alone and whether s. 686(8)  would in that case
permit  an appellate court to limit the defences available to an accused on a
second trial, since I can think of other considerations that could well apply.
Further, as mentioned, the special situation that arises in entrapment cases
justifies a different approach: see Pearson, supra. Accordingly,
I would allow the appeal and order a full new trial for Mr. Thomas.








 

 

The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were
delivered by

 

//L’Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

29                       L’Heureux-Dubé J.
(dissenting)  -- I have had the advantage of the reasons of the Chief Justice
in this appeal and, with respect, I cannot agree with them nor with his
disposition of this case. This case, along with R. v. Warsing, [1998] 3
S.C.R. 579, and R. v. Pearson, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620, released with this
judgment, provides this Court with an opportunity to examine the scope of the
broad powers conferred to appellate courts under s. 686(8)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and I take the position that they were not
exceeded in this case.

 

30                       The essential facts can be quickly summarized.  The appellant
was convicted by a jury of the second degree murder of his common law partner,
Emily Alexander.  At trial, the appellant through his counsel admitted
that he had shot Ms. Alexander, but relied on a defence of intoxication in
order to support a verdict of manslaughter.  The appellant filed his notice of
appeal more than two years after his conviction and, in the interim, a number
of trial exhibits were destroyed.  On appeal, the British Columbia Court of
Appeal granted an extension of time to file the notice of appeal, allowed the
appeal on the basis that the trial judge had erred in answering questions from
the jury with respect to intent and intoxication and ordered a new trial. 
However, the Court of Appeal, relying on s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code ,
limited the new trial to the issue of whether or not the appellant should be
found guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter. 








 

I.   Issues

 

31                       The main issue raised by this appeal concerns the power of a
court of appeal under s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code  to make an order
restricting the scope of a new trial to the question of whether the accused is
guilty of manslaughter or second degree murder.  An additional issue arises
from the decision of the Court of Appeal to hear together the application for
extension of time and the appeal itself.

 

II.   Scope
of Section 686(8)  

 

32                       In order to determine the scope of the powers bestowed by s.
686(8) , it is necessary to interpret the expression “any order, in addition,
that justice requires” as it appears under that section.  It is well
established that the interpretation of a statute must give effect to
Parliament’s intent and must be guided by considering the language of the
section itself, its purpose, and the general objectives to which the section
relates  (P.-A. Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd
ed. 1991), at pp. 236-37 and 243-55; see R. v. Cuerrier, [1998] 2 S.C.R.
371, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., and R. v. Hinchey, [1996] 3 S.C.R.
1128, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., at para. 12).

 

33                           Section 686 provides:

 

 

686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or    against
a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally       responsible
on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is                              unreasonable
or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 








(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground                                     of
a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not
                                    properly convicted on a count or part of
the indictment, was                                                        properly
convicted on another count or part of the indictment,

 

(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any                                  ground
mentioned in paragraph (a),

 

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any                                 ground
mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be                                                                        decided
in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no                                                                                substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred; or

 

(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial                                 court
had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the                                                                            appellant
was convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion                                                                                     that
the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby;

 

c) may refuse to allow the appeal where it is of the opinion
that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion respecting the effect of a
special verdict, may order the conclusion to be recorded that appears to the
court to be required by the verdict and may pass a sentence that is warranted
in law in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court; or

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to
stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may
exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in
section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the
circumstances.

 

(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under    paragraph (1)(a),
it shall quash the conviction and

 

(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

 

(b) order a new trial.

 

(3) Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal
under subparagraph (1)(b)(i), it may substitute the verdict that in its
opinion should have been found and

 

(a) affirm the sentence passed by the trial court; or

 

(b) impose a sentence that is warranted in law or remit the
matter to the trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that
is warranted in law.








(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal, the court
of appeal may

 

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

 

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

(i) order a new trial, or

 

(ii) except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge
and jury, enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in
its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in
law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the
trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted
in law.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the     powers conferred
by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order,      in addition,
that justice requires.

 

34                       Section 686 describes the general powers granted to appellate
courts to dispose of a criminal appeal.  It includes the power to grant a wide
range of specific remedies depending on the nature and the extent of the error
below.  For example, under s. 686(1)(b)(i) and s. 686(3), a court of
appeal may dismiss an appeal and substitute the verdict that in its opinion
should have been rendered where the court finds that the accused was properly
convicted on at least a count or a part of the indictment.  In addition, where
an appeal is from an acquittal and the verdict is not one of a court composed
of a judge and jury, s. 686(4) provides a court of appeal the power to replace
the verdict of acquittal with a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence
of which the accused should have been found guilty but for the error of law.

 








35                       The general objective of s. 686  is to promote finality in
criminal litigation, where that can be achieved, and to ensure that appellate
courts are vested with the authority to grant remedies proportionate to the
errors committed in the trial court.  Section 686  invests courts of appeal with
the discretion and authority necessary to deal with the various errors that
occur at the trial level in a manner which ensures that justice is done.

 

36                       Section 686(8) has a special role to play in this regard.  When
a court of appeal orders a new trial pursuant to s. 686(2)  of the Criminal
Code , s. 686(8)  allows the court to make “any order, in addition, that
justice requires”.  In this context, the remedial purpose of s. 686(8)  is to
ensure that the interests of justice are protected where ordering a new trial
alone would not ensure that justice is done.  This remedial purpose should be
broadly construed in order to enhance the ability of appellate courts to
respond in a measured way to the nature and extent of the error in the
proceedings below.

 

37                        I believe that it would be improper for this Court to state,
as the Chief Justice does, that as a blanket rule a court of appeal can never
order a new trial with limited verdicts.  In my opinion, the vast jurisdiction
of a court of appeal to make any order is limited only by what “justice
requires”.  The types of additional orders that “justice requires” will vary
greatly from case to case.  As such, the approach of Doherty J.A, writing for
the court in R. v. Bernardo (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 123 (Ont. C.A.), at
p. 131, is, in my view, the proper one in the analysis of what justice
requires:

 

 

The phrase “the interests of justice” is used
throughout the Criminal Code . It takes its meaning from the context in
which it is used and signals the existence of a judicial discretion to be
exercised on a case-by-case basis.

 








38                       Similarly, what “justice requires” in a particular situation
should be determined by the court of appeal on a case-by-case basis and that
court should not be restrained in the exercise of its judicial discretion to
fashion a particular type of  remedy under s. 686(8) .  It is up to our Court of
course, to review the exercise of that discretion on a case-by-case basis, and
to determine whether in the particular circumstances of a case, the order to
restrict the new trial to the resolution of certain issues is what “justice
requires” (R. v. Hinse, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597).

 

39                       The determination of what “justice requires” is informed by the
remedial purpose of s. 686(8)  and involves a consideration of both the
individual interest of the accused in a fair trial and the collective interest
in the proper administration of justice.  This is in accordance with the
interpretation of similar expressions, such as the  “interests of justice” used
in different sections of Part XXI of the Criminal Code  and  the
“principles of fundamental justice” from s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  (for the Criminal Code  see Palmer v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, s. 683(1) (d) (formerly
610(1)(d)); Bernardo, supra, s. 684(1) ;  R. v. Chek TV
Ltd. (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 383, per Craig
J.A. concurring, s. 683(5)  (formerly 610(5)); for s. 7  of the Charter 
see R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at p. 458, per
L’Heureux-Dubé J.; Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, at p. 539, per La Forest J.; Rodriguez v. British
Columbia (Attorney General), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519; Cunningham v. Canada,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 143; and R. v. Levogiannis, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475, at p.
486, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.).

 

40                       Section 686(8) provides that a court of appeal’s discretion to
make “any additional order” is limited only by what “justice requires”. The use
of the word “any” emphasizes that every kind of order is within the ambit of
that section.  The French text of s. 686(8) , which reads that a court of appeal
may “en outre rendre toute ordonnance que la justice exige”, confirms
the same wide breadth of the provision.

 








41                       The listing of specific remedies in other subsections of s.
686 , combined with the absence of any limiting language in s. 686(8) ,
reinforces the position that Parliament did not intend to restrict the scope of
a court of appeal’s powers under s. 686(8)  (a similar finding was made by
this Court regarding s. 443(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 487), in R. v. Multiform Manufacturing Co.,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 624, at p. 631).

 

42                       In Elliott v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 393, this Court
broadly interpreted the jurisdiction of a court of appeal to make any order
that justice requires under s. 686(8) .  Ritchie J., for the majority,
found that the British Columbia Court of Appeal had correctly exercised its
jurisdiction under s. 613(8) (now s. 686(8) ) in amending a count of the
indictment in order to ensure that it conformed to the evidence at trial.
Ritchie J. held at pp. 431-32:

 

 

In my view when Parliament authorized the Court of
Appeal, in the exercise of its power, to order a new trial, to “make  any
order, in addition, which justice requires” it must be taken as having
authorized that Court under those circumstances to make any additional order
which the ends of justice require whether the order for a new trial is
dependent upon the additional order or not. I do not think that the wide
powers conferred on the Court of Appeal by s. 613(8) are to be narrowly
construed but rather they are designed to ensure that the requirements of the
ends of justice are met, and are to be liberally construed in light of that
overriding consideration.  [Italics in original; underlining added.]

 

43                       Wilson J., delivering a unanimous judgment in R. v. Provo,
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, quoted the above passage with approval and
characterized the scope of s. 613(8) (now s. 686(8) ) at pp. 19-20, as
follows:

 

In exercising its power under s. 613(2) the Court of Appeal is given a
broad ancillary jurisdiction under s. 613(8) of the Code to make “any
order, in addition, that justice requires”.  This Court has construed the
powers granted to the Court of Appeal under s. 613(8) in a generous manner
consistent with its broad remedial purposes. 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 








There is, in my respectful view, no reasonable alternative to a
broad reading of the Court of Appeal’s ancillary jurisdiction under s. 613(8)
given its broad wording and remedial purpose.  The section gives the Court
of Appeal a broad supplementary power to make any order that justice requires
when it exercises its appellate powers under the enumerated subsections of s.
613. [Emphasis added.]

 

More recently,
in Hinse, supra, this Court confirmed that a generous
interpretation of s. 686(8)  which reflects its broad remedial purpose is
appropriate. 

 

44                       In addition, the Crown submitted an exhaustive list of case law
detailing  the wide variety of orders made by appellate courts under s.
686(8) .  Certain orders were made to: limit the new trial on the included
offence where the evidence could not support a finding of guilt on the offence
charged (R. v. Stanley (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 216 (B.C.C.A.); R. v.
Cook (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 186 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Ruptash (1982),
68 C.C.C. (2d) 182 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Popoff (1960), 129 C.C.C. 250
(B.C.C.A.)); amend a count of the indictment (Elliott, supra);
order a new trial pursuant to an amended information (R. v. Geauvreau,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 485); stay criminal proceedings which violate the community’s
sense of fair play and decency (Hinse, supra); or, dissolve a conditional
stay on a count to which the Kienapple principle against multiple
convictions was applied (Provo, supra).  These cases illustrate
the need to vest courts of appeal with a wide jurisdiction to make all kinds of
orders tailored to the error made below.

 

45                       The approach of the Chief Justice is to restrict at the outset
the types of orders which can be made pursuant to s. 686(8) .  He relies on an
analogy with s. 686(4) to determine that when a new trial is ordered is has to
be a full new trial and not a new trial with limited verdicts.  I disagree for
the following reasons.

 








46                       First, the language of s. 686(8)  and the broad interpretation that
mandates its broad underlying remedial purpose are inconsistent with a
determination that certain classes of orders are outside its scope.  While the
discretion granted under s. 686(8)  to appellate courts is not unlimited, the
proper approach is to review the exercise of that judicial discretion on a
case-by-case basis and not to conclusively place entire classes of orders
outside the jurisdiction of a court of appeal.

 

47                       Second, I find the analogy with s. 686(4) to be unconvincing. 
The Chief Justice recognizes at para. 22, that s. 686(4) deals with appeals
from an acquittal whereas this case deals with an appeal from a conviction
pursuant to s. 686(2) .  The wording of the two sections is different. Section
686(2) (b) does not provide for the restrictions imposed on jury verdicts
by s. 686(4)(b)(ii).  Therefore, there is no rationale for reading s.
686(4) as imposing restrictions on s. 686(2) .  The fact that s. 686(8) 
applies to both s. 686(4)  and s. 686(2)  does not mean that the restrictions
that apply to s. 686(4) apply to s. 686(2) .

 

48                       The Chief Justice states at para. 24 that “[t]he principle that
is reflected in s. 686(4) is that great respect should be shown to juries”. 
Again, this may be so regarding verdicts of acquittal by a jury, where
s. 686(4) restricts a court of appeal from changing that verdict.  On appeals
from verdicts of conviction by a jury however, there is nothing in s.
686(2)  and s. 686(8)  to indicate that the court of appeal is so limited.  In
fact, the court can set aside the verdict on the grounds that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, for example, and direct a
verdict of acquittal pursuant to s. 686(1)(a)(i) and s. 686(2) . 
Therefore, the application of s. 686(4), which is not at issue in this case,
cannot be used to limit the jurisdiction granted to appellate courts by s.
686(8) .

 








49                       The Chief Justice seeks to minimize the impact of limiting s.
686(8)  by restricting his interpretation to jury verdicts and leaving for later
the question of whether the same principles would apply to decisions by a judge
alone (paras. 1 and 28).  In fact, the text of s. 686(8)  makes no distinction
between trial with judge alone and with judge and jury and I see no reason for
this Court to create one.

 

50                      Having determined that the Court of Appeal of British Columbia
had the jurisdiction under s. 686(8)  to make all kinds of orders, limited only
by what justice requires, I will now turn to question of whether it can
restrict the new trial to verdicts of manslaughter or second degree murder.

 

 

III.    Power to Order a New Trial Restricted to
Manslaughter or Second Degree Murder Verdicts Under Section 686(8)

 

51                           The appellant submits that, generally, when a new trial is
ordered on the basis of misdirections on the defence of intoxication, it is a
full new trial and not a limited new trial.  Although usually all issues are
remitted to a new trial, in exceptional cases, such as where there is no
question that the accused committed the guilty act, s. 686(8) can apply to
limit the verdicts available on retrial.

 








52                           Orders made pursuant to s. 686(8) to restrict the issues on
a new trial have been made where the only issue at the end of the appeal
relates to the defence of entrapment or insanity.  For example, this Court’s
decision in Pearson, supra, upheld the order for a restricted new
trial on the issue of entrapment pursuant to s. 686(8).  Furthermore, the
Courts of Appeal of Ontario and British Columbia made additional orders
limiting a new trial to the issue of entrapment in R. v. Maxwell (1990),
61 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Barnes (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d)
368 (B.C.C.A.), aff’d [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449; R. v. Laverty (1990), 80 C.R.
(3d) 231 (B.C.C.A.), and supplementary reasons, November 1, 1990, Victoria
Registry V00270.  As well, a five-member panel of the Ontario Court of Appeal
restricted the retrial on the issue of insanity at the time of the commission
of the offence in Reference re Regina v. Gorecki (No. 2) (1976), 32
C.C.C. (2d) 135. 

 

53                           A new trial restricted to specific verdicts may also be
appropriate where the only issue at the end of the appeal is whether the
accused is guilty of manslaughter or second degree murder.  In R. v. Wade
(1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 39, reversed on another point [1995] 2 S.C.R. 737, the
Ontario Court of Appeal restricted the new trial to whether the accused was
guilty of manslaughter or second degree murder, thereby foreclosing the accused
from raising the defence of automatism already rejected by a previous jury.  
Doherty J.A. stated in Wade, supra, at p. 65:

 

From a  jurisdictional perspective, I can see no difference between
limiting a new trial to the issue of entrapment or insanity, and limiting a new
trial to the question of whether the appellant is guilty of murder or
manslaughter. The authorities, considered along with the language of s. 686(8)
and the command to interpret that language broadly found in R. v. [Provo],
supra, satisfy me that this court has the jurisdiction to limit a new
trial to the determination of whether the appellant committed murder or
manslaughter.               

 

54                           Doherty J.A. in Wade, supra, at pp. 65-66,
pointed out that trials limited to the issue of manslaughter or second degree
murder are not unknown.  These trials occur when the accused admits causing the
death of the victim but claims that he or she did not possess the state of mind
required for murder. 

 








55                           This said, I fully endorse the position of the Court of
Appeal in Gorecki (No. 2), supra, and in Wade, supra,
that an order restricting a new trial represents an exceptional remedy that
justice will require in “special circumstances”.  In the case at bar, the Court
of Appeal seems to have been guided by the “special circumstances” test set out
in Wade, supra, and Gorecki (No. 2), supra. I will
now turn to what constituted such “special circumstances” in these two cases. 
I will subsequently examine whether this case falls within such special
circumstances.

 

56                           In Gorecki (No. 2), supra, the accused was
convicted by a jury of the murder of his wife and the Court of Appeal was asked
to consider fresh evidence relating to his mental state at the time of the
commission of the offence.  At trial, the accused did not raise that question
and his only defence was that of accident.  The Court of Appeal found that the
fresh evidence might show that he was mentally ill and could not recognize his
illness, and therefore, this prevented him from making the insanity defence during
the trial.  Consequently, the court ordered a new trial limited to raising the
defence of insanity pursuant to s. 613(8) (now 686(8)).  The court observed at
p. 149:

 

The Court of Appeal where it orders a new trial is
empowered by s. 613(8) to make any order, in addition, that justice requires. 
While we exercise our power to direct a new trial, we are satisfied that
pursuant to s. 613(8) justice requires that in the special circumstances of
this case the accused should be limited to raising the defence of insanity,
the other defences having already been concluded on the first trial, affirmed
on appeal. [Emphasis added.]

 








57                           In Wade, supra, Doherty J.A. also held that
“special circumstances”  existed which warranted the order to limit the issues
at the new trial.  In that case,  defence counsel admitted that the accused had
attacked his wife and inflicted the injuries causing death and, at trial,
raised the defence of automatism brought on by a variety of sleep disorders. 
He was found guilty by a jury of second degree murder.  After an appeal and
another trial, a second jury found him again guilty of second degree murder. 
At the second trial, the judge decided not to leave manslaughter with the jury,
and this triggered the appeal.  Doherty J.A. recalled that the defence of
automatism brought by the accused was totally rejected by the jury, which was
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had killed his wife. 
Therefore, he ordered a restricted new trial as to whether the accused was
guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter. He wrote at p. 65:

 

Here, as in Gorecki, there is no doubt that the appellant
caused the death of the victim.  Nor, is there any doubt as to how he caused
that death. There is no suggestion that provocation, intoxication or any
other excuse or justification could possibly arise. This is emphatically not
a case, like some, where there exists a realistic possibility that a new trial
could take a radically different course than the previous trial.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

 

58                           A consideration of these two cases and a purposive
interpretation of  what “justice requires” leads me to conclude that an order
restricting the verdicts on a new trial may exceptionally be available where it
is beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the guilty act and the
only outstanding issue relates to the legal quality of that act by reason of
the accused’s mental state or by reason of possible excuses or defences, like
entrapment.

 

IV.   Application
to this Case

 

59                           Before making the order restricting the new trial, Lambert
J.A., for the court, noted that by the time the trial was concluded, there was
no doubt that the appellant shot Emily Alexander and this was not
contested by the defence.  However he found
that the trial judge left the jury confused in both his charge to them and in
his response to their questions about the definition of intent, and the
interrelationship between intent and intoxication.  Lambert J.A. held that it
would be unsafe to uphold the conviction in light of this confusion.  On the
basis that “identity was not in issue
at the trial” and that “some relevant evidence and exhibits have been
destroyed” ((1997), 85 B.C.A.C.
303, at p. 306), Lambert J.A. made the order limiting the new trial to the issue
of whether the appellant was guilty of manslaughter or second degree murder.








 

60                           I will deal first with the issue of prejudice to the Crown
due to the destruction of certain exhibits.  The Crown claims that due to the
lateness of the filling of the appellant’s notice of appeal, certain exhibits
were authorized to be destroyed and in fact were destroyed and as a result, the
destruction of these exhibits has detrimentally affected the Crown’s ability to
make its case in a new trial.  In addition, the Crown submits that it should
not be forced to suffer any potential diminution of its ability to prove its
case as a result of intervening events for which it bears no responsibility.

 

61                           However, the Crown concedes that the lateness in filling of
the notice of appeal was not the appellant’s fault.  Further, the Court of
Appeal found that the lengthy delay that triggered the destruction of the
exhibits was not the fault of the accused, but rather the result of a breakdown
in communications between the accused, the Legal Services Society of British
Columbia and his lawyer who was appointed by the Society.  In addition, the
appellant alleges that most of the exhibits that were destroyed can be
re-obtained or reconstructed.  The Crown does not disagree that this is
possible.  Therefore, on its own, I am of the view that the alleged prejudice
to the Crown is not sufficient to justify in itself the order made.

 

62                           The alternative basis upon
which Lambert J.A. makes his order for a limited trial is much more
compelling.  In his decision Lambert J.A. held that “[b]y the time that the trial was concluded it was
not contested by the defence that Mr. Thomas shot Emily Alexander” (p. 304), that “there was no doubt that Mr. Thomas shot Emily Alexander”,
and that “identity was not in issue at
the trial” (p. 306).  Referring to the
interpretation of s. 686(8) in Wade, supra, Lambert J.A. ordered
a new trial confined to the issue of whether the verdict should be one of
second degree murder or of manslaughter.

 








63                           There is no doubt in this case about the fact that the
appellant killed Ms. Alexander, nor is there any doubt about how it was
done.  Counsel for the appellant admitted to the jury that the appellant caused
the death of Ms. Alexander by means of an unlawful act, and that he was accordingly,
guilty of at least manslaughter,  as shown by these excerpts from his closing
address to the jury:

 

There is a difference between second degree murder
and manslaughter and His Lordship will advise you as to the differences and
what they are at law and his words on the law is final.  And there is no
doubt here Mr. Thomas shot Emily, there is no doubt about that and I would
never in my wildest dreams come before you and suggest otherwise.  We are
asking you to use your common sense here and I don’t attempt to persuade you
not to use it.  Clearly he shot Emily but you have to look at all the
circumstances surrounding that.  You have to look at what the law refers to
it as. Is it second degree murder? Is it manslaughter?

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Quite often in criminal trials we talk about many
things such as identity of the accused, and date, time, place, and jurisdiction
and other matters.  I have already indicated to you I don’t intend to be
arguing those matters, and I am not going to.  It’s very clear that the base
of the facts we know, we do know that Mr. Thomas shot Emily and there is no
doubt about that but what you have to determine is what his intent was.

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

My submission is there is a substantial body of
evidence and facts before you as to the level of intoxication and it’s my
submission there should be a reasonable doubt on the charge of second degree
murder.  I am not suggesting to you Mr. Thomas has not done anything. 
Clearly  Mr. Thomas shot and killed Emily and in my submission to you,
however, it’s manslaughter and not second degree murder. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

 

64                           Moreover, the trial judge specified in his instructions to
the jury that “[t]he nature of this case is such that it is unlikely that you
will consider an acquittal because the evidence of the shooting is
uncontroverted”.  He then led the jury to consider a verdict of either
manslaughter or second degree murder.

 








65                           Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Chief Justice that,
but for the admission of guilt by counsel for the appellant, “it is unlikely
that the Court of Appeal would have had any confidence in the accused’s
liability even for manslaughter” (para. 26).  There was overwhelming
evidence tendered at trial against the appellant.  This evidence and defence
counsel’s admission led the Court of Appeal to conclude that there was no doubt
that the appellant killed Ms. Alexander.  As such, the order to restrict the
new trial in this case is not “completely unrelated to the accused’s underlying
innocence or culpability” or “at direct variance with its underlying
judgment” (see Hinse, supra, at para. 34 and 33 (emphasis in
original)) but is in fact totally connected to the appellant’s guilt.  A
similar approach was applied by the majority’s decision in Pearson, supra,
at para. 14.

 

66                           The appellant submits, albeit in a summary fashion, that
the order made by the Court of Appeal in this case is inconsistent with the
presumption of innocence.  His argument stems from the fact that the order
precludes the court at the new trial from considering a verdict of acquittal.

 

67                           He also alleges that the order made by the Court of Appeal
in this case breaches ss. 7  and 11 (f) of the Charter , without
arguing further.   Although the Chief Justice alludes to ss. 7  and 11 (d)
Charter  violations, he does not draw any conclusion in that respect. 
The Charter  issues are raised for the first time in this Court.  As
such, we do not have the benefit of the reasons of the Court of Appeal and no
constitutional questions were stated.  I will, however, comment briefly on
these alleged violations.

 








68                           The presumption of innocence, guaranteed by s. 11 (d)
of the Charter ,  only operates “until” the accused has been “proven
guilty according to law”.  Someone who has been proven guilty at trial and
appeals his or her conviction can no longer claim the presumption of innocence
(see R. v. Farinacci (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v.
Noble, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, at para. 107).  The presumption of innocence is
revived on appeal only in respect of the elements upon which the court of
appeal sets aside the verdict.  If the court sets aside the entire verdict,
then the presumption of innocence is revived for all elements of the crime (R.
v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p. 912, per Sopinka J.).  If, on
the other hand, the court finds that some elements of the offence have been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt and orders a new trial restricted to the
remaining elements, the presumption of innocence is revived only with respect
to those  elements.  So long as the Crown bears the burden of proving every
element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence
is satisfied.  Where a new trial is restricted to limited issues, this is on
the basis that the Crown has already discharged this burden with respect to the
other elements of the crime.  Here, the error made with the instructions
related wholly to the issue of intent and did not affect the fact that the jury
found beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant killed his common law
partner.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal only revived the elements relevant
to the issue of intent.  On those elements, the accused is entitled to a full
presumption of innocence.  In this case, the practical effect of this
presumption is that the Crown must prove the intent required for second degree
murder beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

69                           The same reasoning answers the suggestion that a new trial
on restricted issues violates the right to a jury trial guaranteed by s. 11 (f). 
The jury found the accused guilty in a trial where the only error related to
the mental element of the crime.  It follows that the jury must have concluded
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the criminal act.  On the
new trial, another jury will decide on the remaining elements of the alleged
offence. The accused’s right to trial by jury is thus fully respected.

 








70                           It is also argued that in admitting at trial that he was
guilty of at least manslaughter, the appellant waived his right to be presumed
innocent and his  right to a trial by jury at a new trial limited to the issue
of whether or not he is guilty of manslaughter or second degree murder.  In
view of my conclusion that these rights have been fully respected, I need not
consider this submission.

 

71                           The appellant will suffer no prejudice arising from the
order made by the Court of Appeal in this case.  The only live issue that
remained at the end of the trial was whether he was guilty of second degree
murder or manslaughter.  In this respect, had the trial judge made no error, he
would, at a minimum, have been convicted of manslaughter.  Therefore, the
restricting order corrects the error made at trial and returns the appellant to
the same position he was in, and admitted being in,  at the conclusion of the
trial.  Doherty J.A. reached the same conclusion in Wade, supra. 
He stated at p. 65:

 

He [the accused] will have every opportunity to challenge the case for
the Crown on the issue of his intent, and to advance evidence which is relevant
to that intent.  He will be foreclosed from relitigating the voluntariness
of his conduct, but I see no prejudice or injustice in barring relitigation of
an issue which has already been determined by a properly instructed jury. I am
not aware of any principle of fairness which demands that an accused be given a
second chance to present a defence because an error in law, unrelated to that
defence, necessitates reversal of the verdict. That proposition carries the
so called “sporting theory” of criminal justice too far. [Emphasis added.]

 

As such,
limiting the new trial in this case to a determination of whether the appellant
is guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter is perfectly fair to the
appellant, in that it permits the appellant to fully litigate the only live
issue, his level of intent, that remains undecided by a properly and fully
instructed jury.

 








72                           To allow the appellant to disavow the acknowledgment of
guilt and seek an acquittal at the new trial would, moreover, bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.  In R. v. Buxbaum (1989), 70
C.R. (3d) 20 (Ont. C.A.), the accused sought to introduce fresh evidence on
appeal with respect to his mental state in the hopes of raising an insanity
defence.  However, during the  trial defence counsel deliberately chose not to
raise that defence.  The Court of Appeal refused to admit the fresh evidence
for the reason that it would not be in the “interest of justice” to do so,
because it would “permit the appellant to now lead this alternative defence in
this court” and to “permit him to resile from the position that he took before
the jury and, indeed, to take a position which is completely inconsistent with
it” (Buxbaum, at p. 35, to the same effect see Palmer, supra, 
at p. 775).

 

73                           The search for the truth and the conviction of the guilty
are certainly important parts of the collective interest in the administration
of justice. In this case, there is no doubt that the appellant shot the
deceased.  His counsel admitted that fact in his address to the jury.  What
Doherty J.A. wrote in Wade, supra, at p. 66 applies with force: 

 

Justice for the accused and the community is fully served by directing
a new trial where the appellant may have his level of culpability determined
according to law.  Justice no longer requires a determination of whether he is
culpable at all.  That determination has been fairly made.

 

74                           These considerations lead me to conclude that the order to
restrict the new trial to verdicts of manslaughter or second degree murder made
pursuant to s. 686(8) was perfectly appropriate considering the nature and the
extent of the wrong occasioned below and was required by justice in the special
circumstances of this case.

 








75                           Before examining the second issue, I would like to briefly
comment on the Chief Justice’s view at para. 27, that it could be detrimental
to the accused to have a limited new trial in a case dealing with intent and
intoxication since the law on these issues has changed since the appellant’s
first trial was held.  To illustrate his point, the Chief Justice refers to
this Court’s decision in R. v. Daviault, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 63, and the
enactment of s. 33.1  of the Criminal Code  dealing with the defence of
self-induced intoxication.  Such a change in the law, where relevant and
available on the facts, might be a reason to decline to make an order for a
restricted verdict under s. 686(8) .   However, no such change touched this
case.  There is no suggestion that the appellant was in a state resembling that
of extreme intoxication akin to automatism as per Daviault, supra. 
The only matter left in doubt at the end of the appeal was whether the accused
was guilty of murder or manslaughter.

 

V.   The
Motion for Extension of Time and to Order a New Trial

 

76                           On appeal, the Crown filed two affidavits to support its
position that it would be prejudiced in the conduct of a new trial due to the
destruction of exhibits and opposed the motion for extension of time on that
basis.  The appellant does not agree  that the application for extension of
time should have been tied to the determination that a new trial ought to be
ordered upon a limited basis.  Furthermore, the appellant submits that, in
determining whether s. 686(8) required a restricted new trial, the Court of
Appeal erred in relying on affidavits tendered by the Crown in relation to the
motion for extension of time.

 








77                           It is clear from the decision of the Court of Appeal that
it was in the interest of economy of judicial time that the court decided to
hear both matters together rather than consecutively.  There is no indication
that the appellant objected to that decision at the time.  Furthermore, the
appellant does not demonstrate that he suffered any real prejudice from that
decision, apart from his claim that the admission of the affidavits in the
conviction appeal gave the Crown an unfair advantage since it permitted the
Crown to introduce new evidence and took the appellant by surprise.  The
appellant could not possibly have been surprised by the Crown’s use of the
affidavits.  The Crown submitted that, if a new trial was ordered, it would
seek to restrict the scope of that new trial and would then rely in part on the
loss of some evidence to support its position.  Therefore, I conclude that the
Court of Appeal did not err in hearing the motion to extend time at the same
time as the appeal and in relying on the Crown’s affidavits.

 

VI.   Conclusion

 

78                           In conclusion, I find that s. 686(8) accords broad powers
to the Court of Appeal to grant remedies tailored to the errors made at trial
and includes the power to make any ancillary order limiting the issues of a new
trial.  These broad powers are only limited by what “justice requires”.  What
is required by justice will vary depending on particular circumstances and
should be determined on a case-by-case basis.  An order restricting the new
trial to limited verdicts is an exceptional remedy that will be required by
justice in “special circumstances”.  Such an order  may be appropriate where
there is no doubt that the accused committed the criminal act and the only
outstanding issue relates to the legal quality of that act.  Applying these
principles, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal’s order restricting
the new trial to limited verdicts of manslaughter or second degree murder, in
this case, was appropriate given the special circumstances and in accordance with
the requirements of justice.

 

VII.   Disposition

 

79                           For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

The accused was convicted by a jury of trafficking in
narcotics.  At his trial, his motion for a stay of proceedings based on
entrapment was dismissed after a hearing on the issue.  The Court of Appeal
allowed the accused’s appeal in part and ordered a new trial limited to the
issue of entrapment on the basis that the Crown had failed to disclose
information which could have been relevant to that issue.  The accused appealed
to this Court.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Cory, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.:   Entrapment is completely
separate from the issue of guilt or innocence. It is concerned with the conduct
of the police and the Crown and is dealt with at a separate proceeding from the
trial on the merits. Once the accused is found guilty of the offence, the
accused alone bears the burden of establishing that the conduct of the Crown
and/or the police amounted to an abuse of process deserving of a stay of
proceedings. Since entrapment is not related to the innocence of the accused
but to the faulty conduct of the state, it does not bring into play the
presumption of innocence. Under s. 686(8) of the Criminal Code , a
court of appeal has the power to make an ancillary order limiting the scope of
a new trial under s. 686(2)  when “justice requires” such an order.  In
light of  the unique nature of an entrapment proceeding after a verdict of
guilty, s. 686(8)  provides broad enough statutory authority on which to
rest the direction by an appeal court of an entrapment proceeding.  A new trial
limited to the issue of entrapment cannot be said to be at direct variance with
a court of appeal’s judgment.  Similarly, an order limiting a new trial to the
issue of entrapment does not contravene the principle that a “new trial” under
s. 686  means a full new trial since entrapment allegations lead to a two‑stage
trial in which the two stages are autonomous.  The result of an order limiting
a new trial to entrapment is thus an order for a full hearing on that issue.
Consequently, a court of appeal finding errors in the trial judge’s ruling on
entrapment has jurisdiction to limit a new trial to that sole issue.  While in
most successful appeals against conviction, the court of appeal which quashes
the conviction will also overturn the finding of guilt, the latter is not a
legally necessary consequence of the former.  Under s. 686(8), the court of
appeal retains the jurisdiction to make an “additional order” to the effect
that, although the formal order of conviction is quashed, the verdict of guilt
is affirmed, and the new trial is to be limited to the post-verdict entrapment
motion.

 

Per L’Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  For the reasons given by the minority in Thomas
and Warsing, the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to order a limited new
trial on the issue of entrapment under ss. 686(2)  and 686(8)  of the Criminal
Code . A new trial limited to the question of entrapment is consistent on
the facts of this case with what “justice requires”.

//The Chief Justice and Major J.//

 








1                                  
The Chief Justice and Major J. --
This  appeal raises a similar issue to that which this Court was asked to
consider in R. v. Thomas, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 535, and R. v. Warsing,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 579,  released with this judgment: does a court of appeal have
jurisdiction, by virtue of its power to make additional orders under s. 686(8) 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , to order a new trial
limited to a specific issue? The appellant, Mr. Pearson, is challenging a
decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal to allow his appeal in part and order a
new trial limited to the issue of entrapment: (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 535.  It
is contended, amongst other things, that the  Court of Appeal did not have the
power to issue such an order.

 

2                                  
The appellant was convicted by a jury of four counts of trafficking in
narcotics contrary to s. 4(3) of the  Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C.,
1985, c. N-1. During the course of the trial, the appellant brought a motion
for a stay of proceedings based on entrapment. This motion was dismissed by the
trial judge after a hearing on the issue. 

 

3                                  
On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, the appellant raised 26 grounds
to overturn his conviction. Fish J.A., for the court, allowed the appeal in
part, ordering a new trial limited to the issue of entrapment, on the basis
that the Crown had failed to disclose information (a police informant’s notes)
which could have been relevant to the appellant’s case on entrapment. Fish J.A.
considered this information to be relevant only to the issue of entrapment,
ruling that it had no bearing on the accused’s liability on the charges as
such. A second trial was held before Boilard J. of the Superior Court. Once
again, the appellant’s motion for a stay of proceedings based on entrapment was
dismissed.  Pearson appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal. That appeal
is still pending.

 

The
Legislation

 

4                                  
The relevant portions of s. 686  of the Criminal Code  state:

 

686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against
a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or
not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 








(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not
properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted
on another count or part of the indictment,

 

(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any ground
mentioned in paragraph (a),

 

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any
ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred; or

 

(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial
court had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was
convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered
no prejudice thereby;

 

(c) may refuse to allow the appeal where it is of the opinion
that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion respecting the effect of a
special verdict, may order the conclusion to be recorded that appears to the
court to be required by the verdict and may pass a sentence that is warranted
in law in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court; or

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to
stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may
exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in
section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the
circumstances.

 

(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under
paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

 

(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

 

(b) order a new trial.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal, the court
of appeal may

 

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

 








(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

(i) order a new trial, or

 

(ii) except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge
and jury, enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in
its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in
law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the
trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted
in law.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the
powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.

 

Power of a
Court of Appeal to Order a New Trial Limited to the Issue of Entrapment

 

5                                  
In R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, this Court recognized
entrapment as an issue that could in the proper circumstances be raised by an
accused following a finding of guilt to stay the proceedings against him prior
to the entering of a formal order of conviction.

 

6                                  
Entrapment is a unique area of the criminal law.  In our view, it has
been somewhat inappropriately referred to as an affirmative defence.  In our
opinion, that misdescribes it.

 

7                                  
It is, in fact, completely separate from the issue of guilt or innocence
as is reflected by the fact that it is dealt with at a separate proceeding from
the trial on the merits, as  directed by Mack and implemented in this
appeal.

 








8                                  
A claim of entrapment is in reality a motion for a stay of proceedings
based on the accused’s allegation of an abuse of process. It does not rely on
the underlying charge and does not affect the admissibility of any evidence
which might influence the jury  on the merits.

 

9                                  
In particular, unlike a claim of not criminally responsible on account of
mental disorder which was the issue raised in Warsing, entrapment does
not go to or involve mens rea or “criminal responsibility” in any way.

 

10                              
That entrapment is not a conventional avenue of defence is clear from
the circumstances under which it is raised.  It arises after a fair trial has
found the accused guilty.

 

11                              
Entrapment concerns the conduct of the police and the Crown.  The
question to be answered is not whether the accused is guilty, but whether his
guilt was uncovered in a manner that shocks the conscience and offends the
principle of decency and fair play.

 

12                              
One of the most important  distinguishing features of entrapment is that
it does not bring into play the presumption of innocence.  Unlike other defence
protections, entrapment is not related to the innocence of the accused but to
the faulty conduct of the state.  Once the accused is found guilty of the
offence, the accused alone bears the burden of establishing  that the conduct
of the Crown and/or the police amounted to an abuse of process deserving of a
stay of proceedings, a standard this Court has held will arise only in the
clearest of cases: see Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into
the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, and R. v. O’Connor,
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 411. Given that  concerns about protecting the presumption of
innocence do not arise in the case of entrapment, this case is quite unlike the
situation in  Thomas.

      








13     
In such circumstances, it is unnecessary and wasteful to reopen the
issue of the appellant’s guilt or innocence on the substantive charges in a new
trial.  Such a result is not mandated by any  fundamental right protected by
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Under s. 686(8) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, a court of appeal has the power to make an ancillary order
limiting the scope of a new trial under s. 686(2)  when “justice requires” that
order. In our view, given the unique nature of an entrapment proceeding after a
verdict of guilty, s.  686(8)  provides broad enough statutory authority on
which to rest the direction by an appeal court of an entrapment proceeding.

 

14                              
In both Thomas and in R. v. Hinse, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597, it
was specifically stated that a court of appeal does not have the power to make
an additional order which is at direct variance with  the court’s underlying
judgment.  Given the fact that the entrapment hearing has no bearing on the
accused’s guilt or innocence, and given that no error has been found in the
finding of guilt,  a new trial limited to the issue of entrapment cannot be
said to be at direct variance with a court of appeal’s judgment.

 

15                              
Similarly, given the nature of an entrapment hearing, the assertion made
in Thomas that a “new trial” under s. 686  means a full new trial is not
contravened. Entrapment allegations lead to a two-stage trial, in which the two
stages are autonomous. Thus, the result of an order limiting a new trial to
entrapment is an order for a full hearing on that issue. It could not possibly
revive the issue of the accused’s guilt, an  issue which has been conclusively
decided in the first stage of the proceedings and which was not successfully
attacked.

 








16                              
A court of appeal which orders a new trial limited to the issue of
entrapment exercises its statutory jurisdiction under s. 686  of the Criminal
Code  in the following manner: where an accused successfully impugns the
finding of no entrapment at his or her first entrapment hearing, the court of
appeal “allows an appeal against conviction”, in accordance with the wording of
s. 686(1) .  Then, pursuant to s. 686(2) , the court of appeal “quashes the
conviction” and “orders a new trial”.  However, the quashing of the formal
order of conviction does not, without more, entail the quashing of the
underlying verdict of guilt.  In most successful appeals against conviction,
the court of appeal which quashes the conviction will also overturn the finding
of guilt; however, the latter is not a legally necessary consequence of the
former.  Under s. 686(8), the court of appeal retains the jurisdiction to make
an “additional order” to the effect that, although the formal order of
conviction is quashed, the verdict of guilt is affirmed, and the new trial is
to be limited to the post-verdict entrapment motion.

 

17                              
Consequently, a court of appeal finding errors in the  trial judge’s
ruling on entrapment has jurisdiction to limit a new trial to this sole issue.
It should be stated that the reverse is not  true, as the new trial ordered on
the  accused’s guilt or innocence will almost always have a direct effect on
the entrapment hearing. It would not be advisable for a court of appeal to
restrict a new trial to exclude the advancement of entrapment. 

 

18                              
The reasoning adopted here is similar to that adopted by Sopinka J.
(dissenting) in  R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at p. 1019. He
stated:

 

Notwithstanding error on the part of the trial
judge, it does not follow that there need  be a new trial. In view of the
procedure required by R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, the substantive
verdict of guilty rendered by the trial judge need not be disturbed, since the
evidence relevant to a Mack application is not relevant to culpability: Mack,
supra, at pp. 965, 972 and 975. In order to rectify the error and
restore the appellant’s opportunity to make full answer and defence, it is only
necessary to vacate the formal conviction and remit the matter to the trial
judge for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of entrapment.

 

 








19                              
 In the same case, McLachlin J. (also dissenting) indicated she would
also have directed  a new hearing on the issue of entrapment had she not been
convinced that the Crown’s conduct constituted an abuse of process which could
not be rectified by a new trial. 

 

20                              
Similar orders were also issued by the British Columbia Court of Appeal
in  R. v. Laverty (1990), 80 C.R. (3d) 231; additional unreported
reasons delivered  November 1, 1990 (Victoria Registry V00270), and R. v.
Barnes (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 368, affirmed [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449, and by the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Maxwell (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 289.

 

21                              
It should also be mentioned  that Parliament has not modified the
process established in Mack, nor has Parliament provided appellate
courts with specific  powers to deal with  the issue of entrapment. It is
therefore open to the courts to rely on s. 686(8) to make orders on  appeal
dealing with that issue. Parliament retains the ability, if it wishes to do so,
to amend the Criminal Code  to enact  otherwise.

 








22                              
The appellant also raised several other grounds of appeal before this
Court.  Most of these grounds relate to  violations of his Charter  rights
or to the trial  judge’s instructions to the jury. Fish J.A.’s analysis of
these issues is sound and we do not wish to add to it. The appellant also
raised new grounds before us, submitting that the Court of Appeal ought not to
have considered new evidence presented by the Crown (the informant’s notes
referred to above). He also presented this Court with evidence discovered in
the course of the second trial on entrapment, which is now pending on appeal
before the Quebec Court of Appeal. This evidence mostly relates to the 
testimony of undercover RCMP officers that the appellant alleges are contradictory. 
These matters are more appropriately dealt with by the courts below and are
irrelevant to our disposition. In any case, if new evidence is discovered that
questions the validity of the convictions, the appellant may apply to have his
case reopened on the basis of the new evidence.

 

23                              
To conclude, the Court of Appeal’s decision is upheld. It respects the
verdict of the jury while acknowledging that the accused may have benefited
from the full disclosure of relevant information at the entrapment stage of the
hearing. In the result, the appeal is dismissed and the decision of the Court
of Appeal confirming the verdict and ordering a new hearing on the issue of
entrapment is confirmed.

 

The reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were
delivered by

 

24                       L’Heureux-Dubé
J. -- At the oral hearing, this appeal was dismissed, reasons to
follow.  I agree with the opinion of the Chief Justice and Justice Major
concerning all arguments  raised by the appellant, except for those relating to
entrapment.  I find, as they do, that they are without merit.

 

25                      I would also reject the
appellant’s arguments relating to entrapment, for the reasons I expressed in R.
v. Thomas, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 535, and R. v. Warsing, [1998] 3 S.C.R.
579, released concurrently.  As I explained in those cases, it is clear that
the Court of Appeal has the power to order a new trial limited to the question
of entrapment under ss. 686(2)  and 686(8)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 .  I also emphasized in Warsing that there are many
examples of this type of order in the jurisprudence (see para. 35).

 








26                      I believe that the
procedure established for the issues of entrapment and not criminally
responsible by reason of mental disorder, which was in question in Warsing,
are largely similar.  In fact, under the procedure adopted by this Court in R.
v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, the issue of entrapment is considered by the
trier of fact only after it is determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused committed the acts charged.  It is, therefore, a two-step procedure,
where the determination of the accused’s guilt or innocence is distinct from
the examination of the entrapment issue.

 

27                      For the same reasons I
articulated in Thomas and Warsing, I believe that a new trial
limited to the question of entrapment is consistent on the facts of this case
with what “justice requires” as specified in s. 686(8)  of the Criminal Code . 
The undisclosed evidence, the notes of the police informant, is only relevant
to the issue of entrapment, and does not change in any way the jury’s
conclusion that the accused committed the acts charged.

The accused was charged with first degree murder for
the killing of his stepfather and with attempted murder for the shooting of his
stepfather’s companion.  Two days after the incident, the weapon used by the
accused was found by the police underneath a skateboard ramp and free of any fingerprints. 
At trial, the accused admitted that he had fired the gun shots that caused the
death of his stepfather, but pleaded not guilty on the grounds that (1) he was
not criminally responsible for his act by virtue of his mental disorder under
s. 16  of the Criminal Code , and (2) he lacked the requisite intent
to kill his stepfather.  Defence psychiatrists testified that the accused
suffered from a mental disorder at the relevant time, as a result of which he
neither understood the nature or quality of his acts nor was capable of forming
the intent to carry them out.   In his lengthy charge to the jury, the trial
judge reviewed extensively the evidence of the accused’s mental disorder as it
related to his s. 16  defence.  When subsequently discussing the issue of 
“planning and deliberation”, the trial judge chose not to repeat himself, 
indicating to the jury that “[i]n considering whether the murder was planned
and deliberate you should consider all . . . the circumstances and all the
evidence”.   The jury convicted the accused.  On appeal from his conviction for
first degree murder, the accused contended that the trial judge’s instructions
did not make it clear to the jury that the burden of proof on the issues of
intent and “planning and deliberation” was on the Crown, and that the evidence
relating to the accused’s mental disorder ought to be reconsidered in relation
to those issues.  The accused also submitted that the trial judge misdirected
the jury with respect to “consciousness of guilt” when he commented to them
that the fact that an accused tries to hide or destroy evidence can be
indicative of “consciousness of guilt”.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the
accused’s appeal.

 

Held (Sopinka, Cory and Major JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

Per Lamer C.J. and La
Forest, L’Heureux‑Dubé and Gonthier JJ.:  As long as an appellate court,
when looking at a trial judge’s charge to the jury as a whole, concludes that
the jury was left with a sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate
to the relevant issues, the charge is proper.  Here,  the trial judge
thoroughly canvassed the evidence of the accused’s mental disorder when he
discussed the s. 16  defence and he was not required to restate this
evidence  when addressing the “planned and deliberate” issue.  By directing the
jury to reconsider all of the circumstances and evidence, he fulfilled his
obligation to relate the essential evidence of the accused’s mental disorder to
that issue.  As well, even though the trial judge did not relate the mental
disorder evidence to the issue of intention when the issue arose, but only
later as part of his instructions regarding manslaughter and attempted murder, 
his charge read  in its entirety made it clear to the jury, prior to its
deliberations, that intention could be negatived by the evidence of the
accused’s mental disorder.  While this aspect of the charge may not have been
perfect, it was proper and fair.








The jury was properly instructed on how the mental
disorder evidence applied  to each live legal issues.   In his charge, the
trial judge clearly indicated  that the Crown had the burden of proving all the
elements of first degree murder, including “planning and deliberation”, beyond
a reasonable doubt, and that this was a different burden from that imposed on
the accused under the s. 16  defence.  The jurors also fully understood
that even if they concluded that the accused had not adequately established a s. 16 
defence, the other defences were still open.  The trial judge did not tell the
jury to disregard the evidence of mental disorder if the s. 16  defence was
not proven.  In fact, he expressly instructed otherwise.   Further,  a trial
judge need not instruct a jury on the finer distinctions of the manner in which
an accused’s mental incapacity can undermine his capacity to intend as opposed
to his capacity to plan and deliberate.  It is sufficient if his instructions,
when read as a whole, make the jury aware that the evidence of the accused’s
mental disorder needs to be considered on each issue, and do not mislead the
jury into thinking that a finding of planning and deliberation necessarily
follows from a finding of intention.  In this case, the jury was properly
instructed on the meaning, scope and effect of “planned and deliberate”.

 








In reviewing jury charges, appellate courts must adopt
a functional approach.  The purpose of such review is to ensure that
juries are properly ‑‑ not perfectly ‑‑ instructed. 
When a functional approach is applied in the greater context of the accused’s
trial, there is added reason to conclude that the jury was properly
instructed.  First, the “planned and deliberate” issue was not expressly raised
by the accused as a live issue at trial,  which  helps explain why the trial
judge’s directions on that issue may have been shorter and less elaborate than
on others. Second, the Crown adduced some evidence on the subject of “planning
and deliberation”, casting doubt on the accused’s submission that his capacity
to plan and deliberate was not on the jury’s mind. Third, the defence’s failure
to comment on the alleged misdirection following the jury charge  says
something about both the overall accuracy of the jury instructions and the
seriousness of the alleged misdirection.  Finally, this is not a case about
misdirection.

 

Evidence of an accused’s flight from a crime scene or
his concealment of a piece of evidence may give rise to an inference of
consciousness of guilt, and a trial judge should instruct the jury
accordingly.  But where, as here, the accused has admitted the actus reus
of the offence, the trial judge must be more circumspect.  Since neither the
accused’s presence at the scene of the killing nor his physical responsibility
for the shooting was at issue at the trial,  the evidence that he hid the
murder weapon and may have cleaned it of his fingerprints  had no probative
value in relation to those aspects of the case.  The alleged attempt to hide
the weapon and to destroy evidence, however, was relevant circumstantial
evidence for the jury to consider in evaluating the accused’s s. 16 
defence.  Evidence of concealment or flight may not speak to a particular level
of offence, but it certainly has some bearing on whether the accused was
capable of appreciating that what he had done was wrong.  Accordingly, the
trial judge erred, not by instructing the jury to consider consciousness of
guilt, because such an inference was clearly relevant, but by saying that the evidence
in question was “one piece of evidence that you can make use of in deciding
whether the accused is guilty or not guilty or not criminal[ly] responsible by
reason of mental disorder”.  This language must be said to have been ambiguous
enough to have had at least the potential to suggest that the trial judge was
making an improper connection between the accused’s alleged concealment of the
murder weapon and a particular offence.

 








Notwithstanding the trial judge’s erroneous
“consciousness of guilt” instructions, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice occurred in this case and it is thus appropriate to apply
s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.  The trial judge’s error was
not in alluding to “consciousness of guilt” but in failing to limit its
applicability to the s. 16  issue.  This error aside, the charge was fair
and balanced and avoided making explicit comment on the propriety of the
inferences available to the jury.   No reasonable juror would have been
motivated to reach a different verdict on the basis of this minor error.  The
jury would have known that there is nothing inherent in the bare act of hiding
a weapon or wiping it of its fingerprints that suggests a particular level of
offence.  Moreover, this is not a case of compounded mistakes.  Consciousness
of guilt was a single error, a small aspect of the Crown’s case, and a minor
component of the incriminating evidence.

 

Per Sopinka, Cory and
Major JJ. (dissenting):  While there is agreement with almost all of the Chief
Justice’s reasons and recommendations, his conclusion that the trial judge’s
instructions to the jury on first degree murder were adequate cannot be
accepted.  The trial judge’s instructions on  the planning and deliberation
element of first degree murder  did not refer to the evidence pertaining to
mental illness and the possible effect it might have on the accused’s ability
to plan and deliberate upon the killing of the victim.   A simple reference to
consider all the evidence was insufficient.  Although it was unnecessary for
the trial judge to review the evidence as to mental illness again, a specific
reference should have been made to it during his explanation of planning and
deliberation.  Such instructions were an essential element of this charge.

 








Per Sopinka and Major
JJ. (dissenting):  It is the obligation of a trial judge to relate evidence
that is crucial to the defence to the issues.  The review of the evidence need
not be extensive.  A reference back to evidence previously reviewed is sufficient
provided it is clear that the jury will be under no misapprehension as to the
evidence to which the reference back relates.  Moreover, if it would not be
apparent to lay persons how particular evidence will assist in resolving an
issue, some explanation is required. Here,  the trial judge fully explained the
relevance and application of the psychiatric evidence to the issue of mental
disorder under s. 16  of the Criminal Code .  He also  specifically
referred to this evidence in relation to other issues but he did not do so in
relation to the charge on planning and deliberation.  The jury might well have
taken from this that the mental disorder evidence and the psychiatric evidence
in particular were only relevant in respect of those issues to which a specific
reference was made.  Furthermore, a simple reference may not have been adequate
in this case since it is uncertain that a jury, without a proper instruction, 
would know how the psychiatric evidence, couched in terms of s. 16 , would
apply to planning and deliberation.

//The Chief Justice//

 

The judgment of Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
L’Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. was delivered by








1                                  
The Chief Justice -- This
appeal raises questions about the standard to which this Court should hold
trial judges in charging juries.  It is undoubtedly important that jurors try
the right facts according to the appropriate legal principles in each case. 
However, we must ensure that the yardstick by which we measure the fitness of a
trial judge’s directions to the jury does not become overly onerous.   We must
strive to avoid the proliferation of very lengthy charges in which judges often
quote large extracts from appellate decisions simply to safeguard verdicts from
appeal.  Neither the Crown nor the accused benefits from a confused jury. 
Indeed justice suffers.  

 

2                                  
These comments are not meant to suggest that we sanction misdirected
verdicts.  This Court has stated on repeated occasions that accused individuals
are entitled to properly instructed juries.  There is, however, no
requirement for perfectly instructed juries.  As I specifically
indicated at the hearing of this case, a standard of perfection would render
very few judges in Canada, including myself, capable of charging juries to the
satisfaction of such a standard.

 

I.  Factual
and Procedural Background

 

3                                  
December 17, 1992 was a fateful day for at least three people in
Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.  Alexander “Sandy” Hurlburt and his spouse Barbara
Wilkinson went out for a special dinner in celebration of Ms. Wilkinson’s 27th
birthday.  When they returned home, the appellant Clayton Jacquard, Mr.
Hurlburt’s stepson from a previous relationship, was there to greet them.  This
came as no surprise because, although he did not live with them,  Mr. Jacquard
had spent the previous day and night at the couple’s home, sleeping on the
living room sofa during the course of the night. 

 








4                                  
   Soon after Ms. Wilkinson retired to her bedroom the night turned
tragic. When she went to bed, she left her husband and the appellant playing
cards and watching television in the living room.  The next thing Ms. Wilkinson
recalled was sitting up in bed screaming, having been shot, and seeing the
appellant standing at the bedroom door with a gun pointing at her.  After Ms.
Wilkinson instinctively raised her hand to protect herself from further
gunshot, the appellant fired once more and then left the room.  Ms. Wilkinson
then crawled from her bedroom to the living room where she was able to phone
her mother and sister and then await the arrival of the police.  

 

5                                  
When the police arrived they found Ms. Wilkinson lying in the living
room with serious shotgun wounds.  She would survive, although she sustained
permanent disability to her leg, hip, hand and collarbone.  By contrast, the
police found Mr. Hurlburt dead in a pool of blood in the front hall with fatal
shotgun wounds to his back and chest.  

 

6                                  
Later that evening, the police apprehended the appellant who had sought
refuge at the house of a friend, Anthony Wallace.  The appellant had instructed
Mr. Wallace to call the police so that the appellant could turn himself in. 
Two days later, the Yarmouth and Area Ground Search and Rescue Team found the 12-gauge
shotgun used by the appellant in the shooting, free of any fingerprints,
underneath a skateboard ramp adjacent to the local gun club.  The appellant was
charged with first degree murder and attempted murder contrary to ss. 235(1) 
and 239  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 








7                                  
At trial, the appellant filed an admission pursuant to s. 655  of the Criminal
Code  in which he indicated  that he had fired the two gun shots that caused
Mr. Hurlburt to die.  He pleaded not guilty to the charges, however, on the
grounds that: (1) under s. 16  of the Criminal Code  he was not criminally
responsible for his act because, at the time of the shooting he was suffering
from a mental disorder that rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature
or quality of the act or knowing that it was wrong; and (2) he lacked the
requisite intent to kill Mr. Hurlburt.  Among other things, the appellant
adduced the evidence of two psychiatrists who testified that, at the relevant
time, the appellant suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, as a result
of which he neither understood the nature or quality of  his acts nor was
capable of forming the intent to carry them out. 

 

8                                  
At the conclusion of the parties’ respective cases, the trial judge gave
his directions to the jury.  In the course of his lengthy 62-page 3-hour
charge, the trial judge spent nearly 15 pages of text reviewing the evidence of
the appellant’s mental disorder as it related to the first prong of his “not
criminally responsible” s. 16  defence.  When subsequently discussing the issues
of “planning and deliberation” (as required to substantiate a first degree
murder conviction under s. 231(2)  of the Criminal Code ), the trial judge
chose not to repeat himself.  He said:

 

In considering whether the murder was planned and deliberate you should
consider all the evid  . . . all the circumstances and all the evidence.

 

On the subject of both the ingredient of intention
and whether or not Mr. Jacquard was or was not criminally responsible by reason
of a mental disorder, I have reviewed the evidence at great length, I can see
no reason to repeat what I already said to you.

 

 

There were no
objections to the jury instructions at that time.  

 








9                                  
The jury convicted the appellant of both offences and he was sentenced
to life imprisonment with no chance of parole for 25 years.  On appeal of the
first degree murder conviction, the appellant found two aspects of the jury
charge objectionable.   First, he contended that the trial judge’s instructions
did not make it clear to the jury that the burden of proof on the issues of
intent and “planning and deliberation” was on the Crown, and that the evidence
relating to the appellant’s mental disorder ought to be reconsidered in
relation to those issues.  Second, the appellant submitted that the trial judge
misdirected the jury with respect to “consciousness of guilt”.  He complained
that the trial judge not only alerted the jury to the fact that the shotgun had
been hidden and that it was devoid of fingerprints, he then commented to them
that the fact that an accused person tries to hide or destroy evidence can be
indicative of “consciousness of guilt”.  

 

10                              
The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal (per Hallett, Matthews and
Chipman JJ.A.) dismissed the appeal for the reasons given by Chipman J.A.: 
(1995), 138 N.S.R. (2d) 352, 394 A.P.R. 352.  On the first issue, the Court of
Appeal held that although the trial judge could have been more explicit, it was
reasonable to conclude from a thorough reading of the charge as a whole, that
the jury must have understood that the medical evidence of his mental state was
relevant to its determination of the planning and deliberation issue, which the
trial judge had properly and sufficiently defined.  On the second issue, the
Court of Appeal held that the jury was entitled not only to consider that the
shotgun had been hidden devoid of any fingerprints, but also to make the
inference of consciousness of guilt.   Accordingly, neither alleged shortcoming
in the jury charge constituted a reversible error.

 

11                              
On April 11, 1995, the appellant filed a notice of application for leave
to appeal to this Court.  The application was heard by a panel of La Forest,
Cory and Major JJ.  On October 12, 1995 leave to appeal was granted affirming
the need to canvass the following two issues raised by the appellant: 

 








1.                Did the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal err in holding that the Trial Judge had adequately instructed the jury
on the essential elements of the various issues and related material evidence
to those issues and in particular on the issue of planning and deliberation?

 

2.                Did the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal err in affirming the instructions of the Trial Judge to the jury that
the evidence could support the inference that the Applicant wiped his
fingerprints from the shotgun and the further inference that could be drawn
from such conduct, namely, that of consciousness of guilt?

 

 

For the
reasons outlined below, I am of the opinion that we should dismiss the appeal
on both issues.

 

II.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

12                              
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

 

16.  (1) No person is criminally responsible
for an act committed or an  omission made while suffering from a mental
disorder that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.

 

231. . . .

 

(2) Murder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

 

235.  (1) Every one who commits first degree
murder or second degree murder is guilty of an indictable offence and shall be
sentenced to imprisonment for life.

 

239.    Everyone who attempts by any means
to commit murder is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
for life.

 

655.  Where an accused is on trial for an
indictable offence, he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him
for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.

 

 

 

III.  Analysis

 

A.  The
Mental Disorder Evidence

 








(1)  The need to restate the evidence in relation to each issue

 

13                              
It has been suggested that the trial judge should have restated the
evidence of the appellant’s mental disorder in its entirety and expressly told
the jury how it should reconsider that evidence in relation to the other live
legal issues on appeal, particularly the Crown’s burden of proving that the
appellant planned and deliberated over Sandy Hurlburt’s murder.  I am
reluctant, however, to conclude that a 62-page 3-hour jury charge would have
been improved had it been any longer.  I cannot emphasize enough that the role
of a trial judge in charging the jury is to decant and simplify.  

 

14                              
Courts have recognized that there is no need to state evidence twice
where once will do.  See R. v. McColeman (1991), 11 W.A.C. 128
(B.C.C.A.).  In McColeman, McEachern C.J.B.C. stated at p. 137:

 

It is not the law, as I understand it, that a judge is required to review 
relevant evidence more than once even though it may relate to more than one
issue, although it is often useful to relate important evidence to the specific
issues being considered. . . .   While concern about prolixity can never be a
consideration if fairness requires it, I am naturally reluctant to require
trial judges to say things twice if once will suffice.

 

 

In many cases,
a trial judge  need only review relevant evidence once and has no duty to
review the evidence in a case in relation to every essential issue.  See John
v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 781, Cluett v. The Queen, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 216.  As long as an appellate court, when looking at the trial judge’s
charge to the jury as a whole, concludes that the jury was left with a
sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to the relevant issues,
the charge is proper.  See Cluett, supra, at p. 231.  In Azoulay
v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, Taschereau J. stated at pp. 497-98: 

 








The rule which has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in
a jury trial, the presiding judge must, except in rare cases where it would be
needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the
jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and
effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they
find them.

 

 

15                              
In this case, the trial judge thoroughly canvassed the evidence of the
appellant’s mental disorder when he discussed the s. 16  defence.  Later, when
addressing the “planned and deliberate” issue, he decided not to repeat what he
had already gone to great lengths to discuss.  He said: 

 

In considering whether the murder was planned and deliberate you should
consider all the evid . . . all the circumstances and all the evidence.

 

On the subject of both the ingredient of intention
and whether or not Mr. Jacquard was or was not criminally responsible by reason
of a mental disorder, I have reviewed the evidence at great length, I can see
no reason to repeat what I already said to you.

 

 

Later he
summarized:

 

 

I noted during the trial you paid strict attention
to the witnesses.  I asked you to consider the facts . . . I asked you,
considering the facts, you accepted from the evidence and taking into
consideration the legal meaning of planned or  deliberate as I have explained
them to you, did Mr. Jacquard plan to kill Mr. Hurlburt and, if so, did he do
it deliberately.  I remind you, murder cannot be first degree murder unless it
was both planned and deliberate.  Again I repeat.  I remind you, murder cannot
be first degree murder unless it was both planned and deliberate. 

 

 








This was not
the only instance in which the trial judge simply referred the jury to the
mental disorder evidence.  He made the same choice when discussing other
issues.   For example, after spending nearly 15 pages of text relating the
evidence of the accused’s mental disorder to the first aspect of the s. 16 
defence, he refrained from repeating the evidence all over again in relation to
the second aspect of the s. 16  defence.  The trial judge said:

 

While considering whether or not Mr. Jacquard knew
at the time of the offence his acts were wrong, I direct your mind to the
evidence I have just discussed with you as to whether or not Mr. Jacquard was
capable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts.

 

 

 

Again, when
instructing the jury on the attempted murder charge arising out of the shooting
of Ms. Wilkinson, he directed: 

 

                          To find the accused
guilty of attempted murder you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the
accused intended to kill Barbara Marie Wilkinson.  That intent must be a specific
intent to kill her, not to wound her, disfigure her or maim her.  If you
determine Mr. Jacquard was not suffering from a mental disorder that rendered
him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts or of knowing
they were wrong I direct you still to consider the evidence of mental disorder
along with all the other evidence to determine whether or not the accused had
the specific intent to commit the offence of attempted murder.

 

16                              
In my opinion, the trial judge was entitled not to restate this evidence
of the appellant’s mental disorder each time he addressed an issue in respect
of which that evidence was relevant. By directing the jury to reconsider all of
the circumstances and evidence, he fulfilled his obligation to relate the essential
evidence of the appellant’s mental disorder as it related to the “planned and
deliberate” issue.  Indeed I resist the conclusion that restating the evidence
would have improved the charge.  In many cases restating the evidence only
confounds the issues, making the charge less perfect and not more so. 

 

(2)  The need to refer to the evidence at the appropriate time

 








17                              
Although not emphasized in his factum, the appellant’s first argument at
the oral hearing was that the trial judge failed to adequately convey to the
jury that evidence of the appellant’s mental disorder was relevant to
determining whether the appellant intended to cause the death of Mr. Hurlburt. 


 

18                              
It is true that the trial judge introduced the subject of intention in a
general way.  He said:

 

In the end you will have to consider all the
surrounding circumstances including what Mr. Jacquard, the accused, said and
did, in order to decide whether the Crown has proven that Clayton Jacquard did,
in fact, mean to cause the death of Mr. Hurlburt.

 

 

 

However, on at
least two occasions later in his charge, the trial judge was clear and
unequivocal in his instructions.  First, when discussing intention and the
included offence of manslaughter, he stated:

 

Where Mr. Jacquard shot and killed Mr. Hurlburt,
which is an unlawful act, but you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
he had the specific intent to commit murder, then you will find the accused not
guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.  I also tell you that after
considering whether Mr. Jacquard was not criminally responsible because of a
mental disorder, as I asked you to determine first in your deliberations, if
you are not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Jacquard suffered
from a mental disorder to the extent necessary for the special verdict of not
criminally responsible on account of a mental disorder, I direct you to still
consider the evidence of mental disorder along with the other evidence in
determining whether or not Mr. Jacquard had the specific intent to commit the
offence of murder.  I direct your attention to consider all the evidence
including the evidence of Doctor Rosenberg, Doctor Bradford and Doctor Akhtar.

 

 

 

Second, he
later summarized in the context of attempted murder:

 

 

 

 

 








I direct your attention to consider all the
evidence, including the evidence of the three psychiatrists, particularly where
they differed in their opinions, as to whether Mr. Jacquard, at the time of the
offence, had the specific intent to commit murder or attempted murder. 

 

 

19                              
The appellant argues that this was not enough -- it was insufficient, he
says, for the trial judge to direct the jury in this ex post facto
manner.  He submits that the trial judge was required to relate the mental
disorder evidence to the issue of intention when the issue arose, and not
later, as part of his instructions regarding  manslaughter and attempted
murder.   

 

20                              
I find this position too onerous.  Even if I were to conclude that the
jury might initially have been left with the impression that the mental
disorder evidence was not relevant to the topic of intention, the trial judge’s
subsequent comments resolved any alleged uncertainty.  You must look at a jury
charge in its entirety.  The trial judge made it absolutely clear to the jury,
prior to its deliberations, that intention could be negatived by the evidence
of the accused’s mental disorder.  I thus fail to see how he was guilty of
misdirection.  Although this aspect of the charge may not have been  perfect,
it was certainly proper and fair. 

 

 

(3)   The need to properly charge the jury on
how the mental disorder evidence applied to the remaining legal issues

 








21                              
These initial conclusions do not end the inquiry.  The appellant is not
simply arguing that the evidence of his mental disorder ought to have been
restated at each point at which it was relevant -- be it in the context of
“intention” or “planning and deliberation”.  The appellant submits that, even
if the jury understood that the evidence was relevant to each issue, it
did not understand how it applied.  In other words, the jury was not
properly instructed on the legal issues themselves.  

 

22     
The appellant argues that the jury did not properly understand that,
even if it fell short of establishing a s. 16  defence, or even if it failed to
negate proof of intention, evidence of the appellant’s mental disorder may
still raise a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the accused had the
capacity to plan and deliberate and did in fact plan and deliberate.  See,
e.g., McMartin v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484; More v. The Queen,
[1963] S.C.R. 522; R. v. Mitchell, [1964] S.C.R. 471; R. v. Kirkby
(1985), 47 C.R. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Reynolds (1978), 22 O.R. (2d)
353 (C.A.).  It is alleged that the jury did not understand the meaning of
“planned and deliberate” and did not recognize that it is a separate issue with
a distinct burden of proof on the Crown.  It is also alleged that the trial
judge did not adequately convey to the jury that a mental disorder could
conceivably negative the elements of planning and deliberation without
negativing proof that an accused intended to kill.

 








23                              
I am not persuaded by these arguments either.  The trial judge made it
clear that the Crown had the burden to prove planning and deliberation beyond a
reasonable doubt, and that this was a different burden from that imposed on the
accused under the s. 16  defence.  At the outset of his charge, the trial judge
discussed in considerable detail the burden of proof, reminding the jury that
“[f]rom start to finish the burden is upon the Crown to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused on these charges.”  Later he said,
“if you are satisfied that the Crown has proven each of the elements beyond a
reasonable doubt your job is not finished because you must go on to decide
whether or not the Crown has proved first degree murder” (i.e., planning and
deliberation under s. 231(2) ).  Still later he explained: “Therefore you must
be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged murder was planned and
deliberate before you can return a verdict of guilty on the charge of first
degree murder.”  These passages should be contrasted with the trial judge’s
instructions under the s. 16  defence.  After reading s. 16  to the jury he said:

 

This means that you must presume Mr. Jacquard was
not so mentally disordered as to be exempt from criminal responsibility at the
time of the offence unless the contrary is proven.  Since Mr. Jacquard is
alleging that he was mentally disordered at the time of the offence he has the
burden or responsibility of proving the mental disorder defence.  He must prove
mental disorder on a balance of probabilities.

 

There is a lesser standard of proof than proof . .
. than beyond a reasonable doubt which I explained to you earlier.  If you are
satisfied that it is more likely than not that Mr. Jacquard was mentally
disordered to the extent of being incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of his act [sic] or of knowing that they were wrong at the time
of the offence, you must return a verdict of not criminally responsible on
account of a mental disorder.

 

24     
I agree with Chipman J.A. that “the jury could not possibly have been
confused with respect to the burden of proof being on the Crown beyond a
reasonable doubt with respect to all of the elements of first degree murder. 
The trial judge told the jury so in no uncertain terms” (p. 362).

 

25     
There is also ample reason to conclude that the jurors fully understood
that even if they concluded that the appellant did not adequately establish a
defence under s. 16 , the other defences were still very much open to consider.
At the conclusion of his s. 16  instructions, the trial judge warned the jury:

 

If you find Mr. Jacquard did not suffer from a mental disorder that
rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his act [sic]
or of knowing that they were wrong I direct that you must then proceed to
determine the remaining issues in count number one.

 

The trial
judge then discussed the elements of count number one and later outlined what
was incumbent upon the Crown to prove:








I tell you as a matter of law, the Crown will not have discharged that
burden of proof unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
only reasonable inference to be drawn from the proven facts is that the
accused, 1) intended to kill Sandy Hurlburt or to cause him bodily harm that he
knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or
not; 2) that the murder of Sandy Hurlburt was planned and deliberate; and 3) 
the intention of the accused was to kill Barbara Marie Wilkinson.  

 

Unlike a case
such as R. v. Allard (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (Que. C.A.), the trial
judge did not tell the jurors to disregard the evidence of the accused’s mental
disorder once they got passed the s. 16  issue.  In fact, he repeatedly told the
jury otherwise -- to consider all of the available evidence on the remaining
points. 

 

26                              
The appellant’s submission that the jury was unaware of the meaning of
“planned and deliberate” is no more convincing.  The trial judge introduced
these terms by stating that “planned and deliberate have different meanings”
and proceeded to define them in a manner perfectly consistent with this Court’s
prior rulings.  See R. v. Aalders, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 482, More, supra.  
See also R. v. Smith (1986), 71 N.S.R. (2d) 229 (C.A.), R. v. Palmer
(1986), 12 O.A.C. 181 (C.A.).   He defined something that is  “planned” as
something that is arranged beforehand on the basis of a “design” or “scheme”.  
He defined something that is “deliberate” as something that is “considered” and
“carefully thought out” rather than “hasty”, “rash”, or “impulsive”.  He said,
“[a] person commits deliberate murder when he or she thinks about the
consequences”, i.e., when he or she contemplates the advantages and
disadvantages of committing the murder.  

 








27                              
It is true that some factor, such as a mental disorder, that is
insufficient to negative the charge that the accused intended to kill,
may nevertheless be sufficient to negative the elements of planning and
deliberation.  This is because one can intend to kill and yet be impulsive
rather than considered in doing so.  It requires less mental capacity simply to
intend than it does to plan and deliberate.   

 

28                              
In R. v. Wallen, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 827, the Court addressed, inter
alia, whether this distinction had to be explained to the jury in the
context of the defence of intoxication.  The five-judge panel unanimously
agreed that the trial judge was obliged to direct the jury to consider the
effects of intoxication separately, in relation to each aspect of the accused’s
defence.   However, a three-judge majority (from which I dissented) concluded
that, while it is the better course to follow, it is not an absolute rule that
the jury must be expressly told of the distinction between the degree of
intoxication necessary to negative intent to kill and that necessary to
negative planning and deliberation.  Put differently, the majority held
that a trial judge need not instruct the jury on the finer distinctions of the
manner in which an accused’s mental incapacity can undermine his or her
capacity to intend as opposed to his or her capacity to plan and deliberate.  

 

29                              
I have no present intention to re-open that discussion.  Nor do I have
any desire to develop a legal distinction -- which would almost certainly be
tenuous -- between the effects of intoxication as opposed to the  effects of a
mental disorder in this context.   Although the s. 16  “not criminally
responsible” defence is altogether different from the defence of intoxication,
planning and deliberation involve more complex and stable mental processes than
the mere intention to kill, and this fact does not change from one form of
mental impairment to another.     

 








30                              
Therefore, although the same logic applies in the context of mental
disorders just as it does in the context of intoxication, this Court said in Wallen
that the trial judge need not be explicit about the subtle differences between
the manner in which evidence of a mental disorder can negative “intention”
versus “planning and deliberation”.  It is sufficient if his instructions, when
read as a whole, make the jury aware that the evidence of the appellant’s
mental disorder needs to be considered on each issue, and do not mislead the
jury into thinking that a finding of planning and deliberation necessarily
follows from a finding of intention.  In my opinion, this is precisely what the
trial judge did in this case.  

 

31                              
There is no question that the trial judge treated the issue of planning
and deliberation separately from all others and alerted the jury that the
evidence of the appellant’s mental disorder was relevant to its determination. 
Moreover, he indicated to the jury that neither “planning” nor “deliberation”
is equivalent to “intentional”.  He told the jury that “a person can mean or
intend to kill someone without having planned to kill the person”.  The effect
of instructing the jury that the appellant could intend to do something without
planning and deliberating is to make the jury understand that the appellant’s
mental disorder could conceivably have undermined his capacity to plan and
deliberate without undermining his capacity to intend.  

 

32                              
Having read and reread the charge, I have no doubt that the jury was
properly instructed on the meaning, scope, and effect of “planned and
deliberate”.   Moreover,  I cannot emphasize enough that the right of an
accused to a properly instructed jury does not equate with the right to a
perfectly instructed jury.  An accused is entitled to a jury that understands
how the evidence relates to the legal issues.  This demands a functional
approach to the instructions that were given, not an idealized approach to
those instructions that might have been given. Using such a functional
approach, I find added support for the conclusion that the jurors were properly
instructed in this case.  Let me explain.  

 








33                              
First, we should not divorce the jury charge from the greater context of
the trial.  As Chipman J.A. emphasized in his judgment for the Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal, it is noteworthy that the “planned and deliberate” issue was
not expressly raised by the appellant as a live issue at trial (at pp.
361-62).  The appellant did not question his experts on the capacity of the
appellant to plan and deliberate.  Nor did defence counsel submit to the jury
in argument that it was something they should consider.  Indeed the appellant
indicated that he had two central arguments: (1) the appellant was not criminally
responsible by virtue of his mental disorder under s. 16  of the Criminal
Code ; and (2) the appellant did not intend or have the capacity to intend
to murder Sandy Hurlburt.  This certainly does not relieve the Crown of its
obligation to prove all of the elements of an offence beyond a reasonable
doubt, but it does help to explain why the trial judge’s directions on the
“planned and deliberate” issue may have been shorter and less elaborate than on
others.  Planning and deliberation was not the focus of the defence.

 

34                              
Second, despite the lack of focus on this matter by the defence, the
Crown made it clear that the ability of the appellant to intend, plan, and
deliberate was at issue.  In the middle of the Crown’s address to the jury, he
said:

 

Now, there are a number of pieces of evidence that
perhaps I haven’t touched on yet that bear on the issue of ah, of intent and
the ability to plan [and] deliberate and whether or not he did, in fact, plan
and deliberate with respect to the killing and I’ll briefly go through them as
I have them listed.

 

 

Indeed the
Crown cross-examined the appellant’s expert witnesses on the issue of planning
and deliberation.  In particular, he put hypotheticals to them designed to get
at the appellant’s capacity to plan and deliberate.  Hence, the Crown and Dr.
Edwin Rosenberg had the following exchange:  

 








Q.   Sir, would you agree with me that the person
I described in the hypothetical, was certainly capable of planning and
deliberation?  Well, let’s forget the facts of the case or let’s forget the
facts that you gave your opinion to Mr. Pink based on.  Assume these facts in
the hypothetical that I’ve given you?

 

A.   Oh certainly, the way you describe it in your
hypothetical, the individual was capable of planning.

 

Q.   He was also capable of considering the
consequences of his acts, would you not agree?

 

A.   Yes.

 

Q.   And he was also capable of forming the
specific intent to kill?

 

A.   Yes.

 

 

Later, the
Crown confirmed:

 

 

Q.   That’s fairly basic, I think.  The facts that
I put forth in my hypothetical show a person, as you said, is capable of
planning and is also capable of exhibiting goal directed behaviour, that is, he
sets out a goal and works on the various steps of how to get there, correct?

 

A.   Yes.

 

 

Similarly, the
Crown had the following exchange with Dr. John Bradford on his
cross-examination:

 

Q.   If one were planning to . . . if one suffered
from post traumatic stress disorder, they’d still be capable of planning to do
things and carrying those things out in some situation, as a generalization
once again?

 

A.   Yes, as a generalization, yes.

 

 

In my opinion,
the fact that the Crown directed evidence to the issue casts significant doubt
on the appellant’s submission that the capacity of the appellant to plan and
deliberate was not on the jury’s collective mind.








35                              
Third, defence counsel failed to comment on the alleged misdirection
following the jury charge.  At the close of the charge, both counsel were given
the full opportunity to express any misgivings they may have had about its
contents.  By way of response, they proposed a joint supplementary instruction
to the judge which  outlined an algorithm of questions the jurors should go
through in deciding the case.  The trial judge accepted the proposal and, with
some modifications, submitted the list of questions to the jury.  At no point,
however, did defence counsel object to the manner in which the trial judge
charged the jury on the “planned and deliberate” issue.  

 

36                              
Nor did defence counsel raise the issue prior to the jury charge
at the informal pre-address conference that took place.  At that time, the
Crown proposed, and defence counsel agreed, that the relevant sections of the Criminal
Code  be submitted to the jury during its deliberations.  Significantly,
although defence counsel objected to submitting the definitions of “planned and
deliberate” along with the sections, he did not express any anticipatory
concern that the “planned and deliberate” issue be handled in a specific
manner.  We should not forget that the issue of planning and deliberation was
fresh in defence counsel’s mind.  The alleged lack of planning and deliberation
had formed the very basis of the appellant’s earlier failed motion for a
directed verdict.

 








37                              
To point this out is not to say that a  party waives its right of appeal
on a jury charge misdirection by failing to raise the  issue contemporaneously
with the making of the charge.   In R. v. Arcangioli, [1994] 1 S.C.R.
129, this Court made it quite clear that defence counsel’s failure to object to
a jury charge is not determinative, at least in the context of the
applicability of the Criminal Code ’s curative provision.   Although such
a rule would act as a strong incentive for counsel to scrutinize the charge
carefully and would inhibit counsel from deliberately failing to object to the
charge as a matter of strategy, the Court has not lost sight of the fact that
the jury charge is the responsibility of the trial judge and not defence
counsel.  Such a rule might also unequivocally prejudice an accused’s right of
appeal in cases where counsel is inexperienced with jury trials.  

 

38                              
Nevertheless, defence counsel’s failure to comment at the trial is
worthy of consideration.  In Thériault v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
336,  although I dissented on unrelated grounds, Dickson J. (as he then was)
expressed the proper view at pp. 343-44:  “[a]lthough by no means
determinative, it is not irrelevant that counsel for the accused did not
comment, at the conclusion of the charge, upon the failure of the trial judge
to direct the attention of the jury to the evidence”.  In my opinion, defence
counsel’s failure to object to the charge says something about both the overall
accuracy of the jury instructions and the seriousness of the alleged
misdirection. 

 

39                              
Fourth, this is not a case about misdirection.   Contrary to the
appellant’s submissions, this case is not like More, supra.   More
was a capital murder case in which the accused called evidence of psychiatric
experts who testified that he was suffering from severe psychosis at the time
of the murder.  Instead of simply leaving the testimony of experts for the jury
to consider, the trial judge read excerpts from evidence textbooks to the jury
which stated that the testimony of experts is often considered to be of slight
value and biased in favour of the party that calls them.  That was clearly a
misdirection, because it undermined the essence of the accused’s  case, by
telling the jury that they should give the medical evidence slight weight and
little consideration.  The trial judge’s charge to the jury was tantamount to
withdrawing the defence.

 








40                              
Nor is this case like Allard, supra.  In Allard,
the accused was charged with first degree murder in the poisoning death of her
husband.  She argued in her defence that she suffered from a manic-depressive
psychosis and had thus been unable to appreciate the consequences of her act. 
The trial judge directed the jury to consider the accused’s insanity defence,
but added that if the jury found that she had failed to establish her insanity
on the balance of probabilities, they should “disregard that defence
completely”.  The Quebec Court of Appeal considered this charge a misdirection. 
If the defence of insanity failed, the jury was still required to consider her
psychosis evidence as it related to the Crown’s burden of establishing intent
beyond a reasonable doubt.  This is completely unlike the case at bar where the
trial judge did not tell the jury to disregard the evidence of mental disorder
if the s. 16  defence was not proven.  In fact, he expressly instructed
otherwise.  

 

41                              
Applying a functional approach to the jury instructions in the greater
context of the appellant’s trial, I find that there is ample reason to conclude
that the jury was properly instructed.  The jury was fully apprised of the
meaning, scope and effect of the “planned and deliberate” requirement, and
understood its responsibility to consider the evidence of the appellant’s
mental state in determining whether  he had the capacity to “plan and
deliberate” and whether he in fact did so.

 

B.  Consciousness
of Guilt

 

42                              
Under certain circumstances, the acts of an accused following a crime
may provide a window to the accused’s culpability.  This sort of circumstantial
evidence  may be used by the jury to infer what has been termed “consciousness
of guilt”.  The most common inferences of this character are made from an
accused’s flight from the scene of the crime.

 








43                              
In this case, the trial judge thought that the jury could derive similar
inferences from the hiding of the murder weapon and the fact that it was found
without any latent traces of the appellant’s fingerprints.  At a fairly early
stage in the jury charge the trial judge made the following observations:

 

In this trial there is some evidence that the accused attempted to hide
or destroy evidence against him.  There is evidence the gun and the ammunition
were hidden at the skateboard ramp.  There was also evidence the gun found at
the skateboard ramp was devoid of fingerprints even though there is other
evidence he shot from the gun during which time he would have handled it. 
Evidence that an accused person tries to hide or destroy evidence can be
evidence of consciousness of guilt.

 

The law recognizes that a guilty person will
sometimes try to hide or destroy evidence in order to escape the consequences
of his or her crime.  It is up to you to decide whether or not the conduct of
the accused indicates consciousness of guilt.  You must of course be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did try to hide or destroy evidence
before you may use this evidence of consciousness of guilt.  If you are not
satisfied the accused tried to hide or destroy evidence then you must ignore
the evidence of the alleged attempt.  If you are satisfied that the accused did
try to hide or destroy evidence you must consider whether or not this attempt
is evidence of consciousness of guilt.  Please remember that guilty knowledge
is not the only reason someone might try to hide or destroy evidence.  For
example, someone might try to hide or destroy evidence out of fear or for some
reason that has nothing to do with guilty knowledge.  You should consider all
the circumstances surrounding the alleged attempt to hide or destroy evidence
when you decide whether or not the alleged attempt is evidence of consciousness
of guilt.  Keep in mind that any inference you may draw to the effect that the
accused attempted to hide or destroy evidence is not, by itself, sufficient to
prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is just one piece of evidence
that you can make use of in deciding whether the accused is guilty or not
guilty or not criminal[ly] responsible by reason of a mental disorder.  
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

44                              
I respectfully disagree with the initial conclusions of Chipman J.A.
that this instruction was completely proper.  In coming to this conclusion I
need not consider whether the evidence supported the inference that the
appellant wiped his fingerprints from the shotgun.  Even if this were
supportable, which I think it was, the instruction was, in part, erroneous.

 








45                              
Typically, an offender will flee the scene of a crime or conceal a piece
of evidence to mask his or her involvement in the crime.  Thus, evidence of
flight or concealment is usually led by the Crown to support the thesis that
the accused was implicated in some way in the commission of the offence.  As a
general rule, this is a natural inference to draw from such evidence and a
trial judge should instruct the jury accordingly.  But where, as here, the
accused has admitted the actus reus of the offence, the trial judge must
be more circumspect.  The use to which evidence of consciousness of guilt can
be put in such circumstances is more limited.  See  Arcangioli, supra;
R. v. Marinaro, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 462, rev’g (1994), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 74
(Ont. C.A.); R. v. Wiltse (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 379 (C.A.); R. v.
Charlette (1992), 83 Man. R. (2d) 187 (C.A.);  R. v. Murray (1994),
93 C.C.C. (3d) 70 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bob (1990), 78 C.R. (3d) 102 (Ont.
C.A.).

 

46                              
In Arcangioli, the accused was charged with aggravated assault
for his participation in a fight in which his combatant was stabbed.  At trial
he admitted that he had committed common assault for punching the victim but
denied stabbing him.  The trial judge nonetheless instructed the jury that the
accused’s flight from the scene of the crime was evidence of consciousness of
guilt and that it was “a factor to be considered in reaching their verdict” (p.
136).  This Court held that this constituted a misdirection.  Given his admission
of guilt for common assault, the flight of the accused could not have been
probative because, in the words of Major J. at p. 145, “the appellant’s flight
was equally consistent with both common assault and aggravated assault, it
could not be evidence of guilt of the latter”.  Major J. elaborated: “Any
inference to be drawn from flight disappears when an [alternate] explanation
for such flight is available”.

 








47     
In Marinaro, the accused was charged with second degree murder in
the killing of his friend.  Half an hour after the fatal altercation in which
the accused claimed the deceased had first  attacked him with a knife, the
accused returned to the scene of the crime where he moved the body, stole some
goods, and disposed of the knife.  Initially, the accused lied to the police
about his presence at the crime scene, but later admitted having stabbed the
deceased and causing his death.  At trial, he relied upon the defences of
self-defence and provocation.  In his dissenting judgment in the Court of
Appeal, which was subsequently endorsed by this Court, Dubin C.J.O. held at p.
81 that once the accused admitted having caused the death of his friend, the
evidence of consciousness of guilt “had very limited application”.   

 

48                              
Similarly, in Charlette, the 17-year-old accused was charged with
second-degree murder in the death of a two-year-old child who had last been
seen in the company of the accused.  The trial judge instructed the jurors that
they could infer consciousness of guilt from the accused’s flight from the area
shortly after the infant’s death.  Twaddle J.A. for the Manitoba Court of
Appeal held that this amounted to a misdirection.  Although flight could be
used to infer that the accused was the perpetrator of the homicide, the accused’s
consciousness of guilt could not assist the jury in deciding whether the
homicide was murder or manslaughter.  His flight from the area was consistent
with both offences and was not probative of one offence in particular.

 

49                              
In this case, the appellant admitted that he was the individual who
fired the shots that killed Sandy Hurlburt.  Thus, neither his presence at the
scene of the killing nor his physical responsibility for shooting the gun was
at issue at the trial.  There was no need, therefore, for the Crown to rely on
evidence that he hid the murder weapon and may have cleaned it of his
fingerprints in order to establish these elements of the offence.  That
evidence, in other words, had no probative value in relation to those aspects
of the case; it was, in effect, irrelevant to them.   

 








50                              
However, unlike Arcangioli, Marinaro, or Charlette,
the alleged attempt to hide the murder weapon and destroy evidence was
relevant circumstantial evidence for the jury to consider in evaluating the appellant’s
“not criminally responsible” s. 16  defence.   Evidence of concealment or flight
may not speak to a particular level of offence, but it certainly has some
bearing on whether the appellant was capable of appreciating that what he had
done was wrong. Indeed, just as a party would be unlikely to hide a murder
weapon or flee a crime scene if he or she was not responsible for the act, a
person would be most unlikely to attempt to cover up his or her actions if
there was no appreciation of the nature and quality of those actions or no
understanding that they were wrong.  This sort of evidence clearly does have
probative value in a case of this sort.  

 

51                              
For this reason, I agree with Chipman J.A. that it was open to the jury
to draw an inference from the fact that the shotgun and ammunition were removed
from the crime scene and later found under the skateboard ramp, but only to the
extent that it assisted the jury in understanding the effects of the alleged
mental disorder on the appellant’s capacity to understand the nature and
quality of his acts.  See, e.g., R. v. White (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(Ont. C.A.), at p. 19.  

 








52                              
In this case, the trial judge erred, not by instructing the jury to
consider consciousness of guilt, because such an inference was clearly
relevant, but by saying that the evidence in question was “one piece of
evidence that you can make use of in deciding whether the accused is guilty
or not guilty or not criminal[ly] responsible by reason of a mental
disorder” (emphasis added).   There is nothing in that language that explicitly
links the evidence to a particular offence.  In all probability, the trial
judge was simply instructing the jurors to consider the consciousness of guilt
evidence in relation to the accused’s mental capacity to intend -- as distinct
from its relevance to the s. 16  defence.  It is even possible to interpret the
reference to “guilty or not guilty” to be connected to the reference to “not
criminally responsible” -- perhaps “not guilty” and “not criminally
responsible” were both intended by the trial judge to be understood as being
modified by the phrase “by reason of mental disorder”.   

 

53                              
However, the language must, I think, be said to have been ambiguous
enough to have had at least the potential to suggest that the trial judge was
making  an improper connection between the accused’s alleged concealment of the
murder weapon and a particular offence, be it first degree murder, second
degree murder, or manslaughter, and it was therefore an error for him to use
it.  I must confess to some reluctance in reaching this conclusion, which
resonates with a standard of perfection, of which I am avowedly wary. 
However,  this Court stated at p. 145 in Arcangioli, that where an
accused’s conduct is equally consistent with multiple offences, and the accused
has admitted culpability for one or more of the offences, “a trial judge should
instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative value with respect to any
particular offence”.  For this reason, I feel compelled to conclude that the
trial judge did err at law by failing to expressly warn the jury that the
accused’s consciousness of guilt said nothing about the particular offence for
which he may have been culpable.  

 

54                              
Nonetheless, in view of the specific context of the facts of this case,
and when reading the jury charge as a whole, I am of the firm view that the
effect of the trial judge’s misstatement would not have been significant.  It
is to this issue that my discussion now turns.

 

C.  Applying
the Curative Provision

 








55                              
Notwithstanding the trial judge’s erroneous “consciousness of guilt”
instructions, I am of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice occurred in this case.  Hence, in my view, it is appropriate in this
instance for the Court to apply the curative provision in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .  I reach this conclusion for four principal
reasons.

 

56                              
First, the trial judge’s “consciousness of guilt” instructions were
tempered with caution.  The error aside, the charge was fair and balanced and
avoided making explicit comment on the propriety of the inferences available to
the jury.  See R. v. Jenkins (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 30 (C.A.).  The trial
judge  did not presume that the appellant had attempted to hide and destroy
evidence, and he did not compel the jury to conclude that this was evidence of
consciousness of guilt.  Instead, he emphasized that it was for the jury to
determine whether the appellant had actually attempted to hide or destroy
evidence.  He also re-emphasized that whether this amounted to evidence of
consciousness of guilt was for them to consider.  He cautioned: “Please
remember that guilty knowledge is not the only reason someone might try to hide
or destroy evidence.  For example, someone might try to hide or destroy
evidence out of fear or for some reason that has nothing to do with guilty
knowledge.”  In my opinion, the trial judge’s comments were largely benign and
very balanced, instructing the jury to consider the alleged hiding of the
murder weapon as merely some evidence to be considered in light of the totality
of the evidence in the case.  

 

57                              
Second, as noted above, as much as the trial judge erred in his
“consciousness of guilt” instructions, the alleged attempt to hide the murder
weapon and destroy evidence was relevant circumstantial evidence for the jury
to consider.   The trial judge’s error was not in alluding to “consciousness of
guilt”, but in failing to limit its applicability to the s. 16  issue.

 








58                              
Third, I find it exceedingly difficult, in the specific circumstances of
this case, to believe that any reasonable juror would have been motivated to
reach a different verdict on the basis of this minor error.  Consciousness of
guilt was a small, and arguably minor, aspect of the Crown’s case against the
appellant.  The other evidence included: the appellant’s s. 655  admission to
shooting Sandy Hurlburt; the expert evidence that the appellant was mentally
capable of knowing that the shooting was wrong; the testimony that the
appellant had been abused coupled with his  statement to his girlfriend that he
was going to “pay back” the person who abused him; the appellant’s inquiries to
Ms. Wilkinson about the timing of her return home; the appellant’s instructions
to Ms. Wilkinson not to disclose his whereabouts in her home; the appellant’s
telephone calls to his friend prior to the killing in which he indicated his
intention to rob a store,“do something else”, and leave town; the number of
shotgun shells that were obtained and expended during the two shootings; the
presence of two guns; and the appellant’s  act of nodding in response to a
question in which he was asked by a friend if he had gone to Mr. Hurlburt and
Ms. Wilkinson’s home in order to shoot Mr. Hurlburt.    In this respect, this
appeal is very much unlike Marinaro, supra,  where Dubin C.J.O.
refused to apply the s. 686(1) (b)(iii) curative provision.  In Marinaro,
there was significant evidence of flight, false statements, and destruction of
evidence upon which the trial judge made “extensive instructions” with respect
to consciousness of guilt.  On that basis,  Dubin C.J.O. was not satisfied that
a properly instructed jury would not have come to a different conclusion.  In
this appeal, the evidence of consciousness of guilt was but a minor component
of the totality of the other incriminating evidence in the case.  See Wiltse,
supra, at p. 386. 

 








59                              
Moreover, I cannot conceive how a reasonable juror, in this case, when
faced with the evidence that the accused concealed the murder weapon, would
have deduced from that evidence that the accused was more likely to have
committed first degree murder, second degree murder, or even manslaughter.  It
is, after all, a matter of simple logic that we are discussing, not a matter
that requires special expertise or even intellectual sophistication.  It is
clear that evidence of flight from a homicide, and/or of concealment of a
weapon used in it, has no relevance to the question of the state of the
perpetrator’s mind at the time of and prior to the killing itself, except to
the extent of showing that he knew the act was wrong.  Such evidence might be
relevant where, for example, there was also evidence that the accused
established a hiding place for the murder weapon prior to the commission of the
offence.  In such circumstances, the hiding of the weapon would be very
relevant to the issues of premeditation and preparation.  But, there is no such
evidence here.  There is nothing inherent in the bare act of hiding a weapon or
wiping it of its fingerprints that suggests a particular level of offence.  The
accused’s consciousness of guilt was clearly irrelevant to this issue and I am
confident that, in the specific circumstances of this case, the members of the
jury could not but have known it.  

 

60                              
Fourth, this is not a case of compounded mistakes.  Unlike Arcangioli
and Murray, supra, we need not be concerned with the “cumulative
effect of the errors”.  In fact, the “consciousness of guilt” passage is the
only objectionable instruction the trial judge made to the jury in his entire
62-page, multiple-hour charge.  

 

61                              
Appellate courts are entitled to apply the curative provision of s.
686(1) (b)(iii) if “the verdict would necessarily have been the same if
such error had not occurred”.  See Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R.
739, at p. 744, and Arcangioli, supra.   This is by no means a
simple test.  Judging “what might have been” is not easy particularly when our
system requires juries to pronounce verdicts without providing supporting
reasons.   Nonetheless, as I noted above, I cannot imagine how the jury would
have acted improperly upon this instruction.  In my view, the verdict would
have been no different had the charge been perfect, and not contained this
minor error.   

 

 








IV.  Conclusion      


 

62                              
As I discussed at the outset of my reasons, appellate courts must adopt
a functional approach to reviewing jury charges.  The purpose of such review is
to ensure that juries are properly -- not perfectly -- instructed.   

 

63                              
Using such an approach, I have no trouble in concluding that the jury in
this case properly understood not only the legal issues at trial, but also how
the evidence related to those issues, and in particular to the appellant’s
defence and to each aspect of the relevant offences.   To the extent that the
trial judge erred in his “consciousness of guilt” instructions, I have found
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.  The appeal
should be dismissed.  

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

The reasons of Sopinka and
Major JJ. were delivered by

 

64                              
Sopinka J. (dissenting) --
I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my colleague, Justice Cory, that the
charge to the jury was inadequate in respect of the issue as to whether the
murder alleged was planned and deliberate.  I would add that it is the
obligation of a trial judge to relate evidence, that is crucial to the defence,
to the issues.  The review of the evidence need not be extensive and a relation
back to evidence previously reviewed is sufficient provided it is clear that
the jury will be under no misapprehension as to the evidence to which the
reference back relates.  Moreover, if it would not be apparent to lay persons
how particular evidence will assist in resolving an issue, some explanation is
required.  This is especially true of expert scientific or medical evidence. 
As stated by Estey J. in Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, at
p. 503:








 

Where, as here, the evidence is technical and somewhat involved, it is
particularly important that [the trial judge] should [explain the relevant law
and relate it to the evidence] in a manner that will assist the jury in
determining its relevancy and what weight or value they will attribute to the
respective portions.

 

 

65                              
In this case the psychiatric evidence was of special importance with
relation to the issue of mental disorder under s. 16  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  Its relevance and application to this issue were fully
explained by the trial judge.  This explanation would be of little assistance
to the jury as to its relevance to planning and deliberation.  Moreover, once
they resolved that issue, they might very well have considered that its
relevance was spent.  To the lay jury it might seem incongruous to reject the
psychiatric evidence under the s. 16  defence, but to then reconsider the same
evidence and what may appear to it to be a similar argument under the issues of
planning and deliberation.  It was therefore important that the trial judge
specifically refer to this evidence in relating it to other issues.  This was done
with respect to the charge on manslaughter and in the summary in relation to
attempted murder where the trial judge stated:

 

I direct your attention to consider all the
evidence, including the evidence of the three psychiatrists, particularly where
they differed in their opinions, as to whether Mr. Jacquard, at the time of the
offence, had the specific intent to commit murder or attempted murder.

 

 

This was not
done in relation to the charge on planning and deliberation.  The jury might
well have taken from this that the mental disorder evidence and the psychiatric
evidence in particular were only relevant in respect of those issues to which a
specific reference was made.  The appellant need only establish “a reasonable
possibility that the jury might have been misled” (R. v. Brydon, [1995]
4 S.C.R. 253, at para. 19).








66                              
Furthermore, a simple reference may not have been adequate in this case. 
I am not sure that a jury would know how the psychiatric evidence, couched in
terms of s. 16 , would apply to planning and deliberation without being told
that this evidence, although falling short of establishing that the accused
could not appreciate the nature and quality of his acts or that he did not know
they were wrong, could still raise a reasonable doubt in relation to planning
and deliberation if the jury concluded that the accused’s cognitive ability was
impaired, albeit to a lesser extent than required under s. 16 .  An instruction
to this effect was essential, particularly in view of the fact that the
evidence had previously been considered by the jury on the basis of a burden of
proof that required the appellant to establish a mental disorder on a balance
of probabilities.  The jury might have assessed the evidence differently when
considering whether it raised a reasonable doubt.

 

67                              
I am in complete agreement with the Chief Justice that overlong and
repetitious jury charges should be avoided.  We also agree that this does not
mean that we should stint on essentials.  Nothing is more important to a true
verdict than ensuring that the jury understands how the evidence relates to the
issues.  This has always been and should continue to be an objective of the
instructions to a jury and nothing should be said to undermine this objective.

 

68                              
I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by Cory J.

 

//Cory J.//

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 








69                              
Cory J. (dissenting) --
With almost all of the reasons and sound recommendations of the Chief Justice I
am in complete agreement.  However, I cannot accept his conclusion that the
trial judge’s instructions to the jury on first degree murder were adequate.

 

70                              
The crime of first degree murder is, from the point of view of sentence,
the most serious crime prescribed by the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 .  It calls for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without
eligibility for parole for 25 years.  It differs from second degree murder
in that it requires that the Crown establish that the murder was both planned
and deliberate.  Clearly it sets a significantly higher standard of culpability
than second degree murder.  The commission of the crime requires a more complex
and focused mental process than the mere intention to kill.

 

71                              
There can be no doubt that a jury must be instructed that alcohol can
affect the ability to plan and to be deliberate.  See R. v. Mitchell,
[1964] S.C.R. 471, R. v. Wallen, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 827.  Similarly, this
Court has held that a jury must be instructed that evidence of mental illness
has to be considered in determining whether the murder was planned and
deliberate.  See More v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 522, R. v. Kirkby
(1985), 47 C.R. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.).  As MacDonnell J. stated in R. v.
Markle, [1990] O.J. No. 2606 (Gen. Div.):

 

The task of the jury in a first degree murder case
based on planning and deliberation where there is evidence of intoxication or
mental disorder is to determine the accused’s thinking and mental processes at
the time of the killing, bearing in mind that evidence, and then to determine
whether those mental processes fell within the definition of “deliberate”.

 








72                              
It follows that in the case at bar, a simple reference to consider all
the evidence is insufficient.  There must be more.  Although it was not
necessary for the trial judge to again review the evidence as to mental
illness, a specific reference should have been made to it during his explanation
of planning and deliberation.

 

73                              
The entire reference pertaining to the planning and deliberation element
of first degree murder in the judge’s charge to the jury is as follows:

 

And I want to explain now to you the meaning of
planned and deliberate.  I will explain the meaning of planned and deliberate
so that you will be able to make this decision if you find the Crown has proven
all the ingredients I just told you about.  The words planned and deliberate
have different meanings.  You should give the word planned its ordinary
meaning.  That is arranged beforehand.  In other words, a person plans to do
something, if he or she forms a design or scheme for doing it.  The plan need
not be a complicated one.  It may be a very simple plan and the simpler it is,
perhaps the easier it is to formulate it.

 

However you should understand that planning
something is not the same as doing it intentionally, therefore, a person can
mean or intend to kill someone without having planned to kill the person.  For
example, suppose Jane Smith has a bad temper, she gets in an argument with
someone and kills the other person during the argument.  Even though she was
not intending to kill the other person before the argument started.  In this
example, Jane Smith might have intended to kill the other person but she did
not plan to kill him.

 

The word deliberate also means something more than
intentional.  It means carefully thought out, not hasty or rash.  A person
commits deliberate murder when he or she thinks about the consequences before
committing the murder.  In other words, he or she thinks about the advantages
and disadvantages of committing the murder.  It is an act that is considered
rather than impulsive.  In considering whether the murder was planned and
deliberate you should consider all the evid . . . all the
circumstances and all the evidence.

 

On the subject of both the ingredient of intention
and whether or not Mr. Jacquard was or was not criminally responsible by
reason of a mental disorder, I have reviewed the evidence at great length, I
can see no reason to repeat what I already said to you.

 

I noted during the trial you paid strict attention
to the witnesses.  I asked you to consider the facts. . . . I asked
you, considering the facts, you accepted from the evidence and taking into
consideration the legal meaning of planned or deliberate as I have explained
them to you, did Mr. Jacquard plan to kill Mr. Hurlburt and, if so, did he
do it deliberately.  I remind you, murder cannot be first degree murder unless
it was both planned and deliberate.  Again I repeat. I remind you, murder
cannot be first degree murder unless it was both planned and deliberate.








If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the
Crown has proven all the essential elements of murder and the Crown has also
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was planned and deliberate,
you may convict the accused of first degree murder.  If you are not satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt the Crown has proven the murder was planned and
deliberate, you should not convict Mr. Jacquard of first degree murder but you
may convict him of second degree murder.

 

74                              
These directions do not refer to the evidence pertaining to mental
illness and the possible effect it might have on the appellant’s ability to
plan and deliberate upon the killing of the victim.  Such instructions were an
essential element of this charge.  The accused facing the most serious charge
in the Criminal Code  was entitled to no less.  It is a fundamental
element of the directions on this offence.  Just as the evidence relating to
the consumption of alcohol must be related to the elements of planning and
deliberation so too must the evidence pertaining to mental illness be related
those elements.

 

75                              
I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

 

1                 Cory J. ‑‑ We are in
substantial agreement with the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal
(1996), 74 B.C.A.C. 257, 121 W.A.C. 257, 106 C.C.C. (3d) 348.  This case was
relatively short and counsel reviewed the evidence extensively.  The appellant
neither testified nor called evidence.

 

2                 The
trial judge adequately instructed the jury as to the evidence they could
consider in determining whether the presumption in the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 212(3) , had been rebutted.  He advised them to
consider all of the evidence as to how the appellant and the prostitute were
living together in the apartment and the manner in which the finances were
dealt with.  With respect to the opinion of the minority in the Court of
Appeal, it was not essential that the trial judge isolate and specify a
“particular and severable” item of evidence that was capable of being evidence
to the contrary.

 

3                 This
appeal which comes to us as of right is dismissed.

 

Judgment accordingly.

The police received a tip from a Crime Stoppers
Association that the accused was growing marijuana in his basement.  A police
officer went to the accused’s house accompanied by a sniffer dog on four
different occasions.  The officer and the dog walked the street in front of the
residence and each time the dog indicated the presence of drugs in the house. 
On one occasion, the officer  smelled the aroma of marijuana coming from the
house.  He also observed that the basement windows were covered and that one
window was barred shut.  On the basis of these observations, the officer
obtained a search warrant.  The information filed in support of the application
for the warrant also disclosed that the officer had received a Crime Stoppers
tip.  Following a search of the house, the accused was charged with cultivation
of marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.  At
trial, the accused asserted that, pursuant to his right under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to make full answer and defence,  he was
entitled to the Crime Stoppers document reporting the tip.  The Crown
refused disclosure on the ground of informer privilege.  The trial judge viewed
the document and attempted to edit out all references to the identity of the
informer.  He then ordered disclosure.  The Crown asked to rely on the warrant
without reference to the tip.  The trial judge refused this request
because the accused did not consent.  As a result, the Crown ceased to tender
evidence, the defence elected to call no evidence, and the trial judge entered
an acquittal.  The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision and
ordered a new trial.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

Per Lamer C.J. and La
Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: The rule
of informer privilege is of such fundamental importance to the workings of a
criminal justice system that it cannot be balanced against other interests 
relating to the administration of justice.  Once the privilege has been
established,  neither the police nor the court possesses discretion to abridge
it.  The privilege belongs to the Crown, which cannot waive it without the
informer’s consent. In that sense, the privilege also belongs to the informer.
The privilege prevents not only disclosure of the informer’s name, but also of
any information which might implicitly reveal his identity.  In the case of  an
anonymous informer, it is almost impossible for a court to know what details
may reveal his identity.

 








The informer privilege is subject only to the
“innocence at stake” exception.   In order to raise this exception, there must
be a basis on the evidence for concluding that disclosure of the informer’s 
identity is necessary to demonstrate the innocence of the accused.  The
accused’s right to full disclosure of documents in the Crown’s possession in
aid of the Charter  guarantee of the right to make full answer and
defence, as interpreted in Stinchcombe,  has not created a new exception
to the informer privilege rule.  To the extent that rules and privileges stand
in the way of an innocent person establishing his innocence, they must yield to
the Charter  guarantee of a fair trial.   By permitting an exception
where innocence is at stake, the common law rule of informer privilege does not
offend this principle.  

 

Where an accused seeks to establish that a search
warrant was not supported by reasonable grounds, he may be entitled to
information which may reveal the identity of an informer notwithstanding
informer privilege  in circumstances where the information is absolutely
essential.  “Essential” circumstances exist  where the accused establishes the
“innocence at stake” exception to informer privilege.  Thus, absent a basis for
concluding that disclosure of  the information that may reveal the identity of
the informer  is necessary to establish the innocence of the accused, the
information remains privileged and cannot be produced, whether at the hearing
into the reasonableness of the search or at the trial proper.

 

Anonymous tip sheets should not be edited with a view
to disclosing them to the defence unless the accused can bring himself within
the innocence at stake exception.  To do so runs the risk that the court will
deprive the informer of the privilege which belongs to him absolutely, subject
only to the “innocence at stake” exception.  It also undermines the efficacy of
programs such as Crime Stoppers, which depend on guarantees of anonymity to
those who volunteer information on crimes.  In the case of an anonymous
informer, where it is impossible to determine which details of the information
provided by the informer will or will not result in that person’s identity
being revealed, none of those details should be disclosed, unless there is a
basis to conclude that the innocence at stake exception applies. 

 








Here,  the trial judge erred in editing the tip sheet
and  in ordering the edited sheet disclosed to the accused.  The identity of
the anonymous informer was protected by  privilege and, given the anonymous
nature of the tip, it was impossible to conclude whether the disclosure of
details remaining after editing might be sufficient to reveal the identity of
the informer to the accused.  The informer’s privilege required  nothing short
of total confidentiality in this case.  As it was not established that the
informer’s identity was necessary to establish the innocence of the accused,
the privilege continued in place.

 

The trial judge also erred  in declining to allow the
Crown to delete the reference  to the informer from the material in support of
the search warrant. Since the accused has not brought himself within the
“innocence at stake” exception,  the trial judge should have permitted the Crown
to defend the warrant on the material in the information to obtain the warrant
with the reference to the Crime Stoppers’ tip deleted.

 

Per L’Heureux-Dubé J.:
The details of the informer’s tip should not have been disclosed in this case.
McLachlin J.’s description of the general principles and procedure to be
considered when the defence makes a request to see an anonymous tip is agreed
with.  However, as it is not strictly necessary, no opinion is expressed
regarding the Charter  argument and other issues raised in her reasons.

//McLachlin J.//

 

The judgment of Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka,
Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

1                 McLachlin J. -- This appeal raises the
issue of whether the defence is entitled to receive details of an informer
telephone tip to Crime Stoppers, a public service organization working to
combat crime.  The appellant asserts that he is entitled to such details
pursuant to his right under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
to make full answer and defence.  The Crown argues that disclosure is barred by
the common law rule that an informer’s communications are privileged.  For the
reasons that follow, I am of the view that the information is privileged and
need not be disclosed.

 

 

I.  The Facts

 








2                 The
police received a tip from the Greater Vancouver Crime Stoppers Association
that the appellant, Richard Leipert, was growing marijuana in his basement.  A
police detective went to Leipert’s residence accompanied by Bruno, a sniffer
dog.   On four different occasions the policeman and Bruno walked the street in
front of Leipert’s residence.  Each time Bruno indicated the presence of drugs
in Leipert’s house.  On one occasion, the policeman smelled the aroma of
marijuana coming from Leipert’s house.  The officer also observed that the
basement windows were covered and one window was barred shut.   On the basis of
these observations, the officer obtained a search warrant.  The information
filed in support of the application for the warrant disclosed that the officer
had received a Crime Stoppers tip that drugs were being grown in Leipert’s
house.  However, the main allegations raised in support of the warrant were the
observations of the police officer at the site.  When the search warrant was
executed, evidence was seized and the appellant was charged with cultivation of
marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.

 

II.  Rulings

 

3                 At
trial, the accused asked the officer if he had the Crime Stoppers document
reporting the tip.  The officer had the document, but the Crown refused
disclosure on the ground of informer privilege.  The trial judge viewed the
document and attempted to edit out all references to the identity of the
informer.  He then ordered disclosure.  The Crown asked to rely on the warrant
without reference to the tip.  The trial judge refused this request because the
accused did not consent.  As a result, the Crown ceased to tender evidence, the
defence elected to call no evidence, and the trial judge entered an acquittal. 


 








4                 The
Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the trial judge and ordered a new
trial: (1996), 74 B.C.A.C. 271, 121 W.A.C. 271, 106 C.C.C. (3d) 375, 47 C.R.
(4th) 31.  Southin J.A. declined production on the ground that the tip was
irrelevant; while evidence of the tip figured as part of the narrative, the
Crown did not rely on it either to justify the issuance of the warrant or to
prove guilt.  McEachern C.J.B.C., agreeing in the result and with most of
Southin J.A.’s reasons, asserted that the document recording the tip was
privileged, subject only to the “innocence at stake” exception.   In his view,
it was unnecessary and unfortunate that the trial judge had examined the tip
sheet.  McEachern C.J.B.C. further held that the trial judge erred in refusing
the Crown’s request to rely on the information with the reference to the tip
sheet deleted.  Trial judges should be cautious, he asserted, in ordering the
production of even carefully edited tip sheets or reports for which informant
privilege is claimed, given the possibility that even seemingly innocuous
details may lead to identification of the informant.  McEachern C.J.B.C.
concluded by commending Crime Stoppers for the valuable public service it
provides.  Cumming J.A. agreed with the disposition of both his colleagues.

 

III.  The Issues

 

5       1. 
Did the trial judge err in ordering the production of the edited tip sheet?

 

2. In the absence of defence consent, was the Crown entitled to
sustain the validity of the warrant without reference to the tip?

 

IV.  Discussion

 

A.  Did the Trial Judge Err in Ordering Production of the Edited
Tip Sheet?

 

(1)  The Argument on Informer Privilege

 

6                 The
appellant relies on the principle that the Crown is under a general duty to
disclose all information within its control unless it is clearly irrelevant or
privileged: R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 339.  He
argues that the Crown did not establish that the information in the tip sheet
was clearly irrelevant.  As for privilege, he asserts that there is no
privilege in the edited document which the trial judge ordered disclosed, since
it could not reveal the identity of the informer.  It follows, he concludes,
that the trial judge properly ordered production of the tip sheet to the
defence. 

 








7                 The
Crown in reply asserts that the entire tip sheet is privileged, subject only to
the “innocence at stake” exception.  Since that exception is not proved, the
tip sheet should not have been disclosed.  The trial judge’s approach of
editing the privileged document to transform it into a non-privileged document
is improper and risky, as seemingly innocuous details may be sufficient to
identify an informant.  This would, moreover, undermine Crime Stoppers’
efficacy, which depends on being able to assure informants that they will not
be identified.

 

8                 The
trial judge was faced with two apparently conflicting rules.  The first was the
rule requiring disclosure to the defence of all information not clearly
irrelevant or privileged.  The second was the rule of informer privilege.  The
trial judge attempted to accommodate both rules by editing the tip sheet to
remove information that could reveal the tipster’s identity and ordering
production of the balance of the tip sheet.  I share the view of McEachern
C.J.B.C. in the Court of Appeal that the trial judge’s approach gave
insufficient weight to both the importance of maintaining informer privilege and
the danger of ordering disclosure of tip sheets containing details which,
despite editing, may enable an accused person  to identify the informant.  

 

(a)  The Importance of Informer Privilege

 

9                 A
court considering this issue must begin from the proposition that informer
privilege is an ancient and hallowed protection which plays a vital role in law
enforcement.   It is premised on the duty of all citizens to aid in enforcing
the law.  The discharge of this duty carries with it the risk of retribution
from those involved in crime.  The rule of informer privilege was developed to
protect citizens who assist in law enforcement and to encourage others to do
the same.  As Cory J.A. (as he then was) stated in R. v. Hunter (1987),
57 C.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 5-6:

 








The rule against the non-disclosure
of information which might identify an informer is one of long standing.  It
developed from an acceptance of the importance of the role of informers in the
solution of crimes and the apprehension of criminals.  It was recognized that
citizens have a duty to divulge to the police any information that they may
have pertaining to the commission of a crime.  It was also obvious to the
courts from very early times that the identity of an informer would have to be
concealed, both for his or her own protection and to encourage others to
divulge to the authorities any information pertaining to crimes.  It was in
order to achieve these goals that the rule was developed.

 

10               The
rule is of fundamental importance to the workings of a criminal justice
system.  As described in Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60,
at p. 105: 

 

The rule gives a peace officer the
power to promise his informers secrecy expressly or by implication, with a
guarantee sanctioned by the law that this promise will be kept even in court,
and to receive in exchange for this promise information without which it would
be extremely difficult for him to carry out his duties and ensure that the
criminal law is obeyed.

 

 

In R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at p. 994, Cory J.
stressed the heightened importance of the rule in the context of drug
investigations:

 

 

 

The value of informers to police
investigations has long been recognized.  As long as crimes have been
committed, certainly as long as they have been prosecuted, informers have
played an important role in their investigation.  It may well be true that some
informers act for compensation or for self-serving purposes.  Whatever their
motives, the position of informers is always precarious and their role is
fraught with danger.

 

The role of informers in
drug-related cases is particularly important and dangerous.  Informers often
provide the only means for the police to gain some knowledge of the workings of
drug trafficking operations and networks. . . .  The investigation often will
be based upon a relationship of trust between the police officer and the informer,
something that may take a long time to establish.  The safety, indeed the
lives, not only of informers but also of the undercover police officers will
depend on that relationship of trust.

 








11               In
most cases, the identity of the informer is known to the police.  However, in
cases like the instant one, the identity of the informer is unknown to everyone
including the Crime Stoppers’ agent who received the call.  The importance of
the informer privilege rule in cases where the identity of the informer is
anonymous was stressed by the California Court of Appeal in People v. Callen,
194 Cal.App.3d 558 (1987).  The court, in holding that the police have no duty
to determine or disclose the identity of anonymous informers, stated at p. 587:


 

 

Such an investigatory burden would
not only be onerous and frequently futile, it would destroy programs such as
Crimestoppers by removing the guarantee of anonymity.  Anonymity is the key to
such a program.  It is the promise of anonymity which allays the fear of
criminal retaliation which otherwise discourages citizen involvement in
reporting crime.  In turn, by guaranteeing anonymity, Crimestoppers provides
law enforcement with information it might never otherwise obtain.  We are
satisfied the benefits of a Crimestoppers-type program -- citizen involvement
in reporting crime and criminals -- far outweigh any speculative benefits to
the defense arising from imposing a duty on law enforcement to gather and
preserve evidence of the identity of informants who wish to remain anonymous.

 

12               Informer
privilege is of such importance that once found, courts are not entitled to
balance the benefit enuring from the privilege against countervailing
considerations, as is the case, for example, with Crown privilege or privileges
based on Wigmore’s four-part test: J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant,
The Law of Evidence in Canada (1992), at pp. 805-6.  In Bisaillon v.
Keable, supra, this Court contrasted informer privilege with Crown
privilege in this regard.  In Crown privilege, the judge may review the
information and in the last resort revise the minister’s decisions by weighing
the two conflicting interests, that of maintaining secrecy and that of doing
justice.  The Court stated at pp. 97-98:

 

This procedure, designed to
implement Crown privilege, is pointless in the case of secrecy regarding a
police informer.  In this case, the law gives the Minister, and the Court after
him, no power of weighing or evaluating various aspects of the public interest
which are in conflict, since it has already resolved the conflict itself.  It
has decided once and for all, subject to the law being changed, that
information regarding police informers’ identity will be, because of its
content, a class of information which it is in the public interest to keep
secret, and that this interest will prevail over the need to ensure the highest
possible standard of justice.

 








Accordingly, the common law has
made secrecy regarding police informers subject to a special system with its
own rules, which differ from those applicable to Crown privilege.

 

13               The
Court in Bisaillon v. Keable summed the matter up by asserting that the
application of informer privilege “does not depend on the judge’s discretion,
as it is a legal rule of public order by which the judge is bound” (p. 93).

 

14               In
summary, informer privilege is of such importance that it cannot be balanced
against other interests.  Once established,  neither the police nor the court
possesses discretion to abridge it.   

 

(b)  Who May Claim Informer Privilege?

 

15               The
privilege belongs to the Crown: Solicitor General  of Canada v. Royal
Commission of Inquiry (Ontario Health Records), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 494. 
However, the Crown cannot, without the informer’s consent, waive the privilege either
expressly or by implication by not raising it: Bisaillon v. Keable,
supra, at p. 94.  In that sense, it also belongs to the informer.  This
follows from the purpose of the privilege, being the protection of those who
provide information to the police and the encouragement of others to do the
same.  This is the second reason why the police and courts do not have a
discretion to relieve against the privilege.  

 








16               The
fact that the privilege also belongs to the informer raises special concerns in
the case of anonymous informants, like those who provide telephone tips to
Crime Stoppers.   Since the informer whom the privilege is designed to protect
and his or her circumstances are unknown, it is often difficult to predict with
certainty what information might allow the accused to identify the informer.  A
detail as innocuous as the time of the telephone call may be sufficient to
permit identification.  In such circumstances, courts must exercise great care
not to unwittingly deprive informers of the privilege which the law accords to
them.

 

 

(c)  The Scope of Informer Privilege

 

17               Connected
as it is to the essential effectiveness of the criminal law, informer privilege
is broad in scope.  While developed in criminal proceedings, it applies in
civil proceedings as well: Bisaillon v. Keable, supra.  It
applies to a witness on the stand. Such a person cannot be compelled to state
whether he or she is a police informer: Bisaillon v. Keable, supra. 
And it applies to the undisclosed informant, the person who although never
called as a witness, supplies information to the police.  Subject only to the
“innocence at stake” exception, the Crown and the court are bound not to reveal
the undisclosed informant’s identity. 

 

18               Informer
privilege prevents not only disclosure of the name of the informant, but of any
information which might implicitly reveal his or her identity.  Courts have
acknowledged that the smallest details may be sufficient to reveal identity. 
In R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at p. 1460, Sopinka J.
suggested that trial judges, when editing a wiretap packet, consider:

 

. . . whether the identities of confidential police
informants, and consequently their lives and safety, may be compromised,
bearing in mind that such disclosure may occur as much by reference to the
nature of the information supplied by the confidential source as by the
publication of his or her name;

 

 

This principle was also confirmed by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in R. v. Hardy (1994), 45 B.C.A.C. 146, at p. 149:








 

 

It is well recognized that information which might
identify a confidential informant need not be disclosed to the Justice of the
Peace or at trial.

 

Similarly, McEachern C.J.B.C. in the case at bar suggested (at para.
35) that an “accused may know that only some very small circle of persons,
perhaps only one, may know an apparently innocuous fact that is mentioned in
the document”.  He noted: “The privilege is a hallowed one, and it should be
respected scrupulously”.

 

19               The
jurisprudence therefore suggests that the Crown must claim privilege over
information that reveals the identity of the informant or that may implicitly
reveal identity.  In many cases, the Crown will be able to contact the informer
to determine the extent of information that can be released without
jeopardizing the anonymity of the tipster.  The informer is the only person who
knows the potential danger of releasing those facts to the accused.  The
difficulty in this case is that the identity of the informer is unknown.
Therefore, the Crown is not in a position to determine whether any part of the
information could reveal his or her identity.  This led the Crown in the case
at bar to claim privilege for all of the information provided by the informer. 
The extension of  privilege to all information that could identify an informant
justifies this claim in the case of an anonymous informant.

 

(d)  The “Innocence at Stake” Exception

 

20               Informer
privilege is subject only to one exception, known as the “innocence at stake”
exception.  Lord Esher, M.R., described this exception in Marks v. Beyfus
(1890), 25 Q.B.D. 494 (C.A.), at p. 498:

 

 








. . . if upon the trial of a prisoner the judge should
be of opinion that the disclosure of the name of the informant is necessary or
right in order to shew the prisoner’s innocence, then one public policy is in
conflict with another public policy, and that which says that an innocent man
is not to be condemned when his innocence can be proved is the policy that must
prevail.   

 

 

 

In Bisaillon v. Keable, supra, this Court held
(at p. 93):

 

The rule is subject to only one exception, imposed by
the need to demonstrate the innocence of an accused person.

 

 

 

As Cory J. stated in Scott, supra, at pp. 995-96:

 

 

 

In our system the right of an individual accused to
establish his or her innocence by raising a reasonable doubt as to guilt has
always remained paramount.

 

 

21               In
order to raise the “innocence at stake” exception to informer privilege, there
must be a basis on the evidence for concluding that disclosure of the
informer’s  identity is necessary to demonstrate the innocence of the accused: R.
v. Chiarantano, [1990] O.J. No. 2603 (C.A.), per Brooke J.A., aff’d
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 906.  In Chiarantano, the possibility that the
information provided by the informer regarding the arrival at a residence of
drugs later found in the possession of the accused might conflict with the
evidence of the accused was held not to raise a basis for disclosure pursuant
to the “innocence at stake” exception.  The court held that the usefulness of
the information was speculative and that mere speculation that the information
might assist the defence is insufficient.   If speculation sufficed to
remove the privilege, little if anything would be left of the protection which
the privilege purports to accord.  

 








22               On
the other hand, circumstances may arise where the evidence establishes a basis
for the exception, as where the informer is a material witness to the crime or
acted as an agent provocateur: see Scott, supra.  Where
such a basis is established, the privilege must yield to the principle that a
person is not to be condemned when his or her innocence can be proved.

 

(e)  Informer Privilege and the Charter

 

23               It
has been suggested (although not by the appellant) that the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms , as interpreted in Stinchcombe, supra,
has introduced another exception to the informer privilege rule based on the
right to full disclosure of documents in the Crown’s possession in aid of the Charter 
guarantee of the right to make full answer and defence: D. M. Tanovich “When
Does Stinchcombe Demand that the Crown Reveal the Identity of a Police
Informer?” (1995), 38 C.R. (4th) 202.  According to this argument, “innocence
at stake” would no longer be the only exception to the informer privilege rule.

 

24               This
argument rests on a right to disclosure broader than any which this Court has
enunciated.  In  Stinchcombe, supra, the right to disclosure of
Crown documents was expressly made subject to two conditions: relevance (to be
interpreted generously as including all that is not clearly irrelevant) and
privilege.  The right to disclosure was not to trump privilege.  Any doubt
about its application to informer privilege was expressly negated (at p. 335):

 

. . . it is suggested that disclosure may put at risk
the security and safety of persons who have provided the prosecution with
information.  No doubt measures must occasionally be taken to protect the
identity of witnesses and informers.  Protection of the identity of
informers is covered by the rules relating to informer privilege and exceptions
thereto. . . . [Emphasis added.]








 

 

In R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, and  A. (L.L.) v.
B. (A.), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536, this Court in dealing with disclosure of
third party medical and therapeutic records, did not suggest that the informer
privilege rule had been altered by the requirement of Crown disclosure, under
the Charter . Rather, it appears to have endorsed the common law rule:
“so important is the societal interest in preventing a miscarriage of justice
that our law requires the state to disclose the identity of an informer in
certain circumstances, despite the fact that the revelation may jeopardize the
informer’s safety”: O’Connor, supra, at para. 18, per
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.  The comments of L’Heureux-Dubé J. in A. (L.L.) v.
B. (A.), supra, at paras. 37 and 69, are to the same effect.  This
Court has consistently affirmed that it is a fundamental principle of justice,
protected by the Charter , that the innocent must not be convicted: R.
v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 611; Stinchcombe, supra;
O’Connor, supra.  To the extent that rules and privileges stand in
the way of an innocent person establishing his or her innocence, they must
yield to the Charter  guarantee of a fair trial.  The common law rule of
informer privilege, however, does not offend this principle.  From its earliest
days, the rule  has affirmed the priority of the policy of the law “that an
innocent man is not to be condemned when his innocence can be proved” by
permitting an exception to the privilege where innocence is at stake:  Marks
v. Beyfus, supra.  It is therefore not surprising that this Court
has repeatedly referred to informer privilege as an example of the policy of
the law that the innocent should not be convicted, rather than as a deviation
from it.

 

25               I
find no inconsistency between the Charter  right to disclosure of Crown
documents affirmed in Stinchcombe, supra, and the common law rule
of informer privilege.

 

(f)  Informer Privilege and Challenges to Search
Warrants








26               Where
the accused seeks to establish that a search warrant was not supported by
reasonable grounds, the accused may be entitled to information which may reveal
the identity of an informer notwithstanding informer privilege  “in circumstances
where it is absolutely essential”:   Scott, supra, at p. 996.  
“Essential” circumstances exist  where the accused establishes the “innocence
at stake ” exception to informer privilege.   Such a case might arise, for
example, where there is evidence suggesting that the goods seized in execution
of the warrant were planted.  To establish that the informer planted the goods
or had information as to how they came to be planted, the accused might
properly seek disclosure of information that may incidentally reveal the
identity of the informer.

 

27               Absent
a basis for concluding that disclosure of  the information that may reveal the
identity of the informer  is necessary to establish the innocence of the
accused, the information remains privileged and cannot be produced, whether on
a hearing into the reasonableness of the search or on the trial proper.

 

(g)  Judicial Editing

 








28               The
ultimate issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in editing the
tip sheet to remove references to the informer’s identity and in ordering the
edited sheet disclosed to the appellant.  In addressing this question, I have
regard to the following propositions, discussed above.  Informer privilege is
of great importance.  Once established, the privilege cannot be diminished by
or “balanced off against” other concerns relating to the administration of
justice.  The police and the court have no discretion to diminish it and are
bound to uphold it.  The only exception to the privilege is found where there
is a basis to conclude that the information may be necessary to establish the
innocence of the accused.  The scope of the rule extends not only to the name of
the informer, but to any details which might reveal the informer’s identity. 
It is virtually impossible for the court to know what details may reveal the
identity of an anonymous informer.  The same considerations apply on challenges
to search warrants or wiretap authorizations.

 

29               These
considerations suggest that anonymous tip sheets should not be edited with a
view to disclosing them to the defence unless the accused can bring himself
within the innocence at stake exception.  To do so runs the risk that the court
will deprive the informer of the privilege which belongs to him or her
absolutely, subject only to the “innocence at stake” exception.  It also
undermines the efficacy of programs such as Crimestoppers, which depend on
guarantees of anonymity to those who volunteer information on crimes.

 

30               The
appellant relies on judicial editing of confidential material approved in
challenges to wiretap authorizations.  In Garofoli, supra,
Sopinka J. stated at p. 1458: “Editing . . . is essential in cases in which
confidential information is included in the affidavit filed in support of an
authorization.”  He added, “In determining what to edit, the judge will have
regard for the rule against disclosure of police informants.”  A similar
conclusion was reached per Cory J. in Hunter, supra.

 








31               These
cases are distinguishable from the case at bar on two grounds.  First, the
informants in those cases were not anonymous, enabling the court to make
judgments on what details might or might not reveal the identity of the
informers.  Second, the defence was seeking to review the affidavit or
“Information to Obtain” filed in support of the application for the
authorization, as distinguished from background documents and information.  In
the case at bar, the appellant had disclosure of the “Information to Obtain”. 
He knew the entire basis for the authorization.  He wanted more -- the details
of the information given by the tipster.  Those details, recorded by the police
officer who received the call, were contained in a separate document.  In Hunter,
Garofoli and Scott, the combination of the known informant and the
fact that what was at issue was the very document upon which the Crown relied
to sustain the warrant or authorization, supported the approval for editing. 
The case here is quite different.

 

32               There
may be cases where the informer and his circumstances are known, in which the
court can be certain that what remains of an informant document after editing
will not reveal the informer’s identity.  When, however, as in the case at bar,
it is impossible to determine which details of the information provided by an
informer will or will not result in that person’s identity being revealed, then
none of those details should be disclosed, unless there is a basis to conclude
that the innocence at stake exception applies. 

 

(h)  Procedure

 

33               When
an accused seeks disclosure of  privileged informer information on the basis of
the “innocence at stake” exception, the following procedure will apply.  First,
the accused must show some basis to conclude that without the disclosure sought
his or her innocence is at stake.  If such a basis is shown, the court may then
review the information to determine whether, in fact, the information is
necessary to prove the accused’s innocence.  If the court concludes that
disclosure is necessary, the court should only reveal as much information as is
essential to allow proof of innocence.  Before disclosing the information to
the accused, the Crown should be given  the option of staying the proceedings. 
If the Crown chooses to proceed, disclosure of the information essential to
establish innocence may be provided to the accused.

 

(i)  Application to the Case at Bar








34               The
identity of the anonymous informer was protected by informer privilege.  The
police and the courts were bound to protect the identity of the informant from
disclosure.  Given the anonymous nature of the tip, it was impossible to
conclude whether the disclosure of details remaining after editing might be
sufficient to reveal the identity of the informer to the accused and others who
might have been involved in this crime and seeking retribution.  It follows
that the statement should not have been edited and ordered disclosed to the
defence.  The informer’s privilege required nothing short of total
confidentiality. As it was not established that the identity was necessary to
establish the innocence of the accused, the privilege continued in place. 

 

(2)  The Relevance Argument

 

35               Southin
J.A. in the Court of Appeal, speaking for the court on this point, allowed the
appeal on the ground that the tip was merely part of the narrative and formed
no part of the Crown’s case.  She noted it was not necessary to the Crown’s
application for a search warrant.  What made the issuance of a search warrant
reasonable was not the tip, but the observations of the police officer who
subsequently investigated the locale with his dog.  Nor did the tip form part
of the Crown’s case against the appellant, which rested solely on other
evidence.  In response, the appellant argues that since the informer’s
information was not clearly irrelevant, and might conceivably be of assistance
to the appellant, it fell within the Stinchcombe rule and disclosure was
required.

 

36               In
view of my conclusion that the informer privilege deprives the appellant of any
right to disclosure which might otherwise have arisen under Stinchcombe,
it is not necessary for me to consider this argument. 

 








B.      Did the Trial Judge Err
in Declining to Allow the Crown to Delete the Reference to the Informer from
the Material in Support of the Warrant?

 

 

 

37               The
trial judge declined to permit the Crown to withdraw the reference to the tip
from the “Information to Obtain” and defend the warrant without reference to
it.  In his view, this could not be done unless the appellant consented.  In my
view, this was an error.

 

38               The
issue before the trial judge was whether there were reasonable grounds for the
issuance of the warrant.  If the Crown wished to limit its defence of the
reasonableness of the warrant and subsequent search to particular grounds, it
was entitled to do so.  At the end of the day, the task of the judge was to
make a ruling on reasonableness on the basis of the information relied on by
the Crown.  

 

39               If
a warrant could not be sustained on less than all the information that was
before the issuing officer, warrants based on edited supporting material could
never be upheld.   The law, however, is otherwise.  As Sopinka J. stated in Garofoli,
supra, at p. 1461: “If the Crown can support the authorization on the basis
of the material as edited, the authorization is confirmed.” 

 

40               In
the case at bar, the appellant has not brought himself within the “innocence at
stake” exception.  Therefore, the trial judge should have permitted the Crown
to defend the warrant on the material in the “Information to Obtain” with the
reference to the Crime Stoppers’ tip deleted.

 

V.  Conclusion

 








41               I
would dismiss the appeal and confirm the order for a new trial.

 

//L’Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

42               L’Heureux-Dubé J. -- I have read the
reasons for judgment of McLachlin J.   Like her, I am of the view that the
details of the informer’s tip should not have been disclosed in this case.  I
also agree with her description of the general principles and procedure to be
considered when the defence makes a request to see an anonymous tip.  As it is
not strictly necessary to do so, however, I prefer not to express an opinion
regarding the Charter  argument and other issues raised in her reasons.  

 

43               I
would dispose of the appeal as proposed by McLachlin J.

The accused was the father of T, a severely disabled
child who suffered from extreme cerebral palsy and was quadriplegic.  As a result
of her physical condition, T was largely immobile and bedridden, and was
physically unable to take care of herself.  Her family provided her with
constant care.  T was in constant pain, and despite the administration of
medication, experienced five or six seizures a day.  T died while in the care
of the accused, who advised the RCMP by telephone that she had passed away in
her sleep.  An autopsy found signs consistent with poisoning, and tests
then indicated that T’s blood was saturated with carbon monoxide.  The RCMP
began to treat the matter as a homicide investigation.  Two officers went to
the accused’s farm, where one of them told the accused that what he was about
to say had “very serious consequences”.  The accused was told that he was being
detained for investigation into the death of his daughter.  He was informed of
his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, of the availability of
Legal Aid duty counsel, and of his right to remain silent.  The accused was
then taken to the police station, where he was interviewed after being again
warned that this was a serious matter and reminded of his right to counsel and
to remain silent.  There was a phone sitting in front of him, with a telephone
number on it for Legal Aid.  The accused made a full confession.  After
receiving a further reminder about the right to counsel and the right to
silence, the accused then made a written statement.  That afternoon, the
accused returned with the officers to his farm, where he pointed out the
equipment he claimed to have used to end his daughter’s life.  The tour of the
farm was videotaped.  During his trial by jury, the accused alleged that he had
not been properly informed of the availability of Legal Aid duty counsel in the
manner mandated in this Court’s judgment in Bartle, which he argued
entitled him to be advised of a toll‑free number by which free legal
advice could be accessed, irrespective of financial need.  The trial judge
found that the accused was adequately informed of his right to counsel.  The
accused was convicted of second degree murder and given the mandatory sentence
of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for ten years.  The Court
of Appeal dismissed his appeal.

 

Subsequent to the Court of Appeal’s judgment, the
parties jointly adduced fresh evidence before this Court which demonstrates
that Crown counsel at trial had interfered with the jury.  The affidavit
indicates that trial counsel for the Crown and an RCMP officer prepared a
questionnaire asking prospective jurors for their views on a number of issues. 
This questionnaire was administered by RCMP officers to 30 of the 198
prospective jurors and also led to some unrecorded discussions with prospective
jurors, which went beyond the exact questions posed in the questionnaire.  At
no time did Crown counsel at trial disclose the direct contact with prospective
jurors to the trial  judge, the defence, or the Sheriff.  Of the 30 prospective
jurors who were administered the questionnaire, five served on the jury which
convicted the accused.

 

 








Held:  The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

The accused’s detention was not arbitrary. 
Notwithstanding what their intention may have been, the RCMP officers who
attended at the farm put the accused under de facto arrest.  A de
facto arrest occurred through the use of words that conveyed clearly that
the accused was under arrest, the conduct of the officers, and the accused’s
submission to the officers’ authority.  Moreover, on the facts of this case,
that de facto arrest was entirely lawful because it was based on
reasonable and probable grounds that the accused had taken his daughter’s
life.  Those grounds included the carbon monoxide in T’s blood, strongly
suggesting that she had been poisoned; the fact that it was extremely unlikely
that T’s death had been accidental; the fact that, because of T’s physical
condition, her death could not have been suicide; and the fact that the accused
had both opportunity and motive.  A de facto arrest which is lawful cannot
be an arbitrary detention for the purposes of s. 9 .

 








The failure to inform the accused that he had been
“arrested” and that he could be charged with murder does not violate
s. 10 (a) of the Charter .  The purpose of the section, which
provides the right to be informed promptly of the reasons for one’s arrest or
detention, is to ensure that a person understands generally the jeopardy in
which he or she finds himself or herself.  The Charter  lays down this
requirement for two reasons:  first, because it would be a gross interference
with individual liberty for persons to have to submit to arrest without knowing
the reasons for that arrest, and second, because it would be difficult to
exercise the right to counsel protected by s. 10 (b) in a meaningful
way if one were not aware of the extent of one’s jeopardy.  On the facts of
this case, the trial judge was right in finding that the accused understood the
basis for his apprehension by the police and hence the extent of his jeopardy. 
He knew that his daughter had died, and that he was being detained for
investigation into that death.  The arresting constable prefaced his comments
by stating that what he was about to say had very serious consequences.  The
accused was informed of the right to counsel and the right to silence, and was
told he could not go into his own house by himself to change his clothes.  It
is clear that the accused knew that he was in an extremely grave situation as
regards his daughter’s death, and that s. 10 (a) cannot be said to
have been violated.

 

The RCMP officers adequately informed the accused of
the means to access available duty counsel services as is required by
s. 10 (b) of the Charter , as interpreted in Bartle.  Bartle
stands for the proposition that s. 10 (b) encompasses the right to
be informed of the means to access those duty counsel services which are
available at the time of arrest.  According to the evidence before this Court,
toll‑free access to duty counsel in Saskatchewan was offered only outside
normal office hours.  Since the accused was arrested during normal office
hours, no toll‑free service was available to him, and the RCMP therefore
did not breach the informational component of s. 10 (b) by failing
to inform the accused of the existence of a toll‑free number. 
Furthermore, the information that was provided to the accused adequately
apprised him of the means to contact the duty counsel service which was
available at the local Legal Aid Office.  The accused was informed of that duty
counsel service on two occasions — when he was arrested at his farm, and before
the commencement of his interview at the police station.  While on neither
occasion did the arresting officers verbally give the accused the phone number
for the local Legal Aid Office, s. 10(b) did not require them to
take that extra step, in the circumstances of this case.  Where an individual
is detained during regular business hours, and when legal assistance is
available through a local telephone number which can easily be found by the
person in question, neither the letter nor the spirit of Bartle is
breached simply by not providing that individual with the local phone number.

 








The actions of Crown counsel in interfering with
prospective jurors were nothing short of a flagrant abuse of process and
interference with the administration of justice.  Given the interference with
the jury, a new trial must be ordered, as conceded by the Crown.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

The Chief Justice --

 

I.  Introduction

 

1                                  
Let me begin by saying what the case before the Court at this stage of
the proceedings is not about.  This case is not about those questions
which have dominated public debate about Mr. Latimer’s trial.  It is not about
the legality and morality of mercy killing, nor is it directly about Mr.
Latimer’s guilt or innocence.  What this case is about are two narrower
issues: first, the admissibility of certain evidence in light of the
circumstances surrounding Mr. Latimer’s arrest; and second, the consequences
flowing from the unfortunate events that took place prior to the commencement
of the trial with respect to potential members of the jury.   I mention this to
correct any impression that the Court, in its judgment today, has deliberately
avoided answering difficult questions which are on the minds of many Canadians. 









 

2                                  
As will become apparent in my reasons, the disposition of this appeal
requires the interpretation and application of  this Court’s judgment in R.
v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173.  In Bartle, and the companion
judgments handed down on the same day (R. v. Prosper, [1994] 3 S.C.R.
236, R. v. Pozniak, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 310, R. v. Matheson, [1994] 3
S.C.R. 328, R. v. Harper, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 343, and R. v. Cobham,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 360), this Court held that the informational component of s.
10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  included the
right of an accused to be informed not only of the existence and availability
of free duty counsel, but also of the means of access to duty counsel,
including being informed of a toll-free telephone  number to contact duty
counsel where duty counsel is  accessible at that number 24 hours a day.  The
question we must answer today is whether and to what extent Bartle
applies in a province which has established a system of toll-free access to duty
counsel which only operates outside normal office hours, while nevertheless
offering the same service during business hours, though through the regular
Legal Aid offices.

    

II.  The
Facts

 

3                                  
The appellant, Mr. Latimer, was the father of Tracy Latimer, a severely
disabled child who died at her family farm on Sunday, October 24, 1993.  Tracy
suffered from extreme cerebral palsy and was quadriplegic.  As a result of her
physical condition,  she was largely immobile and bedridden, and was physically
unable to take care of herself.  Her family provided her with constant care. 
Eating was a difficult task, and Tracy had to be spoon fed.  Unfortunately,
even with this assistance, she could not consume a sufficient amount of
nutrients, and as a result experienced weight loss.

 








4                                  
It is undisputed that Tracy was in constant pain.  The evidence traces
this pain to an operation  that Tracy underwent in 1990 to balance the muscles
around her pelvis, and another operation in 1992 to reduce the abnormal
curvature in her back. Although the latter surgery was successful, it led to
the dislocation of her right hip, which caused considerable discomfort.  As
well, despite the administration of medication, Tracy experienced five to six
seizures every day.

 

5                                  
Tracy was in the care of Mr. Latimer when she passed away.  The
appellant had remained home to care for Tracy, while Tracy’s mother and
siblings were at church to attend a Sunday service.  Tracy was found by Mrs.
Latimer at approximately 1:30 p.m., when she went to get Tracy for lunch.  At
2:00 p.m., Mr. Latimer advised the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP by telephone
that Tracy had passed away in her sleep.  The RCMP officer who took the call
and the local coroner attended at the Latimer farm.  While at the farm, the
coroner examined Tracy’s body in order to determine the cause of death. 
Finding no evidence to suggest suffocation, the coroner arranged for an
autopsy.  During the visit to the farm, Mr. Latimer maintained that Tracy had
passed away in her sleep.  He stated that Tracy had been in pain and put to bed
at about 12:30 p.m.  

 

6                                  
The autopsy found no signs that would explain Tracy’s death, but found
signs consistent with poisoning.  Samples of Tracy’s blood were therefore sent
to a forensic laboratory for further analysis.  Tests indicated that Tracy’s
blood was saturated with carbon monoxide.  Because of the high levels of carbon
monoxide in Tracy’s blood, the RCMP began to treat the matter as a homicide
investigation.  

 








7                                  
The members of the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP inferred the
possibility of motive and opportunity from the facts before them — the
appellant was alone with Tracy at the time of her death, and Tracy was
bedridden and in constant pain.  They then decided to seek the assistance of
the General Investigation Section at North Battleford, representatives of which
they met with on Wednesday, November 3, 1993.  As a result of that meeting,
members of the North Battleford detachment decided to attend at the Latimer
farm, take Mr. Latimer into custody, interview his wife and execute a search
warrant.

 

8                                  
This plan was put into effect the next day, on Thursday, November 4,
1993.  The events are described in the uncontradicted testimony of one of the
principal investigators, Corporal Lyons, which is quoted in the trial
judgment.  Important portions of that testimony, which are central to the
disposition of this appeal, are underlined for emphasis:

 

At 8:28 that morning, Sergeant Conlon and I went to the residence.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

We went to the door, we rapped on it, waited a couple of minutes. 
Robert Latimer came to the door.  He was — appeared to have just been in the
process of getting up, he was in a housecoat, hair messed a little bit. 
Sergeant Conlon introduced ourselves to him, identified us, of course.  We
shook hands.  Sergeant Conlon told him that we were from North Battleford and
were assisting Wilkie in the investigation of Tracy’s death, being his
daughter, and told Mr. Latimer that we’d like to speak to him.  He went into a
bedroom and got dressed, came out a couple of minutes later.  We were waiting
in the kitchen.  Sergeant Conlon said that we’d like to speak to him outside. 
There was no response.  He put on his -- put on his rubber boots and a jacket
and went outside to the car with us.  We had an unmarked police vehicle . . . I
went into the driver’s seat, Sergeant Conlon the passenger side, and Mr. Latimer
in the back seat behind me. 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 








At 8: 32 [a.m.] I turned in the bucket seats [sic] of the
car and looked directly at him.  I said, as Sergeant Conlon explained, we are
assisting Wilkie detachment in the investigation of his daughter’s death.  I
said I realize that this is a very trying time for him and his family and I
said  what I am about to say has very serious consequences and he should listen
very closely.  He nodded to me.  I said, “You are being detained for
investigation into the death of your daughter Tracy.”  I then said, “You have
the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.  You may call any
lawyer you wish.  Legal Aid duty counsel is available to provide legal advice
to you without any charge and can explain the Legal Aid plan to you.”  I asked,
“Do you understand?”  He replied, “Yes.”  I asked, “Do you wish to call a
lawyer now?”  He replied, “Not really, no.”  I then warned him the standard
police warning, “You need not say anything.  You have nothing to hope from any
promise of favour, nothing to fear from any threat, whether or not you say
anything.  Anything you do say may be used as evidence.”  I asked, “Do you
understand?”  And he replied, “Yes.”  At that point, Sergeant Conlon told him
that we would be going to North Battleford for the purpose of speaking to him. 
Mr. Latimer raised no objection.  

 

 

 

 

9                                  
Mr. Latimer asked if he could change his clothes.  The RCMP officers
informed him that he could, but that they would have to accompany him into the
house because he was now in custody.  After Mr. Latimer had changed his
clothes, the RCMP officers drove him to the North Battleford detachment, where
they interviewed him commencing at 9:22 a.m.  At the commencement of this
interview, Corporal Lyons again warned Mr. Latimer that this was a serious
matter.  He then repeated the statements regarding the right to counsel and the
right to silence that he had made in the car.  There was a phone sitting in
front of Mr. Latimer, with a telephone number on it for Legal Aid.  Corporal
Lyons then asked Mr. Latimer if he had any questions, to which the Mr. Latimer
replied “No”.  As well, Corporal Lyons asked Mr. Latimer if he wanted a lawyer;
Mr. Latimer replied “No”.

 








10                              
Corporal Lyons then proceeded to inform Mr. Latimer that he had “no
doubt” that Mr. Latimer  had caused the death of Tracy Latimer.  Mr. Latimer
went on to make a full confession.  After receiving a further reminder about
the right to counsel and the right to silence, Mr. Latimer then made a written
statement.  Before Mr. Latimer confessed to killing his daughter in this
statement, Sergeant Conlon interjected, and asked Mr. Latimer if he understood
that he could be charged with murder.  He replied “Yes”.  After Mr. Latimer
completed his written statement, he was informed that he was being held for
murder.  

 

11                              
That afternoon, Mr. Latimer returned with officers Lyons and Conlon to
the Latimer farm, where he pointed out the equipment he claimed to have used to
end Tracy’s life.  The tour of the farm was videotaped.

 

12                              
On November 16, 1994, following trial by jury, Mr. Latimer was convicted
of second degree murder.  The presiding judge imposed the mandatory sentence of
life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for ten years.  An appeal was
dismissed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal on July 18, 1995: (1995), 134
Sask. R. 1, 126 D.L.R. (4th) 203, [1995] 8 W.W.R. 609, 99 C.C.C. (3d) 481, 41
C.R. (4th) 1. 

 

Fresh
Evidence

 

13                              
Subsequent to the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, the
parties jointly adduced in affidavit form fresh evidence before this Court
which demonstrates that Crown counsel at trial (who was not counsel on appeal)
had interfered with the jury.  The affidavit indicates that trial counsel for
the Crown and an RCMP officer from the Wilkie detachment prepared a
questionnaire asking prospective jurors for their views on a number of issues,
including religion, abortion, and euthanasia.  This questionnaire was
administered by RCMP officers to 30 of the 198 prospective jurors, either on
the telephone or at various  RCMP detachments.  The evidence also discloses
that the questionnaire led to some unrecorded discussions with prospective
jurors, which went beyond the exact questions posed in the questionnaire.  One
prospective juror, for example, was asked by an RCMP officer how well the
prospective juror knew the appellant.








 

14                              
It appears that it had been the intention of Crown counsel at trial and
the RCMP officer who had prepared the questionnaire that there be no direct
contact with prospective jurors.  However, that intention was not initially
communicated to the RCMP detachments involved.  By the time that information
was conveyed to the RCMP, some direct contact had already occurred. 
Nevertheless, at no time did Crown counsel at trial disclose the direct contact
with prospective jurors to the trial  judge, the defence, or the Sheriff. Of
the 30 prospective jurors who were administered the questionnaire, five served
on the jury which convicted Mr. Latimer.

 

III.  Judgments
Below

 

15                              
The proceedings below addressed many issues which were not placed before
this Court by the parties.  The summaries of the judgments below will therefore
focus on those questions which were pursued on this appeal.

 

Saskatchewan
Court of Queen’s Bench, Voir Dire of September 27, 1994

 

16                              
Before the selection of the jury, and some weeks before the commencement
of the trial, defence counsel moved pursuant to s. 645(5)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , for a ruling on the admissibility of Mr.
Latimer’s incriminating statements and the real evidence uncovered as a result
of those statements.  Relying on the Charter , defence counsel argued, inter
alia, that Mr. Latimer had been arbitrarily detained in contravention of s.
9 , and that Mr. Latimer had not been informed promptly of the reasons for his
arrest or detention in contravention of  s. 10 (a).  On the basis of
these alleged Charter  violations, the defence submitted that Mr.
Latimer’s statements should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2)  of the Charter .








 

17                              
The trial judge, Wimmer J.,  found that Mr. Latimer’s Charter 
rights had not been violated, and thus did not consider s. 24(2) .  Although he
accepted without question the proposition that Mr. Latimer’s s. 9  rights would
have been violated if he had been detained for questioning, he held that in
fact there had been a de facto arrest, and that this arrest had been
lawful because it was based on reasonable and probable grounds.  Furthermore,
he held that Mr. Latimer’s s. 10 (a) rights had not been violated,
because although he was not informed of the specific charge against him, his
appreciation of his jeopardy was adequate to make an informed decision about
whether to exercise his right to counsel.

 

Saskatchewan
Court of Queen’s Bench, Reconsideration of Ruling on the Voir Dire, November 7,
1994

 

 

18                              
During the trial, Wimmer J. was asked to reconsider his decision to
admit the incriminating statements of Mr. Latimer, on the basis of the set of
judgments delivered by this Court on the scope of s. 10 (b): Bartle,
Prosper, Pozniak, Matheson, Harper and Cobham. 
Mr. Latimer alleged that he had not been properly informed of the availability
of Legal Aid duty counsel in the manner mandated by those judgments.  Wimmer J.
dismissed the motion.  In his opinion, Mr. Latimer was adequately informed of
his right to counsel, because he had been told about the availability of Legal
Aid duty counsel.  As well, Wimmer J.  held that even if there had been a
violation of s. 10 (b), the incriminating statements should not be
excluded under s. 24(2) , because there was no evidence that, had Mr. Latimer
been differently informed, he would have contacted duty counsel.

 

Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal, July 18, 1995                                   

 








19                              
An appeal on the issues before this Court (except for the interference
with the jury) was unanimously dismissed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, per
Tallis J.A.   Bayda C.J.S. dissented on the sentence imposed by the trial
judge, but that issue is not before us.  The Court of Appeal agreed with the
trial judge, and held that there had been no violation of s. 9  of the Charter . 
Since Mr. Latimer had been lawfully arrested, he had therefore not been
arbitrarily detained.  The court also seems to have approved of the trial
judge’s holding on s. 10 (a), although this point is unclear.  

 

20                              
The Court of Appeal devoted most of its attention to the alleged
violation of Mr. Latimer’s right to counsel.  Mr. Latimer had argued that Bartle
entitled him to be advised of a toll-free number by which free legal advice
could be accessed, irrespective of financial need.  The court rejected this
argument, arguing that Bartle had been complied with.  The court relied
on two factors which were present in this case but absent in Bartle. 
The officers advised Mr. Latimer of the existence and availability of duty
counsel, and of his immediate right to consult duty counsel, whereas in Bartle
the accused was not so advised.  Furthermore, Mr. Latimer was informed of his
right to counsel with a phone in front of him, which had the telephone number
for Legal Aid.  In the circumstances of the case, the court held that the
failure to specifically mention a toll-free number was not fatal.  

 

 

IV.  Issues
on Appeal

 

21                              
The following issues must be addressed in this appeal:

 

1.    Was Mr. Latimer arbitrarily detained in
contravention of s. 9  of the Charter ?








2.    Did the failure to inform the appellant that
he had been “arrested” and that he could be charged with murder violate s. 10 (a)
of the Charter ?

 

3.    Did the RCMP officers adequately inform Mr.
Latimer of the means to access available duty counsel services, as is required
by s. 10 (b) of the Charter  as interpreted by Bartle?

 

4.    Does the transitional period imposed by this
Court in Cobham operate in Saskatchewan so as to preclude Mr. Latimer
from relying on Bartle?

 

5.    If there has been a violation of the Charter ,
should the statements of Mr. Latimer be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) ?

 

6.    If the statements are excluded, should Mr.
Latimer be acquitted?

 

7.    Does the interference with prospective
jurors warrant a new trial?

 

 

V.  Analysis

 

1.                Was the appellant arbitrarily
detained in contravention of s. 9  of the Charter ?

 

 








22                              
The appellant alleges that his right under s. 9  against arbitrary
detention was violated when he was detained at his farm on the morning of
November 4, 1993.  There is no doubt in my mind that the appellant was
detained, and the parties agree on this point.  However, I am equally certain
that Mr. Latimer’s detention was not arbitrary.  The RCMP officers who attended
at the Latimer farm put Mr. Latimer under de facto arrest.  Moreover, on
the facts of this case, that de facto arrest was entirely lawful because
it was based on reasonable and probable grounds that Mr. Latimer had taken his
daughter’s life.  A de facto arrest which is lawful, in my opinion,
cannot be an arbitrary detention for the purposes of s. 9 .

 

23                              
 The appellant’s strongest  argument is that no arrest occurred because
the officers deliberately chose not to arrest Mr. Latimer.  He points to
testimony by officers Lyon and Conlon at trial, in which they indicated that
they decided prior to appearing at the farm they did not wish to arrest Mr. Latimer. 
As well, he also points to the use of the word “detention”, instead of the word
“arrest”, as proof of that intention.  

 

24                              
However, notwithstanding what the intention of the officers may
have been, their conduct had the effect of putting Mr. Latimer under
arrest.  To understand why, we need only turn to the definition of arrest
offered by this Court in R. v. Whitfield, [1970] S.C.R. 46.  Judson J.,
speaking for the majority of the Court, held that an arrest consists either of
(i) the actual seizure or touching of a person’s body with a view to his
detention, or (ii) the pronouncing of “words of arrest” to a person who submits
to the arresting officer.  The term “words of arrest” was not defined in that
judgment.  However, in my mind we should decline the invitation to adopt the
narrow view of that term proposed by the appellant, i.e. that only the word
“arrest” will suffice.  As this Court has held with respect to s. 10 (a)
of the Charter  (R. v. Evans, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869, at p. 888),
what counts is

 

the substance of what the accused can reasonably be supposed to have
understood, rather than the formalism of the precise words used. . . .  The
question is . . . what the accused was told, viewed reasonably in all the
circumstances of the case. . . .

 








25                              
On the facts of this case, a de facto arrest occurred through the
use of words that conveyed clearly that Latimer was under arrest, the conduct
of the officers, and Mr. Latimer’s submission to the authority of officers
Conlon and Lyons.  Mr. Latimer was told that he was being detained, and that he
would be taken back to North Battleford to be interviewed.  The police officers
informed him of his right to silence and his right to counsel. They accompanied
him back into his house  while he changed his clothes, telling him that they
were doing so because he was now in their custody.  Finally, at no point did
Mr. Latimer protest or resist the police — he submitted to the authority of the
arresting officers.

 

26                              
The fact that a de facto arrest occurred, however, is not
sufficient to dispose of the matter, because of the potential that his arrest
was unlawful.  Unlawful arrests may be inherently arbitrary: see P. W. Hogg, Constitutional
Law of Canada (3rd ed. 1992), at p. 1073.  However, it is not necessary to
address that question, because Mr. Latimer’s arrest was entirely lawful, and
failing an attack against the legislative provision which authorized the
arrest, I do not see how a lawful arrest can contravene s. 9  of the Charter  for
being arbitrary.  The arresting power of police officers is set down by s. 495 
of the Criminal Code .  Section 495(1) (a) authorizes peace
officers to arrest without a warrant

 

a person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable
grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence.

 








What counts as
reasonable grounds was laid down by Cory J. in R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1
S.C.R. 241, at pp. 250-51.  Reasonable grounds have both a subjective and an
objective aspect.  The arresting officers must subjectively have
reasonable and probable grounds on which to base an arrest.  Moreover, those
grounds must be justifiable from an objective point of view, such that a
reasonable person placed in the position of the arresting officer can conclude
that there were reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest.

 

27                              
The trial judge made a specific finding that reasonable grounds for the
arrest of Mr. Latimer existed, and I see no reason to disturb that finding. 
Subjectively, despite the fact that the officers decided not to arrest Mr.
Latimer, it is clear that they believed that they had reasonable grounds to
arrest him.  They chose not to because at the time of the arrest, they believed
that they did not have enough evidence to obtain a conviction.  This is most
evident from the testimony of Constable Lyons, who stated that “certainly the
grounds to arrest were present” and “[c]ertainly there were reasonable and
probable grounds to arrest him”.  Objectively, the reasonable person in the
position of the arresting officer would have concluded there were reasonable
grounds for arrest.  Those grounds included: the carbon monoxide in Tracy’s
blood, strongly suggesting that she had been poisoned; the fact that it was
extremely unlikely that Tracy’s death had been accidental; the fact that,
because of Tracy’s physical condition, her death could not have been suicide;
and finally, the fact that the accused had both opportunity and motive.  I
therefore conclude that the trial judge was correct in deciding that there were
reasonable and probable grounds for an arrest.

 

2.                Did the failure to inform the
appellant that he had been “arrested” and that he could be charged with murder
violate s. 10 (a) of the Charter ?

 

 








28                              
Section 10 (a) of the Charter  provides the right to be
informed promptly of the reasons for one’s arrest or detention.  The purpose of
this provision is to ensure that a person “understand generally the jeopardy”
in which he or she finds himself or herself: R. v. Smith, [1991] 1
S.C.R. 714, at p. 728.  There are two reasons why the Charter  lays down
this requirement: first, because it would be a gross interference with individual
liberty for persons to have to submit to arrest without knowing the reasons for
that arrest, and second, because it would be difficult to exercise the right to
counsel protected by s. 10 (b) in a meaningful way if one were not aware
of the extent of one’s jeopardy:  R. v. Evans, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869, at
pp. 886-87.  

 

29                              
Mr. Latimer makes two distinct submissions in which he challenges the
adequacy of the information he was provided on arrest.  His first submission is
that anything short of the word “arrest” was insufficient to convey to him the
jeopardy that he was in.  His second submission explicitly invokes the
interrelationship between the need to understand one’s jeopardy and the right
to counsel; he alleges that had he known that he was under arrest for killing
or murdering his daughter, he would not have waived his right to counsel.  As a
variation on his second submission,  Mr. Latimer links his concern regarding
the right to counsel and s. 10 (a) with the right to silence — that had
he been aware of the true circumstances surrounding his arrest, he would not
have given up his right to silence without first consulting a lawyer.  I note
that Mr. Latimer’s second submission was based on s. 10 (b).  However, I
think that it is more appropriately dealt with under s. 10 (a).

 

30                              
There is no doubt that Mr. Latimer was not told that he was under
“arrest”; he was told that he was being “detained”.  Nor was he explicitly told
that he could be charged with murder.  However, as with determining whether
there has been a de facto arrest, when considering whether there has
been a violation of s. 10 (a), one must look beyond the exact words
used.  As the Court held in Evans, supra, at p. 888:

 








When considering whether there has been a breach of
s. 10 (a) of the Charter , it is the substance of what the accused
can reasonably be supposed to have understood, rather than the formalism of the
precise words used, which must govern.  The question is whether what the
accused was told, viewed reasonably in all the circumstances of the case, was
sufficient to permit him to make a reasonable decision to decline to submit to
arrest, or alternatively, to understand his right to counsel under s. 10 (b).

 

 

31                              
Although the two submissions were presented separately, it is convenient
to deal with them together.  On the facts of this case, I have no doubt that
the trial judge was right in finding that Mr. Latimer understood the basis for
his apprehension by the police and hence the extent of his jeopardy.  He knew
that his daughter had died, and that he was being detained for investigation
into that death.  Constable Lyons prefaced his comments in the car by saying
“what I am about to say has very serious consequences”.  Mr. Latimer was then
informed of his right to counsel and his right to silence, which clearly
conveyed that he was being placed under arrest.  Finally, he was told that he
could not go into his own house by himself to change his clothes.  It is clear
on these facts that Mr. Latimer knew that he was in an extremely grave
situation as regards his daughter’s death, and that s. 10 (a) cannot be
said to have been violated.

 

3.                Did the RCMP officers adequately
inform the appellant of the means to access available duty counsel services, as
is required by s. 10 (b) of the Charter  as interpreted by Bartle?

 

 

 








32                              
When Mr. Latimer was arrested by the police, he was not specifically
informed of the existence of a toll-free telephone number by which he could
access immediate free legal advice by Legal Aid duty counsel.  Relying on this
Court’s judgment in Bartle, the appellant argues that this omission was
unconstitutional, because it did not meet the standard for the informational
component of s. 10 (b).  However, I reject this submission, because Bartle
stands for quite a different proposition — that s. 10 (b) encompasses the
right to be informed of the means to access those duty counsel services which
are available at the time of arrest.  As we shall see, at the time of day when
Mr. Latimer was arrested, the toll-free number in Saskatchewan was not in
operation, and so it was unnecessary to inform him of that number.  Moreover,
he was made aware of the duty counsel service that was offered by the local
Legal Aid office, which could be reached by a local phone call at no cost to
him.  Mr. Latimer’s s. 10 (b) rights were therefore not violated.

 

33                              
The informational component of s. 10 (b) is of critical importance
because its purpose is to enable a detainee to make an informed decision about
whether to exercise the right to counsel, and to exercise other rights
protected by the Charter , such as the right to silence.  In R. v.
Brydges, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 190, this Court engrafted two requirements upon
the informational component: first, information about access to counsel free of
charge provided by provincial Legal Aid where an accused meets financial
criteria with respect to need, and second, information about access to duty
counsel, who provide immediate and temporary legal advice to all accused,
irrespective of financial need. 

 

34                              
However, Brydges only required that information be provided about
the existence and availability of duty counsel; there is no doubt that the
appellant was told about duty counsel here, and so Brydges is
satisfied.  Bartle imposed the additional requirement that persons be
informed of the means necessary to access such services.  However, whether the
police have met this burden in a particular case must always be determined with
regard to all the circumstances of that case, including the duty counsel
services available at the time of arrest or detention.  

 

35                              
For example, in Bartle, this Court held that s. 10 (b)
required that persons be informed of toll-free telephone numbers to access duty
counsel.  But it only imposed that requirement where such numbers were in
operation.  As I said in Bartle, supra, at p. 195:

 








. . . the specific nature of the information provided to detainees
would necessarily be contingent on the existence and availability of Legal Aid
and duty counsel in the jurisdiction. . . .

 

Thus, in Bartle,
as well as in Pozniak, Harper and Cobham, s. 10(b)
was violated because the accused persons in those cases were not informed on
arrest about the existence of 24-hour duty counsel, accessible by a toll-free
telephone number, available free of charge to all detainees.  By contrast, in Prosper
and Matheson, there was no violation of s. 10(b), because there
was no toll-free, 24-hour duty counsel service.  There was nothing useful to
tell the accused.  Thus, the proposition which emerges from these cases is that
the nature of the information provided pursuant to s. 10(b) depends on
the actual services available in a jurisdiction.  As I said in Prosper, supra,
at p. 259: 

 

if there is in existence a 24-hour duty counsel service which
can be accessed by dialling a toll-free number . . . this must be communicated
to all detainees as part of the standard s. 10(b) caution delivered by
police.  Obviously, it would make no sense to inform detainees of a service
which does not in fact exist and which is, therefore, unavailable to them. 
The point of the information component under s. 10(b) is to enable detainees
to make informed decisions about services which actually exist. [Emphasis
added.]

 

36                              
According to the evidence before this Court, toll-free access to duty
counsel in Saskatchewan was only offered outside normal office hours.  Thus,
the position in Saskatchewan is in between those provinces where there is a
24-hour service, and those provinces where there is no service at all.  The
service in Saskatchewan was commenced in July 1990, and is operated out of
Saskatoon.   Normal office hours, according to the Saskatchewan Legal Aid
Commission, are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.   Mr. Latimer, however, was arrested at
8:32 a.m. by the RCMP, and hence during normal office hours.  At the time of
his arrest, no toll-free service was available to him.  I therefore find that
the RCMP did not breach the informational component of s. 10(b) by
failing to inform Mr. Latimer of the existence of a toll-free number.

 








37                              
I also have no doubt that the information that was provided to Mr.
Latimer adequately apprised him of the means to contact the duty counsel
service which was available at the local Legal Aid Office.  Mr. Latimer was
informed of that duty counsel service on two occasions — when he was arrested
at his farm, and before the commencement of his interview at the police
station.  Admittedly, on neither occasion did the arresting officers verbally
give Mr. Latimer the phone number for the local Legal Aid Office.  However, s.
10(b) did not require the arresting officers to take that extra step,
under the circumstances of this case.  Where an individual is detained during
regular business hours, and when legal assistance is available through a local
telephone number which can easily be found by the person in question, neither
the letter nor the spirit of Bartle is breached simply by not providing
that individual with the local phone number.  Mr. Latimer was perfectly capable
of obtaining the number.  He could have consulted a telephone book either at
his farm, or at the police station if he had asked for one.  Moreover, at
either location, he could have obtained the number from Directory Assistance. 
There is nothing to suggest that had he asked  the police for it, they would
not have provided it.  Finally, at the police station, there was a telephone
sitting in front of Mr. Latimer, with a telephone number on it for Legal Aid. 
I also note that at both locations, Mr. Latimer was asked if he understood or
had any questions about what he had been told.  He replied in the negative on
both occasions.

 








38                              
I hasten to add that there will be cases in which it will be necessary
to provide more information to an accused or detained person than was provided
to Mr. Latimer about the means to access duty counsel.  For example, a young
person, or even more obviously an individual who is visually impaired, may
require more assistance from the police than Mr. Latimer.  As well, someone
whose facility in the language of the jurisdiction is not sufficient to
understand the information provided about duty counsel may require more
explicit information than was provided to Mr. Latimer.  This list of examples
should not be taken to be exhaustive.

 

39                              
Finally, I add another point.  The principle that an accused or detained
person must be provided with the information which is necessary to ensure
access to counsel means that if an accused were arrested during normal office
hours in a jurisdiction where duty counsel was accessible by a 24-hour
toll-free service and was also available by a local call during the day,
s. 10(b) would not require that the toll-free number be given, because
that number is not necessary to ensure access to counsel.

 

4.                Does the transitional period
imposed by this Court in Cobham operate in Saskatchewan so as to
preclude the appellant from relying on Bartle?

 

 

40                              
In addition to receiving submissions on whether s. 10(b), as
interpreted by this Court in Bartle, was violated in the circumstances
of this case, we also heard argument on whether Mr. Latimer was legally
precluded from relying on Bartle at all, as a result of the order
granted by this Court after its judgment in Cobham.  That order, dated
October 20, 1994, reads in full:

 

The application for a re-hearing is granted on the issue of whether
there should be a transition period, and the operation of the judgment herein
[i.e. Cobham] is stayed for a period of 21 days from the date such
judgment was issued, namely September 29, 1994.

 

 

However, given
that I have found there to be no violation of s. 10(b), it is
unnecessary for me to examine the remedial effect of this order. 

 

 








5.                If there has been a violation of
the Charter , should the statements of the appellant be excluded pursuant
to s. 24(2) ?

 

 

41                              
Since I have found that there were no violations of the appellant’s Charter 
rights, there is no need to consider whether his incriminating statements
should be excluded under s. 24(2) .

 

6.                If the statements are excluded,
should the appellant be acquitted?

 

42                              
Similarly, because the statements of the appellant were not
inadmissible, it is not necessary to answer whether the appellant should have
been acquitted.

 

7.                Does the interference with
prospective jurors warrant a new trial?

 

43                              
I need only address this issue very briefly.  The actions of Crown
counsel at trial, which were fully acknowledged by Crown counsel on appeal,
were nothing short of a flagrant abuse of process and interference with the
administration of justice.  The question of whether the interference actually
influenced the deliberations of the jury is quite beside the point.  The
interference contravened a fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system,
which  Lord Hewart C.J. put felicitously as “justice should not only be done,
but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done”: R. v. Sussex
Justices, [1924] 1 K.B. 256, at p. 259; also see R. v. Caldough
(1961), 36 C.R. 248 (B.C.S.C.).

 

 

IV.  Disposition

 








44                              
Given the interference with the jury, a new trial cannot be avoided, as
the Crown itself concedes.  The admissibility of Mr. Latimer’s incriminating
statements at that trial will be a matter for the trial judge, who will be
governed by these reasons, on matters of law, but who will, of course, decide
the question on the facts of the case as they are presented to him or her at
that time.

 

45                              
The appeal is therefore allowed.  The order of the Court of Appeal
dismissing the appeal and the conviction entered by the trial judge are set
aside, and a new trial is ordered.

 

Appeal allowed.

2                        The rebuttal evidence
introduced by the Crown relating to O.H. was properly admitted.  It went to the
context and the essential fabric of the alibi defence.  The Crown could not
have known in advance either that the appellant would testify or the testimony
he would give.  The rebuttal evidence was clearly relevant to an issue raised
in the defence.  The discretion of the trial judge to permit the rebuttal
evidence was not improperly exercised in those circumstances.

 

3                        Even if the second prong of
the rebuttal evidence was improperly admitted it did not appear to influence
the reasons of the trial judge.  The evidence against the appellant was
overwhelming.  In the circumstances it is appropriate to apply the curative
provisions of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) and the appeal is therefore
dismissed.

//McLachlin J.//

 

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

 

1                 McLachlin J. -- This is an appeal as of
right.  The only point on appeal is the admissibility of a telephone
conversation between an unidentified person and a police officer, in which an
unidentified person made arrangements to deliver drugs to a police officer at a
certain time and place.

 

2                 The
appellant argues that the telephone conversation was properly rejected by the
trial judge because it is hearsay and does not fall within any of the
exceptions to the hearsay rule.

 

3                 We
are all of the view that the appeal should be dismissed and the Court of
Appeal’s order for a new trial confirmed.  The telephone conversation was
admissible.  It was a statement of intention, or a statement tendered to
establish the alleged drug transaction, and hence not tendered for the truth of
its contents.  Accordingly, it was not hearsay.  The telephone conversation is
merely one of the circumstances which, combined with others, may suffice to
establish that the appellant, when he appeared at the designated time and
place, in possession of the drugs, did so for the purpose of trafficking.  Any
frailties in relation to the connection between the appellant and the telephone
conversation go to weight and not admissibility.

 

4                 The
appeal is dismissed and the order for a new trial confirmed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

 

1                        McLachlin J. ‑‑ We would
all dismiss the appeal.

 

2                        The
appellant raises four issues.

 

3                        The
first issue is whether the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to entertain this
appeal.  The appellant argues that the trial judge’s conclusion that he
lacked the intention (or mens rea) required for the offence is a
finding of fact.  Since appeals lie only on questions of law, it follows, he
argues, that there can be no appeal from his acquittal by the trial judge.

 








4                        This
argument fails on the ground that the issue raised in the Court of Appeal (and
this Court) was not a question of fact, but an issue of law:  namely what
mental state or mens rea suffices to establish guilt under s. 332(1)  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .  The
issue is whether the trial judge erred in law in holding that to convict there
must be “an intent to steal”, and consequently in acquitting the appellant.

 

5                        It
follows that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

 

6                        The
second issue concerns the mens rea required for conviction under s.
332(1) .  We agree with Rowles J.A. in the British Columbia Court of Appeal that
an intentional misappropriation, without mistake, suffices to establish mens
rea under s. 332(1) :  see Lafrance v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R.
201; R. v. Williams, [1953] 1 Q.B. 660 (C.A.).  The word “fraudulently”,
as used in this section, connotes no more than this.  The dishonesty inherent
in the offence lies in the intentional and unmistaken application of funds to
an improper purpose.

 

7                        We
also agree with Rowles J.A. that the findings of fact of the trial judge
establish both the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.  The actus
reus is not in issue.  On mens rea, the trial judge concluded:

 

I find that Mr. Skalbania was at
all material times the controlling mind of Prime Realty Limited, to whom Mr.
Gooch’s cheque was paid.  I find that Mr. Skalbania through Prime Realty
applied Gooch’s money for a purpose other than that directed by Mr. Gooch.

 








In short, the trial judge found:  that the appellant knew that the
money belonged to Mr. Gooch; that the appellant knew the purpose to which the
money was supposed to be applied; and that the appellant knowingly, without
mistake, applied the money to different purposes.

 

8                        It
follows that the Court of Appeal did not err in concluding that the elements
required for conviction were established.

 

9                        The third issue is whether
s. 686(4) (b)(ii) of the Criminal Code , which permits a court of
appeal to substitute a guilty verdict for an acquittal on a trial by a judge
sitting alone, but not on a trial by a judge and jury, is unconstitutional.

 

10                      The appellant argues that s.
686(4) (b)(ii) violates the s. 7  Charter  right not to be deprived
of one’s
liberty except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for two
related reasons:  (1) that permitting the substitution of a conviction in cases
where the trial was by judge alone but not where it was by judge and jury is
arbitrary; and (2) that this is contrary to the alleged principle of
fundamental justice that criminal proceedings must be consistent.

 

11                      In our view, the impugned
distinction is neither arbitrary nor inconsistent and does not trammel the s. 7 
guarantee of fair process.

 

12                      There is a distinction between
trial by judge alone and trial by judge and jury that justifies the different
procedures.  Judges sitting alone give reasons that can be examined for
findings of fact and errors of law.  Juries, by contrast, do not give reasons. 
It cannot, therefore, be known if the jury has made the findings of fact
necessary to support a conviction.  For this reason, the Court of Appeal cannot
substitute a conviction for the acquittal and a new trial must be held.

 








13                      We conclude that s. 686(4) (b)(ii)
does not violate s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

14                      The final issue raised by the
appellant is whether he was entitled to be sentenced by the judge who presided
at trial.  Since that judge had retired at the time of the
Court of Appeal’s decision, sentence was passed by a new judge.

 

15                      In our view, there is no merit
in this submission.  Section 686(4) (b)(ii) provides that the
case be remitted to the “trial court”, not the “trial judge”.  Section 669.2  confirms this.  The
constitutionality of these provisions in relation to whether a particular judge
can pass sentence was not challenged.  Any other system would be unworkable. 
We note, without prejudice to any outstanding proceedings in relation to
sentence, that transcripts of the trial were available and the hearing occupied
three days.

 

16                      In conclusion, we are unable
to accept any of the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant.  We would
dismiss the appeal, affirm the conviction, and answer the first constitutional
question* in the negative.

 

Judgment accordingly.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario 

 

Criminal law ‑‑ Videotape evidence ‑‑
Children ‑‑ Videotape made of child‑complainant’s testimony
shortly after alleged crime and admitted into evidence on adoption by child ‑‑
Requirements for the admissibility of a videotaped statement under
s. 715.1 of the Criminal Code ‑‑  Whether voir dire necessary
-- Effect of inconsistencies between child’s viva voce evidence and videotaped
statement ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
s. 715.1 .








The respondent was convicted of touching his six‑year‑old
daughter for a sexual purpose. The police investigated the complaint the
evening it was made and videotaped the complainant’s statement describing the
incident.  At trial, the complainant was shown the videotape following her
examination‑in‑chief.  She identified herself in the videotape,
confirmed that she made the statements on the videotape and that they were
true.  The trial judge ruled that the complainant had adopted the videotaped
statement and admitted it as evidence pursuant to s. 715.1  of the Criminal
Code .  On cross‑examination the complainant made statements which
contradicted in part the videotaped statements.  The Ontario Court of Appeal
overturned the conviction and directed a new trial at the discretion of the
Crown.  At issue here were the requirements for the admissibility of a
videotaped statement under s. 715.1  and the effect of an inconsistency
between the child’s viva voce evidence and her videotaped statement.
Also at issue was whether a voir dire should have been held with respect
to the admissibility of the complainant’s videotaped statement.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

Section 715.1 of the Code is a statutory
exception to the hearsay rule which permits an out‑of‑court
statement to be admitted at the trials of certain enumerated offences if  the
complainant is under 18 and if the video was made within a reasonable time
following the alleged offence.  The complainant must also describe the acts
complained of and, while testifying, adopt the contents of the videotape.  The
section’s primary goal is to create a record of what is probably the best
recollection of the event.  It is also to prevent or reduce materially the
likelihood of inflicting further injury upon a child as a result of
participating in court proceedings.

 








The word “adopts” in s. 715.1  should be given a
meaning consistent with the section’s aim and purpose and the word “confirme”
in the French text must be given the same meaning.  The  strict adoption test
for prior inconsistent statements, which  was necessary to ensure a reasonable
degree of reliability, should not be used because s. 715.1  has built‑in
guarantees of trustworthiness and reliability.

 

A witness who cannot remember the events cannot be
effectively cross‑examined on the contents of his or her statement. 
Several factors present in s. 715.1  provide the requisite reliability of
the videotaped statement:  (a) the requirement that the statement be made
within a reasonable time; (b) the fact that the trier of fact can watch the
entire interview, which provides an opportunity to observe the demeanor and to
assess the personality and intelligence of the child; (c) the requirement that
the child attest that he or she was attempting to be truthful at the time that
the statement was made.  As well, the child can be cross‑examined at
trial as to whether he or she was actually being truthful when the statement
was made.  Moreover, where the complainant has no independent memory of the
events, there is an obvious necessity for the videotaped evidence.  The trier
of fact, however, should be given a special warning of the dangers of
convicting based on the videotape alone.

 








Once the trial judge rules that the statement has been
adopted, the video becomes evidence of the events described as if the child
were giving the statements on the videotape in open court.  An adopted
videotaped statement should, together with the viva voce evidence given
at trial, comprise the whole of the evidence‑in‑chief of the
complainant.  Any questions which arise concerning the circumstances in which
the video was made, the veracity of the witnesses’ statements, or the overall
reliability of the evidence, are matters for the trier of fact to consider in
determining how much weight the videotaped statement should be given. Parts of
the video contradicted during cross‑examination are not rendered
inadmissible but may well be given less weight in the final determination of
the issues.  The fact that the video is contradicted in cross‑examination
does not necessarily mean that the video is wrong or unreliable.

 

The standard for assessing credibility which would be
applied to an adult’s evidence is not always appropriate in assessing a young
child’s credibility.  The peculiar perspectives of children can affect their
recollection of events and the presence of inconsistencies, especially those
related to peripheral matters, should be assessed in context.  A skilful cross‑examination
is almost certain to confuse a child, even if he or she is telling the truth,
and that confusion can lead to inconsistencies in the child’s testimony. 

 

A voir dire must be held in order to review the
contents of the tape to ensure that the statements within it conform to the
rules of evidence.  At this stage, the trial judge may exercise his or her
discretion to exclude the videotaped statement if prejudice from its admission
would outweigh its probative value.  The discretionary power to exclude
evidence should not be used to determine issues of weight.  Where there is
conflicting evidence and opinion as to how useful the videotaped statement may
be in providing an honest and complete account of the complainant’s story, the
statement should be admitted unless the trial judge is satisfied that it could
interfere with the truth‑finding process.

 








Although it is preferable for the police to refrain,
to the extent that it is reasonably possible, from interviewing the complainant
before the videotaped statement is recorded, the ultimate reliability of the
videotaped statement is not a question which should be resolved at the voir
dire.  The fact that a pre‑video interview was conducted, and any
effect it may have had on the subsequently videotaped statement, should go to
the weight to be accorded the evidence and not to its admissibility.  The
police officers conducting the videotaped interview should pose simple, open‑ended
questions to the child.  In some situations, however, it will be necessary and
appropriate to ask leading questions.

 

No substantial wrong resulted from the failure to hold
a voir dire.  Since the complainant adopted the videotape’s contents and
absent evidence that the trial judge would or should have exercised the
residual discretion to exclude the evidence because of unfairly prejudicial
effects its admission would have on the respondent, the videotaped statement
was properly admitted.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 








1                                  
Cory J. --
Section 715.1  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
provides that if a videotape is made within a reasonable time after the offence
it will be admissible in evidence if the young complainant adopts it when
testifying.  The appellate courts of Alberta and Ontario have given different
meaning to the word “adopted”.  What constitutes the adoption of a videotape
statement is the first and paramount issue that must be resolved in this
appeal.  The second is a consideration of what effect, if any, subsequent
contradictory evidence of the complainant will have upon the admissibility of
the videotape statement.

 

Factual Background

 

2                                  
The respondent was convicted of touching his daughter for a sexual
purpose.  At the time of the offence the little girl was just six years
old.  At that time, the complainant was living with her mother and younger
brother.  The respondent had separated from the complainant’s mother some years
earlier.

 

3                                  
On the evening of the incident, the respondent visited the complainant’s
mother in an attempt to reconcile with her but his offers were rejected. 
Eventually the respondent, as he had done on other occasions, went to sleep in
the complainant’s bed.  The next morning the complainant told her mother that
the respondent had touched her “privates” while he was in bed with her.  That
evening, police spoke to the complainant and her mother and took them to the
police station.  The police conducted an initial interview with the complainant
and then videotaped her statement.

 








4                                  
In that videotape, S.D. (the complainant) told the police officer that
on the previous night, she had been asleep in bed with her mother when the
respondent, banging on the door, woke them up.  She stated that her mother left
the room and the respondent went to sleep with her in her bed.   S.D. said that
the respondent touched her “around there, inside” and gestured to her genital
area.  She also stated that, although neither of them said anything, she knew
her father was awake because she saw him.  She stated that the respondent had
been wearing his underwear.  When asked how they had been lying, S.D. said she
was on her side and her father was on his back.  She also agreed with the
officer’s suggestion that, after touching her, the respondent had put his hand
on his own privates.

 

5                                  
At trial, the complainant was shown the videotaped statement following
her examination‑in‑chief.  The complainant identified herself in
the videotape, confirmed that she made the statements on the videotape and that
they were true.  The trial judge ruled that the complainant had adopted the
videotaped statement and admitted it as evidence pursuant to s. 715.1 of
the Code.  On cross‑examination the complainant made statements
which contradicted in part the videotaped statements.  For instance, she
testified that the respondent was wearing pants and a shirt in bed and that she
could not tell whether the respondent was awake or asleep when he touched her.

 

6                                  
The respondent was convicted by Lane J. of the Ontario Court (Provincial
Division) and sentenced to 15 months in custody.  The Ontario Court of Appeal
(1996), 88 O.A.C. 397, overturned that decision and directed a new trial at the
discretion of the Crown.  The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court,
[1996] 3 S.C.R. xii.

 

7                                  
On this appeal, upon the conclusion of oral argument, the judgment of
the Court of Appeal was set aside, and the decision of Lane J. convicting the
respondent, C.C.F. was restored with reasons to follow.

 

Relevant
Statutory Provision

 

8                                  
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 715.1 








 

715.1  In any proceeding relating to an
offence under section 151, 152, 153, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3), or
section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273, in which the complainant was under
the age of eighteen years at the time the offence is alleged to have been
committed, a videotape made within a reasonable time after the alleged offence,
in which the complainant describes the acts complained of, is admissible in
evidence if the complainant, while testifying, adopts the contents of the
videotape.

 

Judgments Below

 

Ontario Court (Provincial Division)

 

9                                  
Lane J. noted that the requirements of s. 715.1  had been met and that
the videotaped statement was properly admitted.  Next, she considered the
appropriate weight to be given to the videotape.  She carefully noted that the
motive of the child to falsify and the nature of questions posed during the
videotaped interview must be considered.  Nonetheless she placed considerable
weight on the videotape.  With respect to the essential elements of the offence
recounted in it, she was satisfied that the complainant told her story in a
spontaneous manner in response to “open‑ended” questions.  The only
question that appeared to be leading was whether the respondent had touched his
own genitals after touching the complainant.  Lane J. refused to make a finding
of fact in that regard.  However, she found that the essential facts of what
occurred had been set out in the videotape and apart from certain
inconsistencies of “peripheral detail”, those facts were consistent with the
complainant’s testimony at trial.

 








10                              
With respect to the testimony S.D. gave under cross‑examination,
that the respondent could have been asleep when he touched her, Lane J.
observed that S.D. was very tired and yawning when she gave this evidence,
which was at the end of a very long and skilful cross‑examination. 
Nevertheless, when asked if the respondent could have touched her by accident,
the complainant was adamant that he had not.  Lane J. also accepted the
complainant’s statement on the video with respect to the clothes the respondent
was wearing.  The trial judge stated that she did not have concerns about the
inconsistencies which related to peripheral detail and concluded that the
videotape should be given considerable weight.

 

11                              
Lane J. remarked that S.D.’s viva voce testimony at trial
strongly reinforced the essence of the offence as it had been described
initially on the videotape and that she was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
as to the essence of the complaint.  She found that the testimony of S.D. was
completely consistent in the essential details of the incident and that consistency
remained notwithstanding a very skilled and lengthy cross‑examination.

 

12                              
She found the respondent guilty and sentenced him to 15 months in
custody.

 

Ontario Court of Appeal

 

13                              
In a brief endorsement, the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge’s
failure to conduct a voir dire did not have any effect upon the trial or
its resolution.  The court rejected the suggestion that s. 715.1  must be
read as requiring that the police should not interview the witness before
videotaping.  Although the nature of the interview may be examined on a voir
dire to ensure fairness to the accused, it would be unreasonable to
interpret s. 715.1  as requiring that the witness had never been questioned
before the statement was videotaped.

 








14                              
Respecting the videotaped evidence, the court found that the differences
between what the complainant said on the tape and what she testified to at
trial were material.  The court held that the videotaped evidence that was
later disavowed could not be considered as having been adopted under
s. 715.1 .  Although the trial judge could have made a finding of guilt
based on the sworn testimony, despite the inconsistencies with the videotape,
she erred in finding the respondent guilty on the basis of the videotape,
including those portions of the tape that were contradicted at trial.  The
contradicted evidence became inadmissible under s. 715.1  when it was
disavowed in cross‑examination and, therefore, could not form the basis
for the reasons leading to conviction.

Analysis

 

The Admissibility of a Videotaped Statement Under s. 715.1

 

17                              
Section 715.1 is a statutory exception to the rule that hearsay is
inadmissible.  It permits an out‑of‑court statement to be admitted
for the truth of its contents, provided that certain conditions are met. 
Specifically, the complainant must be under 18 years of age, the offence
must be one of an enumerated list of offences (predominantly sexual offences),
the video must have been made within a reasonable time following the alleged
offence, the complainant must describe the acts complained of and, while testifying,
adopt the contents of the videotape.

 

(i)    The Purpose of s. 715.1

 

18                              
The interpretation of legislation will always be facilitated by a
consideration of its aim or goal.  In the case of R. v. L. (D.O.),
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, the constitutional validity of s. 715.1 was
considered.  The section was unanimously held to be constitutionally valid. 
Chief Justice Lamer, writing for six members of the Court, made this comment
upon the aim and purpose of the section at p. 429:

 

By allowing for the videotaping of evidence under certain express
conditions, s. 715.1 not only makes participation in the criminal justice
system less stressful and traumatic for child and adolescent complainants, but
also aids in the preservation of evidence and the discovery of truth.

 








19                              
It will be self‑evident to every observant parent and to all who
have worked closely with young people that children, even more than adults,
will have a better recollection of events shortly after they occurred than they
will some weeks, months or years later.  The younger the child, the more
pronounced will this be.  Indeed to state this simply expresses the
observations of most Canadians.  It is a common experience that anyone, and
particularly children, will have a better recollection of events closer to
their occurrence than he or she will later on.  (See, e.g., Rhona Flin and J.
R. Spencer, “Do Children Forget Faster?”, [1991] Crim. L.R. 189, at
p. 190.)  It follows that the videotape which is made within a reasonable
time after the alleged offence and which describes the act will almost
inevitably reflect a more accurate recollection of events than will testimony
given later at trial. Thus the section enhances the ability of a court to find
the truth by preserving a very recent recollection of the event in question.

 

20                              
There is another aspect of the section that cannot be ignored.  Any kind
of assault on a child may be traumatic.  Assaults of a sexual nature are still
more likely to have a serious deleterious effect.  This traumatic effect will
be greater still when the perpetrator is a parent, guardian or person in
authority.  Recalling the events will be extremely difficult for every child
and the more sensitive the young person, the greater will be the difficulty
experienced.  It follows that anything that can be done to ease the traumatic
effect upon a child should be encouraged.  Thus a record of events made in more
informal and less forbidding surroundings than a courtroom will serve to reduce
the likelihood of inflicting further injury upon the child witness.

 








21                              
It can thus be seen that the primary goal of the section is to create a
record of what is probably the best recollection of the event that will be of
inestimable assistance in ascertaining the truth.  The video record may indeed
be the only means of presenting a child’s evidence.  For example, a child
assaulted at the age of three or four years may have very little real
recollection of the events a year or two later when the child is attempting to
testify at trial.  Justice L’Heureux‑Dubé in her minority reasons in L.
(D.O.), supra, noted the fundamental importance of having the
videotape before the court.  At p. 450 she stated:

 

Section 715.1 ensures that the child’s story will be brought
before the court regardless of whether the young victim is able to accomplish
this unenviable task.

 

22                              
The important subsidiary aim of the section is to prevent or reduce
materially the likelihood of inflicting further injury upon a child as a result
of participating in court proceedings.  This will be accomplished by reducing
the number of interviews that the child must undergo and thereby diminish the
stress occasioned a child by repeated questioning on a painful incident. 
Further, the videotaping will take place in surroundings that are less
overwhelming for a child than the courtroom.

 

23                              
Numerous Canadian academic writers have noted and stressed the goals of
s. 715.1.  For instance, Professor Bala stated, in Nicholas Bala and
Hilary McCormack, “Accommodating the Criminal Process to Child Witnesses:  L.
(D.O.) and Levogiannis” (1994), 25 C.R. (4th) 341, at p. 343:

 

One of the main purposes of this provision is to ensure that the courts
have access to the best description possible of the events, as a child is more
likely to have an accurate and complete memory of the events when the videotape
is made, than several months later at the time of trial.  Children are also
more likely to fully remember and relate often painful memories in a relatively
relaxed interview than in the strange, stressful, and formal court environment.

 








24                              
This was the same approach which had been taken before s. 715.1
came into force.  During the second reading of Bill C‑15, An Act to Amend
the Criminal Code  and the Canada Evidence Act , the Hon. Bob Kaplan indicated
that one of the purposes of s. 715.1  would be to capture the child’s story
at a time when it is fresh in her mind.  He stated at p. 1040:

 

. . . videotaping a complainant at a time closer to the
incident will reflect more accurately the vocabulary and life experience of a child. 
The evidence a child gives in court will be much different four or five years
later because of the evolution of the child, because of his or her greater
understanding of the sexual behaviour of adults and because of his or her own
sexuality.  That in itself is an argument for admitting a
videotape. . . .

 

(House of Commons Debates, 2nd Sess., 33rd Parl., vol. I, 1986,
November 4, 1986.)

 

25                              
With a view to achieving the same goals as those sought by the Canadian
legislators many jurisdictions in the United States have enacted statutes
making videotaped interviews with children admissible in criminal proceedings. 
It is usually a precondition for admissibility that the child be available for
cross‑examination at trial.  This is often effected by means of a live
video‑link.  Some schemes provide for a “video deposition” when the child
is unavailable to give evidence at trial.  In this type of legislation, the
videorecording is made outside the courtroom in the presence of counsel and the
defendant.  The defendant is given an opportunity to cross‑examine the
child at that time.  The video is then admitted at trial in lieu of the
testimony of the child.  However, several states permit the child to be called
as a witness at trial despite the admission of the videotape.

 








26                              
Legislation of this type was first enacted in Montana in 1977 with the
stated aim of reducing the trauma that young victims of sexual abuse face when
thrust into the criminal justice system (Mike McGrath and Carolyn Clemens, “The
Child Victim as a Witness in Sexual Abuse Cases” (1985), 46 Mont. L. Rev.
229, at p. 230).  By 1994, 37 states allowed videotaped testimony by children
in child abuse cases, and 30 states permitted children who were allegedly
victims of abuse to testify by means of one‑way or two‑way closed
circuit television.  See Diana B. Lathi, “Sex Abuse, Accusations of Lies, and
Videotaped Testimony: A Proposal for a Federal Hearsay Exception in Child
Sexual Abuse Cases” (1997), 68 U. Colo. L. Rev. 507, at p. 531
(f.n. 126).

 

27                              
Many of these statutes have been challenged by defendants as violating
their constitutional right to confront their accusers guaranteed by the Sixth
Amendment.  However, most courts have upheld these innovations because of the
significant emotional distress that face‑to‑face confrontation can
cause children which in turn affects their ability to testify and thus impairs
the truth‑seeking process.  See Lathi, supra, at p. 531.

 

28                              
The reasons advanced in the U.S. Courts to support the use of videotaped
statements are reflected in those advanced by Canadian courts and academic
writers.  First, videotaping may reduce the number of pretrial interviews
required of the child.  Second, videotaping the statements lessens the chance
of inflicting further harm on the child by, at least, lessening the stress at
trial.  Third, videotaping may increase the accuracy of the testimony since the
child may feel more comfortable and be more forthcoming in the atmosphere in
which the video is recorded.  Fourth, the admission of a videotape may prompt a
guilty plea by the defendant and eliminate entirely the need for the child to
appear as a witness in court.  Finally, videotaping preserves an early account
of the alleged events including the gestures and facial expressions
accompanying the child’s initial statement (Nancy Walker Perry and Bradley D.
McAuliff, “The Use of Videotaped Child Testimony:  Public Policy Implications”
(1993), 7 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol’y 387).  As the authors
state, at p. 420:

 

The standard courtroom setting is particularly
likely to induce trauma among child witnesses; it also is likely to impair
their communicative abilities.  Under such circumstances, the truth‑seeking
function of the court may be vitiated if videotaped testimony is not allowed in
cases involving child witnesses.








29                              
The experience in the United States emphasizes and confirms the two
primary purposes of s. 715.1.  First, it enhances the fundamental
truth-seeking role of the courts.  Second, it reduces the likelihood of
inflicting further injury on a child as a result of involvement in the criminal
process.  With those goals in mind, what is the appropriate test for
determining whether a young person has adopted the videotaped statement.

 

(ii)  The Test for Adoption

 

30                              
Section 715.1 provides that a videotaped statement is admissible in
evidence if the complainant “adopts the contents of the videotape” while testifying. 
What meaning should be attributed to that phrase?

 

31                              
The law of evidence has developed rough guidelines for determining
whether a witness has adopted a prior inconsistent statement. 
Originally, prior inconsistent statements were admissible solely for attacking
a witness’ credibility, even in circumstances where the witness adopted it as
true.  However, over time, the rule has been broadened.  If the witness
admitted the prior statement was true, it was considered to have been adopted
and would be admissible for the truth of its contents (Deacon v. The King,
[1947] S.C.R. 531).  Initially, the conditions that had to exist before a
witness could “adopt” a prior inconsistent statement were not considered by the
courts.  Instead, judges relied upon their assessment of the witness’ demeanor
and reaction upon being confronted with a prior statement to determine whether
the witness adopted it as true.

 








32                              
However, in R. v. Antoine, [1949] 1 W.W.R. 701 (C.A.), it was
held that adoption occurs when the witness admits the truth of the statement
under oath.  This was the approach taken by Estey J. in McInroy v. The Queen,
[1979] 1 S.C.R. 588.  He found, at p. 608, that the question to be
resolved was whether the witness had “adopted it in the witness box as being
the truth as she now sees it”.  In R. v. Smith (1985), 66 A.R. 195, the
Alberta Court of Appeal held that a previous inconsistent statement is adopted
if the witness accepts it as being true at the moment she is testifying. 
Lieberman J.A. stated that it was insufficient for the witness to affirm that
when she gave the statement she was being candid.  The Ontario Court of Appeal
applied a similar approach to the adoption of prior inconsistent statements in R.
v. Atikian (1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 357, at p. 364:

 

The jury had to understand that before they could find that the witness
had adopted the statement and that they could use what was said in the
statement as proof of the truth of the facts stated in it, they had to be
satisfied that she acknowledged that she made the statement and that it was
true, or, of course, that she made part of the statement and that that part of
it was true.  And so, she adopted it as part of her testimony under oath at the
trial.

 

33                              
In the context of prior inconsistent statements the term “adoption” is
used to distinguish between the situation presented by a witness who admits
making a prior inconsistent statement but not its truth and that of a witness admitting
not only that the prior statement was made but also that it is true.  It is
only in the latter case that the statement is “adopted” and admissible for the
truth of its contents.  The question remains whether the test for adopting a
prior inconsistent statement should be applied to the videotaped statement
contemplated by s. 715.1.

 

34                              
Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990), defines “adopt” as
follows:

 

To accept, appropriate, choose, or select.  To make that one’s own
(property or act) which was not so originally.

 

 








35                              
Obviously the term “adoption” is capable of several meanings.  However,
in the context of s. 715.1 the proper interpretation should be one which
accords with its aim and purpose.  At this point it must be observed that the
French version of the Code uses in lieu of the word “adopts” the word “confirme”
which may not have precisely the same meaning as “adopts”.  Nonetheless the
word “confirme” in s. 715.1 must be given the same meaning as that
attributed to “adopts” in these reasons.  It is the meaning which best reflects
the purpose of the section.

 

36                              
The Alberta and Ontario Courts of Appeal have taken different approaches
to the adoption of videotaped evidence.  In R. v. Meddoui (1990), 61
C.C.C. (3d) 345, the Alberta Court of Appeal found that a witness “adopted” her
statement within the meaning of s. 715.1 when she recalled giving the
statement and testified that she was then attempting to be honest and
truthful.  It was held that the complainant need not have a present recollection
of the events discussed.  The decision approved the use of the videotape as
evidence of the events described, even if the complainant is unable to recall
the events discussed in the tape which formed the basis for the charge.

 

37                              
In Meddoui, it was found that s. 715.1 modified the rule
concerning past recollection recorded which required that the witness have no
present memory of the events described in the record before it could be
admitted for the truth of its contents.  This rule was developed to prevent the
admission of prior consistent statements which were deemed irrelevant. 
Section 715.1 was found to be an exception to the rule.  Further it was
recognized that a very early account can be of more probative value than
present testimony, particularly if the present memory is faulty or it is
difficult for the witness to articulate it in court.  It was held that a
present assurance of past honesty would be a sufficient indication of
trustworthiness to warrant the admission of the statement.

 








38                              
In R. v. Toten (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 5, the Ontario Court of
Appeal rejected the Meddoui interpretation of “adopts” in favour of a
narrower one.  It was held that in order to adopt the contents of a videotaped
statement, the child complainant must be able, based on a present memory of the
events referred to in the videotape, to verify the accuracy and contents of the
statement.  The child must not only acknowledge making the statement but also
the truth of its contents.  This interpretation of “adopts” was based upon the
more traditional approach which had been used in the context of prior
inconsistent statements.

 

39                              
Should the Meddoui decision or the Toten decision be
applied in defining s. 715.1 or should portions of each form the basis for
determining if there has been “adoption” of the videotaped statement?

 

40                              
In light of the clear aim and purpose of s. 715.1, I cannot accept
the Ontario Court of Appeal position that the same meaning of adoption should
be used in the context of the videotaped statements of a child as was applied
to prior inconsistent statements.  Adoption is not a term with a static legal
meaning which must apply in all circumstances.  The strict adoption test for
prior inconsistent statements was necessary to ensure a reasonable degree of
reliability before allowing the statements to be admitted for the truth of
their contents.  However, s. 715.1 has built‑in guarantees of
trustworthiness and reliability which eliminate the need for such a stringent
requirement for adoption.  Further, a lack of present memory or an inability to
provide testimony at trial regarding the events referred to in the videotape as
a result of the youthfulness and the emotional state of the complainant
increases the need to consider the videotaped statement.

 








41                              
The test set out in Toten would prevent a child who has little,
or no memory of the events from “adopting” the video and it would therefore be
inadmissible under s. 715.1.  However, it is precisely in this situation
that the video is most needed.  Children, particularly younger ones, are prone
to forget details of an event with the passage of time.  A videotape made
shortly after the event is more likely to be accurate than the child’s viva
voce testimony, given months later, at trial.  It is quite possible that a
young child will have a recollection of going to the police station and making
the statement and of her attempt to be truthful at the time yet have no memory
of the unpleasant events.  This is particularly true where the elapsed time
between the initial complaint and the date of trial is lengthy.  If effect is
to be given to the aims of s. 715.1 of enhancing the truth-seeking role of
the courts by preserving an early account of the incident and of preventing
further injury to vulnerable children as a result of their involvement in the
criminal process, then the videotape should generally be admitted.

 

42                              
In Toten, it was suggested that the videotape would be useful in
circumstances where a child has a memory of events but is unable to articulate
them.  In my view, this approach is too narrow.  It fails to take into account
the broader purposes of the legislation.  Trial judges do not expect children
to be perfectly articulate.  They know that the examination‑in‑chief
of a child will not precisely match the ideal narrative form of an adult’s
testimony.  Indeed, the trial judge has the discretion to permit counsel to use
leading questions on examination‑in‑chief in order to get the
child’s evidence before the trier of fact.  Children are vulnerable victims and
for a number of reasons their testimonial capacities may range from a complete
inability to articulate recalled events to an ability to recount some but not
all of the events.  In any of these circumstances, the admission of a videotaped
statement would assist a court in arriving at the truth.  It would be
inappropriate to construe the section as one which only addresses the
“inarticulate complainant”.

 








43                              
Although I agree with much of the reasoning in Meddoui I cannot
accept the suggestion put forward that when a witness has an independent
present memory of the events the videotape adds nothing to the testimony.  The
admission of the videotaped statements made shortly after the events in issue
may be of great assistance in augmenting a child’s testimony at trial by the
account of events given in the statement when the incidents were fresh in the
child’s mind.  In Toten, at p. 28, it was wisely observed that
“[t]he prior statement, combined with the complainant’s in‑court evidence,
may well afford a more complete version of the complainant’s evidence.”

 

44                              
I recognize that the Meddoui approach to “adoption” gives rise to
another problem.  Specifically, a witness who cannot remember the events cannot
be effectively cross‑examined on the contents of his or her statement,
and therefore the reliability of his or her testimony cannot be tested in that
way.  However, it was recognized in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; R.
v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, and R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R.
740, that cross‑examination is not the only guarantee of reliability. 
There are several factors present in s. 715.1 which provide the requisite
reliability of the videotaped statement.  They include:  (a) the requirement
that the statement be made within a reasonable time; (b) the trier of fact can
watch the entire interview, which provides an opportunity to observe the
demeanor, and assess the personality and intelligence of the child; (c) the
requirement that the child attest that she was attempting to be truthful at the
time that the statement was made.  As well, the child can be cross‑examined
at trial as to whether he or she was actually being truthful when the statement
was made.  These indicia provide enough guarantees of reliability to
compensate for the inability to cross‑examine as to the forgotten
events.  Moreover, where the complainant has no independent memory of the
events there is an obvious necessity for the videotaped evidence.  In Meddoui,
it was recommended that in such circumstances, the trier of fact should be
given a special warning (similar to the one given in Vetrovec v. The Queen,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 811) of the dangers of convicting based on the videotape
alone.  In my view, this was sage advice that should be followed.








 

The Effect of an Inconsistency Between the Child’s Viva Voce
Testimony and Her Videotaped Statement

 

45                              
The test of adoption should not be the final determination of
reliability but rather a means of ascertaining whether the videotape meets the
threshold degree of reliability required to admit it for the truth of its
contents.  The adoption of the videotape renders the evidence admissible
pursuant to s. 715.1.  Once the trial judge rules that the statement has
been adopted, the video becomes the evidence of the events described as if the
child were giving the statements on the videotape in open court (L. (D.O.),
supra, at p. 458).  An adopted videotaped statement should,
together with the viva voce evidence given at trial, comprise the whole
of the evidence‑in‑chief of the complainant.

 

46                              
After the videotaped evidence has been admitted, any questions which
arise concerning the circumstances in which the video was made, the veracity of
the witness’ statements, or the overall reliability of the evidence, will be
matters for the trier of fact to consider in determining how much weight the
videotaped statement should be given.

 

47                              
If, in the course of cross-examination, defence counsel elicits evidence
which contradicts any part of the video, this does not render those parts
inadmissible.  Obviously a contradicted videotape may well be given less weight
in the final determination of the issues.  However, the fact that the video is
contradicted in cross‑examination does not necessarily mean that the video
is wrong or unreliable.  The trial judge may still conclude, as in this case,
that the inconsistencies are insignificant and find the video more reliable
than the evidence elicited at trial.  In R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
30, at p. 55, Wilson J. stated that

 








a flaw, such as a contradiction, in a child’s testimony should not be
given the same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an adult.
. . . While children may not be able to recount precise details and
communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean
that they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it.

 

48                              
She concluded that, although each witness’ credibility must be assessed,
the standard which would be applied to an adult’s evidence is not always
appropriate in assessing the credibility of young children.  This approach to
the evidence of children was reiterated in R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2
S.C.R. 122, at pp. 132‑34.  There McLachlin J. acknowledged
that the peculiar perspectives of children can affect their recollection of
events and that the presence of inconsistencies, especially those related to
peripheral matters, should be assessed in context.  A skilful cross‑examination
is almost certain to confuse a child, even if she is telling the truth.  That
confusion can lead to inconsistencies in her testimony.  Although the trier of
fact must be wary of any evidence which has been contradicted, this is a matter
which goes to the weight which should be attached to the videotape and not to its
admissibility.

 

49                              
In the case at bar, Lane J. properly viewed the inconsistencies as a
matter going to weight.  She applied the principles from B. (G.), supra,
and W. (R.), supra, in holding that the minor inconsistencies
regarding peripheral details were not of “great significance” and that they
should not preclude her from relying on the videotaped statement as true. 
Furthermore, she found that the complainant’s evidence‑in‑chief and
cross‑examination were consistent with the evidence she gave in her videotaped
statement with respect to the essential elements of the assault.  As Lane J.
noted:

 

. . . I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the
essence of her complaint.  As I have said before, she was totally consistent
with respect to the essential details and that consistency remained
notwithstanding a very skilled cross‑examination.








Lane J. was
entitled to prefer the videotaped evidence to that elicited on cross‑examination. 
Her decision was not unreasonable and should not be disturbed.

 

Should a Voir Dire Have Been Held?

 

50                              
At trial, the videotape was shown to the complainant and she testified
that it was her in the video, that she had made the statements it contained and
that they were true.  Lane J. then ruled that the requirements of s. 715.1
had been met and that the videotaped evidence was admissible for the truth of its
contents.  It is apparent that no formal voir dire was held with respect
to the admissibility issue.

 

51                              
The minority reasons of L’Heureux‑Dubé J. in L. (D.O.), supra,
indicate that, prior to the introduction of a videotaped statement under
s. 715.1, a voir dire must be held in order to review the contents
of the tape to ensure that the statements within it conform to the rules of
evidence.  I agree with this conclusion.  Both L. (D.O.) and Toten,
supra, indicate that, at this stage, the trial judge may exercise his or
her discretion to exclude the videotaped statement if prejudice from its
admission would outweigh its probative value.  The discretion to exclude the
videotape is limited to those cases where its admission would operate unfairly
to the accused.  Those cases will be relatively rare.  (See Toten, at
p. 32; R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, at p. 548.) 
L’Heureux‑Dubé J. in L. (D.O.), at p. 463, suggests that
there are a number of factors which should be taken into account in exercising
this discretion:

 

(a)   The form of questions used by any other
person appearing in the videotaped statement;

 

(b)   any interest of anyone participating in the
making of the statement;

 

(c)   the quality of the video and audio
reproduction;

 








(d)   the presence or absence of inadmissible
evidence in the statement;

 

(e)   the ability to eliminate inappropriate
material by editing the tape;

 

(f)    whether other out‑of‑court
statements by the complainant have been entered;

 

(g)   whether any visual information in the
statement might tend to prejudice the accused (for example, unrelated injuries
visible on the victim);

 

(h)   whether the prosecution has been allowed to
use any other method to facilitate the giving of evidence by the complainant;

 

(i)    whether the trial is one by judge alone or
by a jury; and

 

(j)    the amount of time which has passed since
the making of the tape and the present ability of the witness to effectively
relate to the events described.

 

52                              
A consideration of these factors would help to ensure that the contents
of the statement generally conform to the rules of evidence and that the
statement has probative value.  The discretionary power to exclude evidence
should not be used to determine issues of weight.  In cases where there is
conflicting evidence and opinion as to how useful the videotaped statement may
be in providing an honest and complete account of the complainant’s story, the
statement should be admitted unless the trial judge is satisfied that it could
interfere with the truth‑finding process.  (See Toten, at
pp. 32‑33.)

 








53                              
The respondent argued in this appeal that the pre‑video interview
conducted by the police officers may have tainted the videotaped evidence and
that this possibility ought to have been canvassed in a voir dire. 
Although I agree that it would have been preferable for the police to have
refrained, to the extent that it was reasonably possible, from interviewing the
complainant before the videotaped statement was recorded, the ultimate
reliability of the videotaped statement is not a question which should be
resolved at the voir dire.  The fact that a pre‑video interview
was conducted, and any effect it may have had on the subsequently videotaped
statement, will go to the weight which should be accorded the evidence, not its
admissibility.  It would be preferable if the police officers conducting the
videotaped interview would pose simple, open-ended questions to the child.  It
must be recognized that in some situations it will be necessary and appropriate
to ask leading questions. Recently, an Ontario Court of Appeal decision was
upheld in which the possibility of witness tainting was ruled a question of
weight not admissibility: see R. v. Buric, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 535.

 

54                              
Wherever evidence is tendered for admission under s. 715.1 of the Code,
a formal voir dire must be held to determine whether the requirements of
the section are met and to ensure that the videotape conforms with the rules of
evidence.  However, no substantial wrong resulted from Lane J.’s failure to
hold a voir dire.  Since S.D. duly adopted the contents of the videotape
and there is no evidence suggesting that Lane J. would or should have exercised
her residual discretion to exclude the evidence because of unfairly prejudicial
effects its admission would have on the respondent, the videotaped statement
was properly admitted.

 








55                              
If it can reasonably be done, a sensitive judicial system should, with
the aim of s. 715.1 in mind, interpret the section in a manner that will
attempt to avoid further injury to children resulting from their participation
in the criminal trial process.  That must of course be done within the balanced
bounds of always ensuring that the accused enjoys the fundamental right to a
fair trial.  The definitions and procedures set out in these reasons strive to
achieve these aims.

Defences ‑‑ Provocation ‑‑ Whether provocation defence
properly left with jury ‑‑ Whether evidence met threshold test for
leaving defence with jury ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
s. 232 .

 

                   The accused was
charged with first degree murder for the killing of his wife's lover.  Two
months prior to the incident, his wife had disclosed her relationship to him. 
On the night she left, the accused tried unsuccessfully to locate her.  When he
returned home, he removed a rifle from the house to the garage.  He was very
upset and he testified that he thought about killing the victim, his wife, or
himself.  The next morning, he met his wife, who was accompanied by the victim,
in an attempt to persuade her to return home.  He was unsuccessful.  He
persisted by calling her at work and later decided to try to meet her alone,
away from the influence of the victim.  This was important to the accused because
on an earlier occasion he had been able to convince his wife to stay with him. 
Before leaving his house, the accused put the loaded rifle in the back of his
car, thinking that he might have to kill the victim.  He testified that a few
miles from home he abandoned that thought, but instead planned to use the rifle
as a final bluff to get his wife to come with him.  He went to his wife's
workplace and followed her when she went to the bank, where he insisted that
they go some place private to talk.  She agreed but out of fear returned to her
workplace.  The accused followed her into the parking lot.  While he was
attempting to persuade his wife to go somewhere to talk, the victim came out of
the building and began to lead her back into the office.  The accused removed
the rifle from the car.  The victim was then told by the accused's wife that
the rifle was not loaded and he may have believed her.  He began walking
towards the accused, with his hands on the wife's shoulders swinging her back
and forth, saying, ""Come on big fellow, shoot me?  You want to shoot me? 
Go ahead and shoot me.""  At some point, she was moved aside and the victim
kept coming towards the accused, ignoring his instructions to stay back.  The
accused testified that his eyes were closed as he tried to retreat inward and
the gun discharged.  The trial judge left the defence of provocation with the
jury, but in his charge did not instruct the jury that the Crown had the onus
of disproving provocation beyond a reasonable doubt.  The accused was found
guilty of second degree murder.  The Court of Appeal in a majority decision
dismissed the accused's appeal, holding that the trial judge erred in leaving
the defence of provocation with the jury but that this error did not prejudice
the accused.

 

                   Held (Iacobucci and Major JJ.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Sopinka, Cory and
McLachlin JJ.:  The defence of provocation in s. 232  of the Criminal
Code  contains both an objective and a subjective element and both must be
satisfied if the defence is to be invoked.  The objective element requires that
there be a wrongful act or insult of such a nature that it is sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control.  The
""ordinary person"" must be of the same age, and sex, and share with
the accused such other factors as would give the act or insult in question a
special significance and have experienced the same series of acts or insults as
those experienced by the accused.  The history and background of the relationship
between the victim and the accused is also relevant.  The subjective element
requires that the accused act upon that insult on the sudden and before there
was time for his passion to cool.  To be sudden provocation, the wrongful act
or insult must strike upon a mind unprepared for it, and it must make an
unexpected impact that takes the understanding by surprise and sets the
passions aflame.  Under the subjective element, the history and background of
the relationship between the victim and the accused should also be taken into
consideration.  While both elements are clearly questions of fact which the
jury must decide, before leaving the defence with the jury the trial judge must
determine if there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed
and acting judicially could find that there had been provocation.  This
threshold test can be readily met, so long as there is some evidence that the
objective and subjective elements may be satisfied.  The trial judge should not
weigh the sufficiency of the evidence.  This function is reserved for the
jury.  When considering whether the evidence has met the threshold test, the
trial judge must also take into account the nature of the wrongful act or
insult and how that act or insult should be viewed in the context of the case.

 

                   Here, the trial
judge properly left the defence of provocation with the jury.  When all the
relevant considerations are taken into account in assessing both elements of
the test, there was evidence upon which a reasonable jury acting judicially and
properly instructed could have concluded that the defence was applicable. 
Further, although rejection in the context of a romantic relationship does not
constitute a basis for the provocation defence, rejection in this case is not
the most significant or overriding factor.  The accused sought to avoid the
victim in order to talk privately with his wife.  The evidence indicates that
the confrontation with the victim in the parking lot was unexpected.  Finally,
s. 232(3) of the Code is not a bar to the defence in this case. 
While the victim's actions in the parking lot were clearly not prohibited by
law, they could nonetheless be found by a jury to constitute insulting
behaviour.

 

                   In light of the
trial judge's failure to instruct the jury that the onus rested upon the Crown
to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that there had not been provocation,
there must be a new trial on the charge of second degree murder.

 

                   Per Iacobucci and Major JJ.
(dissenting):  The threshold test for leaving the defence of provocation with
the jury has not been met in this case.  With respect to the objective element
of the test, there is no evidence on which a reasonable jury, acting
judicially, could find a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive the
ordinary person of the power of self‑control.  The victim's statements
prior to the shooting or the fact that he may have positioned the accused's
wife between himself and the accused cannot constitute a wrongful act or
insult.  Those actions are not contemptuous or scornful; they are legitimate
reactions to a dangerous situation.  As well, the fact that the victim had a
personal relationship with the accused's wife is not a wrongful act or insult
sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose the power of self‑control. 
It would be a dangerous precedent to characterize involvement in an
extramarital affair as conduct capable of grounding provocation, even when
coupled with the victim's reactions to the dangerous situation he faced.  In
any event, even if the objective element of the test for provocation had been
met, the subjective element was not met since there is no evidence that the
accused acted on the sudden.  The accused's mind was not unprepared for the
sight of his wife with the victim such that he was taken by surprise and his
passions were set aflame.  The accused had known of his wife's involvement with
the victim for some time; he knew his wife wanted to leave him, and he had seen
the victim with his wife earlier that day.  The defence therefore should not
have been left with the jury.  This was an error that did not prejudice the
accused.

1                 Cory
J. -- The sole question to be considered on this appeal is whether the trial
judge was correct in leaving the defence of provocation with the jury.  Put
another way, the issue is whether there was any evidence upon which a
reasonable jury acting judicially and properly instructed could find that there
had been provocation.

in leaving provocation with the jury, then it is conceded that there must be a
new trial.  This is the result of the failure to instruct the jury that there
was no onus resting upon the appellant to establish the defence but rather that
it rested upon the Crown to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that there had
not been provocation.  The necessity of giving these instructions has been
emphasized by this Court in Latour v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 19, and in
Linney v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 646.  If on the other hand it was
inappropriate for the trial judge to leave the defence of provocation to the
jury, then the fact that he erred in the instructions pertaining to provocation
was immaterial and it would be appropriate to find that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage had been occasioned by the error.

 

The Defence of Provocation

 

3                 The Criminal Code  has
always provided a defence of provocation which may reduce the crime of murder
to manslaughter.  It is found at present in s. 232  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which provides:

 

                   232. (1)  Culpable homicide
that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who
committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   (2)  A
wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

                   (3)  For
the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)  whether
a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

 

(b)  whether
the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation that
he alleges he received,

 

are
questions of fact, but no one shall be deemed to have given provocation to
another by doing anything that he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything
that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused with an
excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being.

 

                   (4)  Culpable
homicide that otherwise would be murder is not necessarily manslaughter by
reason only that it was committed by a person who was being arrested illegally,
but the fact that the illegality of the arrest was known to the accused may be
evidence of provocation for the purpose of this section.

 

4                 The section specifies that there
is both an objective and a subjective element to the defence.  Both must be
satisfied if the defence is to be invoked.  First, there must be a wrongful act
or insult of such a nature that it is sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control as the objective element.  Second, the
subjective element requires that the accused act upon that insult on the sudden
and before there was time for his passion to cool.  The objective aspect would
at first reading appear to be contradictory for, as legal writers have noted,
the ""ordinary"" person does not kill.  Yet, I think the objective
element should be taken as an attempt to weigh in the balance those very human
frailties which sometimes lead people to act irrationally and impulsively
against the need to protect society by discouraging acts of homicidal violence.

 

When Should the
Defence of Provocation Be Left to the Jury

 

5                 In Parnerkar v. The Queen,
[1974] S.C.R. 449, Fauteux C.J., writing for the majority at p. 454, held
that the defence should not be left with the jury for where:

 

. . .
the record is denuded of any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable jury
acting judicially to find a wrongful act or insult of the nature and effect set
forth in s. 203(3)(a) and (b), it is then, as a matter of
law, within the area exclusively reserved to the trial judge to so decide and
his duty to refrain from putting the defence of provocation to the jury.

 

6                 That is to say that before the
defence of provocation is left to the jury, the trial judge must be satisfied
(a) that there is some evidence to suggest that the particular wrongful
act or insult alleged by the accused would have caused an ordinary person to be
deprived of self-control and (b)  that there is some evidence showing that the
accused was actually deprived of his or her self-control by that act or
insult.  This threshold test can be readily met, so long as there is some
evidence that the objective and subjective elements may be satisfied.  If there
is, the defence must then be left with the jury.

 

7                 The test in Parnerkar was
followed by this Court in R. v. Faid, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 265.  This test
has been criticized by some writers (see, for example, Don Stuart, Canadian
Criminal Law: A Treatise (3rd ed. 1995), at p. 498) as being contrary
to the plain wording of s. 232 .  Despite my admiration for the work of
Professor Stuart, I cannot accept his position.  It is true that the objective
and subjective requirements mandated by this section are clearly questions of
fact which the jury must decide.  Nonetheless, the trial judge must still
determine if there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly
instructed and acting judicially could find that there had been provocation. 
If the trial judge is satisfied that there is such evidence, then the defence
must be put to the jury to determine what weight, if any, should be attached to
that evidence.  Obviously the trial judge should not weigh the sufficiency of
the evidence.  This is the function reserved for the jury.  A trial judge considering
whether the evidence has met the threshold test must also take into account the
nature of the wrongful act or insult and how that act or insult should be
viewed in the context of the case.

 

The Wrongful Act or
Insult

 

8                 Taylor v. The King,
[1947] S.C.R. 462, adopted The Oxford English Dictionary definition of
""insult"" (at p. 475) and found it to mean:

 

. . .
an act, or the action, of attacking or assailing; an open and sudden attack or
assault without formal preparations; injuriously contemptuous speech or
behaviour; scornful utterance or action intended to wound self-respect; an
affront; indignity.

 

The Objective Element of the Test: 
How Ordinary Is the ""Ordinary Person"" and Would That Person Have Been
Provoked by the Wrongful Act or Insult?

 

9                 In earlier cases, both in
England and in Canada, the concept of the ordinary person was very narrowly
defined.  In Wright v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 335, Fauteux J. (as he
then was) specifically rejected a consideration of the accused's past
relationship with the deceased.  He stated at p. 340:

 

While
the character, background, temperament, idiosyncrasies, or the drunkenness of
the accused are matters to be considered in the second branch of the enquiry,
they are excluded from the consideration in the first branch.  A contrary view
would denude of any sense the objective test.

 

10               This approach was adopted in Parnerkar,
supra, where Fauteux C.J. again emphasized that in assessing the
evidence on the objective test, the trial judge must consider the ordinary
person as one who had not been confronted with all of the same
circumstances which had faced the accused.  A similar view was expressed in the
English case of Bedder v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1954] 1
W.L.R. 1119 (H.L.).  This narrow approach required a court to completely ignore
all the particular features of the accused whether mental or physical, even for
the purpose of assessing the gravity of the insult.

 

11               The courts in England and Canada
have changed their position.  They now permit the inclusion of many of the
characteristics of the accused in the ""ordinary person"" standard
which must be met in the objective test.  It was recognized that if the
objective test was to be usefully applied the jury or fact finder must take
into consideration features such as the age, sex, and racial origin of the
accused.  Obviously the effect of calling a black person a “two-bit nigger
punk”, as in Olbey v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008, would be far
greater than if the same demeaning epithet was applied to a white man. 

 

12               Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705 (H.L.), was the turning point in England.  In
that case a 15‑year‑old male was raped and then mocked.  The
accused picked up a frying pan and struck and fatally injured his assailant. 
Section 3 of the Homicide Act, 1957 (U.K.), 5 & 6 Eliz. 2,
c. 11, provided that “the jury shall take into account everything both
done and said according to the effect which, in their opinion, it would have on
a reasonable man"".  Lord Diplock, at p. 718, interpreted the section
in this way:

 

. . .
the reasonable man referred to . . . is a person having the power of
self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the
accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as
they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him; . . .

 

13               Lord Simon went further and
determined that the entire factual situation had to be taken into account in
determining whether a person of reasonable self-control would be provoked in
the circumstances.  He put it in this way (at p. 727):

 

                   I
think that the standard of self-control which the law requires before
provocation is held to reduce murder to manslaughter is still that of the
reasonable person . . .; but that, in determining whether a person of
reasonable self-control would lose it in the circumstances, the entire
factual situation, which includes the characteristics of the accused, must be
considered.  [Emphasis added.]

 

14               In Canada, the courts have also
sought to attain a proper balance in the interpretation of the provocation
section.  It has been properly recognized that the objective element of the
test exists to ensure that the criminal law encourages reasonable and
responsible behaviour.  A consideration of the defence of provocation must
always bear this principle in mind.  On the other hand, if the test is to be
applied sensibly and with sensitivity, then the ordinary person must be taken
to be of the same age, and sex, and must share with the accused such other
factors as would give the act or insult in question a special significance.  In
other words, all the relevant background circumstances should be considered. 
In the context of other cases it may properly be found that other factors
should be considered.  It is how such an ""ordinary"" person with those
characteristics would react to the situation which confronted the accused that
should be used as the basis for considering the objective element.

 

15               The problem was considered by this
Court in R. v. Hill, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 313.  There a 16‑year‑old
male fought off the homosexual advances of an older man who was his ""Big
Brother"".  The narrow ""ordinary person"" test was rejected and a
more contextual one adopted.  Dickson C.J., writing for the majority of the
Court, held that the age and sex of the accused are important considerations in
the objective branch of the test.  At page 331, he noted that
""particular characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic can be
ascribed to an ordinary person without subverting the logic of the objective
test of provocation"".  Although it was not necessary in the circumstances
of that case to go beyond a consideration of the age and sex of the accused,
Dickson C.J. did state that the jury should ""assess what an ordinary
person would have done if subjected to the same circumstances as the
accused"" (p. 332).  Thus, although characteristics such as a propensity
to drunken rages or short tempered violence cannot be taken into account, other
characteristics may properly be considered without in any way demeaning or
subverting the aim of the objective test to encourage responsible behaviour. 
So too, it is proper for the jury to consider the background of the
relationship between the deceased and the accused, including earlier insults
which culminated in the final provocative actions or words.  For a jury to take
this into account would not adversely affect the objective aspect of the test.

 

16               The provincial courts of appeal
have widened I believe correctly the approach to the objective element in order
to consider the background relationship between the deceased and the accused. 
In R. v. Daniels (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (N.W.T.C.A.), Laycraft J.A.,
for the court, acknowledged that the personal attributes of an accused should
be excluded from the objective test but held that the background events should
be taken into consideration.  He put his position in these words (at
p. 554):

 

                   The
purpose of the objective test . . . is to consider the actions of the
accused in a specific case against the standard of the ordinary person.
Hypothetically, the ordinary person is subjected to the same external pressures
of insult by acts or words as was the accused.  Only if those pressures would
cause an ordinary person to lose self-control does the next question arise
whether the accused did, in fact, lose self-control.  In my view, the objective
test lacks validity if the reaction of the hypothetical ordinary person is not
tested against all of the events which put pressure on the accused.

 

                   The
requirement for suddenness of insult and reaction does not preclude a
consideration of past events.  The incident which finally triggers the reaction
must be sudden and the reaction must be sudden but the incident itself may well
be coloured and given meaning only by a consideration of events which preceded
it.  Indeed, one could imagine a case in which a given gesture, in itself
innocuous, could not be perceived as insulting unless the jury was aware of
previous events.  They disclose the nature, depth and quality of the insult.

 

17               In R. v. Conway (1985), 17
C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.), Howland C.J.O. concluded that the history and
background of the relationship between the victim and the accused is relevant
and pertinent to the ""ordinary person"" test.  He stated at
p. 487:

 

[The
trial judge] should have told [the jury] present acts or insults, in themselves
insufficient to cause an ordinary man to lose self-control, may indeed cause
such loss of self-control when they are connected with past events and external
pressures of insult by acts or words and accordingly in considering whether an
ordinary man would have lost self-control they must consider an ordinary man
who had experienced the same series of acts or insults as experienced by the
appellant. . . .

 

18               In my view, so long as the
provocation section remains in the Criminal Code  in its present form
certain characteristics will have to be assigned to the ""ordinary
person"" in assessing the objective element.  The ""ordinary
person"" must be of the same age, and sex, and share with the accused such
other factors as would give the act or insult in question a special significance
and have experienced the same series of acts or insults as those experienced by
the accused.

 

19               In summary then, the wrongful act
or insult must be one which could, in light of the past history of the
relationship between the accused and the deceased, deprive an ordinary person,
of the same age, and sex, and sharing with the accused such other factors as
would give the act or insult in question a special significance, of the power
of self‑control. 

 

The Subjective Element

 

20               In R. v. Tripodi, [1955]
S.C.R. 438, Rand J. interpreted ""sudden provocation"" to mean that
""the wrongful act or insult must strike upon a mind unprepared for it,
that it must make an unexpected impact that takes the understanding by surprise
and sets the passions aflame"" (p. 443).  To this definition, I would
add that the background and history of the relationship between the accused and
the deceased should be taken into consideration.   This is particularly
appropriate if it reveals a long history of insults, leveled at the accused by
the deceased.  This is so even if the insults might induce a desire for revenge
so long as immediately before the last insult, the accused did not intend to
kill.  Glanville Williams adopts this position in his Textbook of Criminal
Law (2nd ed. 1983).  At page 530, he puts it in this way: 
""affronts over a long period of time inducing the desire for revenge do
not preclude the defence of provocation, if immediately before the last affront
the defendant did not intend to kill"".  He adds further that, ""the
last affront may be comparatively trivial, merely the last straw that makes the
worm turn, so to speak"".

 

21               Further support for the position
that the prior history of the relationship may as well be taken into account in
assessing the subjective aspect can be found in the dissenting reasons of Foisy
J.A. in R. v. Sheridan (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 313 (Alta. C.A.), at
p. 321.  There Foisy J.A. stated:

 

                   The
trial judge's finding that the accused appellant had acted in the heat of
passion caused by sudden provocation took into account the finding that the
appellant, a cocaine addict, was irritable and anxious at the time.  Further
there was the sudden throwing of the bottle just after the final and absolute
death threat uttered by Miller.  This, together with the previous history of
threats of violence against the appellant and his wife was found by the learned
trial judge to have incited the appellant.

 

These reasons were specifically
adopted by this Court.  See R. v. Sheridan, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 205.  These
then are the considerations which the trial judge must take into account in
making assessment as to whether or not there was any evidence upon which a
reasonable jury acting judicially and properly instructed could find that the
defence of provocation could be applicable in the circumstances of this case.

 

Bearing in Mind the
Principles Pertaining to Provocation, Was There any Evidence Adduced in This
Case Which Required the Trial Judge to Leave That Defence with the Jury?

 

22               In this case, there is no doubt
that the relationship of the wife of the accused with the deceased was the
dominating factor in the tragic killing.  Obviously, events leading to the
break‑up of the marriage can never warrant taking the life of another. 
Affairs cannot justify murder.  Yet the provocation defence section has always
been and is presently a part of the Criminal Code .  Any recognition of
human frailties must take into account that these very situations may lead to
insults that could give rise to provocation.  Some European penal codes
recognize ""crimes of passion"" as falling within a special category.  
Indeed many of the Canadian cases which have considered the applicability of
the defence arise from such situations.  See, for example, the cases of Daniels,
supra, and Conway, supra.  The defence of provocation does
no more than recognize human frailties.  Reality and the past experience of the
ages recognize that this sort of situation may lead to acts of provocation. 
Each case must be considered in the context of its particular facts to
determine if the evidence meets the requisite threshold test necessary to
establish provocation.

 

The Objective Element
of the Test

 

23               In this case, it is appropriate to
take into account the history of the relationship between the accused and the
deceased.  The accused's wife had, on a prior occasion, planned to leave him
for the deceased but he had managed to convince her to return to him.  He hoped
to accomplish the same result when his wife left him for the deceased on this
second occasion.  At the time of the shooting he was distraught and had been
without sleep for some 34 hours.  When he turned into the parking lot of
his wife's employer he still wished to talk to her in private.  Later, when the
deceased held his wife by her shoulders in a proprietary and possessive manner
and moved her back and forth in front of him while he taunted the accused to
shoot him, a situation was created in which the accused could have believed
that the deceased was mocking him and preventing him from his having the
private conversation with his wife which was so vitally important to him.

 

24               Taking into account the past
history between the deceased and the accused, a jury could find the actions of
the deceased to be taunting and insulting.  It might be found that, under the
same circumstances, an ordinary person who was a married man, faced with the
break‑up of his marriage, would have been provoked by the actions of the
deceased so as to cause him to lose his power of self‑control. There was
some evidence, therefore, that would satisfy the objective element of the
test.  Next it remains to be seen whether there was evidence that could fulfil
the subjective element of the test.

 

The Subjective Element
of the Test

 

25               It must be determined whether
there was evidence that the appellant was actually provoked.  Once again it is
necessary to take into account the past history involving the accused, the
deceased and his wife.  Further, it cannot be forgotten that the accused hadn't
slept for some 34 hours and that he described himself as being devastated,
stressed out and suicidal.  He emphasized how important it was to him to talk
to his wife in private, away from the deceased.  It was in this manner that he
successfully persuaded his wife to stay with him on the earlier occasion.  When
his wife returned to her employer's parking lot and the deceased came out of
the building, he testified that his thoughts were ""here is the man that
won't give me a half hour alone with my wife after 21 years and he has had
her for 24 hours the night before"".

 

26               It was when the deceased put his
arm around his wife's waist and started leading her back towards the building
that the appellant removed the rifle from the car.  He testified that he did so
as a bluff.  He hoped it would make them take him more seriously and succeed in
convincing his wife to accompany him so that they could talk privately.  From
this point, the deceased's actions could be construed as a conscious attempt to
test the appellant's limits.  When he saw that the appellant had a gun, he
advanced towards him.  The appellant's wife was in front of the deceased and
the deceased had his hands on her shoulders.  The appellant recalled that the
deceased was swinging Mrs. Thibert from side to side like a moving target. 
While doing this, the deceased was laughing and grinning at the appellant.  He
also dared the appellant to fire and taunted him by saying ""Come on big
fellow, shoot me.  You want to shoot me?  Go ahead and shoot me.""  The
deceased continued to approach the appellant, proceeding as fast as he could. 
In turn, the appellant kept backing up and told the deceased to ""stay
back"", but the deceased continued to approach him.  The appellant
testified that he remembered wanting to scream because the deceased would not
stop coming towards him.  The appellant's eyes were tightly closed when he
fired the gun.  The time the appellant held the gun until he fired was not
long.  The events unfolded very quickly, in a matter of moments, seconds, not
minutes.

 

27               The respondent submitted that
""[r]ejection in the context of a romantic relationship will not constitute
a basis for the provocation defence.""  This is correct.  If the appellant
had simply brooded over the unhappy situation, put a rifle in his car and gone
looking for the deceased, then the history of the deceased’s relationship with
the wife of the accused could not be used as a basis for a defence of
provocation because the necessary final act of provocation was missing. 
However, in this case, rejection is not the most significant or overriding
factor.  The appellant sought to avoid the deceased in order to talk privately
with his wife.  The evidence indicates that the confrontation with the deceased
in the parking lot was unexpected.  The appellant had gone to some lengths to
avoid meeting the deceased.

 

28               In my view there was evidence upon
which a reasonable jury acting judicially and properly instructed could have
concluded that the defence of provocation was applicable.  Next it must be considered
whether the acts of the deceased were those which he had a legal right to do
and thus within the exemption described in s. 232(3).

 

Were the Acts of the
Deceased Ones Which He Had a Legal Right to Do but Which Were Nevertheless
Insulting?

 

29               It will be remembered that
s. 232(3) provides that ""no one shall be deemed to have given
provocation to another by doing anything that he had a legal right to
do"".  In the context of the provocation defence, the phrase ""legal
right"" has been defined as meaning a right which is sanctioned by law as
distinct from something which a person may do without incurring legal
liability.  Thus the defence of provocation is open to someone who is
""insulted"".  The words or act put forward as provocation need not be
words or act which are specifically prohibited by the law.  It was put in this
way in R. v. Galgay, [1972] 2 O.R. 630 (C.A.), by Brooke J.A. (at
p. 649):

 

The
absence of a remedy against doing or saying something or the absence of a
specific legal prohibition in that regard does not mean or imply that there is
a legal right to so act.  There may be no legal remedy for an insult said or
done in private but that is not because of legal right.  The section
distinguishes legal right from wrongful act or insult and the proviso of the
section ought not to be interpreted to license insult or wrongful act done or
spoken under the cloak of legal right.

 

This interpretation of ""legal
right"" was adopted in R. v. Haight (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 168 (Ont.
C.A.), where, at p. 175, Martin J.A. noted that ""[t]he law does not
approve of everything which it does not forbid.""

 

30               Thus, while the actions of the
deceased in the parking lot were clearly not prohibited by law, they could
nonetheless be found by a jury to constitute insulting behaviour.  In light of
the past history, possessive or affectionate behaviour by the deceased towards
the appellant's wife coupled with his taunting remarks could be considered to
be insulting.  Nor can it be said that these actions really constituted
self-defence.  The deceased was told by the appellant’s wife that the gun was
unloaded and he may have believed her.  In any event, he continued to advance
towards the appellant and to goad him to shoot despite the request to stop.  In
the circumstances, the actions of the deceased could well be found not to be
acts of self‑defence.  A jury could infer that it was the taunting of the
appellant by the deceased who was preventing him from talking privately with
his wife which was the last straw that led him to fire the rifle suddenly
before his passion had cooled.  While the deceased’s conduct might not have
been specifically prohibited nor susceptible to a remedy it was not sanctioned
by any legal right.

 

31               In summary, there was some
evidence upon which a reasonable jury acting judicially and properly instructed
could find that the defence of provocation was applicable.  It was appropriate
for the trial judge to leave his defence with the jury.  Once it was determined
the defence should be left then the trial judge was required to correctly
relate the principles of reasonable doubt as they applied to that defence.

 

Some General Comments

 

The Effect of Leaving
the Defence of Provocation With the Jury

 

32               It must be remembered that to find
that there was evidence which justified leaving the defence to the jury is far
from concluding that jury should or would act upon that evidence.  The defence
is simply something that the jury will have to assess.  The great good sense of
jurors will undoubtedly lead them to consider all the facts, including the
presence of the loaded gun in the car.  Further, it must be remembered that the
defence of provocation goes no farther than to reduce the conviction for murder
to one of manslaughter.  This is hardly an insignificant crime when it is
remembered that the life imprisonment can be imposed as punishment.

 

Advantageous Position
of the Trial Judge

 

33               It is trite but important to
recall that the trial judge had the tremendous advantage of seeing and hearing
the testimony of all who testified.  The trial judge was in a very advantageous
position to determine if there was such evidence of provocation adduced that
the defence should be left with the jury.  He considered the objections of the
Crown to leaving the defence with the jury but decided, rightly in my view,
that he should instruct the jury on the defence.  Unless there is an absence of
any evidence as to the objective and subjective elements of the defence such a
decision of a trial judge should not be lightly interfered with by an appellate
court.

 

The Juries Question as to Provocation

 

34               Of still greater significance the
jury in this case asked a question pertaining to the objective element of the
defence of provocation.  The question makes it apparent that the jury was
seriously considering the evidence relating to the defence and was concerned by
it.  In light of the evidence adduced relating to provocation this, in itself,
is an indication that the defence was properly left to the jury.

 

Disposition

 

35               In the result, I would allow the
appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and direct a new trial on
the charge of second degree murder.

 

//Major J.//

 

                   The reasons of
Iacobucci and Major JJ. were delivered by 

 

36               Major
J. (dissenting) -- This appeal concerns the application of the defence
of provocation found in s. 232  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 .  Specifically at issue is whether the trial judge was correct in leaving
the defence with the jury, and if so, whether the jury charge can be saved by
s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 

I.  Facts

 

37               The appellant Norman Eugene
Thibert was charged with first degree murder in the shooting death of his
estranged wife's lover, Alan Sherren.  Norman Eugene Thibert married his wife,
Joan Thibert, in July 1970.  The couple had two children, Michelle and Catrina,
aged 22 and 19 respectively at the time of the trial.

 

38               The Thiberts' marriage had its
share of problems.  Early on in the marriage, Mr. Thibert admitted to his wife
that he had had three extramarital affairs.  In September 1990, Mrs. Thibert
began an intimate relationship with the deceased, a co-worker.  She disclosed
this relationship to her husband in April 1991.  He was distraught and
eventually convinced his wife to remain with him and attempt to make their
marriage work.  

 

39               On July 2, 1991, Mrs. Thibert
decided to leave her husband.  She took a hotel room rather than returning
home.  The appellant drove around the city that evening, unsuccessfully
searching for the hotel where his wife was staying.  When he returned home, he
removed a rifle and a shotgun from the basement of the house to the garage.  He
testified that he thought about killing the deceased, his wife, or himself.  He
loaded the rifle, and then left the guns in a corner of the garage, having at
that point abandoned his violent thoughts.

 

40               The daughter, Catrina arrived home
to find her father very upset.  He told her of her mother's affair.  At
approximately 11:00 p.m., Mrs. Thibert telephoned her husband at home to tell
him of her decision to leave him.  At his request, she agreed to meet him the
next morning, at Smitty's Restaurant in St. Albert, a suburb of Edmonton at
7:00 a.m.  

 

41               The next morning Mr. Thibert and
Catrina went to the restaurant to meet Mrs. Thibert who arrived at the meeting
with the deceased.  The appellant attempted to persuade her to return home with
him, but she refused.  The meeting at Smitty's lasted approximately one hour. 
At the end of the meeting, Mr. Thibert promised not to bother his wife at work,
and in return, she promised to think about coming home that night to again talk
to him.  Outside the restaurant, while waiting for Mrs. Thibert to finish
talking with Catrina, the appellant told the deceased, ""I hope you intend
on moving back east or living under assumed names.... Because as long as I have
got breath in my body I am not going to give up trying to get my wife back from
you, and I will find you wherever you go.""  

42               The appellant testified that, when
he returned home, he thought about killing himself, and so returned to the
garage and retrieved the guns.  He sawed off the barrel of the shotgun, but
then discovered that the gun was inoperable since the firing pin was broken.

 

43               He telephoned his wife at work
several times in an effort to persuade her to return to him.

 

44               During one afternoon call, she
asked him to stop phoning her and told him that she was leaving work to make a
bank deposit.  The appellant then drove into the city, planning to find his
wife while she was at the bank, and away from the influence of the deceased,
and again attempt to convince her to give the marriage another try.

 

45               He put the loaded rifle in the
back of his car before departing, thinking that he might have to kill the
deceased.  He testified that a few miles from home he abandoned that thought,
but instead planned to use the rifle as a final bluff to get his wife to come
with him.  The police later seized a box of shells from the vehicle, although
the appellant stated that he did not remember placing the ammunition in the
car.

 

46               At approximately 2:45 p.m., the
appellant parked across the street from his wife's place of work.  When he saw
Mrs. Thibert depart for the bank, he followed her.  She noticed him at a
stoplight, at which time he attempted to persuade her to get into his car so
they could talk.  The appellant followed Mrs. Thibert to the bank, and insisted
that they go some place private to talk.  Mrs. Thibert agreed to meet him in a
vacant lot but instead, out of fear returned to her workplace.  The appellant
followed her into the parking lot.  The appellant again tried to persuade Mrs.
Thibert to go some place with him to talk, but she continued to refuse.

 

47               The appellant told Mrs. Thibert
that he had a high powered rifle in his car, but claimed that it was not
loaded.  He suggested that he would have to go into Mrs. Thibert's workplace
and use the gun.  At that time, the deceased came out of the building and began
to lead Mrs. Thibert back into the office.  The appellant then removed the
rifle from the car.  

 

48               The appellant's evidence was that
the deceased began walking towards him, with his hands on Mrs. Thibert's
shoulders swinging her back and forth, saying, ""You want to shoot me?  Go
ahead and shoot me."" and ""Come on big fellow, shoot me.  You want to
shoot me?  Go ahead and shoot me.""  At some point, Mrs. Thibert either
moved, or was moved aside.  The appellant testified that the deceased kept
coming towards him, ignoring the appellant's instructions to stay back.  The
appellant testified that his eyes were closed as he tried to retreat inward and
the gun discharged.  

 

49               After the shot, Mrs. Thibert ran
into the office building.  At some point, the appellant put the gun down,
entered the office building, and calmly said that he wanted to talk to his
wife.  He then exited the building, picked up the gun, put more ammunition in
it, and said he was not going to hurt anyone.  He placed the gun in his car and
drove away.  

 

50               While he was driving, the
appellant noticed a police car following him.  He pulled off onto a side road,
and surrendered to the police.  At the time of his arrest, Constable
Baumgartner recorded that the appellant stated ""It's out of me now.  He
was fooling around with my wife.""  Constable Turner recorded the
appellant's statement as ""For what it's worth, I was just after him.  For
what it's worth, it's out of me now.  He was fooling around with my wife.""

 

51               The appellant was tried by judge
and jury. He was found guilty of murder in the second degree.

 

II.  Legislation

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                   232.
(1)  Culpable homicide
that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who
committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   (2)   A
wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

                   (3)   For
the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)               whether
a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

 

(b)               whether
the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation that
he alleges he received,

 

are
questions of fact, but no one shall be deemed to have given provocation to
another by doing anything that he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything
that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused with an
excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being.

 

                                                                    ...

 

III.  Courts Below

 

Trial Court

 

52               At trial, the appellant  argued
that he did not have the requisite intent to commit murder, or that in the
alternative, he was provoked.  The trial judge left the defence of provocation
with the jury, but his charge did not relate the reasonable doubt standard to
the defence of provocation.  During deliberations, the jury returned twice with
questions, including a request for clarification of the provocation provision
of the Criminal Code  specifically with regard to the ordinary person
standard.  The jury found the appellant guilty of murder in the second degree.

 

Alberta Court of Appeal (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 193

 

                   Foisy J.A.

 

53               Foisy J.A. dismissed the
appellant's appeal on the grounds that the subjective element of the defence of
provocation did not have an air of reality on the evidence in this case.  The
appellant's main defence was that he had no intention to cause death or
grievous bodily harm.  It would then be inconsistent for the appellant to argue
that, alternatively, he did intend to shoot the deceased, but did so because he
was provoked.  The appellant's own words indicated that his actions had nothing
to do with an intentional act committed in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation. Therefore, it was an error for the trial judge to have left the
defence of provocation with the jury.  This error did not prejudice the
appellant.

 

54               Foisy J.A. agreed with the reasons
of McClung J.A., that if provocation had been a live issue in this case, the
jury charge was inadequate.

 

                   Côté J.A.,
concurring

 

55               Côté J.A. dismissed the
appellant's appeal on the grounds that he could find no evidence that the
accused acted in the heat of passion.  Since one of the elements necessary for
provocation was totally absent, it was not a live issue and should not have
been left with the jury.

 

56               Côté J.A. also agreed with McClung
J.A., that if provocation was a live issue in this case, the jury charge was inadequate.

 

                   McClung J.A.,
dissenting

 

57               McClung J.A. would have allowed
the appellant's appeal.  He found that the verdict was vulnerable because the
trial judge did not instruct the jury that the Crown had the onus of disproving
provocation beyond a reasonable doubt.  The fact that the trial judge had
explained that the Crown had the burden of proving the essential elements of
the offence beyond a reasonable doubt could not override the necessity of
specific guidance on the issue of provocation and the proof burden that
accompanies it.  In this case, the jury might have been left with the notion
that the accused bore some proof obligation in the establishment of the
provocation defence.

 

58               McClung J.A. noted that the trial
judge concluded that provocation was a real issue arising on the evidence after
hearing argument on the point, and declined to disturb the trial judge's
decision to leave the defence with the jury.  McClung J.A. also noted that the jury
did not convict the appellant of first degree murder, which finding accords
more with a provoked and impulsive homicide than one which was planned and
deliberate.  He found (at pp. 196-97) that the jury could decide that the
deceased's taunting and goading of the appellant at the time of the shooting
was a ""re-emergence of the wrongful insult"" of the deceased's attack
on the appellant's marriage.  In the circumstances, s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code  could not be invoked.

 

IV.  Issues

 

1.Was
the defence of provocation properly left with the jury?

 

2.If
so, can the verdict be saved by the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code ?

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Was the Defence of Provocation
Properly Left with the Jury?

 

59               In Parnerkar v. The
Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449, this Court, discussing the provocation defence,
set out the test for determining when the defence should be left with the
jury.  Fauteux C.J., speaking for the majority said, at p. 454:

 

If,
then, the record is denuded of any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable
jury acting judicially to find a wrongful act or insult of the nature and
effect set forth in s. 203(3)(a) and (b) [now s. 232(3)(a)
and (b)], it is then, as a matter of law, within the area exclusively
reserved to the trial judge to so decide and his duty to refrain from putting
the defence of provocation to the jury.

 

60               In R. v. Squire, [1977] 2
S.C.R. 13, this Court dealt with the objective branch of the provocation
defence, found now in s. 232(3) (a) of the Criminal Code .  Spence
J., for the Court, after reviewing the evidence, stated, at p. 21:

 

                   As
I have said, it is the duty of this Court to come to a decision whether those
circumstances amount to any evidence that a reasonable jury acting judicially
could find a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self-control (s. 215(2)) [now s. 232(2)], and I am strongly of the
view, with great respect to the opinion expressed by Martin J.A., that no jury
acting judicially could come to such a conclusion.

 

61               Therefore, if the record is
without evidence enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially to find a
wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, the objective branch of the threshold test for provocation has
not been met and the defence should not be left with the jury.

 

62               The definition of insult, cited
with approval by Kellock J. in Taylor v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 462, at
p. 475, is:

 

""Insult""
is defined in ""The Oxford English Dictionary"" inter alia, as

 

an
act, or the action, of attacking or assailing; an open and sudden attack or
assault without formal preparations; injuriously contemptuous speech or
behaviour; scornful utterance or action intended to wound self-respect; an
affront; indignity.

 

63               In my opinion, in this case there
is no evidence of a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control.  That the deceased may have positioned
Mrs. Thibert between himself and the appellant cannot constitute a wrongful act
or insult.  Nor can the statements ""You want to shoot me?  Go ahead and
shoot me"" and ""Come on big fellow, shoot me"" be considered a
wrongful act or insult.  Those actions are not contemptuous or scornful; they
are legitimate reactions to a dangerous situation.  It would be improper to
require victims to respond in a certain way when faced with armed, threatening
individuals.  The defence claim that the wrongful act or insult came from the
appellant's evidence that the deceased used Joan Thibert as a shield while taunting
him to shoot is ironic.  The appellant had control of the only true weapon
involved in this situation, the rifle.

 

64               Further, that the deceased had a
personal relationship with Mrs. Thibert is not a wrongful act or insult sufficient
to cause an ordinary person to lose the power of self-control.  The break-up of
a marriage due to an extramarital affair cannot constitute such a wrongful act
or insult.  I agree with the statement of Freeman J.A. in R. v. Young
(1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 538 (N.S.C.A.), at p. 542, that:

 

                   It
would set a dangerous precedent to characterize terminating a relationship as
an insult or wrong act capable of constituting provocation to kill.  The
appellant may have been feeling anger, frustration and a sense of loss,
particularly if he was in a position of emotional dependency on the victim as
his counsel asserts, but that is not provocation of a kind to reduce murder to
manslaughter.

 

65               Similarly, it would be a dangerous
precedent to characterize involvement in an extramarital affair as conduct
capable of grounding provocation, even when coupled with the deceased's
reactions to the dangerous situation he faced.  At law, no one has either an
emotional or proprietary right or  interest in a spouse that would justify the
loss of self-control that the appellant exhibited.  

 

66               In that connection, Cory J. states
that the events leading to the break-up of a relationship are not factors going
to provocation but I wonder whether the effect of his reasons is such that
these factors have been taken into account in the context of provocation.  My
colleague emphasizes that the accused still wished to see his wife alone after
the end of the relationship.  However, in my view, she had made it clear on a
number of occasions that she did not wish to be alone with him.  This was a
choice that Joan Thibert was free to make.  The accused had no right or
entitlement to speak with his wife in private.  The fact that the accused
believed that the deceased was preventing him from doing so is not, with
respect, a fact that ought to be taken into account when considering the
defence of provocation.

 

67               If I am wrong and the objective
threshold test for provocation is met, the appeal would fail on the subjective
element of the test.  The appellant had known of his wife's involvement with
the deceased for some time.  He knew his wife wanted to leave him, and had seen
the deceased with his wife earlier that day.  It cannot be said that the
appellant's mind was unprepared for the sight of his wife with the deceased
such that he was taken by surprise and his passions were set aflame.  There was
no element of suddenness on the facts of this case.

 

68               For these reasons, I am of the
opinion that neither the objective branch nor the subjective branch of the threshold
test for leaving the defence of provocation with the jury has been met.  There
is no evidence on which a reasonable jury, acting judicially could find a
wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive the ordinary person of the power
of self-control.  Neither is there any evidence that the appellant acted on the
sudden.  The defence should not have been left with the jury.  This was an
error that did not prejudice the appellant.

                   

B.  The Application of Section
686(1) (b)(iii)

 

69               In view of the conclusion I have
reached regarding the applicability of the defence of provocation in this case,
it is not necessary to consider the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code .

statement.  We see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s finding on

                   The accused pleaded guilty to
two charges of sexual assault and two charges of sexual interference involving
young female persons. On a motion by the Crown, consented to by defence
counsel, the trial judge ordered the exclusion of the public and the media from
those parts of the sentencing proceedings dealing with the specific acts
committed by the accused,  pursuant to s. 486(1)  of the Criminal Code . 
The order was sought on the basis of the nature of the evidence, which the
court had not yet heard and which purportedly established that the offence was
of a “very delicate” nature.  The exclusion order remained in effect
for approximately 20 minutes.  Afterwards, following a request by the CBC, the
trial judge gave reasons for making the exclusion order, stating that it had
been rendered in the interests of the “proper
administration of justice”; it would
avoid “undue hardship on the
persons involved, both the victims and the accused”.  The CBC challenged the constitutionality of
s. 486(1)  before the Court of Queen’s
Bench.  The court held that s. 486(1)  constituted an infringement on
the freedom of the press protected by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  but that  the infringement was justifiable
under s. 1  of the Charter .  The court also held that the  trial
judge had not exceeded his jurisdiction in making the exclusion order.  The
Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment.

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

(1) Constitutional law issue

 

                   The open court principle is one of the hallmarks of a democratic society,
fostering public confidence in the integrity of the court system and
understanding of the administration of justice.  This principle is inextricably
tied to the rights guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Charter . 
The freedom to express ideas and opinions about the operation of the courts and
the right of members of the public to obtain information about them are clearly
within the ambit of s. 2 (b).  As well, s. 2 (b) protects
the freedom of the press to gather and disseminate this information.  Members
of the public in general rely and depend on the media to inform them and, as a
vehicle through which information pertaining to courts is transmitted, the
press must be guaranteed access to the courts in order to gather information. 
Measures that prevent the media from gathering that information, and from
disseminating it to the public, restrict the freedom of the press guaranteed by
s. 2 (b).  To the extent that such measures prohibit public access
to the courts and to information about the courts, they may also be said to
restrict freedom of expression in so far as it encompasses the freedom of
listeners to obtain information that fosters public criticism of the courts. 
The recognition of the importance of public access to the courts as a
fundamental aspect of our democratic society should not be understood, however,
as affirming a right to be physically present in the courtroom; there may be a
shortage of space. Nor should it be seen as extending public access to all
venues within which the criminal law is administered.  By its facial purpose,
s. 486(1) of the Code restricts expressive activity, in particular
the free flow of ideas and information, in providing a discretionary bar on
public and media access to the courts.  This is sufficient to ground a violation
of s. 2 (b).

 

                   The exclusion of the public
under s. 486(1) of the Code is a means by which the court may
control the publicity of its proceedings with a view to protecting the innocent
and safeguarding privacy interests and thereby afford a remedy to the
underreporting of sexual offences.  This provision constitutes a reasonable
limit on the freedoms guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Charter . 
Section 486(1)  is aimed at preserving the general principle of openness in
criminal proceedings to the extent that openness is consistent with and
advances the proper administration of justice.  In situations where openness
conflicts with the proper administration of justice, s. 486(1)  purports to
further the proper administration of justice by permitting covertness where
necessary.  This objective is of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a
constitutional freedom.  Section 486(1)  is also proportionate to the legislative
objective.  First, the means adopted ‑‑ a discretionary power in
the trial judge to exclude the public where it is in the interests of the
proper administration of justice ‑‑ is rationally connected to the
objective.  The trial judge must exercise his discretion in conformity with the
Charter  and the grant of this judicial discretion necessarily ensures
that any order made under s. 486(1)  will serve the objective of furthering
the administration of justice.  If it is not rationally connected to the
objective, then the order will constitute an error of law.  Second,
s. 486(1) impairs the rights under s. 2 (b) as little as
reasonably possible in order to achieve the objective.  The discretion
conferred on trial judges by s. 486(1)  is not overbroad.  Section 486(1) 
provides an intelligible and workable standard ‑‑ the proper
administration of justice ‑‑ according to which the judiciary can
exercise the discretion conferred.   It also arms the judiciary with a useful
and flexible interpretative tool to accomplish its goal of preserving the
openness principle, subject to what is required by the proper administration of
justice. Again, since the discretion must be exercised in a manner that
conforms with the Charter , the discretionary aspect of s. 486(1) 
guarantees that the impairment is minimal.  An order that fails to impair
the rights at stake as little as possible will constitute an error.  Third, the
salutary effects of s. 486(1)  outweigh the deleterious effects. 
Parliament has attempted to balance the different interests affected by
s. 486(1)  by ensuring a degree of flexibility in the form of judicial discretion,
and by making openness the general rule and permitting exclusion of the public
only when public accessibility would not serve the proper administration of
justice.  The discretion necessarily requires that the trial judge weigh the
importance of the interests the order seeks to protect against the importance
of openness and specifically the particular expression that is limited.  In
this way, proportionality is guaranteed by the nature of the judicial
discretion.  In deciding whether to order exclusion of the public pursuant to
s. 486(1) , a trial judge should bear in mind whether the type of
expression that may be impaired by the order infringes upon the core values
sought to be protected.

 

(2) Criminal law issue

 

                   In applying s. 486(1) to
order the exclusion of the public, the trial judge must exercise his discretion
in conformity with the Charter .  He  must  (a) consider available
options and whether there are any other reasonable and effective alternatives
available; (b) consider whether the order is limited as much as possible;
and (c) weigh the importance of the objectives of the particular order and
its probable effects against the importance of openness and the particular
expression that will be limited in order to ensure that the positive and
negative effects of the order are proportionate.   Additionally, the burden of
displacing the general rule of openness lies on the party making the
application.  The applicant bears the burden of proving:  that the particular
order is necessary, in terms of relating to the proper administration of
justice; that the order is as limited as possible; and that the salutary
effects of the order are proportionate to its deleterious effects.  In relation
to the proportionality issue, if the order is sought to protect a
constitutional right, this must be considered.  There must also be a sufficient
evidentiary basis from which the trial judge may assess the application and
upon which he may exercise his discretion judicially.  In some cases in which
the facts are not in dispute the statement of counsel will suffice.  If there
is insufficient evidence placed before the trial judge, or there is a dispute
as to the relevant facts, the applicant should seek to have the evidence heard in
camera.

 

                   Since the trial judge
considering an application to exclude the public is usually in the best
position to assess the demands in a given situation, where the record discloses
facts that may support the trial judge’s exercise
of discretion, it should not lightly be interfered with.  In this case,
however, the trial judge erred in excluding the public from any part of the
proceedings.  There was insufficient evidence to support a concern for undue
hardship to the complainants or to the accused.  The order was unnecessary to
further the proper administration of justice and its deleterious effects were
not outweighed by its salutary effects.  The mere fact that the victims are
young females is not, in itself, sufficient to warrant exclusion.  The victims’ privacy was already protected by a publication
ban and there was no evidence that their privacy interests required more
protection.  While the criminal justice system must be ever vigilant in
protecting victims of sexual assault from further victimization, the record
before the trial judge did not establish that undue hardship would befall the
victims in the absence of a s. 486(1) order.   Nor did the record reveal
that there were any other reasons to justify an exception to the general rule
of openness.  Finally, barring exceptional cases, there is no issue of hardship
to the accused arising from prejudicial publicity once the accused has pleaded
guilty.

                   The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

 

1.         La
 Forest J. -- This appeal is brought
by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (“CBC”) from the judgment of the New Brunswick Court of
Appeal dismissing an appeal from a decision of Landry J. who had refused to
quash an order of Rice Prov. Ct. J. restricting public access to the
courtroom.  The order in question was made pursuant to s. 486(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which reads:

 

                   486. (1) Any proceedings against an accused shall be
held in open court, but where the presiding judge, provincial court judge or
justice, as the case may be, is of the opinion that it is in the interest of
public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper administration of justice
to exclude all or any members of the public from the court room for all or part
of the proceedings, he may so order.

 

The order mandated the exclusion of the public
and the media from the courtroom during part of the sentencing proceedings of
the respondent, Gerald Carson.  A pre-existing non-identification order, made
pursuant to s. 486(3) of the Code, was already in effect.  The CBC now
seeks a declaration that s. 486(1)  is of no force or effect as infringing s. 2 (b)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and cannot be justified
under s. 1  of the Charter .  In the alternative, if the provision is held
to be constitutionally valid, the CBC seeks a declaration that Rice Prov. Ct.
J. exceeded his jurisdiction in making the exclusion order.  If such a
declaration is made, it further seeks an order quashing the exclusion order and
a mandatory order granting access to the media and the public to a transcript
of the proceedings held in camera.

 

I.  Facts

 

2.         The facts are
straightforward.  The respondent, Gerald Carson, a prominent Moncton resident,
pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault, contrary to s. 271(1)(a)
of the Code, and two charges of sexual interference, contrary to s. 151
of the Code.  On motion by Crown counsel, consented to by defence
counsel, Rice Prov. Ct. J. ordered the exclusion of the public and the media,
with the exception of the accused, the victims, their immediate families and a
victim services coordinator, from those parts of the sentencing proceedings
dealing with the specific acts committed by Carson.  The exclusion order
remained in effect for approximately 20 minutes.  The order was sought on the
basis of the nature of the evidence, which the court had not yet heard, and
which purportedly established that the offence was of a “very delicate” nature.  Crown counsel further pointed to the fact that the case
involved young, female persons.

 

3.         André Veniot, a CBC
reporter, was excluded from the court along with the other members of the media
and the public.  Shortly after the public had been invited to reattend the
proceedings, a lawyer retained by Veniot was granted permission to address the
court.  She requested that Rice Prov. Ct. J. give reasons for making the
exclusion order.  In maintaining his order, Rice Prov. Ct. J. stated that it
had been rendered in the interests of the proper administration of justice; it
would avoid undue hardship to the victims and the accused.

 

II.  Judicial History

 

Court of Queen’s Bench (1993), 143 N.B.R. (2d) 174

 

4.         A constitutional
challenge to s. 486(1) of the Code was then made before the Court of
Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick on
the basis of s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  Landry J., who heard the
matter, held that since s. 486(1)  limits or prohibits the right of the public
and the press to gather and publish information in court proceedings in certain
instances, it constitutes an infringement on the freedom of the press protected
by s. 2 (b).

 

5.         Landry J. then
considered whether the infringement could be saved by s. 1  of the Charter 
as being reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society.  He found that s. 486(1)  addressed a pressing and substantial
objective since it was a mechanism to ensure the ""proper administration of
justice"" (p. 179).  He also determined that the infringement is
proportionate to that objective.  He stated:  “There exists a rational connection between the section and the
objective, the section impairs the freedom as little as possible and there is some
balance between the importance of the objective and the injurious effect of the
section” (p. 179).  He, therefore,
concluded that s. 486(1)  is saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

6.         In deciding whether the
trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction in ordering the exclusion of the
public, Landry J. noted that the test was not whether he would have excluded
the public in the same circumstances.  The proper administration of justice,
which Rice Prov. Ct. J. relied on, was an appropriate reason for the exercise of
his discretion in this case.  Landry J. further noted that the public and the
press were excluded for a short period of time only and as such he found no
injustice had been done to the parties involved in the proceedings.  Finally,
he stated (at pp. 181-82):

 

                   It
is important for the proper administration of justice to preserve the
discretion provided by s. 486(1)  and a Court of Appeal should not substitute
its judgment for that of a judge who felt compelled to exercise a discretion as
did the judge in the present case.  Although this is a borderline case I find
that the judge acted within his jurisdiction by excluding the public.  It
would, however, have been preferable if the judge had elaborated more on his
reasons for excluding the public and the press.

 

 

Court of Appeal (1994), 148 N.B.R. (2d) 161

 

                   Hoyt C.J.N.B. (for the
majority)

 

7.         In the Court of Appeal,
Hoyt C.J.N.B. (speaking for himself and Turnbull J.A.) expressed the view that
freedom of expression, as protected by s. 2 (b) of the Charter , includes
the right of the media, as well as any member of the public, to attend criminal
trials.  He agreed with Landry J.'s finding that s. 486(1)  limits freedom of
expression and is, therefore, contrary to s. 2 (b), but he also agreed
that the provision could be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  The case, he
found,  illustrates why s. 486(1)  can be justified; the failure to have made
the order would likely have resulted in the further victimization of the
complainants, by permitting details of the offences to be published and the
possible identification of the complainants.  And this was so notwithstanding
that a non-publication order was already in effect.

 

8.         As to the particular
exercise of discretion by Rice Prov. Ct. J., he agreed with Landry J. that it
was not for him to say whether he would have exercised the discretion in the
same fashion.  He found it was Rice Prov. Ct. J.’s belief that the young complainants in this case deserved protection. 
That being so, he concluded:  “For this
reason alone, I cannot say that he was wrong in making the order, even though,
in my view, he may have taken an irrelevant factor into consideration, namely,
the protection of the accused from undue hardship” (p. 169).  He did not rule out the protection of the accused as a factor
in other cases; however, he concluded that Rice Prov. Ct. J.’s  other reasons were sufficient.

 

                   Angers J.A.

 

9.         Angers J.A. concurred,
but for different reasons.  He first observed that most of the issues raised by
the appellant were moot since the trial was over and the sentence had been
imposed.  He further noted that it would be wrong for a non-party to the
proceedings to succeed in having an interlocutory order quashed or altered when
the parties themselves could not appeal.  He next discussed the right to a
public trial as a means of protecting the accused.  The right was prescribed in
s. 486(1) of the Code and guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter . 
He noted, however, that there was no express right in any legislation,
including the Charter , giving the public access to trials; rather, in
criminal law the right of the public to be present in court is merely a
corollary of the right of the accused to a public trial.  As such, it is a
subordinate to, and cannot prevail over the principal right.  In his view, s.
486(1)  provides the necessary guidelines to permit the presiding judge to
exercise his or her discretion in a judicial manner.  Given the respondent Carson’s consent to the order, he found that a possible
infringement of the respondent’s s. 11 (d)
right did not arise.

 

10.       Angers J.A. stated that
he could not accept that s. 2 (b) of the Charter  gives the media
better access to court proceedings than members of the public.  He added (at p.
174):

 

                   The
principle of a public trial goes beyond a particular accused and must be
approached while keeping in mind the reasons that led to the right:  that no
person be convicted of a criminal offence behind closed doors or on secret and
unknown evidence.  It is the duty of all those involved in the administration
of the criminal justice system to see that the principle is upheld.  While the
public, through the Attorney General, is involved in the administration of
criminal justice, the media per se is not.  Its interests are different.  Its
duty is to inform, its temptation to entertain.  It was given and it should
have the constitutional freedom to perform its duty to inform, but the
gathering of information involves different considerations such as individual
privacy, defamation, due process of law, fair trial. . . .

 

11.       Angers J.A. concluded
that s. 486(1)  involves a balancing between the constitutional rights of an
accused to a public trial and the protection of a certain class of witnesses or
potential witnesses.  It had nothing to do with, and does not infringe on any
freedom of the press to publish what is legally permissible.  The argument of
the media that freedom to publish necessarily includes freedom to gather
information was, in his view, really “misleading
and fallacious” (p. 175).

 

III.  Issues

 

12.       The CBC then sought and was granted leave to appeal to this
Court.  Two major issues arise in this appeal.  The first relates
to the constitutionality of s. 486(1) of the Code and is conveniently
set forth in the constitutional questions stated by the Chief Justice on September 18, 1995:

 

1. Does s.
486(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , limit the freedom of
expression of the press in whole or in part as guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2. If so, is
the limit one that can be justified in accordance with s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

The second issue is whether Rice Prov. Ct. J.
exceeded his jurisdiction in making the order excluding members of the media
and the public from a part of the sentencing proceedings, thereby committing
reversible error.

 

13.       Before turning to these issues, I propose to address some
preliminary matters raised by the interveners.  The first of these matters,
brought to our attention by the Attorney General for Ontario, relates to the
sequence in which the Court should deal with the issues.  He argued that the
constitutionality of the provision should not be considered until it has been
determined whether Rice Prov. Ct. J. properly exercised his discretion.  If he
did not, then he acted without jurisdiction, and the constitutional question
need not, and should not, be considered.  Such an approach may certainly be
appropriate in some situations, but in the present case, I am disposed to deal with
the constitutional question with a view to providing guidance to courts faced
with the issue in the future.

 

14.       A second preliminary matter, raised by the Attorney General of
Canada, concerns the appropriate scope of constitutional review to be
undertaken in relation to s. 486(1).  Rice Prov. Ct. J. granted the order of
exclusion solely on the basis of the “proper
administration of justice”.  The
Attorney General of Canada contends that the Court should not go beyond the
circumstances of this case and review the constitutionality on each of the
three grounds for exclusion set forth in s. 486(1).

 

15.       This Court has in the
past exhibited a reluctance to consider the constitutionality of legislative
provisions in the absence of a proper factual foundation; see Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086.  To accede to the appellant’s contention that the other grounds be
constitutionally reviewed would require us to conduct such review in the
absence of a factual framework, contrary to this Court’s practice. Moreover, it would be dangerous to
make a determination of the constitutionality of the other two grounds for
exclusion under s. 486(1) by extrapolation from the constitutional review of
the proper administration of justice ground; the values and interests invoked
may differ depending upon the specific legislative context.  It is best, then,
to leave to another day the constitutionality of the other two statutory
grounds for exclusion, and to focus solely on the ground relied upon by Rice
Prov. Ct. J., i.e., the proper administration of justice.

 

16.       I come then to an
analysis of the major issues, beginning with the constitutional issue.

 

IV. The Constitutional Issue

 

A.  Section 2(b) of the Charter

 

17.       This appeal engages two essential issues in relation to s.
2(b).  The first is integrally linked to the concept of representative
democracy and the corresponding importance of public scrutiny of the criminal
courts.  It involves the scope of public entitlement to have access to these
courts and to obtain information pertaining to court proceedings.  Any such
entitlement raises the further question:  the extent to which protection is
afforded to listeners in addition to speakers by freedom of expression.  The
second issue relates to the first, in so far as it recognizes that not all
members of the public have the opportunity to attend court proceedings and
will, therefore, rely on the media to inform them.  Thus, the second issue is
whether freedom of the press protects the gathering and dissemination of
information about the courts by members of the media.  In particular, it
involves recognition of the integral role played by the media in the process of
informing the public.  Both of these issues invoke the democratic function of
public criticism of the courts, which depends upon an informed public; in turn,
both relate to the principle of openness of the criminal courts.

 

18.       The freedom of
individuals to discuss information about the institutions of government, their
policies and practices, is crucial to any notion of democratic rule.  The
liberty to criticize and express dissentient views has long been thought to be
a safeguard against state tyranny and corruption.  James Mill put it this way:

 

                   So
true it is, however, that the discontent of the people is the only means of
removing the defects of vicious governments, that the freedom of the press, the
main instrument of creating discontent, is, in all civilized countries, among
all but the advocates of misgovernment, regarded as an indispensable security,
and the greatest safeguard of the interests of mankind.

 

                   (“Liberty of the Press”, in Essays on Government, Jurisprudence,
Liberty of the Press, and Law of Nations (1825 (reprint ed. 1967)), at p.
18.)

 

19.       This Court has had occasion to discuss the freedom to
criticize encompassed in freedom of expression and its relation to the
democratic process in Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General),
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, where Cory J. stated that it is difficult to think of a
guaranteed right more important to a democratic society than freedom of
expression.  At page 1336, he declared:

 

                   Indeed
a democracy cannot exist without that freedom to express new ideas and to put
forward opinions about the functioning of public institutions.  The concept of
free and uninhibited speech permeates all truly democratic societies and
institutions.  The vital importance of the concept cannot be over-emphasized.

 

20.       It cannot
be disputed that the courts, and particularly the criminal courts, play a
critical role in any democracy.  It is in this forum that the rights of the
powerful state are tested against those of the individual.  As noted by Cory J.
in Edmonton Journal, courts represent the forum for the resolution of
disputes between the citizens and the state, and so must be open to public
scrutiny and to public criticism of their operations.

 

21.       The concept of open
courts is deeply embedded in the common law tradition.  The principle was
described in the early English case of Scott v. Scott, [1913] A.C. 419
(H.L.).  A passage from the reasons given by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline is worthy
of reproduction for its precise articulation of what underlies the principle. 
He stated at p. 477:

 

                   It
moves Bentham over and over again.  “In the
darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full
swing.  Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks
applicable to judicial injustice operate.  Where there is no publicity there is
no justice.”  “Publicity is the very soul of justice.  It is the
keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity.  It
keeps the judge himself while trying under trial.”  “The security of securities
is publicity.”  But
amongst historians the grave and enlightened verdict of Hallam, in which he
ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of
Parliament as a guarantee of public security, is not likely to be forgotten:  “Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct
guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly
interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament,
without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. 
Of these, the first is by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of
any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom, where this condition is not
found both in its judicial institutions and in their constant exercise.”

 

22.       The
importance of ensuring that justice be done openly has not only survived:  it
has now become “one of the
hallmarks of a democratic society”; see Re
Southam Inc. and The Queen (No.1) (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 113 (C.A.), at p. 119.  The open court principle, seen as “the very
soul of justice” and the “security of securities”, acts as a guarantee that justice is
administered in a non-arbitrary manner, according to the rule of law.  In Attorney
General of Nova Scotia v. MacIntyre, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 175, openness was held
to be the rule, covertness the exception, thereby fostering public confidence
in the integrity of the court system and understanding of the administration of
justice.

 

23.       The principle of open
courts is inextricably tied to the rights guaranteed by s. 2(b).  Openness
permits public access to information about the courts, which in turn permits
the public to discuss and put forward opinions and criticisms of court
practices and proceedings.  While the freedom to express ideas and opinions
about the operation of the courts is clearly within the ambit of the freedom
guaranteed by s. 2(b), so too is the right of members of the public to obtain
information about the courts in the first place.  Cory J. in Edmonton
Journal described the equally important aspect of freedom of expression
that protects listeners as well as speakers and ensures that this right to
information about the courts is real and not illusory.  At pages 1339-40, he
states:

 

                   That
is to say as listeners and readers, members of the public have a right to
information pertaining to public institutions and particularly the courts. 
Here the press plays a fundamentally important role.  It is exceedingly
difficult for many, if not most, people to attend a court trial.  Neither
working couples nor mothers or fathers house-bound with young children, would
find it possible to attend court.  Those who cannot attend rely in large
measure upon the press to inform them about court proceedings -- the nature of
the evidence that was called, the arguments presented, the comments made by the
trial judge -- in order to know not only what rights they may have, but how
their problems might be dealt with in court.  It is only through the press
that most individuals can really learn of what is transpiring in the courts. 
They as “listeners” or readers have a right to receive this
information.  Only then can they make an assessment of the institution.  Discussion
of court cases and constructive criticism of court proceedings is dependent
upon the receipt by the public of information as to what transpired in court. 
Practically speaking, this information can only be obtained from the newspapers
or other media.  [Emphasis added.]

 

That the right of the public to information
relating to court proceedings, and the corollary right to put forward opinions
pertaining to the courts, depend on the freedom of the press to transmit this
information is fundamental to an understanding of the importance of that
freedom.  The full and fair discussion of public institutions, which is vital
to any democracy, is the raison d’être of the s. 2(b)
guarantees.  Debate in the public domain is predicated on an informed public,
which is in turn reliant upon a free and vigorous press. The public’s entitlement to be informed imposes on the media
the responsibility to inform fairly and accurately.  This responsibility is
especially grave given that the freedom of the press is, and must be, largely
unfettered. The significance of the freedom and its attendant responsibility
lead me to the second issue relating to s. 2(b).

 

24.       Essential
to the freedom of the press to provide information to the public is the ability
of the press to have access to this information.  In Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. v. Lessard, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 421, I noted that freedom of the press not
only encompassed the right to transmit news and other information, but also the
right to gather this information.  At pp. 429-30, I stated:

 

                   There can be no doubt, of course, that it
comprises the right to disseminate news, information and beliefs.  This was the
manner in which the right was originally expressed, in the first draft of s.
2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  before its expansion to its
present form.  However, the freedom to disseminate information would be of
little value if the freedom under s. 2 (b) did not also encompass the right to
gather news and other information without undue governmental interference. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

25.       It is by
ensuring the press access to the courts that it is enabled to comment on court
proceedings and thus inform the public of what is transpiring in the courts. 
To this end, Cory J. stated in Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 459, at p. 475:

 

                   The media have a vitally important role to play
in a democratic society.  It is the media that, by gathering and disseminating
news, enable members of our society to make an informed assessment of the
issues which may significantly affect their lives and well-being.

 

26.       From the
foregoing, it is evident that s. 2 (b) protects the freedom of the press to
comment on the courts as an essential aspect of our democratic society.  It
thereby guarantees the further freedom of members of the public to develop and
to put forward informed opinions about the courts.  As a vehicle through which
information pertaining to these courts is transmitted, the press must be
guaranteed access to the courts in order to gather information.  As noted by
Lamer J., as he then was, in Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney
General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 129:  “Freedom of the press is indeed an important and essential attribute of
a free and democratic society, and measures which prohibit the media from
publishing information deemed of interest obviously restrict that freedom.”  Similarly, it may be said that measures that
prevent the media from gathering that information, and from disseminating it to
the public, restrict the freedom of the press.  To the extent that such
measures prohibit public access to the courts and to information about the
courts, they may also be said to restrict freedom of expression in so far as it
encompasses the freedom of listeners to obtain information that fosters public
criticism of the courts.

 

27.       At this point, however, I
should like to make a number of caveats to the recognition of the importance of
public access to the courts as a fundamental aspect of our democratic society. 
First of all, this recognition is not to be confused with, nor do I wish to be
understood as affirming a right to be physically present in the courtroom. 
Circumstances may produce a shortage of physical space, such that individual
members of the media and the public may be denied physical access to the
courts.  In such circumstances, those excluded may have to rely on those
present to relay information about the proceedings.

 

28.       To this I
would add a further caveat. I do not accept that the necessary consequence of
recognizing the importance of public access to the courts is the recognition of
public access to all facets of public institutions.  The intervener, Attorney
General for Saskatchewan argues that if an open court system is to be protected
under s. 2 (b) of the Charter  on the basis that the public has an
entitlement to information about proceedings in the criminal courts, then all
venues within which the criminal law is administered will have to be accessible
to the public, including jury rooms, a trial judge’s chambers and the conference rooms of appellate
courts.  The fallacy with this argument is that it ignores the fundamental
distinction between the criminal courts, the subject of this appeal, and the
other venues mentioned by the intervener.  Courts are and have, since time
immemorial, been public arenas.  The same cannot be said of these other
venues.  Thus, to argue that constitutional protection should be extended to
public access to these private places, on the basis that public access to the
courts is constitutionally protected, is untenable.

 

29.       Furthermore, this Court
has noted on previous occasions that public access to certain judicial
processes would render the administration of justice unworkable; see MacIntyre,
supra.  The importance of ensuring that the administration of justice is
not rendered unworkable provides a palpable reason for prohibiting public
access to many of the other types of processes of which the intervener makes
mention.  Indeed, as we have seen in this case, the open court principle itself
must yield to circumstances that would render the proper administration of
justice unworkable.

 

B.  Does Section 486(1) of the Criminal Code
Infringe Section 2(b)?

 

30.                          At
common law, the rule of public access to the courts was subject to certain
exceptions, primarily where it was deemed necessary for the administration of
justice.  In Scott, supra, Earl Loreburn, at pp. 445-46,
described the basis for exclusion of the public from the courts in these terms:

 

                   Again,
the Court may be closed or cleared if such a precaution is necessary for the
administration of justice.  Tumult or disorder, or the just apprehension of it,
would certainly justify the exclusion of all from whom such interruption is
expected, and, if discrimination is impracticable, the exclusion of the public
in general.  Or witnesses may be ordered to withdraw, lest they trim their evidence
by hearing the evidence of others.

 

31.       The common
law is effectively reflected in the current Canadian statutory form of the
rule, s. 486(1) of the Code, which begins with “[a]ny proceedings against an accused shall be
held in open court”, thereby
preserving and giving statutory effect to the general rule of openness.  It
then vests in a trial judge the discretion to make an exclusionary order for,
among other reasons, the furtherance of the proper administration of justice.

 

32.       The
appellant submits that s. 486(1) infringes s. 2 (b) of the Charter . 
Having said that s. 2 (b) protects the freedom of the press to gather and
disseminate information relating to court proceedings, and protects the freedom
of the public to comment upon our criminal courts as an essential attribute of
our democratic society, a provision that excludes the public and the media from
the courtroom must infringe s. 2 (b).

 

33.       By its
facial purpose, s. 486(1) restricts expressive activity, in particular the free
flow of ideas and information, in providing a discretionary bar on public and
media access to the courts.  This is sufficient to ground a violation; any
provision that has as its purpose the restriction of expression will
necessarily violate s. 2 (b); see Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General),
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at p. 974.

 

34.       Admittedly,
s. 486(1) only permits such restriction on freedom of expression and freedom of
the press where values of superordinate importance so require.  To this end,
the respondents argue that s. 486(1) supports, as opposed to violates, the
values of the Charter , in that it permits the courts to maintain control
over their own processes, as well as advancing core values including the
protection of victims and witnesses, privacy interests and inherent limitations
on freedom of expression such as public order and decency.  In answer to the respondents’
submissions, however, it is to be noted that this Court has repeatedly favoured
a balancing of competing interests at the s. 1  stage of analysis. 
Specifically, Dickson C.J. stated in R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
697, that “s. 1  of the Charter  is
especially well suited to the task of balancing” and found that freedom of expression jurisprudence supported that
view.  He continued, at p. 734:

 

                   It
is, in my opinion, inappropriate to attenuate the s. 2 (b) freedom on the
grounds that a particular context requires such; the large and liberal
interpretation given the freedom of expression in Irwin Toy indicates that the
preferable course is to weigh the various contextual values and factors in s.
1 .  [Emphasis in original.]

 

35.       This
approach was again adopted in the recent case of Ross v. New Brunswick
School District No. 15, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825, where the broad, purposive
interpretation to be favoured in relation to s. 2 (b) is discussed.  At para.
75, it is stated that “[t]he
important thing is that the competing values of a free and democratic society
have to be adequately weighed in the appropriate context.”  Thus, I conclude that s. 486(1) of the Code infringes
s. 2 (b) of the Charter  and leave to s. 1  an assessment of the competing
interests and factors tending to justify restrictions on the guaranteed
freedom.

 

C.  Section 1 Analysis

 

36.       I turn now
to an examination of whether s. 486(1) is reasonable and demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter 
following the analytical framework developed by this Court in R. v. Oakes,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 103.  But in undertaking this task, it must be remembered, a
formalistic approach must be avoided.  Regard must be had to all
circumstances.  The Court thus described the proper approach to be taken in Ross,
supra, at para. 78:

 

                   . .
. the Oakes test should be applied flexibly, so as to achieve a proper
balance between individual rights and community needs.  In undertaking this
task, courts must take into account both the nature of the infringed right and
the specific values the state relies on to justify the infringement.  This
involves a close attention to context.  McLachlin J.  in RJR-MacDonald,
supra, reiterated her statement in Rocket v. Royal College of Dental
Surgeons of Ontario, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 232, at pp. 246-47, that conflicting
values must be placed in their factual and social context when undertaking a s.
1  analysis.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Having affirmed the flexible and contextual
approach to be taken, it is apposite to examine the context within which this
appeal arises in light of the specific values engaged.

 

37.       The first
such value is the power vested in courts of criminal jurisdiction to control
their own process in furtherance of the rule of law.  This was recognized in United
Nurses of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901, where
McLachlin J. noted that “[t]he rule
of law is directly dependent on the ability of the courts to enforce their
process and maintain their dignity and respect” (p. 931).  Similarly, in  B.C.G.E.U. v. British Columbia (Attorney
General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214, this Court referred to the English decision
of Morris v. Crown Office, [1970] 1 All E.R. 1079 (C.A.), where, at p. 1081, it was said:

 

                   The
course of justice must not be deflected or interfered with.  Those who strike
at it strike at the very foundations of our society.  To maintain law and
order, the judges have, and must have, power at once to deal with those who
offend against it.

 

In B.C.G.E.U., supra, Dickson C.J.
affirmed the power of courts to act in furtherance of the proper administration
of justice.  While said in the context of discussing contempt of court, the
principle of permitting a court to control its own process may be said to
extend to situations, such as the one at bar, where the court is granted a
discretion to act in the interests of the proper administration of justice to
exclude the public from criminal proceedings.

 

38.       Related to
a court’s power to control its own
process is the power to regulate the publicity associated with its
proceedings.  As such, it has been held that a legislative provision mandating
a publication ban upon request by the complainant or prosecutor in sexual
assault cases is constitutional; see Canadian Newspapers, supra. This
Court has also recognized a common law discretion on the part of  courts to
order a publication ban; see Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 835.

 

39.       The court’s power to regulate the publicity of its
proceedings serves, among other things, to protect privacy interests,
especially those of witnesses and victims.  In MacIntyre, supra, Dickson
J., as he then was, noted that “[m]any times
it has been urged that the ‘privacy’ of litigants requires that the public be
excluded from court proceedings” (p. 185)
and in the course of weighing this interest against the interest of public
access to court proceedings held that the protection of the innocent from
unnecessary harm “is a valid
and important policy consideration” (p. 187). 
Stating that the “curtailment
of public accessibility can only be justified where there is present the need
to protect social values of superordinate importance” (pp. 186-87), he identified the protection of
the innocent as among these values.

 

40.       While the
social interest in protecting privacy is long standing, its importance has only
recently been recognized by Canadian courts.  Privacy does not appear to have
been a significant factor in the earlier cases which established the strong
presumption in favour of open courts.  That approach has generally continued to
this day, and this appears inherent to the nature of a criminal trial.  It must
be remembered that a criminal trial often involves the production of highly
offensive evidence, whether salacious, violent or grotesque.  Its aim is to
uncover the truth, not to provide a sanitized account of facts that will be
palatable to even the most sensitive of human spirits.  The criminal court is
an innately tough arena.

 

41.       Bearing
this in mind, mere offence or embarrassment will not likely suffice for the
exclusion of the public from the courtroom.  As noted by M. D. Lepofsky in Open
Justice:  The Constitutional Right to Attend and Speak About Criminal
Proceedings (1985), at p. 35:  “Proceedings
cannot be closed only because the subject of the charges relates to purportedly
morality-tinged topics such as sex.”  In the
course of the balancing exercise under s. 1 , the exigencies and realities of
criminal proceedings must be weighed in the analysis.

 

42.       Nonetheless,
the right to privacy is beginning to be seen as more significant.  Thus Cory J.
in Edmonton Journal, supra, considered that the protection accorded the
privacy of individuals in a legislative enactment related to a pressing and
substantial concern and underlined its importance in Canadian law.  In this
area of the law, however, privacy interests are more likely to be protected
where it affects some other social interest or where failure to protect it will
cause significant harm to the victim or to witnesses.  This is particularly so
of sexual assault cases.  As L’Heureux-Dubé
J. recently put it in R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, a case involving the
production of complainants’ medical
records in relation to charges of sexual offences (at para. 158):

 

                   This
Court has already recognized that society has a legitimate interest in
encouraging the reporting of sexual assault and that this social interest is
furthered by protecting the privacy of complainants:  [R. v. Seaboyer,
[1991] 2 S.C.R. 577], at pp. 605-6.  Parliament, too, has recognized this
important interest in s. 276(3) (b) of the Criminal Code .

 

Similar views had earlier been expressed by Lamer
J., in Canadian Newspapers, supra; see also L’Heureux-Dubé J. in R. v. L. (D.O.), [1993]
4 S.C.R. 419, at pp. 441-42.

 

43.       So far as
s. 486(1) of the Code is concerned, then, exclusion of the public is a
means by which the court may control the publicity of its proceedings with a
view to protecting the innocent and safeguarding privacy interests and thereby
afford a remedy to the underreporting of sexual offences.

 

44.       Having set forth the
relevant context, the s. 1  analysis developed in Oakes, supra, may now
be undertaken.  This approach requires two things to be established:  the
impugned state action must have an objective of pressing and substantial
concern in a free and democratic society; and there must be proportionality
between the objective and the impugned measure.

 

                   (1)  Legislative Objective

 

45.       To
constitute a justifiable limit on a right or freedom, Oakes tells us,
the objective of the impugned legislation must advance concerns that are
pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society.  The appellant CBC
maintains that the legislative objective of s. 486(1) is “to allow the exclusion of the public in criminal
proceedings if it is in the interests of:  (1) the safeguard of public morals;
(2) the maintenance of order; or (3) the proper administration of justice”.  I have already indicated my intention to
confine this appeal to consideration of the third branch for exclusion, the “proper administration of justice”.  As to this branch, the CBC concedes its
pressing and substantial nature, but notes its imprecision.

 

46.       I would
characterize the objective somewhat differently. Section 486(1) aims at
preserving the general principle of openness in criminal proceedings to the
extent that openness is consistent with and advances the proper administration
of justice.  There are situations where openness conflicts with the proper
administration of justice.  The provision purports to further the proper
administration of justice by permitting covertness where necessary.  This
recharacterization of the objective leaves intact that which the appellant
conceded was of a pressing and substantial nature:  the exclusion of the public
from criminal proceedings in three specific cases.  In light of the appellant’s concession, I do not intend to say more than
that this objective clearly passes the first step of the s. 1  analysis.

 

47.       The second
step, or the proportionality inquiry, is broken down into three further
requirements that must be established, namely:  the legislative measure must be
rationally connected to the objective; it must impair the guaranteed right or
freedom as little as possible; and there must be proportionality between the
deleterious effects of the measures and their salutary effects; see RJR-MacDonald
Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 60.

 

                   (2)  Proportionality

 

                   (a)  Rational Connection

 

48.       In an
attempt to discern whether the legislative means are rationally connected to
the legislative objective, McLachlin J., in RJR-MacDonald, supra,  at
para. 154, noted that in some cases, the relationship between the infringement
of the rights and the benefit sought to be achieved may not be “scientifically measurable”.  In such cases, she continued, “this Court has been prepared to find a causal
connection between the infringement and benefit sought on the basis of reason
or logic, without insisting on direct proof of a relationship between the
infringing measure and the legislative objective”.  It was also my view in RJR-MacDonald, supra, that a
common-sense analysis was sufficient to satisfy the rational connection
branch.  In the present case, where the benefit sought to be realized by the
operation of s. 486(1) is the furtherance of the administration of justice, the
benefit is not scientifically measurable; nor is the relationship between the
benefit and the infringement.  As such, it is appropriate to proceed under the
rational connection inquiry on the basis of logic and reason.

 

49.       Whether s.
486(1) is rationally connected to the legislative objective requires a
determination of whether the particular legislative means adopted -- a
discretionary power in the trial judge to exclude the public where it is in the
interests of the proper administration of justice -- serves the legislative
objective.

 

50.       The
discretionary element of s. 486(1) is crucial to the analysis.  In this
respect, the Court has held discretion to be an essential feature of the
criminal justice system.  As was noted  in R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
387, at p. 410, a “system that
attempted to eliminate discretion would be unworkably complex and rigid”.  In some cases, the Criminal Code 
provides no guidelines for the exercise of discretion, and yet, as was stated
in Beare, supra, “[t]he day to
day operation of law enforcement and the criminal justice system nonetheless
depends upon the exercise of that discretion” (p. 411).

 

51.       In Dagenais,
supra, Lamer C.J. discussed the common law discretion to order a publication
ban and held that a discretionary power cannot confer the power to infringe the
Charter .  The discretion must be exercised within boundaries set by the Charter ;
an exercise of discretion exceeding these boundaries would result in reversible
error.  The Chief  Justice further held that a publication ban should only be
ordered when two things are established:  (1) that the ban is necessary to
prevent a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial, because
reasonably available alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and (2)
that the salutary effects of the ban outweigh the deleterious effects to the
free expression of those affected by it.  This standard, he noted, “clearly reflects the substance of the Oakes
test applicable when assessing legislation under s. 1  of the Charter ” (p. 878).  Accordingly when a judge orders a ban
that contravenes this standard, the judge commits an error of law, and the
order is reviewable on that basis.

 

52.       In applying
s. 486(1), then, a court must exercise its discretion in conformity with the Charter . 
In this way, the judicial discretion guarantees that any order made pursuant to
s. 486(1)  will be rationally connected to the legislative objective of
furthering the proper administration of justice.  Once we accept the importance
of discretion as an integral aspect of our criminal justice system, then the
case for discretion in the hands of the courts is perhaps the strongest.  In R.
v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, Gonthier J.
discussed the need for limitations on law enforcement discretion.  This need is
met where the discretion is vested in the courts, because the exercise of
discretion is reviewable.

 

53.       Thus, the
grant of judicial discretion in s. 486(1) necessarily ensures that any order
made will be rationally connected to the legislative objective.  If it is not,
then the order will constitute an error of law; the proper course in such a
case is to review the particular exercise of discretion and provide an
appropriate remedy. Section 486(1) sets up a means, logically connected to the
legislative objective of furthering the proper administration of justice, which
permits a court to order the exclusion of the public where an open court would
impede this objective.

 

54.       The
appellant contends that vesting in inferior courts the discretion to make a s.
486(1) order on the ground of the proper administration of justice is to
provide insufficient guidance to courts in the exercise of their discretion. 
This contention is essentially an allegation that the legislation is vague or
overbroad.  I find it more appropriate to deal with the vagueness argument
under the minimum impairment branch of the analysis.  It is to this that I now
turn.

 

                   (b)  Minimal Impairment 

 

55.       In
examining whether s. 486(1) impairs the rights under s. 2 (b) as little as
reasonably possible in order to achieve its objective, I begin by referring to
McLachlin J.’s articulation of this
requirement in RJR-MacDonald, supra, at para. 160:  “The impairment must be ‘minimal’, that is,
the law must be carefully tailored so that rights are impaired no more than
necessary.”  However, she qualified
this somewhat by noting that the tailoring process will rarely admit of
perfection and thus, if the law “falls within
a range of reasonable alternatives, the courts will not find it overbroad
merely because they can conceive of an alternative which might better tailor
objective to infringement”.

 

56.       I have
noted the appellant’s submission
that the discretion conferred on trial judges by s. 486(1), to exclude the
public from the courts in the interests of the proper administration of
justice, is vague.  In Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1991] 2
S.C.R. 69, Sopinka J. discussed the concept of vagueness and the ways in which
it could arise (at pp. 94-95):

 

                   Vagueness can have constitutional significance in
at least two ways in a s. 1  analysis.  A law may be so uncertain as to be
incapable of being interpreted so as to constitute any restraint on
governmental power.  The uncertainty may arise either from the generality of
the discretion conferred on the donee of the power or from the use of language
that is so obscure as to be incapable of interpretation with any degree of
precision using the ordinary tools.  In these circumstances, there is no “limit prescribed by law” and no s. 1  analysis is necessary as the
threshold requirement for its application is not met.  The second way in which
vagueness can play a constitutional role is in the analysis of s. 1 .  A law
which passes the threshold test may, nevertheless, by reason of its
imprecision, not qualify as a reasonable limit.  Generality and imprecision of
language may fail to confine the invasion of a Charter  right within reasonable
limits.  In this sense vagueness is an aspect of overbreadth.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

57.       Allegations
of overbreadth, of which allegations of vagueness are said to be an aspect, 
are more appropriately dealt with in relation to minimal impairment; see Osborne,
supra, at p. 95.  In the present case, the appellant’s submission as to vagueness relates more to
imprecision and generality, than to an allegation that s. 486(1) is incapable
of interpretation with any degree of precision and thus not a limit prescribed
by law.  (I note that Gonthier J. writing in Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical
Society, supra, preferred to reserve the term “vagueness” for the
most serious degree of vagueness where the law  could not be said to constitute
a “limit prescribed by law” and to use overbreadth for the other aspect of
vagueness.  My use of “vagueness” in this case should be construed as meaning “overbreadth”.)

 

58.       In Osborne,
Sopinka J. discussed vagueness in relation to the granting of wide
discretionary powers and held that “[m]uch of
the activity of government is carried on under the aegis of laws which of
necessity leave a broad discretion to government officials” (p. 95).  He then cited a passage from Irwin
Toy, supra, at p. 983, in which this Court held that the law is rarely an
exercise in absolute precision and that the question is whether there is an
intelligible standard to guide the judiciary in doing its work.

 

59.       Section
486(1) provides an intelligible standard -- the proper administration of
justice -- according to which the judiciary can exercise the discretion
conferred.  The phrase “administration
of justice” appears throughout
legislation in Canada, including the Charter .  Thus, “proper administration of justice”, which of necessity has been the subject of
judicial interpretation, provides the judiciary with a workable standard.

 

60.       Section
486(1) arms the judiciary with a useful and flexible interpretative tool to
accomplish its goal of preserving the openness principle, subject to what is
required by the proper administration of justice, and the discretionary aspect
of s. 486(1) guarantees that the impairment is minimal.  Again relying upon the
fact that the discretion must be exercised in a manner that conforms with the Charter ,
the discretion bestowed upon the court by s. 486(1)  ensures that a particular
exclusionary order accomplishes just what is necessary to advance the interests
of the proper administration of justice and no more.  An order may be made to
exclude certain members of the public, from part or all of the proceedings, and
for specific periods of time.  As such, an order that fails to impair the
rights at stake as little as possible will constitute an error.  This is
exemplified by R. v. Brint (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 560 (Alta. S.C., App.
Div.), where a new trial was ordered when it was found that a trial judge had
ordered the entire trial to be held in camera when the facts established that
the proper administration of justice only required the complainant’s evidence to be taken in camera.  The case
illustrates that the public should only be excluded from the part of the
proceedings where public access would offend against the proper administration
of justice.

 

61.       The order
should be limited as much as possible.  In Dagenais, supra, Lamer C.J.
stated that a publication ban should only be ordered where it is necessary, and
where reasonably available alternatives would not accomplish the same result. 
The same is true of the discretion accorded by s. 486(1) of the Code.

 

                   (c)  Proportional Effects

 

62.       The “proportional effects” stage of the analysis requires a consideration
of whether the deleterious effects of s. 486(1) outweigh the salutary effects
of excluding the public from the courts where it is required by the proper
administration of justice.  Parliament has attempted to balance the different
interests affected by s. 486(1) by ensuring a degree of flexibility in the form
of judicial discretion, and by making openness the general rule and permitting
exclusion of the public only when public accessibility would not serve the
proper administration of justice.  The discretion necessarily requires that the
trial judge weigh the importance of the interests the order seeks to protect
against the importance of openness and specifically the particular expression
that is limited.  In this way, proportionality is guaranteed by the nature of
the judicial discretion.

 

63.       It is important to stress
that the particular expression that is limited in a given case may impact upon
the s. 1  balancing.  In RJR-MacDonald, supra, I noted that the
evidentiary requirements of s. 1  analysis will vary substantially with the
nature of the right infringed.  In the case of freedom of expression, this
Court has consistently held that the level of constitutional protection to
which expression will be entitled varies with the nature of the expression. 
More specifically, the protection afforded freedom of expression is related to
the relationship between the expression and the fundamental values this Court
has identified as being the “core” values underlying s. 2 (b).  I put the matter
this way in RJR-MacDonald, at para. 72:

 

                   Although
freedom of expression is undoubtedly a fundamental value, there are other
fundamental values that are also deserving of protection and consideration by
the courts.  When these values come into conflict, as they often do, it is
necessary for the courts to make choices based not upon an abstract, platonic
analysis, but upon a concrete weighing of the relative significance of each of
the relevant values in our community in the specific context.  This the
Court has done by weighing freedom of expression claims in light of their
relative connection to a set of even more fundamental values.  In Keegstra,
supra, at pp. 762-63, Dickson C.J. identified these fundamental or “core” values as
including the search for political, artistic and scientific truth, the
protection of individual autonomy and self-development, and the promotion of
public participation in the democratic process.  [Emphasis added.]

 

This Court has subjected state action that
jeopardizes these “core” values to a “searching degree of scrutiny”.  Where, on
the other hand, the expression in question lies far from the “centre core of the spirit” of s. 2 (b), state action restricting such
expression is less difficult to justify.

 

64.       In the case
of s. 486(1), the type of expression impaired will vary from case to case. 
This makes it difficult to consider the extent to which the expression
restricted by s. 486(1) relates to the “core” values under a s. 1  analysis, in light of the
fact that the expression will not always be of the same type.  For example,
some expression that is restricted by s. 486(1) may be connected to the “core” values. 
The expression may relate to the ability of the public to participate in and
contribute to the democratic system.  By restricting public access to the
expressive content of court proceedings, s. 486(1) inhibits informed public
criticism of the court system, thereby directly impeding public participation
in our democratic institutions, one of the “core” values protected by s.
2 (b) of the Charter .  However, in other cases, s. 486(1)  may be used to
exclude the public from proceedings where the presence of the public would
impede a witness’s ability to
testify, thereby impairing the attainment of truth, another “core” value; see R.
v. Lefebvre (1984), 17 C.C.C. (3d) 277, [1984] C.A. 370; R. v. McArthur
(1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 152 (Ont. H.C.).  On the other hand, exclusion may be
ordered from that part of the proceedings where the most lurid or violent
details of the offence are recounted, such that the restricted expression would
lie far from the core of s. 2 (b).  In the end, the important point is that in
deciding whether to order exclusion of the public pursuant to s. 486(1) , a
trial judge should bear in mind whether the type of expression that may be
impaired by the order infringes upon the core values sought to be protected.

 

65.       In sum, it
is my view that the means enacted pursuant to s. 486(1) are proportionate to
the legislative objective.  It must be recalled that the appropriate means of
remedying a particular exclusionary order having deleterious effects
outweighing its salutary effects is through judicial review of the given order.

 

66.       From the
foregoing analysis, I conclude that s. 486(1) constitutes a justifiable limit
on the freedom of expression guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Charter  and is
thereby saved by s. 1 .

 

V.  The Discretion

 

A.  Manner of Exercise

 

67.       Much of my
s. 1  analysis has turned on the fact that s. 486(1) vests a discretion in the
trial judge.  In view of the reliance I have placed on discretion in assessing
constitutional validity, I think the manner in which this discretion is to be
exercised warrants some discussion beyond the simple assertion that it must
comply with the Charter .  In doing so, I will restrict my comments to
exclusion in the interest of the “proper
administration of justice”.

 

68.       In Dagenais,
supra, this Court reviewed the constitutionality of a publication ban ordered
pursuant to the common law rule.  As I have already mentioned, Lamer C.J.
stated that the common law rule governing the issuance of publication bans must
comply with the principles of the Charter .  As he put it:  “Since the common law rule does not authorize
publication bans that limit Charter  rights in an unjustifiable manner,
an order implementing such a publication ban is an error of law on the face of
the record” (p. 865).  Holding that
the exercise of discretion must be consistent with the Charter , Lamer
C.J. set out a list of general guidelines for future cases.  These guidelines
essentially impose on the trial judge the requirements of a s. 1  balancing at
the stage of determining whether or not to order a ban.  These include three
directives which echo the three steps of the proportionality analysis of the Oakes
test.

 

69.       The same
directives are equally useful in assisting the trial judge in exercising his or
her discretion within the boundaries of the Charter  when exercising the
judicial discretion to order exclusion of the public under s. 486(1) .  Stated
in the context of such an order, the trial judge should, therefore, be guided
by the following:

 

(a)   the judge
must consider the available options and consider whether there are any other
reasonable and effective alternatives available;

 

(b)   the judge
must consider whether the order is limited as much as possible; and

 

(c)   the judge
must weigh the importance of the objectives of the particular order and its
probable effects against the importance of openness and the particular
expression that will be limited in order to ensure that the positive and
negative effects of the order are proportionate.

 

70.       Additionally,
I provide the following for guidance on the procedure to be undertaken upon an
application for a s. 486(1) order.

 

71.       The burden
of displacing the general rule of openness lies on the party making the
application.  As in Dagenais, supra, the applicant bears the burden of
proving:  that the particular order is necessary, in terms of relating to the
proper administration of justice; that the order is as limited as possible;
and, that the salutary effects of the order are proportionate to its
deleterious effects.  In relation to the proportionality issue, if the order is
sought to protect a constitutional right, this must be considered.

 

72.       There must
be a sufficient evidentiary basis from which the trial judge may assess the
application and upon which he or she may exercise his or her discretion
judicially.  In some cases in which the facts are not in dispute the statement
of counsel will suffice.  If there is insufficient evidence placed before the
trial judge, or there is a dispute as to the relevant facts, the applicant
should seek to have the evidence heard in camera.  This may be done by way of 
a voir dire, from which the public is excluded.  For example, in the
present case, a voir dire could have been held to permit the Crown to disclose
the facts not known to Rice Prov. Ct. J. in an effort to provide him with a
more complete record from which to make his decision.  The decision to hold a voir
dire will be a function of what is necessary in a given case to ensure that
the trial judge has a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which to act
judicially.

 

73.        A
sufficient evidentiary basis permits a reviewing court to determine whether the
evidence is capable of supporting the decision.  In this regard, in R. v.
Vandevelde (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (Sask. C.A.), Vancise J.A., at p.
171, referred to the concurring reasons of Kaufman J.A. in Lefebvre, supra, at
pp. 282-83 C.C.C., who stated:

 

                   . .
. public trials are the order . . . and any exceptions (as provided for in s.
442) [now s. 486(1)] must be substantiated on a case by case basis.  In my
respectful view, it is not good enough to say “the nature of this case is sexual”, and an in
camera hearing should, therefore, be imposed.  Nor, with respect, is it
sufficient for a judge to say that he or she would follow the “current practice”.

 

                   Discretion
is an important element of our law.  But, it can only be exercised judiciously
when all the facts are known . . . . [Emphasis added by Kaufman J.A.]

 

74.       Similarly,
in the Alberta Court of Appeal’s decision
in Brint, supra, McGillivray C.J.A., noting that a trial in open court
is “fundamental to the administration of justice in
this country”, stated that exclusion
could only be ordered where “there are
real and weighty reasons”.  A
sufficient evidentiary basis allows the judge to determine whether such reasons
exist; see R. v. Quesnel and Quesnel (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 270 (Ont.
C.A.), where the court found there was insufficient information before the
trial judge to enable him to order any part of the Crown’s case held in camera; see also Vandevelde,
supra, where the court held that the party seeking the order must place
sufficient evidence before the trial judge to permit a judicious exercise of
discretion.

 

75.       The information available
to the trial judge must also allow a determination as to whether the order is
necessary in light of reasonable and effective alternatives, whether the order
has been limited as much as possible and whether the positive and negative
effects of the order are proportionate.

 

76.       Finally, I
must address the exercise of judicial discretion in this case and,
specifically, the order made by Rice Prov. Ct. J.  In doing this, it is only
fair to say that Rice Prov. Ct. J. made his order prior to this Court’s decision in Dagenais, supra.  He did
not, therefore, have the benefit of the three-part inquiry that I have
discussed above and adapted to the particular s. 486(1) context.

 

B.  Review of Judicial Discretion

 

77.       In
reviewing the trial judge’s decision
to exclude the public from part of the proceedings, it must be remembered that
the trial judge is usually in the best position to assess the demands of the
given situation.  In Lefebvre, supra, the Quebec Court of Appeal found
that the trial judge had acted judicially in excluding the public where a
witness might have suffered stress from the circumstances of the case rendering
her incapable of testifying.  It continued (at p. 280 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  [The trial judge] saw the
witness and he could appreciate the stress which she was affected by.  Sitting
in appeal, and not having had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witness, I
am of the opinion that it is not appropriate for this court to question the
decision of the trial judge.

 

The court stated that where a victim of sexual
assault does not want to give evidence because of the stress created by the
presence of too many people, this could adversely affect the proper
administration of justice.  It concluded that the trial judge was in the best
position to consider the victim’s
nervousness and was aware of the facts that would be revealed by that witness.

 

78.       Where the
record discloses facts that may support the trial judge’s exercise of discretion, it should not lightly
be interfered with. The trial judge is in a better position to draw conclusions
from the facts he or she sees and hears, and upon which he or she may exercise
the judicial discretion.  This, however, presupposes that the trial judge has a
sufficient evidentiary or factual basis to support the exercise of discretion
and that the evidence is not misconstrued or overlooked.

 

79.       In the
present case, Rice Prov. Ct. J. had this to say in support of his decision to
exclude the public from part of the sentencing proceedings:

 

                   The
application made under 486(1) and the ban -- I granted the order on the third
ground that is for the proper administration of justice.  The reason for that
is that I am privy, due to documentation which I have before me, and did have
before me prior to the application being made before -- by request -- I had it
delivered to me prior to today’s hearing
which is normal.  On the opinion that the proper administration of justice --
in order for the court to have at least on the court record the exact nature of
the events including some of the details with regard to those events -- in
order for justice to properly be done, it was necessary to do these, to --
sorry, to have these facts presented to me in the manner in which they
subsequently were and that was the basis of the order.  I quite often make
orders in this regard.  This is the first time that I have been challenged, but
that’s alright, you are entitled
to challenge it. . . .  But, however, if these facts were to be presented for
the exposure to the public, it would cause I think a great undue hardship on
the persons involved, both the victims and the accused, although no
representations were made on behalf of the accused other than Mr. Letcher’s consent to Mr. Wood’s application for the exclusion, and that is the
reason.  I think that the important thing is that the court know what the facts
-- they were presented to me in the manner in which I think would have
embarrassed unnecessarily other people but I think that it was important for me
to know.  Thus, I think that the ground was, for the proper administration of
justice, I say some of the facts I knew beforehand or some I had some idea, I
didn’t know exactly what the
facts were thus the Order.

 

80.       The appellant focuses
upon the judge’s finding
that public access would have embarrassed some people, and submits that this is
not a sufficient ground upon which to exclude the public, citing Quesnel,
supra, in support of this submission.  In Quesnel, the Ontario Court of
Appeal held that the embarrassment of witnesses “alone is not reason to suppose that truth is more difficult or unlikely
or that the witness will be so frightened as to be unable to testify” (p. 275).  While it is true that this would not
suffice if it were the only ground for exclusion, the decision to exclude was
not solely based upon a finding that a public presence would embarrass the
witnesses.  Rice Prov. Ct. J. also mentioned “great undue hardship on the persons involved, both the victims and the
accused” among his reasons for
making the order. 

 

81.       With respect
to concerns relating to undue hardship, it is my view that where the
circumstances and evidence support such concerns, “undue hardship on the persons involved” may, in the interests of the proper
administration of justice, amount to a legitimate reason to order exclusion. 
The question is whether this reason is valid in the circumstances here.  My
conclusion with respect to this question is that the validity of these concerns
is fatally impaired both in relation to the victims and to the accused.

 

82.       I will deal
first with the concerns of undue hardship to the victims.  Neither the record
nor the reasons provided by the Crown support a finding that the proper
administration of justice required the exclusion of the public from part of the
sentencing proceedings.  In making his order, Rice Prov. Ct. J. had the benefit
of victim impact statements and a pre-sentence report.  The latter, however,
was not included in the record before this Court.  The victim impact statements
did not disclose evidence of undue hardship that would ensue as a result of
public attendance during the sentencing proceedings, nor did they disclose the
circumstances of the sexual offences that were ultimately divulged during
sentencing.  Indeed, Rice Prov. Ct. J. expressly stated that he did not have
all the facts before him in making the order:  “I say some of the facts I knew beforehand or some I had some idea, I
didn’t know exactly what the
facts were thus the Order.”

 

83.       In its
submission, the Crown gave the following in support of his application for a s.
486(1) order:

 

                   The
nature of the evidence, of which the court hasn’t heard, that constitutes the offence is very delicate.  It involves
young persons, female persons, and I would just ask maybe the court would
consider invoking [s. 486(1)] for purposes of --

 

Most sexual assault cases involve evidence that
may be characterized as “very
delicate”.  The evidence did not
establish that this case is elevated above other sexual assaults. This point
was conceded by the Crown during oral submissions.

 

84.       The mere
fact that the victims are young females is not, in itself, sufficient to
warrant exclusion.  There were other effective means to protect them.  Indeed,
the privacy of the victims was already protected by a non-publication order by
which their identities were withheld from the public. There was no evidence
that their privacy interests required more protection.  The victims were not
witnesses in the proceedings, the evidence of particulars of the offences
having been read in by the Crown.  As such, no stress could be said to emanate
from their having to testify, and the protection of witnesses was in no way
jeopardized.  While the criminal justice system must be ever vigilant in
protecting victims of sexual assault from further victimization, it is my view
that the record before Rice Prov. Ct. J. did not establish that undue hardship
would befall the victims in the absence of a s. 486(1) order.  Nor did the
record reveal that there were any other reasons to justify an exception to the general
rule of openness.

 

85.       The
importance of a sufficient factual foundation upon which the discretion in s.
486(1) is exercised cannot be overstated, particularly where the reasons given
by the trial judge in support of an exclusion order are scant.  In this case,
the record does not reveal that such a foundation existed or that the facts
known to Rice Prov. Ct. J. established that the proper administration of
justice required exclusion of the public in the interests of the victims.

 

86.       At this
point, I would pause to sympathize with the position in which the trial judge
found himself.  His sensitivity to the complainants cannot be overlooked, nor
should it be.  And where the record discloses sufficient information to
legitimate concerns for undue hardship to the complainants, then exclusion of
the public may be necessary for the proper administration of justice.  However,
in this case, exclusion cannot be justified on this ground in the absence of
more than is disclosed by the record.

 

87.       As to the
concern expressed for undue hardship to the accused, barring exceptional cases,
I cannot think there is any issue of hardship to the accused arising from
prejudicial publicity once the accused has pleaded guilty.  The publicity
associated with a public trial will in almost every case cause some prejudice
to the accused.  The criminal justice system has addressed much of the
potential for prejudice with procedural safeguards to ensure that trials do not
proceed in the absence of reasonable and probable grounds, and that fairness is
protected.  Once an accused has pleaded guilty, however, prejudice is greatly
diminished as the risk of having wrongly accused the person being tried is
eliminated.

 

88.       The fact
that closure of the court was only ordered during the sentencing proceedings
bears considerably upon my determination that the accused was not likely to
suffer undue hardship in this case.  As alleged by the intervener Attorney
General for Ontario, the deterrence and public denunciation functions of
sentencing are not to be undervalued.  Public scrutiny of criminal sentencing
advances both these functions by subjecting the process to the public gaze and
its attendant condemnation.  The type of expression restricted in this case,
expression relating to the sentencing process, weighs in favour of maintaining
open court.  In any criminal case, the sentencing process serves the critically
important social function of permitting the public to determine what punishment
fits a given crime, and whether sentences reflect consistency and
proportionality.  In sexual assault cases, the importance of subjecting
sentencing to public scrutiny is especially strong.  “Sexual assault” in law encompasses a wide array of different types of activities, with
varying penalties.  It is, therefore, essential to inform the public as to what
is encompassed in the term “sexual
assault” and the range of
punishment it may attract.

 

89.       In this
case, there was insufficient evidence to support a concern for undue hardship
to the accused or to the complainants.  The order was not necessary to further
the proper administration of justice and the deleterious effects of the order
were not outweighed by its salutary effects.  On the whole, and with some
reluctance in light of the proper deference to be accorded the exercise of
discretion in these types of cases, I conclude that Rice Prov. Ct. J. erred in
excluding the public from any part of the proceedings.

 

VI.  Disposition

 

90.       Following
oral argument for the appellant on the constitutional issue, the Chief Justice
gave judgment for the Court that s. 486(1) of the Code was
constitutionally valid.  On this aspect, then, all that requires to be done is
to respond to the constitutional questions.

 

91.       On the
exclusion order of Rice Prov. Ct. J., I find that he improperly exercised his
discretion in the circumstances of this case.

 

92.       Accordingly,
the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal on this point is
reversed.  I would quash the exclusion order and order access to the media and the
public to the transcript of that part of the proceedings held in camera.  Both
constitutional questions are answered in the affirmative.

                   The accused was charged with
sexual assault of R, a two-and-a-half-year-old child.   The accused was a
friend of R’s father, who on the evening in question asked him to babysit while
he ran some errands.  R was left alone with the accused for two hours.  In the
following days, R complained that his bum was sore.  Two days later he told his
mother that the accused had hurt his bum and ""put his peter in [his]
bum"".  The child was seen by a pediatrician who confirmed injury to the
anus consistent with the insertion of a blunt object.  In the subsequent
months, R's behaviour changed.  He was no longer happy and outgoing.  He
exhibited fear of social encounters, particularly with men.  He engaged in
inappropriate sexual behaviour with other children.  On a number of occasions,
he made statements to various people about the incident with the accused.  The
matter came on for trial some years later, when R was five years old.  The
Crown did not call the child, but instead tendered seven statements he had made
about the incident, arguing that while hearsay, they were admissible as
necessary and reasonably reliable following this Court's decision in Khan. 
On the initial voir dire on the admissibility of these statements, the
trial judge ruled that two would be admitted and rejected the other five.  On a
second voir dire, defence counsel argued that in view of certain
inconsistent statements, referring to the father as having been present at the
incident, all the statements should be excluded.  The trial judge rejected that
argument but accepted defence counsel's alternative argument that R's
statements bearing on his father's presence or absence should be admitted.  As
the trial proceeded, a number of statements attributed to R, including some
never subjected to a voir dire, were admitted into evidence without
objection and without any further voir dires or rulings.  The accused
did not testify or present evidence of alibi.  In his instructions to the jury
at the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge referred to the statements
globally as having been introduced as an exception to the hearsay rule.  The
accused was convicted.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority decision, upheld the
conviction.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
L’Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and Gonthier JJ.:  The question of necessity on
which the trial judge erred in failing to make findings was a preliminary
determination of mixed law and fact relating to the admissibility of crucial
evidence.  While findings on those preliminary matters would have constituted
mixed questions of law and fact, failure to make them was  an error of law. 
Where that occurs, s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
requires the court to trace the effect of the error through the process of the
trial and to determine its effect on the ultimate verdict.  In this case, the
trial judge was required to address two issues preliminary to a finding of
necessity: (a) testimonial competence, and, if competent, (b) potential trauma
to the child should he testify.  With respect to (a), an evaluation of the
evidence could lead to different conclusions.  In any event, some trial judges
might have considered speaking to the child under child-friendly
circumstances.  With respect to (b), however, in light of the uncontradicted
evidence of the Crown’s expert witness, a trial judge would inevitably have
concluded that the child would be traumatized by actually being called as a
witness.  It follows that the element of necessity is made out in law and the
evidence would inevitably have been admitted had the trial judge not erred. 
Accordingly, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.  The admission
of certain additional statements did not occasion any substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.  The Crown has discharged its obligation under
s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.

 

                   Per Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: A
trial judge on an application to admit hearsay evidence pursuant to Khan
should formally consider and rule on whether the requirements of necessity and
reliability are met.  Where a trial judge neglects to make a finding which is
essential to determining the admissibility of a crucial piece of evidence, this
may amount to an error of law which necessitates the application of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .  The majority of the
Court of Appeal did not err here in concluding that the trial judge would inevitably have admitted the
hearsay evidence had he properly considered and ruled upon its admissibility. 
This Court ruled in Khan that a child's out-of-court statement about
events at issue in a trial may be received notwithstanding that it is hearsay,
provided that the reception of the statement is made necessary by the
unavailability of the child's direct evidence on the stand and provided that
the out-of-court statement is reasonably reliable.  Reliability was conceded 
and is not in issue here.  Necessity, on the Khan test, may be
established if the child is incompetent to testify, unable to testify,
unavailable to testify, or if the trial judge is satisfied, based on psychological
assessments, that testimony in court might be traumatic for the child or harm
the child.  A reasonable trial judge would inevitably have found the
requirement of necessity to be met in this case.  It is unrealistic to conclude
that R could have communicated his evidence in any useful sense.  Moreover,
even if R possessed the ability to communicate his evidence under
s. 16(1) (b) of the Canada Evidence Act , the expert evidence
established clearly that he did not understand what it meant to promise to tell
the truth, and so he could not meet the requirement of s. 16(3) .  The
evidence also supports a finding of necessity on the grounds of trauma to the
child.

 

                   With respect to the admission
of out-of-court statements that were never the subject of a formal voir dire,
these statements, which pertained to the presence or absence of the father at
the incident, were admitted at the insistence of the defence and were obviously
not intended to be used as evidence of the truth of their contents, but were admitted
to provide a ground for arguing that R had been inconsistent regarding his
father’s presence or absence.  On this view, there was in fact a voir dire
and a ruling on the admissibility of the subsequent statements.

 

                   In his charge to the jury the
trial judge did not differentiate between the two statements ruled admissible
at the first voir dire, which were admitted for the truth of their
contents, and the other statements, which were admitted on the issue of
consistency.  Assuming that the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury on
the different purposes for which it could use the different statements
constitutes error, in the circumstances of this case no reasonable jury
receiving the limiting instruction would have arrived at a different conclusion. 
The additional statements objected to added no new information capable of
strengthening the statements tendered for their truth.  Further, any effect the
absence of the direction might possibly have had pales to insignificance
against the backdrop of the strength of the case against the accused.  No
reasonable jury, properly instructed, would have entered a verdict of
acquittal.

1                        Sopinka J. -- I
have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my colleague Justice McLachlin
but while I reach the same result I disagree with her application of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
with respect to the failure of the trial judge to make findings on the question
of necessity.

 

1                        The
matters in respect of which the trial judge erred in failing to make findings
were a preliminary determination of mixed law and fact relating to the admissibility
of crucial evidence.  Evidence was led on the voir dire on which
findings were required to be made.  While findings on those preliminary matters
would have constituted mixed questions of law and fact, failure to make them
was  an error of law.  Where that occurs, s. 686(1) (b)(iii) requires the
court to trace the effect of the error through the process of the trial and to
determine its effect on the ultimate verdict.  If the preliminary matter is
purely a question of law which the trial judge failed to decide, the Court of
Appeal decides what was the right conclusion in law.  If that conclusion leads to
the admissibility of evidence which was in fact admitted, then the error had no
effect on the verdict.  The appellate court will not entertain an argument that
different judges might decide differently.  There is only one answer which is
that given by the appellate court.

 

1                        On
the other hand, if the preliminary matter is one of fact or mixed law and fact,
the decision is not necessarily inevitable.  In our system where there is a
dispute on matters of fact, the general rule is that the appellant is entitled
to a decision from a trial judge.  In such circumstances, it is wrong for the
appellate court to simply decide the matter.  The process of reasoning is to
ask whether the issue of fact would inevitably have been decided in favour of
admissibility.  If the answer is in the affirmative, then the error had no
effect.  If the answer is in the negative, then it might reasonably have
affected the verdict because the evidence might have been excluded.  This is
the way in which both the majority and Doherty J.A. dissenting dealt with the
issue in the Court of Appeal although they differed in the result.

 

1                        In
this case, the trial judge was required to address two issues preliminary to a
finding of necessity:

 

                   (a)testimonial
competence, and, if competent,

 

                   (b)potential
trauma to the child should he testify.

 

With respect to (a), as demonstrated by Doherty
J.A. dissenting in the Court of Appeal, an evaluation of the evidence could
lead to different conclusions.  As expressed by him, “I cannot say that a reasonable
trial judge would necessarily have found Ryan to be incompetent to give
evidence” ((1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 641, at p. 667).  Apart from the fact that
different conclusions could be drawn from the evidence, some trial judges might
have considered speaking to the child under child-friendly circumstances.  The
trial judge did not even consider this possibility because of the fact that he
simply acted on the assumption that the child would not be called by the
Crown.  I would not conclude, therefore, that but for the failure of the trial
judge to make a finding in respect of testimonial competence the verdict would
necessarily have been the same.

 

1                        With
respect to (b), I am of the view that, in light of the uncontradicted evidence
of Dr. Sas, a trial judge would inevitably have concluded that the child would
be traumatized by actually being called as a witness.  It follows that, in
light of this conclusion, the element of necessity is made out in law and the
evidence would inevitably have been admitted had the trial judge not erred. 
Accordingly, the verdict would therefore necessarily have been the same.  

 

1                        In
respect to the admission of certain additional statements, I am satisfied for
the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal and those of my colleague
that the admission of these statements did not occasion any substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice.  The Crown has discharged its obligation under s.
686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

 

1                        I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

                   The reasons of Cory, McLachlin,
Iacobucci and Major JJ. were delivered by

 

1                        McLachlin J. --
The appellant, Shaun Edward Rockey, was charged and convicted of sexual assault
of Ryan, a child of two and one-half years.  The appellant was a friend of
Ryan's father.  On the evening in question, the father asked the appellant to
babysit while he ran some errands.  He left Ryan alone with the appellant from
8:00 to 10:00 p.m.  In the following days, Ryan complained that his bum was
sore.  Two days later he told his mother that Shaun had hurt his bum and
""put his peter in [his] bum"".  The child was seen by a pediatrician
who confirmed injury to the anus consistent with the insertion of a blunt
object.  In the subsequent months, Ryan's behaviour changed.  He was no longer
happy and outgoing.  He exhibited fear of social encounters, particularly with
men.  And he engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour with other children.  On
a number of occasions, he made statements to various people about the incident
with Shaun.

 

1                 The
appellant was charged and the matter came on for trial some years later, when
Ryan was five years old.  It was a difficult trial.  The Crown did not call the
child.  Instead it tendered seven statements Ryan had made about the incident,
arguing that while hearsay, they were admissible as necessary and reasonably
reliable following this Court's decision in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
531.

 

1                 On
the initial hearing on the admissibility of these statements (the first voir
dire), the trial judge ruled that two would be admitted and rejected the
other five.  On a second voir dire, defence counsel argued that in view
of certain inconsistent statements, referring to the father as having been
present at the incident, all the statements should be excluded.  The trial
judge rejected that argument but accepted defence counsel's alternative
argument that Ryan's statements bearing on his father's presence or absence
should be admitted.  As the trial proceeded, a number of statements attributed
to Ryan, including some never subjected to a voir dire, were admitted
into evidence without objection and without any further voir dires or
rulings.  The appellant did not testify or present evidence of alibi.  In his
instructions to the jury at the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge referred
to the statements globally as having been introduced as an exception to the
hearsay rule.  The jury convicted the appellant of sexual assault.

 

1                 The
appellant appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal.  The Ontario
Court of Appeal, Doherty J.A. dissenting, dismissed the appeal: (1995), 23 O.R.
(3d) 641, 99 C.C.C. (3d) 31, 82 O.A.C. 1, 42 C.R. (4th) 186.  The appellant
appeals to this Court as of right.

 

The Issues:

 

1                 The
appellant argues that the trial judge erred in three respects:

 

(1)
in admitting the hearsay statements without an express inquiry into or ruling
on the necessity of relying on Ryan's statements as opposed to calling Ryan as
a live witness;

 

(2)
in admitting numerous out-of-court statements, some without a voir dire;
and 

 

(3)
in failing to charge the jury on which statements it could                    use
for the truth of their contents and which went to credibility only.

 

1                 If
error on one or more of these matters is found, the further issue arises of
whether, applying s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , it can be concluded that a reasonable jury in the absence of
error would necessarily have convicted the appellant.

 

Decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal

 

1                 The
majority of the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in not formally
considering and ruling on necessity in deciding whether the hearsay statements
of the child were admissible.  However, it held that this made no difference
since had he done so, he would inevitably have ruled that necessity was
established.  Moreover, even if the child had been called as a witness, the
outcome of the trial would not have been affected, in the view of the majority. 
As for the admission of numerous other statements, the majority held that this
was harmless error, since the statements were admitted not for the truth of
their contents, but to provide a full context within which the jury could weigh
the significance of the statements that his father had been present at the
incident.  The majority of the Court of Appeal ruled that the charge was
adequate, even though the trial judge failed to tell the jury that it should
not use the statements admitted without a voir dire as proof of the
truth of their contents.

 

1                 Doherty
J.A. dissented.  He did not find that the hearsay statements were inadmissible
for the truth of their contents; however, he argued that they would not
necessarily have been admitted had the trial judge followed the correct
procedure. He pointed out that had the additional statements tendered on the
issue of credit been inadmissible, the trial judge's failure to tell the jury
they could be used only for this purpose was, in his view, fatal.  Accordingly,
he would have allowed the appeal.

 

Discussion

 

1. Admissibility of the Hearsay Statements

 

1                 The
trial judge on the first voir dire referred to the case law requiring a
finding of necessity and reliability before a hearsay statement may be admitted
for the truth of its contents.  However, in his written ruling finding two of
the statements admissible, he stated:

 

                   I
make the following comments on the assumption that Ryan will not testify. 
Thus, I am proceeding on the basis that at least some of the statements in
issue are ""reasonably necessary"" and therefore meet the first part of
the Khan test of admissibility.

 

The appellant argues that the use of the word
""assumption"" indicates that the trial judge was not ruling on
necessity, but was rather deferring to the prosecution's decision not to call
the child as a witness.  He submits that the trial judge should have called the
child and examined him to see whether he could give useful evidence without
undue trauma, rather than simply assuming the child could not testify and that
use of the hearsay statements was consequently necessary.

 

1                 I
accept the appellant's contention that a trial judge on an application to admit
hearsay evidence pursuant to Khan should formally consider and rule on
whether the requirements of necessity and reliability are met.  Hearsay
evidence is not admissible unless these requirements are present.  It should
not lightly be assumed that they are present, even where the statements are
those of a young child.  There is no presumption of necessity; it must always
be considered on the circumstances of a particular case.  The Crown must decide
whether to call the child or not.  In the event it decides not to call the
child and to tender hearsay statements instead, the judge must determine
whether the child could not have testified, making it necessary to call
substitute evidence.  

 

1                 I
agree with counsel for the appellant that where a trial judge neglects to make
a finding which is essential to determining the admissibility of a crucial
piece of evidence, this may amount to an error of law which necessitates the
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .  Where the
Court of Appeal cannot address the question left unanswered by the trial judge
without weighing issues of fact, then  s. 686(1) (b)(iii) seems to me to
require the application of the “inevitability” standard: that is, would the
issue of fact inevitably have been decided in a manner which would have led to
the same conclusion that the trial judge reached, in this case, admission of
the statements.  This is the procedure the majority of the Court of Appeal
followed in this case, finding that had the trial judge made the necessary
inquiry, he would have inevitably admitted the evidence.  Doherty J.A., in
dissent, was not convinced of the inevitability of that conclusion.

 

1                 This
then is the issue: did the majority of the Court of Appeal err in concluding that
the trial judge would inevitably have admitted the hearsay evidence had he
properly considered and ruled upon its admissibility?  In my view, the majority
did not err in so concluding.  

 

1                 This
Court ruled in Khan that a child's out-of-court statement about events
at issue in a trial such as this may be received notwithstanding that it is
hearsay, provided that the reception of the statement is made necessary by the
unavailability of the child's direct evidence on the stand and provided that
the out-of-court statement is reasonably reliable.  Reliability is not in issue
on this appeal and I consider it no further.  Necessity is the issue. 
Necessity, on the Khan test, may be established if the child is
incompetent to testify, unable to testify, unavailable to testify, or if the
trial judge is satisfied, ""based on psychological assessments that
testimony in court might be traumatic for the child or harm the child
..."":  R. v. Khan, supra, at p. 546.  While not argued in the
present case, it may be that necessity can also be established where the child
testifies, if the trial judge is satisfied that the admission of the
out-of-court statement is reasonably necessary in order to put a full and frank
account of the child's version of the relevant events before the jury: Khan
v. College of Physicians & Surgeons of Ontario (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d)
10 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 24.

 

1                 The
Crown called Dr. Louise Sas as a witness on the issue of necessity.  She
testified that Ryan did not understand the concepts of truth, lying and
promising.                

 

Q. 
Okay, you were starting into the area about the truth and...

 

A. 
Yeah.  I ... again, I tried to play a little game there. 

 

 ""Oh
Ryan, do you know what the truth is?  Do you know what a lie is?""

 

and
he says,

 

""Oh
yeah"", and he says, ""Well, once my mother said she wasn't going to
call and she called"".

 

And
I said -- I was waiting.

 

""So
what is that?  Is that the truth or was that a lie?""

 

and
he didn't know, so he couldn't really extrapolate as to whether that was true
or not.  I gave him an example
and I just, you know,

 

""If
I told you I was wearing a red dress, would I be lying?""

 

And
he said,

 

""Well,
you're wearing a black dress"" -- because he knows his colours very well. 
But he didn't know that that was a lie.  He could not articulate that that
was lying, you know, or an untruth.  I gave him several other examples and
he couldn't make the abstract connection.  He could recite the example, he
could tell you something was not right, but he could not then say, if you say
that, then you are lying.  Okay, so he can't take it farther.  He did not know,
really, what a promise was.  He could not articulate a promise to me at all. 
A promise is a promise is a promise, and he could not bring into it the context
that is entailed in a promise. [Emphasis added.]

 

1                 Dr.
Sas also testified that not only would giving evidence be extremely traumatic
for Ryan, but that he simply would not be able to give evidence in a room with
the accused, lawyers and a judge.

 

Q.  
Now you've talked about his own ability, that you have come to an opinion
about, based on an interview in an office which may not have had toys in it,
but was smaller than this room.  How could you contrast that with the
possibility of him testifying in a court room such as this, with a judge and
other people present?

 

THE
COURT:  And a jury.

 

Q. 
Yes.

 

A. 
I would not advise that in this case for this child.

 

Q. 
Why?

 

A. 
I feel that he would be traumatized. I think the fact of being in this court
room, on the stand, would be traumatic enough that he wouldn't be able to give
an account.

 

...

 

THE
COURT: ... What effect do you think it would have on this boy by testifying? 
If you want to give me a gradation of trauma or ...

 

A. 
You're talking about a closed circuit t.v. -- television or come from the court
room?

 

THE
COURT:  Well, do you want to start with the court room first, or do you feel
that it just will not happen if it's in the court room?

 

A. 
It will not happen, I believe, if he has to be in the same room as the
accused.  I think it would be very traumatic for him to come into contact with
Shaun, who he continues to feel is in a jail situation somewhere and that he is
safe because this person is being held.

 

Q. 
All right, can we take it one step, then, what if there were a screen in place,
would you be able to comment on that -- a screen that would prevent him from
viewing the accused?

 

A. 
Well, what the screen does, in a sense ... you're right, it provides a barrier
for the child so he wouldn't see the accused directly, however, I know both
from the literature, that children do better in smaller rooms.  There's some
literature to support the use of closed circuit t.v. and you're more likely to
elicit a full account in a smaller room with younger children in particular,
and that for this child, I think this large room is so formal, it would be very
frightening for him.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Q. 
... In your opinion, would he be able to give a meaningful account of what
happened if he were in a room with a camera that was taking his picture and
transmitting that into the court room?

 

A. 
It would be ... I believe he would be able to say pretty much the same as what
he said to me today, if he was in a room separate from the court and asked
questions one more time.  There's no reason to believe that he couldn't again
say what he said today, but would that be enough, given what I told you he was able
to say?

 

THE
COURT:  Would he be able to meaningfully respond to cross-examination by a
person as kind as Mr. Bentley?

 

A. 
I don't have ... I don't know what you would ask him, so I can't answer, you
know.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, I don't know if he were asked questions
about ... well when did it happen, or at what time or where were you, what room
... I don't think he could provide any of that.  He has not been able to in
questioning, so the fact that he would be in a small room with a closed circuit
t.v. provision, to me, wouldn't make a difference in that area;  but how much
information he could give you about the incident ...

 

Q. 
You don't think that that would affect it?

 

A. 
No I don't think that will affect how much you will get.  I think what  we're
getting is the most that we're going to get from this child, given his
developmental level and the fact that it's two years now.  He gave us almost as
much as he could then and I don't think we're to expect more now.

 

1                 Dr.
Sas's evidence was uncontradicted.  It established beyond doubt that calling
this already traumatized child to the courtroom to testify would inflict
further trauma upon him.  Even to call him for examination on a voir dire would
be cruel.  Having listened to Dr. Sas, it likely was apparent to everyone in
the courtroom that Ryan could not and should not be subjected to the ordeal of
being questioned by the judge or lawyers.  This much we know:  everyone simply
took it for granted that he would not take the stand.  This explains the trial
judge's omission to make a formal ruling on necessity and the absence of
objection by either party to that omission.  The trial and all its participants
proceeded on the common understanding that necessity had been manifestly
established.

 

1                 Dr.
Sas's evidence suggests three grounds for a conclusion of necessity:
testimonial incompetence; potential trauma to the child; and inability to
present meaningful evidence.

 

1                 The
first ground is that Ryan lacked the testimonial capacity required of a witness. 
Testimonial incompetence can render it necessary to receive the out-of-court
statement of a child witness: R. v. Khan.  Ryan was clearly not
competent to testify under oath.  He could only have testified upon promising
to tell the truth pursuant to s. 16(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 :

 

                   16. ...

 

                   (3) 
A person referred to in subsection (1) who does not understand the nature of an
oath or a solemn affirmation but is able to communicate the evidence may
testify on promising to tell the truth.

 

Two requirements must be met to establish
testimonial competence under s. 16(3) : the ability to communicate the evidence
and the ability to promise to tell the truth: R. v. Farley (1995), 99
C.C.C. (3d) 76 (Ont. C.A.).  The phrase to “communicate the evidence” in s.
16(1) (b) indicates more than mere verbal ability.  In order to establish
ability to communicate, “[i]t is necessary to explore in a general way whether
the witness is capable of perceiving events, remembering events and communicating
events to the court”.  R. v. Marquard, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, at p. 236. 

 

1                 Ryan’s
ability to communicate his evidence in a courtroom setting was limited.  Dr.
Sas stated:

 

...
I believe he would be able to say pretty much the same as what he said to me
today, if he was in a room separate from the court and asked questions one more
time.  There’s no reason to believe that he couldn’t again say what he said
today....

 

At the same time,  Dr. Sas testified that Ryan
could only give the most basic information of what happened, without detail. 
Even if he were to be walked through the process, he lacked the capacity to
understand what goes on in court.  Cross-examined about videotaping Ryan's
evidence or giving it in a small room via closed circuit television, Dr. Sas
initially supposed that it could be tried, but clarified that the only
information the child could provide would be ""this happened to me, it
hurt, and he did it"".  His sense of time was very poor, and he would be
able to relate only the bare bones of the incident under very direct
questioning.  Crown counsel would likely have to be under a table when talking
to Ryan, at least part of the time.  Dr. Sas also testified that Ryan was much
less comfortable with men than women.  As for cross-examination, Dr. Sas was
very clear that Ryan would be incapable of meaningful response:  ""if he
were asked questions about .... well when did it happen, or at what time or
where were you, what room ... I don't think he could provide any of
that.""  In the face of this evidence, it is unrealistic to conclude that
Ryan could have communicated his evidence in any useful sense either in the
courtroom or in a smaller room via closed circuit television.  

 

1                 It
may be, as Doherty J.A. concluded, that despite these limitations Ryan
possessed the ability to communicate his evidence under s. 16(1) (b) of
the Canada Evidence Act .  Logistical difficulties are generally not a
sufficient reason to substitute hearsay evidence for a witness’s testimony. 
However, even if this requirement were met, the case for Ryan testifying would
founder on the requirement of s. 16(3) , the ability to promise to tell the
truth.  Dr. Sas's evidence was unequivocal: Ryan did not understand what it
meant to promise to tell the truth.  I agree with Doherty J.A. in dissent that
it is not necessary that the witness be able to define the word ""promise""
in some technical sense; what is required is that the witness understand the
obligation to tell the truth in giving his or her evidence.  I respectfully
part company from Doherty J.A.’s conclusion, however, that it cannot be said
that “a reasonable trial judge would necessarily have found Ryan to be
incompetent to give evidence” (p. 667 O.R.).  On this point, I share the view
of the majority of the Court of Appeal.  Ryan, as noted above, did not
understand the concepts of truth or lying.  Nor could he articulate a promise. 
""A promise is a promise is a promise, and he could not bring into it the
context that is entailed in a promise.""  The only inference that can be
drawn from this evidence is that while Ryan understood the difference between
what is “so” and ""not so"",  he had no conception of any moral
obligation to say what is ""right"" or ""so"" in giving
evidence or otherwise.  In these circumstances, no judge could reasonably have
concluded that Ryan was able to promise to tell the truth.

 

1                 The
evidence also supports a finding of necessity on the grounds of trauma to the
child.  The argument for the appellant on trauma suggested that only the most
severe trauma could justify a conclusion of necessity.  I respectfully
disagree.  Mere discomfort is insufficient to establish necessity.  But where
there is evidence, as here, that an already traumatized child might be further
traumatized by being questioned by strange men in a strange situation, that
suffices.  The Court is not required to wait for proof of actual harm to the
child.

 

1                 I
conclude that a reasonable trial judge would inevitably have found the
requirement of necessity to be met.  Reliability having been conceded, it
follows that the evidence would inevitably have been admitted and that the
requirements of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  are met.

 

2. Admission of Numerous Out-of-Court
Statements

 

1                 The
admission of Ryan's out-of-court statements was attacked on two grounds.  The
first ground of attack was the absence of necessity, considered above.  The
second ground is that statements were admitted which were never the subject of
a voir dire.  It was error, it is submitted, for successive Crown
witnesses to be permitted to testify that Ryan told them the same story,
without the admissibility of these additional statements having been considered
on a voir dire.

 

1                 To
appreciate the reason for the admission of the additional statements and their
significance it is necessary to consider their place in the context of the
trial and how it unfolded.  It behoves appellate courts to remind themselves
that a trial is a dynamic process.   Particular events and rulings are best
judged, not in isolation, but in connection to the events that precede and
follow them.  The reception of the additional statements in this case provides
a classic illustration of the need to consider the dynamics of the trial.

 

1                 Viewed
in the abstract, the admission of out-of-court statements without a voir
dire appears abnormal, if not erroneous.  A different perspective emerges,
however, when the statements are considered in the context of how the trial
developed.  At the outset of the trial, the trial judge ruled two out-of-court
statements admissible.  It then came to the attention of the defence that Ryan
had given certain other statements containing a collateral contradiction.  In
two statements in the course of play therapy, Ryan had said that his father had
been present when Shaun assaulted him.  The defence requested another voir
dire.  It asked the trial judge to exclude all the statements, including
the two that had been ruled admissible.  The trial judge refused, but acceded
to the defence's alternative request that all the statements pertaining to the
presence or absence of the father at the incident be admitted.  These statements,
admitted at the insistence of the defence, were obviously not intended to be
used as evidence of the truth of their contents.  Rather, they were admitted to
provide a ground for arguing that Ryan had been inconsistent.

 

1                 Once
the issue of Ryan's consistency had been raised by admitting the statements
referring to his father's presence, it became necessary in fairness and logic
to admit all the statements Ryan had made which averted to the presence of his
father and which did not avert to the presence of his father.   The admission
of these statements was required so that the jury could properly judge the
degree of the inconsistency on that point and its effect on the credibility of
Ryan.  The trial judge's ruling on the second voir dire may be
interpreted as doing this: ""all the statements that were made to the
various witnesses can go in in relation to the father being there or father not
being there"".

 

1                 On
this view, there was in fact a voir dire and a ruling on the
admissibility of the subsequent statements.  Had the defence not insisted on
the admission of the two statements referring to the father's presence, the
only statements that would have been admitted were the two ruled admissible at
the first voir dire.  The defence having requested the admission of
these additional statements as evidence of inconsistency, it became necessary
to admit all statements made on that issue.  This is what the trial judge did. 
That all parties viewed this as what had occurred and as being fair is attested
to by the fact no one objected to admission of the statements that were
subsequently tendered.

 

1                 Viewed
in the perspective of the trial and the trial judge's ruling on the second voir
dire, it is clear that the admission of the subsequent statements without
separate voir dires was not in error.  The subsequent statements were
not tendered for the truth of their contents, but on the issue of
inconsistency.

 

3. The Charge to the Jury

 

1                 The
two statements ruled admissible at the first voir dire, one to his
mother and the other to Dr. Sas, were admitted for the truth of their
contents.  The other statements were admitted on the issue of consistency.  The
trial judge, however, did not differentiate between the two classes of
statements and the different uses to which the jury could put them.

 

1                 He
introduced his instruction on the out-of-court statements as follows: 

                   In
this case, as has been indicated by both counsel, this is rather an unusual
case in that the child did not testify.  In certain circumstances, the Crown
is permitted to offer a child's evidence through the mouths of others.  In most
cases involving adults, particularly, a person is not allowed to say in court
what he heard another person saying, because that is what you have all heard
throughout this trial known as hearsay.  However, as I have indicated in
law now, under certain circumstances, as in this case, I have ruled that the
Crown is permitted to adduce evidence through the mouths of other persons about
what this child has said.  When considering that evidence -- the evidence of
the lad -- you must have certain considerations and I must caution you with
respect to that type of evidence. [Emphasis added.]

 

In cautioning the jury about Ryan's statements,
he said:

 

The
repetition of the statements.  I believe Linda Aitken indicated that the child
was entirely consistent in his disclosure to her -- you should take that into
consideration.  You must also,
of course, take into consideration at one point, October of 1991, when his mother
was walking with him in the park, he at one point said that his father was
there and then later on, apparently again without any leading or anything else,
he said that his father was not present at the time.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The trial judge made several other references to
the out-of-court statements in reviewing the evidence, including statements
which had been tendered only on the issue of consistency.   He suggested that
the latter were relevant to credit:

 

You
should take into consideration the manner in which the statements came
forward.  Are they credible?  Is it a logical manner in which they came
forward?  The repetition of the statements. I believe Linda Aitken indicated
that the child was entirely consistent in his disclosure to her -- you should
take that into consideration.

 

At no time did the trial judge tell the jury that
these statements were not to be used as evidence of the truth of their
contents, but only on the issue of whether they could rely on Ryan's contention
that Shaun had assaulted him.  At the same time, he told them the additional
statements must be considered on the issue of Ryan's consistency and never
suggested that the repetition of the statements could be viewed by the jury as
making them more likely to be true.  Neither the Crown nor the defence objected
to the judge's charge.

 

1                 It
has long been accepted that trial judges charging juries on out-of-court
statements must instruct them on how they may use the statements -- whether as
evidence of the truth of their contents or for some other purpose, such as
credit.  In this case the trial judge did not do this.  It may be that it was
apparent to everyone in the courtroom that the subsequent statements were
tendered on the issue of consistency, as the majority of the Court of Appeal
suggests.  Nevertheless, the usual rule requires this to be stated expressly.

 

1                 The
Crown submits that the usual rule was inapplicable in this case.  To tell the
jury that some of the statements could be used for the truth of their contents
and others only on the issue of credit would only have served to confuse them,
the Crown submits.  The instruction the defence now belatedly seeks that some
of the statements could be considered for their truth while other statements
similar in virtually every respect could not, would result in ""analytical
chaos"", the Crown suggests, and serve no purpose.  The instruction has a
place, the Crown submits, where the issue is whether the witness has fabricated
or concocted evidence; in such a case it is useful and necessary to point out
to the jury that out-of-court the witness said something different and to
instruct them that the out-of-court statements can be considered only on the
issue of whether the witness was speaking truthfully.  But here, where the
""witness"" is, on the expert testimony, incapable of deliberate
fabrication, and where all the statements are out-of-court statements, the
traditional differentiation makes little sense.  To put it another way, warning
the jury about the different uses to which it may put in-court evidence on oath
and out-of-court statements tendered only for credibility may make good sense
where concoction is at issue and some statements are sworn and others not;  it
makes little or no sense where all the statements are out-of-court statements
of equal value, admitted on the basis of their pre-determined reliability.  In
such cases, the Crown submits, the best course is to leave all of the
statements to the jury for the truth of their contents.

 

1                 It
may be that in some future case this Court will be required to consider whether
the traditional warnings regarding statements apply in all respects where all
the statements are tendered on the basis of the principles enunciated in R.
v. Khan.  In this case, however, I find it unnecessary to decide this
issue.  Assuming that the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on
the different purposes for which it could use the different statements
constitutes error, I am satisfied that in the circumstances of the case at
bar,  no reasonable jury receiving the limiting instruction would have arrived
at a different conclusion.   The inconsistencies that the defence relied upon
were repeatedly drawn to the attention of the jury.  The jury was clearly told that
it must consider the inconsistencies in deciding whether to accept Ryan's
allegations.  The additional statements objected to added no new information
capable of strengthening the statements tendered for their truth.  The
objection to the charge reduces to the suggestion that the jury might have
inferred from the subsequent consistent statements that the initial statements
were more likely to be true.  But this is precisely the inference which a jury
is permitted to draw from evidence tendered on credit.  In the result, I cannot
see how the limiting instruction the defence now says should have been given
could have led to acquittal.

 

1                 I
add this.  Any effect the absence of the direction might possibly have had
pales to insignificance against the backdrop of the strength of the case
against the appellant.  With the exception of the two statements in play
therapy briefly referring to the presence of his father, the child's statements
to many individuals from two days after the alleged event to the date of trial,
covering a period of two and one-half years, were entirely consistent.  The
medical examination proved beyond doubt the injury to the child.  The child's
marked behavioural changes amply supported the violent sexual nature of the
assault as well as the child's assertion that it had been perpetrated by a
male.  No plausible explanation supporting a perpetrator other than the
appellant was suggested.  Indeed, the appellant's avoidance of the child's
father and cancellation of a planned fishing trip after the injury to the child
support the child's statement to his mother that the person who had done this
to him was Shaun.

 

1                 I
conclude that any error in the trial judge's instructions to the jury was
inconsequential.  No reasonable jury, properly instructed, would have entered a
verdict of acquittal.

 

Conclusion

 

1                 I
would dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction.

on appeal from the court of appeal for nova
scotia

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Child abduction in absence of custody order ‑‑ Elements of offence ‑‑
Whether accused parent can be convicted of child abduction under s. 283(1) of
Criminal Code when child not in possession of deprived parent at time of
offence ‑‑ Meaning of ""takes"" and ""possession"" ‑‑
Whether defence contained in s. 284 of Code applicable -- Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , ss. 283(1) , 284 . 

 

                   The accused father and his
common law wife were separated in 1986.  M, their 3‑year‑old son, originally
remained with his mother but she became unable to care for him and, in December
1986, she agreed that M should live with his father and that he would be solely
responsible for M’s upbringing. The mother later became dissatisfied with the
limitations which the father was placing on her access to M and, in 1992, she
applied to the Nova Scotia Family Court for custody and access.  Pending the
resolution of the matter, the Family Court ordered ex parte that the
mother be granted “interim liberal access” and that M not be removed from Nova
Scotia.  Soon after being served with the interim order, the father left with M
for California. The father was arrested two years later and, upon his return to
Nova Scotia, was charged with abducting his child contrary to s. 283(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code . That section makes it offence for a parent,
guardian or lawful custodian of a child to take a child, not the subject of a
custody order, with intent to deprive another parent or guardian or lawful
custodian of the child of possession of that child.  The father was acquitted
at trial on the ground that he had not “taken” M from his mother since, at all
material times,  M was legally in the father’s care. The majority of the Court
of Appeal overturned the acquittal and ordered a new trial. 

 

                   Held (Sopinka and McLachlin JJ. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per L’Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Cory, Iacobucci 
and Major JJ.: The trial judge erred in his interpretation of s. 283(1) of
the Code.  Since 
the section states that the offence of child abduction can be committed by the
“parent, guardian or person having the lawful care or charge” of the child, a
person can clearly be found guilty notwithstanding that he or she is the
child’s parent or that he or she had lawful care of the child.   

 

                   Section 283 does not require
that the deprived parent, guardian or other person having lawful care or charge
of the child must actually have had possession of the child at the moment of
the offence for an accused to be convicted.  Reading the English and French texts of
s. 283(1)  together, a “taking” or “enlèvement” occurs where the
accused causes the child to come or go with him or her, and, in the process,
excludes the authority of another person who has lawful care or charge of the
child.  Further,  by also prohibiting acts such as “concealing”, “harbouring”
and “receiving” — acts which can only be committed while the child is not in
the possession of the deprived parent — Parliament has indicated that child
abduction by a parent, even in the absence of a custody order, can be found to
have occurred regardless of whether the child was in the possession of the
deprived parent at the relevant time. There is nothing in the mens rea
of s. 283(1)  to suggest otherwise.   An accused would have the requisite
“intent to deprive [the other parent] of the possession” if he or she intended
to keep the other parent from having a possession to which he or she would
otherwise be entitled.  The word “possession”  is not limited to circumstances
in which the deprived parent is actually in physical control of the child at
the time of the taking, but extends to the ability to exercise control over the
child.  By enacting ss. 281 to 283,  Parliament has decided that the
protection of children rests in ensuring that people entitled to exercise care
and control over children are able to do so.  Accordingly, Parliament has
criminalized conduct — whether by a stranger or a parent, and whether or not
there is a custody order in force — that intentionally interferes with a
parent’s lawful exercise of care and control over the children. An
interpretation of s. 283  which does not require that the deprived parent
have possession of the child at the moment of the offence  is consistent with
the purpose and scheme of the child abduction provisions.  Such an
interpretation does not have the effect of unduly expanding the scope of
criminal liability, and elevating a deprivation of access to the status of
criminal conduct.  No accused will be convicted under s. 283 unless he or
she intended to deprive a person entitled to possession of the child of that
possession.

 

                   Under s. 284
of the Code,  a person who takes a child with intent to deprive the
child’s parent, or another person having lawful care or charge of the child, of
possession of the child cannot escape liability by giving his or her own
consent to the taking.  The consent referred to in s. 284  must come, not
from the accused himself or herself, but from the person whom the accused
intended to deprive of possession of the child. 

 

                   It is not the role of this
Court to determine whether the mother was entitled to M's possession.  That
issue should  be determined at the new trial on the basis of the evidence
adduced. Iacobucci J.'s comments in reply to McLachlin J.'s reasons are agreed
with.      

 

                    Finally,  the Court of Appeal did not err in
law by allowing the Crown’s appeal from the accused’s  acquittal at
trial. The Crown’s appeal  was based on a question of law ‑‑
namely, the proper interpretation of the actus reus of s. 283 of
the Code. 

 

                   Per Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci  JJ.:   The role
of  the purported custody “agreement” between the father and the mother can
arguably be safely discounted.  In cases such as this one, the Nova Scotia Family
Maintenance Act appears to supplant the common law of contracts as it
pertains to agreements between spouses on care and custody matters.   Section
18(4) of this Act establishes, as a baseline, that both parents are entitled to
care and custody of the child unless a court orders otherwise.  An agreement
may have the effect of an order, but only if it has been registered in a court
(s. 52).  No formal order was made in this case, and the 1986 agreement
appears not to have been registered.  The 1992 order granting  “interim liberal
access” to the mother did not, by implication, grant care and custody to the
father. A parent’s statutory right to joint custody of her child should not be
abrogated except in the clearest of terms.  Therefore, as there was no order
made by the court otherwise, there was no evidence before it that might upset
the statutory presumption of joint care and custody.  Both parents retained
their entitlement to care and custody of the child.  Consequently, it cannot be
said, on the basis of the agreement, that the father did not take M from the
possession of his mother.

 

                    Even if it were accepted that
the common law of contracts governs in this case, it would still not follow
that the father should prevail.  Whatever may be the literal terms of the
purported custody agreement, it is possible that for reasons of equity  an
implied condition might be found that the father should not remove M  from the
country. It is impossible, however, to say in advance whether such a condition
should be found. The inquiry must be left to the trial judge.

 

                   Although there is a concern
that a parent who inadvertently and only technically breaches the other
parent’s custody rights may face imprisonment, it should be emphasized that the
mens rea of the offence is not simply the intention to take the child,
but the intention to take the child from the possession of one who is entitled
to that possession.  Because  the latter kind of intent is serious, 
prosecution of trifling offences under s. 283 is not to be expected.

 

                   Per Sopinka and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  Section 283(1) of the Code
targets the act of taking a child where there is no custody order in place.
Certain conditions, however, must be fulfilled before the act of taking becomes
criminal: the person taking must have lawful custody and the taking must be
with the “intent to deprive” the other parent “of the possession of” the child.
The section thus contemplates the situation where people share custody or
“possession” of the child.  Possession is used in the legal sense of right of
possession.  It is not necessary that the deprived parent have physical
possession of the child at the time of the taking.  What is required, at a
minimum, is that the deprived parent have a right to possession of the child.

 

                   The central issue
in this appeal is the effect of a custody agreement,  as opposed to a court
order, on a parent’s common law custody rights.  A  parent may give up his or
her right to custody by entering into an agreement conferring sole custody on
the other parent.  Notwithstanding the absence of a court order, a parent who
does so no longer has a right to possession of the child of which he or she
can  be deprived, unless custody is restored by the termination of the
agreement, a new agreement, or a court order.  It follows that s. 283(1) 
would find no application in a situation where sole custody has been conferred
upon the “taking” parent. It is unquestioned that common law rights, including
the right to custody of a child, may be altered by contract.  Here,  the trial
judge was correct in acquitting the father of the offence of child abduction. 
After the separation, the mother initially had a right to possession of the
child at common law, as confirmed by the Nova Scotia Family Maintenance  Act,
but  the trial judge found  that the mother, by oral agreement with the father
in December 1986, validly conveyed her common law right to possession and
custody of the child to the father and that the agreement was still in force. 
These findings were  amply supported by the evidence and should not have been
disturbed by the Court of Appeal. The court erred in concluding that the
agreement, as opposed to a court order, could not affect a parent’s original
right to custody.  Further, the father’s interference with the mother’s
exercise of her access rights did not constitute a deprivation of possession
under s. 283(1) . Possession, in contrast to access, comports the right and
responsibility of care and control of the child.  While  the terms of access
may be so generous that the non‑custodial spouse in fact exercises a
significant degree of care and control over the child, the trial judge’s 
findings in this case  negate any suggestion that the mother had any control or
responsibility over the child.  She had the right to visit the child; she did
not have the control or responsibility for him required to establish
possession.  Finally, this Court should not rule on the issue of whether
unregistered custody agreements may be of no force in Nova Scotia  since  this
issue was not  properly raised, considered and argued in this case. With
respect to s. 18(4) of the Family Maintenance Act,  in the context
of a criminal trial, the Crown bore the burden of showing that the father did
not have an exclusive right of possession to the child at the time of taking.  The
Crown not having raised s. 18(4) at trial, it is not for this Court at
this stage of the proceedings to raise it to the end of discharging the burden
that lay on the Crown.

 

                   The line between
wrongful but non‑criminal failure to respect parental rights on the one
hand,  and child abduction under s. 283(1)  on the other, lies at the point
where the wrongdoer takes the child with intent to thwart the established right
(by court order or agreement) of control and care of the other parent.  On one
side of the line the remedies are civil, on the other criminal.  Section
283(1)  draws the line at this point by requiring  intent to deprive the other
parent of possession of the child, a concept that goes beyond mere interference
with access rights or a hypothetical possibility of a future right to
possession.  While arguments can be raised for an interpretation of
s. 283(1)  that would criminalize virtually any interference with access
rights or future custody rights, given the severity of the criminal sanction,
reserved for the most reprehensible conduct in our society, there is no reason
to interpret the section that broadly.  Less serious breaches are better left
to civil sanctions.

I.  Introduction

 

1                 The appellant lived on the
Myrtle Tree Farm at Waterville, Nova Scotia, with his young son Michael, until
Michael’s mother arrived at the farm with a court order for “interim liberal
access” pending a final determination of her application for custody of
Michael.  Soon thereafter, the appellant disappeared with the child.  When the
appellant was finally apprehended two years later, he was living in California
with Michael under an assumed name.  He was charged with child abduction under
s. 283  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , but contends that he
is not guilty, essentially because an accused cannot be found to have “taken” a
child, within the meaning of s. 283 , unless, at the time of the offence, the
child was in the possession of the other parent, guardian or person having the
lawful care or charge of the child.  The appellant was also charged under s.
127(1)  of the Criminal Code  for violating a provision of the interim
access order requiring that Michael not be removed from Nova Scotia. 

 

II.  Facts

 

2                 Michael Dawson was born on
January 31, 1983, to Judith Seymour and the appellant.  The appellant was
physically abusive towards Seymour, and the couple were separated just before
Michael’s third birthday.  Later that year, the appellant underwent a religious
conversion and took up residence in a religious community at Clark’s Harbour,
Nova Scotia.  Although Michael originally remained with his mother, she became
unable to care for him, and, in December 1986, Seymour agreed that Michael
should live with the appellant.  It was also agreed that the appellant would be
solely responsible for Michael’s upbringing.  In August 1987, the appellant and
Michael moved to an affiliated religious community located on the Myrtle Tree
Farm at Waterville, Nova Scotia.

 

3                 Near the end of 1987, Michael
was taken from his father by provincial officials acting under an order of the
Family Court of Nova Scotia, on the ground that he was a “child in need of
protection” within the meaning of the Children’s Services Act, S.N.S.
1976, c. 8.  Lengthy court proceedings ensued, at the conclusion of which the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that the Family Court’s order was ultra
vires and ordered that Michael be returned to his father. 

 

4                 Over the next few years, Seymour
became dissatisfied with the limitations which the appellant was placing on her
access to Michael, and, in 1992, she applied to the Family Court for custody
and access.  Pending the resolution of the matter, the Family Court ordered ex
parte that Seymour be granted “interim liberal access” and that Michael not
be removed from Nova Scotia.  

 

5                 Soon after being served with the
interim order, the appellant vanished, taking Michael with him.  He sent a
letter to the Chief Judge of the Family Court, explaining that he was motivated
purely by a desire to protect Michael’s interests.  

 

6                 Seymour heard nothing from the
appellant or their son until two years later, when the appellant was arrested. 
At the time of his arrest, the appellant was living with Michael in California
under an assumed name.  The appellant and Michael were returned to Nova Scotia,
where the appellant was charged with having disobeyed a court order contrary to
s. 127(1)  of the Criminal Code  and with having “taken” Michael contrary
to s. 283(1)(a) of the Code.  Throughout the relevant period, the
latter provision read as follows:

 

         283.  (1) Every one who, being the parent, guardian
or person having the lawful care or charge of a person under the age of
fourteen years, takes, entices away, conceals, detains, receives or
harbours that person, in relation to whom no custody order has been made by a
court anywhere in Canada, with intent to deprive a parent or guardian, or any
other person who has the lawful care or charge of that person, of the
possession of that person, is guilty of

 

(a) an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten
years; [Emphasis added.]

 

The prosecution under s. 283(1) (a) was
duly authorized on behalf of the provincial Attorney General as required by s.
283(2).

 

III.  Judgments

 

A.  Nova Scotia Supreme Court

 

7                 At trial, the appellant was
convicted of the charge under s. 127(1) .  He was acquitted, however, of the
abduction charge under s. 283(1) (a), on the ground that he had not
“taken the child Michael from anyone”.  Although the appellant had taken steps
to frustrate Seymour’s access, Michael “was legally in the care of his father
... at all times from 1986”.

 

B.  Nova Scotia Court of Appeal (1995),
100 C.C.C. (3d) 123

 

8                 With
respect to s. 127(1) , the Court of Appeal unanimously overturned the conviction
and substituted an acquittal, on the ground that s. 127(1)  does not apply to
violations of orders made under the Family Maintenance Act, R.S.N.S.
1989, c. 160.  The Court of Appeal’s decision on s. 127(1)  is not under appeal.

 

9                 However, the Court of Appeal
also overturned the appellant’s acquittal under s. 283(1)  and ordered a new
trial.  Hallett J.A., writing for the majority, observed that the word “take”
does not import any requirement that the person whom the accused intended to
deprive of possession — hereinafter, the “deprived parent” — have physical
control over the child at the time of the taking.  While Hallett J.A.
acknowledged that, if there has been a taking, a court must then determine
whether the child was taken with the intent to deprive a parent (or a guardian
or other person having care or charge of the child) of possession of the child,
he emphasized that the notion of possession, in the context of this
determination, includes actual possession or a right to possession.  

 

10               Jones J.A., dissenting, would have
upheld the acquittal under s. 283(1) .  According to Jones J.A., only by
intentionally removing the child from the possession of the deprived parent,
can an accused commit child abduction within the meaning of s. 283 , because the
essence of the crime of child abduction is the removal of a child from the
possession of its parent rather than the frustration of “rights” of possession.

 

11               As a result of the decision of the
Court of Appeal setting aside the appellant’s acquittal of the offence under s.
283(1) , the appellant appeals as of right to this Court pursuant to s. 691(2) 
of the Criminal Code . 

 

IV.  Issues

 

 








12               The appellant raises the following
issues:

 

         A.Did
the Court of Appeal err in law in ruling that the word “takes” as it appears in
s. 283(1)  of the Criminal Code  does not import a requirement that the
deprived parent have possession of the child at the time of the offence?

 

B.Did the Court
of Appeal err in law by failing to apply the defence of consent contained in s.
284  of the Criminal Code ?

 

C.Did the Court
of Appeal err in law in holding that the ex parte order of the Family
Court gave Seymour a right to possession of the child?

 

D.Did the Court
of Appeal err in law by allowing the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal entered
at trial, when the Crown’s appeal failed to raise a question of law?

 

V.  Analysis

 

13               To avoid confusion about the scope
of this appeal, I would observe at the outset that this appeal, like any appeal
as of right to this Court, is restricted to questions of law.  Consequently,
despite the appellant’s contention that, in light of the agreement between
Seymour and the appellant regarding Michael’s upbringing, Seymour is not
entitled to the possession of Michael, it is not the role of this Court to
resolve this or any other factual controversy.  Rather, we are called upon to
decide whether the trial judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 283 . 
If we agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge committed an error of
law, then, unless the same verdict is inevitable, we must uphold the order for
a new trial and leave all factual issues to be resolved in that forum. 

 

A.Whether
the word “takes” imports a requirement that the deprived parent have possession
of the child at the time of the offence

 

14                    The trial judge found the
appellant not guilty of child abduction, on the basis that the appellant could
not have “taken” Michael because the child “was legally in the care of his
father” at all material times.  The terms in which s. 283  is drafted, however,
leave no room for this interpretation.  Section 283(1)  states that the offence
can be committed by the “parent, guardian or person having the lawful care
or charge” of the child (emphasis added).  Clearly, a person can be found
guilty under s. 283  notwithstanding that he or she is the child’s parent or
that he or she had lawful care of the child. 

 

15                    The appellant, for his part,
develops a slightly different argument as to why his acquittal should be
upheld.  He urges that an accused cannot be convicted under s. 283  unless the
deprived parent had possession of the child at the moment of the offence.  Yet
the breadth of the terms selected by Parliament to express the prohibited acts
militates against such a requirement.  The word “take”, for example, used in
the English text of the section, is commonly understood to mean, inter alia,
“to cause (a person or animal) to go with one”: Oxford English Dictionary
(2nd ed. 1989), vol. XVII, at p. 564; see also D. Watt, The New
Offences Against the Person: The Provisions of Bill C-127 (1984), at p.
141.  The verb “enlever”, which appears in the French text, is somewhat
more precise, as it connotes the action of “soustraire (une personne) à
l’autorité de ceux qui en ont la garde”: Le Grand Robert de la langue
française (2nd ed. 1986), t. III, at p. 1002.  Reading the two texts
together, I conclude that a “taking” or “enlèvement” occurs where the
accused causes the child to come or go with him or her, and, in the process,
excludes the authority of another person who has lawful care or charge of the
child.  There is nothing in s. 283  to suggest that the deprived parent,
guardian or other person having lawful care or charge of the child must
actually have had possession of the child at the moment of the offence. 
Indeed, by also prohibiting acts such as “concealing”, “harbouring” and
“receiving” — acts which can only be committed while the child is not in the
possession of the deprived parent — Parliament has indicated that child
abduction by a parent, even in the absence of a custody order, can be found to
have occurred regardless of whether the child was in the possession of the
deprived parent at the relevant time.

 

16                    Finding little to support his
position in the words used to describe the actus reus of s. 283 , the
appellant rests his argument in large part on the formulation of the mens
rea of the offence.  He points out that an accused cannot be convicted
unless he or she had the “intent to deprive [the other parent] of the
possession” of the child, and asserts that a person cannot be “deprived” of
something that he or she does not have.  However, this argument has been made
before, and it did not find favour even under the more narrowly worded
provisions in force prior to ss. 281  to 283 .  In an often-cited case, Re
Lorenz (1905), 9 C.C.C. 158 (Que. K.B.), an alleged abductor contended that
“she could not be held guilty of taking away from her husband what he had not
actually had, viz., the possession of the child, although he might be legally
entitled to it” (p. 161).   The court dismissed the argument, stating that when
the statute spoke of the “intent to deprive . . . of the possession”, it is not
“the possession he has had of which the parent has been deprived, but of
that to which he is entitled” (pp. 161-62 (emphasis in original)).

 

17                    Indeed, to “deprive” a person
of something means, among other things, to keep that person from that which he
or she would otherwise have: Oxford English Dictionary, supra,
vol. IV, at p. 490.  Similarly, the French verb “priver” means “empêcher
(qqn) de jouir d’un bien, d’un avantage présent ou futur; enlever à (qqn)  ce
qu’il a ou lui refuser ce qu’il espère, ce qu’il attend”: Le Grand
Robert, supra, t. VII, at p. 779.  This suggests that the
accused would have the requisite intent if he or she intended to keep the other
parent from having a possession to which he or she would otherwise be
entitled.  

 

18                    Moreover, this Court
considered the meaning of the phrase “with intent to deprive ... of the
possession” under s. 281  of the Criminal Code , in R. v. Chartrand,
[1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, and observed that “possession” is not limited to
circumstances in which the deprived parent is actually in physical control of
the child at the time of the taking, but extends to the ability to
exercise control over the child.  Consequently, the intent to deprive of
possession will exist whenever “the taker knows or foresees that his or her
actions would be certain or substantially certain to result in the parents
(guardians, etc.) being deprived of the ability to exercise control over the
child”: Chartrand, at p. 889.  There is nothing in this mens rea
to suggest that the actus reus requires anything more than preventing a
parent, guardian, or other person having lawful care or charge of the child,
from exercising control over that child.   

 

19                    The appellant further
contends that the interpretation favoured by the Court of Appeal has the effect
of unduly expanding the scope of criminal liability, and elevating a
deprivation of access to the status of criminal conduct.  It must be borne in
mind, however, that the essence of the offence is an intentional
interference with a parent’s ability to exercise control over his or her
child.  No accused will be convicted under s. 283  unless he or she intended to
deprive a person entitled to possession of the child of that possession.  And
if an accused does take a child and thereby excludes the authority of a person
who has lawful care or charge of the child, with intent to deprive that person
of the possession of the child, I see no reason to permit the accused to hide
behind his or her status as a custodial parent or the other parent’s status as
an access parent.

 

20                    In this connection, it is
important to remember, as Deschamps J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal wrote in
Augustus v. Gosset, [1995] R.J.Q. 335, that “if parental status entails
responsibilities, it is the source of few right[s]” (p. 357).  Indeed, all
rights of custody and access exist only to the extent that they permit the
custodial or access parent to act in the best interests of the child: Gordon
v. Goertz, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27,  at para. 69, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.  
It follows that although the parties and the courts below speak of ss. 281  to
283  as provisions enacted for the protection of parental “rights”, their
ultimate purpose is the protection of children.  In Chartrand, supra,
we described this purpose in this way (at p. 880): 

 

. . . to secure
the right and ability of parents (guardians, etc.) to exercise control over
their children . . . for the protection of those children, and at the same time
to prevent the risk of harm to children by diminishing their vulnerability.

 

This description was given in the context of s.
281 ; however, I believe that s. 283  has the same broad purpose.  Parliament has
decided that the protection of children rests in ensuring that people entitled
to exercise care and control over children are able to do so.  Accordingly, by
enacting ss. 281  to 283 , Parliament has criminalized conduct — whether by a
stranger or a parent, and whether or not there is a custody order in force —
that intentionally interferes with a parent’s lawful exercise of care and
control over the children. 

 

21                    Before 1983, the Criminal
Code  did not distinguish explicitly between parents and strangers.  Section
250  provided simply that:

 

    250. 
(1) Every one who, with intent to deprive a parent or guardian or any
other person who has lawful care or charge of a child under the age of fourteen
years of the possession of that child, or with intent to steal anything on or
about the person of such a child, unlawfully

 

(a)
takes or entices away or detains the child, or

 

(b)
receives or harbours the child,

 

is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

 

  (2) This
section does not apply to a person who, claiming in good faith a right to
possession of a child, obtains possession of the child. [Emphasis added.]

 

However, courts generally held the view that, in
the absence of a judicial order to the contrary, a parent had authority over
and a right to possession of his own child and, therefore, could not be found
guilty of child abduction.  They therefore interpreted s. 250(2) as being
available to any parent accused of abducting his or her own child, unless the
taking violated a custody order: see R. v. Cowan (1910), 17 O.W.R. 553
(Co. Ct.), at p. 554; R. v. Anagnostis, [1970] 1 O.R. 595 (Co. Ct.), at
p. 597; R. v. Miller (1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 387 (Co. Ct.); R. v.
Enkirch (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 165 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Cook (1984),
12 C.C.C. (3d) 471 (N.S.C.A.), at p. 475; R. v. Hammerbeck (1991),
2 B.C.A.C. 123; E. G. Ewaschuk, “Abduction of Children by Parents” (1978-79),
21 Crim. L.Q. 176, at p. 179; B. Johnstone, “Parental Child Abduction
Under the Criminal Code ” (1987), 6 Can. J. Fam. L. 271, at p. 273;
I. J. Sagatun and L. Barrett, “Parental Child Abduction: The Law, Family
Dynamics, and Legal System Responses” (1990), 18 J. Crim. Just. 433, at
p. 434; and S. L. Pollet, “Parental Kidnapping: Can Laws Stem the Tide?”
(1993), 21 J. Psychiatry & L. 417, at p. 419. 

 

22                    The state of the law before
1983 was subject to criticism for neglecting the large number of child
abductions which occur in advance of a court order for custody.  The
problem of pre-emptive abductions was discussed by Sagatun and Barrett, supra,
at p. 437, for example, and by children’s advocates before the Standing Committee
on Justice and Legal Affairs, Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of
June 3, 1982, at pp. 93:10 and 93:11.  Section 250, as interpreted by the
courts, contained a sizable loophole which permitted a parent anticipating an
application for custody by the other parent to short-circuit the court
proceedings simply by taking the children. 

 

23                    The 1983 amendments (S.C.
1980-81-82-83, c. 125, s. 20) closed this gap.  The Code continues to
prohibit takings by strangers (now s. 281 ), and takings by a parent in
contravention of the custody provisions of a custody order (now s. 282 ). 
However, it also contains a completely new section (s. 283 ) which extends
criminal liability to intentional takings — the same actus reus and mens
rea described in ss. 281  and 282  — committed by a parent even in the
absence of a custody order.  Thus, by the time of the incidents which gave rise
to the present appeal, the provisions read as follows:

 

  281. 
Every one who, not being the parent, guardian or person having the lawful
care or charge of a person under the age of fourteen years, unlawfully
takes, entices away, conceals, detains, receives or harbours that person with
intent to deprive a parent or guardian, or any other person who has the lawful
care or charge of that person,  of the possession of that person is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten
years.

 

  282. 
Every one who, being the parent, guardian or person having the lawful care
or charge of a person under the age of fourteen years, takes, entices away,
conceals, detains, receives or harbours that person, in contravention of the
custody provisions of a custody order in relation to that person made by a
court anywhere in Canada, with intent to deprive a parent or guardian, or any
other person who has the lawful care or charge of that person, of the
possession of that person is guilty of

 

(a) an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten
years; or

 

(b) an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

  283. 
(1) Every one who, being the parent, guardian or person having the lawful
care or charge of a person under the age of fourteen years, takes, entices
away, conceals, detains, receives or harbours that person, in relation to
whom no custody order has been made by a court anywhere in Canada, with
intent to deprive a parent or guardian, or any other person who has the lawful
care or charge of that person, of the possession of that person, is guilty of

 

(a) an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten
years; or

 

(b) an
offence punishable on summary conviction.  [Emphasis added.]

 

All three offences involve taking, enticing away,
concealing, detaining, receiving or harbouring a child with intent to deprive a
parent or guardian, or any other person who has the lawful care or charge of
the child, of the possession of that child.  They differ only as to the
identity of the person who commits the offence (whether a stranger or a parent)
and as to the existence or violation of a custody order in respect of the
child.

 

24                    In repealing s. 250(2) and
adding what is now s. 283 , Parliament clearly intended to expand the reach of
the child abduction provisions so as to protect children from unilateral
removal, even in the absence of a custody order, and even by a person who
could, in some sense, claim a right to possession of the child.  The
interpretation favoured by the appellant would unacceptably undermine this purpose. 


 

25                    Indeed, if the appellant’s
submissions on this question of law were accepted, it would severely reduce the
scope of all three child abduction offences.  For example, a non-custodial
parent who, in contravention of a custody order, acted as the appellant is
alleged to have done, would escape criminal liability under s. 282 .  There
would have been no “taking”, since the deprived custodial parent did not
actually have the possession of the child at the time of the offence. 
Similarly, under the appellant’s interpretation, a stranger who plucked a lost
child off the street, with intent to deprive the child’s parents of the
possession of the child, could not be convicted under s. 281 .  There would be
no “taking”, as the child was not in the possession of its parents at the time
of the alleged offence.  

 

26                    The courts have consistently
refused to adopt such a narrow interpretation of the offence of child
abduction.  An excellent example is the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal’s decision
in Cook, supra, which the appellant himself calls the “seminal
decision” on s. 283 .  In that case, far from confirming the right of a parent
to disappear with his or her children provided that they are not taken from the
actual possession of the other parent, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in fact
upheld the conviction of a father in circumstances quite similar to those of
the case at bar.  In Cook, as here, there was no custody order in
respect of the child, so both parents were entitled to custody of the child by
virtue of the Family Maintenance Act.  As in the case at bar, the
accused had possession of the child with the permission of the mother
(although, admittedly, in Cook the permission was much more limited). 
As in the case at bar, the accused vanished with the child.  The Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal upheld the accused’s conviction for abduction under s. 283 . 
See also R. v. Petropoulos (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 393 (B.C.C.A.). 

 

27                    Even under the pre-1983
legislation, courts have upheld convictions for child abduction where the child
was not in the possession of the deprived parent.  In Enkirch, supra,
for example, another decision relied on by the appellant, the Alberta Court of
Appeal entered a conviction against an accused under former s. 250
notwithstanding that there had been no transfer of possession and that, at the
time of the offence, the child was lawfully in the possession of the accused
under the access terms of a custody order.

 

28                    These decisions are
consistent with the proposition that a “taking” can be found to have occurred
notwithstanding that the children were not removed from the actual physical
possession of the deprived parent but were, in fact, in the possession of the
depriving parent.  Considering the scheme and purpose of ss. 281  to 283  as well
as the wording of the provisions, I am left with no doubt that the principle
underlying these decisions is correct.  There is no requirement in s. 283  that
the deprived parent have the possession of the child at the moment of the
alleged offence.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal must fail.

 

B.Whether
the Court of Appeal erred in law by failing to apply the defence of consent
contained in s. 284 of the Criminal Code

 

29                    The appellant argues that,
even assuming that his arguments on s. 283  are not accepted, there is no need
for a new trial since a defence under s. 284  of the Criminal Code  was
raised on “the undisputed facts”.  The English text of s. 284 of the Code
reads as follows:

 

  284.  No
one shall be found guilty of an offence under sections 281  to 283  if he
establishes that the taking, enticing away, concealing, detaining, receiving or
harbouring of any young person was done with the consent of the parent,
guardian or other person having the lawful possession, care, or charge
of that young person. [Emphasis added.]

 

The appellant reasons that, since he is the
parent who had lawful possession of the child at the time of the alleged
offence, his consent suffices under s. 284  as a defence to any charge
under s. 283 .

 

30                    I cannot accept the notion
that a person who takes a child with intent to deprive the child’s parent, or
another person having lawful care or charge of the child, of possession of the
child could escape liability by giving his or her own consent to the taking. 
Under the appellant’s interpretation of s. 284 , a babysitter or a teacher could
take a child with intent to deprive the child’s parents of possession of the
child, and escape criminal liability under s. 281  simply by giving his or her
own consent as a person having lawful possession of the child.  Such an absurd
result could not have been within the contemplation of Parliament in enacting
s. 284 .

 

31                    My view is confirmed by the
French text of s. 284 , which states that the defence is available where “le
père, la mère, le tuteur ou l’autre personne qui avait la garde ou la charge
légale de la personne âgée de moins de quatorze ans en question a consenti
aux actes reprochés” (underlining added).  There is no reference to
possession.  I cannot but conclude that the consent referred to in s. 284  must
come, not from the accused himself or herself, but from the person whom the
accused intended to deprive of possession of the child. 

 

32                    It therefore cannot be
maintained that a defence under s. 284  arises “on the undisputed facts”.  That
is not to say that there is no possible argument to be made under s. 284 . 
Assuming (without deciding) that the appellant’s conduct falls prima facie
within s. 283 , it may be possible for the appellant to argue that Seymour
consented to the taking so as to engage s. 284 .  However, this factual question
is very much in dispute, and should be resolved at trial.

 

C.Whether
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the ex parte order of the
Family Court gave Seymour a right to possession of the child

 

33                    The appellant argues that the
order of the Family Court giving Seymour “interim liberal access” was not
lawful because the Family Court issued it without first hearing from him. 
According to the appellant, the legality of the order is of the utmost
importance because it was the basis on which the Court of Appeal found that
Seymour had a right to possession of the child.

 

34                    In fact, however, the
majority of the Court of Appeal also pointed out that “[a]s the mother of the
child, Ms Seymour had a right to custody even though she had consented to
Dawson having custody of the child when they separated” (p. 151).  Presumably,
Hallett J.A. was alluding to the provision in s. 18(4) of the Family
Maintenance Act that, in the absence of a court order or legislative
provision to the contrary, the parents of a child are equally entitled to
custody of the child.  Thus, even if it were assumed that the appellant could
successfully challenge the legality of the order of the Family Court, there
could well be room to argue that Seymour’s right to possession of Michael, for
the purposes of s. 283 of the Code, can be supported on the basis of the
Family Maintenance Act.  

 

35                    However, it does not fall to
us to decide these points.  This is not an appeal from the order of the Family
Court.  Nor is it a trial, at which the question of whether Seymour was
entitled to the possession of Michael ought to be determined in the first
instance on the basis of the evidence adduced.  The trial judge made no
findings on this issue, and, indeed, the appellant has indicated that there is
additional evidence not presented at the first trial that may be relevant. 
This ground of appeal should therefore fail.

 

36                    In
that respect, I fully agree with my colleague Iacobucci J.’s reasons in reply
to my colleague McLachlin J.’s reasons.

 

D.Whether
the Court of Appeal erred in law by allowing the Crown’s appeal from the
acquittal entered at trial, when the Crown’s appeal failed to raise a question
of law

 

37                    The appellant’s final
contention is that the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal entered at trial
should have been dismissed by the Court of Appeal, as it failed to raise a
question of law.  However, in light of the foregoing, I think it is obvious
that the Crown’s appeal was based on a question of law, namely the proper
interpretation of the actus reus of s. 283  of the Criminal Code . 
This ground of appeal, like the others, should be rejected.

 

VI.  Conclusion

 

38                    Much was made by the
appellant, in his factum and in oral argument, about the agreement between
Seymour and the appellant regarding Michael’s upbringing.  The appellant
attempted, in essence, to paint himself as a sole custodial parent and Seymour
as a mere access parent.  The Crown did not allow these assertions to go
unanswered.  It responded that Seymour no longer assents to the arrangement,
and that, in any event, s. 18(4) of the Family Maintenance Act
grants both parents joint custody of Michael in the absence of a custody
order.  However, as I stated at the outset, it is not the role of the Court to
determine whether Seymour was entitled to possession of Michael.  That
determination is a matter for trial.  All we are called upon to decide is
whether, assuming that a person is a parent, guardian or other person having
lawful care or charge of a child, an accused may be found to have taken the
child with intent to deprive that person of the possession of the child even
if, at the moment of the alleged offence, the deprived person did not have the
possession of the child.

 

39                    This question, for the
reasons I have set out above, should be answered in the affirmative.  The text
of s. 283 , the purpose and scheme of the child abduction provisions, and even
the case law cited by the appellant himself, indicate that the person whom the
accused intended to deprive of possession need not actually have had possession
of the child at the time of the offence in order for a conviction under s. 283 
to be sustained.  

 

40                    I therefore agree with the
majority in the Court of Appeal that the trial judge committed an error of law
in his interpretation of s. 283 , and that a new trial should be ordered.  In
the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

I.  Introduction

 

41  This
appeal requires us to interpret the section of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , as it stood in 1992, which criminalizes child abduction
by parents or guardians.  Section 283(1)  made it an offence for a parent,
guardian or lawful custodian of a child to take a child, not the subject of a
custody order, with intent to deprive another parent or guardian or lawful
custodian of the child of possession of the child.  It read:

 

      283. (1) Every one who, being the parent, guardian or
person having the lawful care or charge of a person under the age of fourteen
years, takes, entices away, conceals, detains, receives or harbours that
person, in relation to whom no custody order has been made by a court anywhere
in Canada, with intent to deprive a parent or guardian, or any other person who
has the lawful care or charge of that person, of the possession of that person,
is guilty of 

 

(a) an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten
years; or

 

(b) an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

Section 283(1)  was modified by s. 284 , which reads:

 

      284.  No one shall be found guilty of an offence
under sections 281  to 283  if he establishes that the taking, enticing away,
concealing, detaining, receiving or harbouring of any young person was done
with the consent of the parent, guardian or other person having the lawful
possession, care or charge of that young person.

 

42  Judith
Seymour and Edward Dawson lived together.  In 1983 they had a child, Michael. 
Three years later they separated.  Ms. Seymour initially took the child with
her.  Very soon, however, she became unable to care for him.  She agreed that
Michael should go to live with his father, and that his father would be
exclusively responsible for his upbringing.  This agreement had the effect of
giving Mr. Dawson sole custody of Michael.

 

43  In
1992, six years after conferring custody of the child on Mr. Dawson, Ms.
Seymour objected to certain limitations that Mr. Dawson was placing on her
access to the child.  She obtained a court order granting her “interim liberal
access” and stipulating that the child not be removed from Nova Scotia. 
Shortly after being served with the order, Mr. Dawson took the child to
California.  He advised the Family Court by letter that he was acting out of a
desire to protect the child’s interests.

 

44  Mr.
Dawson was arrested in California two years later.  Upon returning to Nova
Scotia, he was charged with disobeying a court order contrary to s. 127(1)  of
the Criminal Code  and with abducting his child contrary to s. 283(1)(a)
of the Code.

 

45  The
trial judge acquitted Mr. Dawson of the offence of child abduction.  He held
that it was an essential element of an offence under s. 283(1)  that the accused
have taken the child from a person entitled to possession of the child.  In his
view, the mother did not have possession or any right to possession of the
child at the time the father took him to California; rather the child “was
legally in the care of his father ... at all [material] times”.  Therefore an
essential element of the offence was not met.

 

46  The
majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, per Hallett J.A., interpreted
s. 283(1)  differently.  In its view, the offence did not require that the
mother have custody of the child at the time of the taking.  It sufficed that
the mother had a statutory right to possession of the child.  The court found
this right in the stipulation of the Family Maintenance Act, R.S.N.S.
1989, c. 160, which affirmed the common law rule that both parents have custody
of a child.  The custody agreement giving the father sole custody did not
affect the mother’s statutory right to custody.  In the Court’s view, only a
court order could deprive her of her custody right.  It followed that the
mother had a right to possession of the child sufficient to attract s. 283(1) 
of the Criminal Code .   With reluctance, the Court of Appeal ordered a
new trial, noting that the appellant had already paid a considerable price for
his conduct.

 

47  Both
the trial judge and the Court of Appeal held that in order for s. 283(1)  to
apply, the parent “deprived” of possession must have a right to possession of
the child.  The trial judge found that the parent said to be deprived in this
case, the mother, did not have such right or entitlement because the custody
agreement had transferred her custody rights to the father.  The Court of Appeal,
in contrast, held that because there was no court order concerning custody, but
only an agreement, both parents had custody at common law and under the Nova
Scotia Family Maintenance  Act. Thus, the difference between the views
of the trial judge and those of the Court of Appeal is based on their
respective interpretations of the effect of the custody agreement between the
parties.  The trial judge held that an agreement giving one parent exclusive
custody negates a right of the other parent to “possession” of the child of 
which she may be “deprived” under s. 283(1) .  The Court of Appeal, on the other
hand, held that a custody agreement giving one parent sole custody does not
remove the common law and statutory right to custody of the other parent.  Only
a court order giving one parent sole custody would deprive the other parent of
the right to possession under the Act.

 

48  The
issue arising from the judgments below is thus not whether s. 283(1)  required
that the “deprived” parent have possession or a right to possession of the
child.  All courts below agree that she must.  The issue centers rather on the
effect of a custody agreement, as opposed to a court order, on a parent’s
common law custody rights.  If it is concluded as a matter of law that a
custody agreement, as opposed to a custody order, is capable of negating a
parent’s common law right to custody, the further question arises of  whether
the custody agreement in this case had that effect. If it did, a final question
arises: whether possession by the mother sufficient to attract s. 283(1)  may be
found on other grounds, such as her access rights or her right to apply to the
courts for custody.

 

II.  Legal Issues

 

49  The
issues that emerge from the judgments under review suggest an analysis
proceeding on the following lines:

 

      (1)  The nature of the requirement under s.
283(1)  for the non-taking or “deprived” parent to have possession or a right to
possession of the child; 

 

      (2)  Whether a custody agreement, as
opposed to a custody order, may remove a parent’s common law right to
possession for the purposes of s. 283(1) ;

 

      (3)  If so, whether the custody agreement
in this case removed the mother’s right of possession for purposes of s.
283(1) ;

 

      (4)  If so, whether there are alternative
grounds on which the right to possession required by s. 283(1)  may be asserted,
such as access.  

 

50  These,
I perceive, are the real issues in the case.  Unfortunately, a number of the
arguments focussed undue attention on side-issues, such as whether custody in
the “taking” parent provides an absolute defence, whether actual physical
possession by the deprived parent is required by s. 283(1) , and whether the
father himself could consent to the taking.  As will be seen, I substantially
agree with L’Heureux-Dubé J.’s answers to these side-issues; however, I do not
agree that they resolve the appeal in favour of the respondent. 

 

1.The Nature
of the Requirement of Section 283(1)  for the “Deprived” Parent to  Have Possession
of the Child

 

51  Both
the trial judge and the Court of Appeal accepted that for there to be an
offence under s. 283(1) ,  the parent, guardian or person having lawful care or
charge of the child  from whom the child is alleged to be taken or  otherwise
kept must have some right of possession in the child. Otherwise, it is
logically impossible to find that that parent has been deprived of possession
of the child, as required by s. 283(1) .

 

52  Section
283(1) targets the act of taking a child where there is no custody order in
place. But certain conditions must be fulfilled before the act of taking
becomes criminal.  The person taking must have lawful custody.   And the taking
must be with the “intent to deprive” the other parent “of the possession of”
the child.  Unless there is another parent with a right to possession of the
child, the intent to deprive required by s. 283(1)  cannot be established.  The
section thus contemplates the situation where people share custody or
“possession” of the child.  It makes it an offence for one of those people to
take the child without the consent of the other, and with intent to deprive the
other of his or her right to possession or control of the child.  The most
common example is the situation of joint custody which exists at common law
(confirmed by statute in most provinces) between parents whether separated or
living together, absent agreement or court order to the contrary. 

 

53  It
is thus apparent that s. 283(1)  applies only where the person alleged to be
“deprived” by the taking of the child, has possession of the child.  Possession
is used in the legal sense of right of possession.  I agree with L’Heureux-Dubé
J. that it is not necessary that the deprived parent have physical possession
of the child at the time of the taking.  What is required, at a minimum, is
that the deprived parent have a right to possession of the child, in other
words, a possession right of which he or she is “deprived” by the taking. To
interpret s. 283(1)  as requiring actual physical possession in the deprived
parent at the time of taking  is not required by the words of the section and
would subvert its purpose of preventing one of two persons sharing custody or
possession of a child from taking or keeping the child from the other parent
without that parent’s consent.

 

54  While
I agree with L’Heureux-Dubé J. that the deprived parent need not have actual
physical custody of the child at the time of the taking, I do not share her
view that this disposes of the issue of possession.  We must go on to consider
whether the parent alleged to be deprived of possession of the child in this
case had a right to possession of the child.

 

55  Possession
of a child connotes the right (and correlative obligation) to care for and
control the child. It may be unilateral, or it may be shared with another
person.  The latter is the situation addressed by s. 283(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

56  The
right of a person to possession of a child may flow from a variety of sources. 
It may flow from the common law right of parents, confirmed in most provinces
by statute, to the custody, care and control of their children.  It may be
conferred by contracts,  called custody agreements.  Finally, it may be
conferred by court order.

 

57  There
can be no doubt that Ms. Seymour originally had a right to possession of the
child at common law as confirmed by the Nova Scotia Family Maintenance Act. 
The question is whether the separation agreement conferring exclusive custody
on the father conveyed that right to Mr. Dawson.

 

2. Is a
Custody Agreement Capable of Depriving a Parent  of a Common Law Right  to
Possession of the Child for Purposes of Section 283(1) ?

 

 

58  The
key element of the decision of the Court of Appeal is its conclusion that the
mother retained the right to custody at common law, notwithstanding the
agreement between the parties that the father would have sole custody.

 

59  The
appellant argues that the mother relinquished  her rights to custody and
possession of the child by entering into the custody agreement.  The custody
agreement was a contract between the appellant and the mother which, by its
terms,  gave exclusive custody of Michael to the appellant.  Like most other
contracts, a custody agreement can be oral or written, and while there was no
written custody agreement in evidence before the trial judge, he was satisfied
that a valid contract existed.

 

60  The
mother had a right to apply to the courts for custody.  But so long as the
agreement remained in effect, she was contractually bound to permit the
appellant to have sole custody, subject to her rights of access. Having
contractually relinquished her custody right to Michael’s father, she had no
remaining right to possession or custody.  Until the agreement was ended or
overridden by court order, her only right was to access. 

 

61  When
a child is born, both parents have the right to its custody.  This is the
common law, confirmed by statute.  However, a parent may give up his or her
right to custody by entering into an agreement conferring sole custody on the
other parent.  Notwithstanding the absence of a court order, a parent who does
so no longer has a right to possession of the child of which he or she can  be
deprived, unless custody is restored by the termination of the agreement, a new
agreement, or a court order.  It follows that s. 283(1)  would find no
application in a situation where sole custody has been conferred upon the
“taking” parent.

 

62  Both
settled legal principle and policy support this view.  From the point of view
of legal principle, it is unquestioned that common law rights, including the
right to custody of a child, may be altered by contract.  

 

63  Every
day, hundreds of separating parents in Canada enter into custody agreements by
which they do just this, and every day the courts uphold and enforce these
agreements.  From the point of view of policy, parents are encouraged to settle
matters of custody by agreement rather than engaging the expensive and often
slow process of adversarial litigation.  It is probable that many more custody
issues are resolved by agreement than by court orders. The legal result sought
by the parties is identical, regardless of whether they settle the issue of
custody out of court or through a court order.  It makes no sense to treat the
two situations differently.  The reasoning of the Court of Appeal would require
us to conclude that a parent who takes a child where a court order for custody
has been made will not commit a crime, while a parent who takes a child where
there is a custody agreement will be criminally liable, assuming that all other
facts are identical.  That cannot have been the intention of Parliament.

 

64  I
conclude that a parent may cede his or her right to custody of a child by
agreement, just as he or she may lose that right by court order.  For the
purposes of s. 283(1) , there is no difference between the two situations.

 

65  Before
leaving this point, I must avert to the suggestion of Iacobucci J. that unregistered
custody agreements may be of no force in Nova Scotia.  This argument was not
raised at the hearing nor considered by any courts below.  It is one of
far-reaching implications, having the potential to undermine all unregistered
custody agreements in the province of Nova Scotia.

 

66  This
Court should not rule on this issue in obiter dicta in this case, but
should leave the issue to a case where it is properly raised, considered and
argued.  Suffice it to say that it is far from apparent that the legislature in
enacting s. 18(4) of the Family Maintenance Act, intended to oust the
common law power of parents to make their own arrangements on matters of
custody.  As for the provision for registration of custody agreements, this is
a common provision in many legislative schemes.  Its intent is not to curtail
the right of parties to settle their own affairs where they can do so amicably,
but to enhance that right by making agreements enforceable as court orders.

 

67  I
also note that the issue is raised here in the context of a criminal trial.  
The Crown bore the burden of showing that the appellant did not have an
exclusive right of possession to the child at the time of taking.  The Crown
not having raised s. 18(4) of the Family Maintenance Act at trial, it is
not for this Court at this stage of the proceedings to raise it to the end of
discharging the burden that lay on the Crown.

 

3.  Did the Agreement in this Case Negate the
Mother’s Right of Possession?

 

68  The
trial judge found that pursuant to the agreement between the parties, the
appellant father had had the legal care of the child with the consent of the
mother since 1986.  While the father took steps to frustrate the mother’s
access, he at all times had a legal right to have the child in his care.  These
amount to findings that the mother, by agreement with the father, conveyed her
common law right to possession and custody of the child to the father and,
notwithstanding the father’s frustration of access, that agreement was still in
force.  These findings should not have been disturbed by the Court of Appeal
unless they were not supported by the evidence.

 

69  In
fact, the evidence amply supports the trial judge’s finding that the agreement
conferring sole custody of the child on the father was still in force.  The
mother, it is true, had of late become dissatisfied with the agreement and
wished to recover the custody rights she had ceded by her agreement.  But she
recognized that she could not break the contract unilaterally and that to
regain the custody she had conveyed by contract, it would be necessary to
obtain either the appellant’s consent to a new arrangement or a court order
granting her custody.  At the time of the alleged offence, she had decided to
apply for such an order.  However, until it was granted, the agreement remained
in effect.

 

70  Custody
agreements are binding until terminated, amended, or set aside by court order. 
To suggest otherwise would be to introduce dangerous uncertainty into custody 
law, a domain where it is of the utmost importance that the parties know
precisely what their rights are and are not.  None of these events occurred in
the case at bar.  The trial judge correctly concluded the custody agreement
remained in force.  It follows that the mother did not have custody or a right
to custody of the child at the time of the alleged offence.  As such, the facts
in the case at bar dictate that custody cannot serve as a basis for finding
possession of the child required by s. 283(1) .

 

4.Can the
Mother’s Possession Under Section 283(1) of the Criminal Code Be Established on
Other Grounds?

 

71  It
has been held that the words “having the lawful care or charge”  of a child
following “parent, guardian or person” in s. 283(1) does not mean that all
persons enumerated in the phrase must have lawful care or charge of the child: R.
v. Van Herk (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 264 (Alta. C.A.).  For the purposes of
this case, I am prepared to proceed on that basis.  This raises the possibility
that a parent not having custody rights may be the object of a deprivation
under s. 283(1).  This in turn raises the question of whether interfering with
the exercise of access rights can constitute a deprivation of possession under
s. 283(1). 

 

72  Possession,
in my view, is different from access.  Access refers to the right to visit the
child. Often it entails giving the access parent temporary possession of the
child. But possession is not an inherent or necessary quality of access. 
Possession, in contrast to access, comports the right and responsibility of
care and control of the child.  

 

73  Whether
the parent has sufficient care and control of the child to have possession for
the purposes of s. 283(1) in cases falling short of express custody is a matter
of fact for the trial judge to decide.  The terms of access may be so generous
that the non-custodial spouse in fact exercises a significant degree of care
and control over the child.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal proceeded on
this basis in R. v. Petropoulos (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 393.  In that
case the father had custody.  However, the mother had access for three days of
the week. In affirming a conviction following the father’s move with the child
from British Columbia to Toronto, Taylor J.A. reasoned that the access order in
question amounted to a transfer of care and custody of the child to the access
parent (at p. 397):

 

While the word
“access” is used, indicating that the order does not contemplate joint, or
alternating, custody, what is granted by such an order as this is more than
merely a right to visit while the child is in the possession, care, or charge
of the other parent. It involves transfer of the child from the possession,
care or charge of the “custodial parent” to that of the non-custodial parent.

 

74  This
decision confirms that in order to support a charge of child abduction, the
parent deprived of possession must have an express right to custody, or failing
this, rights which establish a custody-like obligation of care and control over
the child. 

 

75  The
findings of the trial judge in the case at bar negate any suggestion that the
mother had any control or responsibility over the child.  She had the right to
visit the child; she did not have the control or responsibility for him
required to establish possession.  This was the case both under the agreed
provisions as to access and the access established by the court order.

 

76  It
was faintly suggested that there was interference with Ms. Seymour’s possession
of the child in the sense that the appellant’s conduct prejudiced the exercise
of a future possible right to court-ordered custody.  I see little merit in
this suggestion.  Section 283(1) refers not to possible future possession, but
to possession simpliciter.  In a criminal law statute, that can only be
interpreted as an actual right of possession at the time of the taking. 

 

III.  The Defence of Consent

 

77  Having
concluded that the trial judge did not err in finding that the mother retained
no right of possession to the child sufficient to found the deprivation of
possession required by s. 283(1), it is unnecessary to consider the defence of
consent provided by s. 284 :

 

      284.  No one shall be found guilty of an offence
under sections 281  to 283  if he establishes that the taking, enticing away,
concealing, detaining, receiving or harbouring of any young person was done
with the consent of the parent, guardian or other person having the lawful possession,
care or charge of that young person. [Emphasis added.]

 

78  I
observe only that I agree with L’Heureux-Dubé J. that it makes no sense to
suggest that the taking parent could himself provide the necessary consent. 
Clearly what Parliament had in mind as a defence was the consent of the parent
deprived of possession of the child by the taking.  The fact that Parliament
chose to describe that person as a person “having the lawful possession, care
or charge of” the child in s. 284  confirms the view expressed above that the
deprived person must have a present right to possession, in the sense of care
and control, of the child.

 

IV.  The Common Sense Perspective

 

79  Section
283(1)  of the Criminal Code  is not a model of clarity, as the history of
this case attests.  My analysis to this point has centered on the wording of
the section -- wording that suggests, if I am right, that it is essential to
conviction of the crime of abduction of a child under the section that there be
a person who had possession of the child, in the sense of custody or a
custody-like right of care and control of the child.  But where the section is
as important as this one is, a court charged with settling its meaning would be
remiss if it did not consider the common sense perspective.  How was the
section intended to function?  How, as interpreted, does it function?

 

80  In
support of the ruling of the Court of Appeal, it is argued that s. 283(1) 
should apply wherever a custodial parent takes, entices, conceals, detains,
receives or harbours a child with intent to in any way deprive the other parent
or guardian of any right of control of the child, even a bare right to visit
the child.  Interpreted thus, a custodial parent who is late in delivering a
child for an access visit could be charged with a crime and imprisoned for up
to ten years.

 

81  The
respondent argues that the breadth conferred by this interpretation is
mitigated by two factors.  First, intent to deprive must be demonstrated. 
Second, the Attorney General must consent to prosecutions under the section.

 

82  Neither
factor offers great reassurance.  Intent in criminal law is generally inferred
from conduct.  A person taking a child will be presumed to intend whatever
deprivation a reasonable person in his position would have foreseen.  It is not
unrealistic to suppose that thousands of custody and access violations occur in
this country each day.  Most are committed by people who know full well that
their breach may deprive the other parent, however temporarily or trivially, of
some present or potential contact with the child.  Intent will easily be
inferred in such cases.  Is this the stuff, one is compelled to ask, of the
criminal law?  

 

83  The
respondent concedes that the interpretation it advocates might result in
prosecuting as criminals people whose conduct falls far short of what society
would regard as criminal.  However, the respondent also submits that this
situation is remedied by the requirement of the Criminal Code  that the
Attorney General authorize prosecutions under this section.  This reasoning
amounts to attributing to Parliament the intention to place people guilty of
civil default in violation of the criminal law of this land; then remedying the
overkill by conferring on the executive branch the discretion whether or not to
proceed with prosecution.  I cannot hazard what was in the mind of the
Parliamentarians when they passed the requirement of the Attorney General’s
consent to prosecution.  Perhaps it was nothing more than a desire to prevent
frivolous private prosecutions in an area of the law where emotions often run
high.  I can, however, assert that the intention that the respondent
would have us attribute to Parliament is unworthy of this country’s history and
Constitution.  The suggestion of legislating broad criminal laws and then
attempting to cure the overbreadth by the conferral of prosecutorial
discretion  is not to be countenanced.  The citizen has a right to know what
conduct will result in the stigma of criminal conviction and punishment.  That
knowledge should be spelled out by Parliament, not left to the whim of the Attorney
General and his or her staff.  To live under the cloud of prosecutorial
restraint is in itself punishment.  Moreover, the need for executive permission
to prosecute offers little comfort to the person whose conduct may, in the
minds of others, be unfairly stigmatized as criminal. 

 

84  At
the same time, the evil targeted by Parliament -- the taking or keeping of
children from those who have the right and responsibility to contribute to
their care and upbringing -- must not be minimized.  Unlike more trivial
defalcations of custodial obligations, child abduction constitutes an immediate
injury against not only the other parent, but more importantly against the
child, who is deprived of that parent’s care and control.  This is misconduct
of the most serious order.  Where it is done with intent, criminal sanctions
properly lie.  The line between wrongful but non-criminal failure to respect
parental rights on the one hand,  and child abduction under s. 283(1)  on the
other, lies at the point where the wrongdoer takes the child with intent to
thwart the established right (by court order or agreement) of control and care
of the other parent.  On one side of the line the remedies are civil, on the
other criminal.  Section 283(1)  draws the line at this point by requiring 
intent to deprive the other parent of possession of the child, a concept
that goes beyond mere interference with access rights or a hypothetical
possibility of a future right to possession.  While arguments can be raised for
an interpretation of s. 283(1)  that would criminalize virtually any
interference with access rights or future custody rights,  I see no reason to
strain to accept them.  Given the severity of the criminal sanction, reserved
for the most reprehensible conduct in our society, there is no reason to
interpret the section  more broadly.  Less serious breaches are better left to
civil sanctions than to the ultimate sanction of conviction and imprisonment.

 

V.  Conclusion

 

85  The
trial judge did not err in concluding that the custody agreement deprived the
mother of a right of possession sufficient to support the deprivation of
possession required by s. 283(1)  of the Criminal Code .  The error lay
rather with the Court of Appeal, which concluded that the custody agreement, as
opposed to a court order, could not affect a parent’s original right to
custody.

 

86  I
would allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.

 

\\Iacobucci J.\\

 

      The reasons of Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci
JJ. were delivered by

 

 

87                    Iacobucci J. -- I
agree with the reasons of my colleague, L’Heureux-Dubé J., and with her
disposition of this appeal.  However, I wish to make some comments that are
intended to reinforce her views and that address, in part, the approach taken
by my colleague, McLachlin J.

 

88                    I
am somewhat concerned with McLachlin J.’s emphasis on contract principles to
resolve this appeal, not only because, as L’Heureux-Dubé J. correctly mentions,
the question of contract law is a factual one for the trial court, but also
because the role of contract issues in this appeal is not as clear in my view
as it is in McLachlin J.’s.  I say this for a number of reasons.

 

 

89                    First,
it would appear that, in cases such as this one, Nova Scotia’s Family
Maintenance Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 160, supplants the common law of
contracts as it pertains to agreements between spouses on care and custody
matters.  As L’Heureux-Dubé J. points out, s. 18(4) of that Act establishes a
presumption of joint guardianship:

 

      18 . . .

 

      (4)
Subject to this Act, the father and mother of a child are joint guardians and
are equally entitled to the care and custody of the child unless otherwise

 

                        (a)
provided by the Guardianship Act; or

 

                        (b)
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

90                    However,
even more important in this respect is s. 52 of the Family Maintenance Act
(as am. by S.N.S. 1994-95, c. 6, s. 63(4)), which describes the effect of
custody agreements:

 

Registration
of agreement

 

      52 (1) A judge may, with the consent of either parties,
register in the court an agreement entered into between the parties respecting
maintenance or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges or
any amendment made to that agreement.

Inquiry into
agreement

 

      (2) Before registering an agreement pursuant to
subsection (1), a judge may inquire into the merits of the agreement and, after
giving the parties an opportunity to be heard, may vary its terms as he deems
fit.

Effect of
registration

 

      (3) An agreement, including amendments registered
pursuant to this Section, shall for all purposes have the effect of an order
for maintenance or respecting care and custody or access and visiting
privileges made under this Act.

 

 

It should also be noted that s. 4 of the Guardianship
Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 189, provides that the parents may, “by instrument
in writing executed in the presence of two witnesses”, appoint a guardian for
their child.  This provision is not relevant on the facts of this case,
however, because it is nowhere suggested that the purpose of the “agreement”
between the appellant and Seymour was to appoint a guardian.

 

91                    Pursuant
to s. 52 of the Family Maintenance Act, a registered custody
agreement may have the same effect as a court order.  If a custody agreement
could, by virtue of the common law alone, upset the statutory presumption of
joint entitlement to care and custody, then the requirement of registration in
s. 52 would be rendered meaningless -- an agreement would have the effect of an
order without being registered.

 

92                    On
the basis of the foregoing, the role of the purported custody “agreement”
between the parties can arguably be safely discounted.  The law establishes, as
a baseline, that both parents are entitled to care and custody of the child
unless a court orders otherwise:  Family Maintenance Act, s. 18(4).  An
agreement may have the effect of an order, but only if it has been registered
in the court:  s. 52.  No formal order was made in this case, and the agreement
at issue in this case appears not to have been registered.  I should pause to
mention that the order of March 10, 1992 granted “interim liberal access” to
the mother.  It could be argued that this order, by implication, grants care
and custody to the father.  However, I do not think that something as important
as a parent’s statutory right to joint custody of her child should be abrogated
except in the clearest of terms.  I suspect that the mother did not raise s.
18(4) of the Family Maintenance Act at the interim hearing, and that the
judge’s decision to grant “interim liberal access” consequently reflects
unawareness of that provision.  And in any case, if it were found that the
order of March 10, 1992 was an order respecting custody, s. 283  would not even
apply.  The relevant provision of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , would then be s. 282 .

 

93                    Therefore,
as there was no order made by the court otherwise, there was no evidence before
it that might upset the statutory presumption of joint care and custody.  Both
parents retained their entitlement to care and custody of the child. 
Consequently, it cannot be said, on the basis of the agreement, that the
appellant did not take Michael from the possession of his mother.

 

94                    However,
even if I were to accept that the common law governs in this case, I still
would have trouble with the argument advanced by my colleague.  It is one of
the features of the law of contracts that the freedom of the parties to arrange
their own affairs will in certain cases yield to concerns of policy.  For
reasons of equity, terms are often implied that do not exist on a literal
reading of the instrument.  In a case such as this one, it may well be that a
fair implication is that any giving up of custody by one parent is subject to
the condition that the other parent should not abscond with the child.  Thus,
even if the parents did agree that the father should have care and custody of
the child, arguably it was not in the contemplation of the mother to authorize
the spiriting of the child out of the country.  I acknowledge the contrary
argument, namely, that, if this implied term were accepted, parents would be
unable to conclude binding agreements respecting custody.  However, I do not
mean to suggest that no agreement could ever confer unfettered care and custody
on one parent.  My point is that the inquiry must be an ad hoc one to be
determined according to all circumstances of the case.  I have simply not seen
sufficient evidence concerning the agreement in this case to say whether it
might have conferred absolute care and custody on the father.  And, as
L’Heureux-Dubé J. has said, it is not the role of this Court to settle the
precise legal significance of whatever agreement might have existed between the
appellant and Seymour because that matter is not properly before us.

 

95                    My
final comments relate to the role that intent plays in narrowing the scope of
s. 283 .  I agree that intent can in many cases be inferred from conduct. 
However, if this is so it is because the inference makes sense.  To impugn or
make light of the inference from conduct to intent is to challenge one of the
most fundamental inferences known to criminal evidence.  No trier of fact,
however clairvoyant, is privy to the thoughts of the accused.  The indicia of
intent are generally external, but they are not for that reason unreliable. 
If, having heard all the evidence, a judge or a jury concludes that an accused
acted with a certain intent, chances are good that the accused did act with
that intent.  Although I appreciate the concern that a parent who inadvertently
and only technically breaches the other parent’s custody rights may face
imprisonment, I wish to emphasize that the mens rea of the offence is
not simply the intention to take the child, but the intention to take the child
from the possession of one who is entitled to that possession.  If a
parent acts with the latter kind of intent, then it is not an extraordinary
thing that he or she should face the sanction of the criminal law.  Surely the
parent whose only offence is to return his child to the custodial parent five
minutes late does not have the requisite intent, and so is unlikely to face
prosecution.  While such a parent may know that he has, in however small
a measure, deprived the custodial parent of possession of her child, it does
not follow that he intends that consequence.  Prosecution of trifling
offences under s. 283  is not to be expected, because the offence described in
s. 283  is not trifling.

 

96                    I
would dispose of the appeal as proposed by L’Heureux-Dubé J.

Pursuant to an internal investigation, the Crown
believed that H, a police officer, had provided the co-accused M, a former
president of a motorcycle club, with confidential information concerning police
surveillance of the club in return for money.  The key figure in the Crown's
investigation was G, H’s girlfriend.  At the preliminary inquiry, the Crown
called G as a competent and compellable witness, and she made a number of
statements under oath and cross-examination which incriminated H.  However,
shortly thereafter, G retained her own counsel and sought to testify again. 
This application was granted, and, in her subsequent testimony, G recanted key
portions of her previous statements, offering explanations with respect to the
events in question that were in direct contradiction to what she had previously
told the court.  Following the completion of the preliminary inquiry, and prior
to trial, G and H were legally married. The trial judge found that G was not
competent for the Crown, owing to the common law rule of spousal incompetence. 
Following the ruling on the motion, the Crown decided that it would not offer
any evidence in support of a conviction.  Accordingly, the jury rendered
directed acquittals of the two accused.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
agreed that the witness was not competent for the Crown, but held that the
evidence could have been admitted pursuant to s. 715  of the Criminal
Code  or alternatively under the principled exception to the hearsay rule
developed in Khan, Smith and B. (K.G.).  The court set
aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial.

 

Held (Sopinka,
McLachlin and Major JJ. dissenting):  The appeals should be dismissed.

 

(1)               The common law
rule of spousal incompetence should not be modified in the circumstances of
this case.

 

(2)               G’s testimony at
the preliminary inquiry cannot be read into evidence at trial pursuant to
s. 715  of the Criminal Code .

C.J. and La Forest, L’Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ.
(Sopinka, McLachlin and Major JJ. dissenting): G’s testimony at the preliminary
inquiry may be read into evidence at trial through a principled exception to
the hearsay rule.

 

                                                        _____________

 








(1)  Spousal incompetence

 

The circumstances of this
case do not warrant modifying the common law rule of spousal incompetence. 
Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were correct in holding that G was
not a competent witness for the Crown at the trial, as she had entered into a
valid and genuine marriage with H.  The common law rule is that a spouse is an
incompetent witness in criminal proceedings in which the other spouse is an
accused, except where the charge involves the person, liberty or health of the
witness spouse.  While the traditional rule has been modified by s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act , these statutory exceptions aside, the general common law rule
that the spouse of an accused, willing or not, is not competent to testify
against the accused at the behest of the Crown still
applies.  At common law, it was well accepted that the rule of spousal
incompetency renders a spouse incapable of testifying in relation to events
which occurred both before and during the marriage.  While it is true that this Court has signalled
its willingness to adapt and develop common law rules to reflect changing
circumstances in society at large, it is clear that the courts will only make
incremental changes to the common law.  By contrast,
complex changes to the law with uncertain ramifications should be left to the
legislature.  Both of the changes proposed by the Crown, whereby a spouse would
be rendered competent if the marriage was solemnized after the issuance of an
information or indictment and, alternatively, where an accused marries a
witness for the purpose of insulating that witness from being called by the
prosecution, far from being incremental, would strike at the heart of the
traditional rule of spousal incompetency.  A marriage entered into following the swearing of an
indictment may be perfectly valid and genuine, and there may indeed be a
marital bond worthy of protection. Similarly, a
marriage which is motivated by a desire to take advantage of the spousal
incompetency rule may nonetheless be a true marriage, deserving of the law’s
protection.








(2) Section 715 of the Criminal Code

 

The Court of Appeal erred
in concluding that G’s testimony before the inquiry could be read into
evidence pursuant to s. 715  of the Criminal Code .  As it presently
reads, s. 715  provides that where a person whose evidence was
given at a previous trial on the same charge or was taken in the course of the
investigation or on the preliminary inquiry refuses to be sworn or to give
evidence, or is now dead, insane, so ill as to be unable to travel or testify,
or is absent from Canada, then that person's testimony may be read as evidence
in the proceedings without further proof.  The evidence must also have been
given in the presence of the accused.  However, even if preliminary inquiry evidence
satisfies these criteria, s. 715  preserves a residual discretion in
the trial judge to exclude such evidence.  G’s marriage clearly cannot be read into
the section as grounds for admitting the transcripts of her preliminary inquiry
evidence as it does not represent a refusal to give evidence: the common law
rule of spousal incompetency disqualifies a spouse from giving evidence,
regardless of the spouse's choice.

 

(3)  Principled exception to the hearsay
rule

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ.:  The Court of Appeal was correct in
concluding that G’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry could be admitted for
the truth of its contents through a principled exception to the hearsay rule at
common law.  Evidence at trial of statements made by a witness in a prior
adjudicative proceedings represents a form of hearsay.  Under the modern principled framework for defining
exceptions to the hearsay rule, a hearsay statement will be admissible for the
truth of its contents if it meets the separate requirements of
""necessity"" and ""reliability"".  These two requirements
serve to minimize the evidentiary dangers normally associated with the evidence
of an out-of-court declarant.  Consistent with the
spirit of this modern approach, the twin requirements of ""necessity""
and ""reliability"" must always be applied in a flexible manner.  If a hearsay statement satisfies these
two requirements, the trial judge may put the statement to the trier of fact,
subject to appropriate safeguards and to cautions regarding weight.  At the same time, this modern framework should also be applied in
a manner which preserves and reinforces the integrity of the traditional rules
of evidence.  Accordingly, the new hearsay analysis should not permit the
admission of statements which the declarant, if he or she had been available
and competent at trial, would not have been able to offer into evidence through
direct testimony because of the operation of an evidentiary rule of
admissibility.

 








Under the modern principled
framework, hearsay evidence will be necessary in circumstances where the
declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and where the party is unable to
obtain evidence of a similar quality from another source.  Here G was
unavailable to testify on behalf of the Crown for the purposes of the necessity
criterion.  The prosecution could not call upon G to testify as a result of her
spousal incompetency, and there was no other means of presenting evidence of a
similar value before the court.  The requirement of
reliability will be satisfied where the hearsay statement was made in
circumstances which provide sufficient guarantees of its trustworthiness.  In
particular, the circumstances must counteract the traditional evidentiary
dangers associated with hearsay.  The criterion of reliability is concerned with threshold reliability,
not ultimate reliability.  The ultimate reliability of the statement, and the
weight to be attached to it, remain determinations for the trier of fact.  A witness's testimony before a preliminary inquiry will generally
satisfy this threshold test of reliability since there are sufficient
guarantees of trustworthiness.  The surrounding circumstances of such
testimony, particularly the presence of an oath or affirmation and the
opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination, more than adequately
compensate for the trier of fact's inability to observe the demeanour of the
witness in court.  The absence of the witness at trial goes to the weight of
such testimony, not to its admissibility.  G’s statements before the inquiry satisfy the criterion
of reliability.   They were made under oath before a properly constituted
preliminary inquiry, and they were subject to the opportunity of
contemporaneous cross-examination by counsel for both accused. 
As well, G’s statements were transcribed under circumstances which support
their authenticity.

 








Even where a particular hearsay statement satisfies
the criteria of necessity and reliability under the reformed framework, the
statement remains subject to the judge's residual discretion to exclude the
statement where its probative value is slight and undue prejudice might result
to the accused.  Here the
trial judge should not have exercised his discretion to exclude the evidence of
G's testimony before the preliminary inquiry.  The risk of undue prejudice
arising from her testimony did not substantially exceed the potential probative
value of such evidence at trial.  G’s prior testimony
was not  devoid of probative
value as a result of the internal contradictions of her testimony.  The simple fact of recantation does not provide a basis for the
exclusion of a witness's testimony.  Nor did G’s exposure to numerous outside influences deprive her
testimony of its potential probative value.  Notwithstanding
the contradictions in and outside influences upon G's testimony, the trier of
fact may indeed derive significant probative value from her statements at the
preliminary inquiry.  Finally, the reception of G's prior testimony through a
principled exception to the hearsay rule would not result in undue prejudice or
unfairness to H.  There is no evidence indicating how the admission of G’s
preliminary inquiry testimony would actually prejudice the accused and the
trial process.  Nor would admitting the statements undermine H’s relationship
with G.  If G was compelled to testify at trial for the prosecution following
her marriage with H, his marital harmony would indeed be jeopardized.  However,
his marital bond would not be similarly threatened if the prosecution simply
read into evidence the testimony which G willingly gave before an adjudicative
proceeding prior to the marriage.

 

In the balance of considerations, and notwithstanding
considerations of “unfairness” to the accused in his marital relationship, the risk of prejudice arising from the
admission of G's preliminary inquiry testimony did not significantly exceed the
potential probative value of such evidence at trial.  The trial judge should
not have exercised his residual discretion to exclude her testimony, and the
transcripts ought to have been put to the trier of fact, subject to appropriate
safeguards and instructions.  The Crown would of course be obliged to present G’s preliminary
inquiry testimony before the trier of fact in its entirety.

 

Per La Forest and
L’Heureux-Dubé JJ.:  In determining whether statements made by a spouse prior
to trial can be admitted for their substantive content as exceptions to the
hearsay rule, the threshold question which must be asked is whether the
evidence is precluded from being admitted because it is barred by the spousal
incompetence rule.  If the answer to this question is in the negative, there is
no need to consider “fairness” on a case-by-case basis.  The evidence obtained
from the witness in this case, in the form of  testimony at a preliminary
inquiry, fits rather easily into the principled exception to the hearsay rule. 
Since it was not created in a manner which offends the spousal incompetence
rule, there is no need to prevent its admission.

 








The spousal incompetence rule does not prevent the
admission of the out-of-court statements of a spouse.  The rule is grounded in
the common law, and its scope is thus subject to the interpretation of the
courts.  The incompetence of a witness does not necessarily preclude the
admission of his or her evidence by another route.  Evidentiary principles
which constrain the truth-seeking process should be carefully tailored so that
they do not exceed what is strictly necessary to accomplish the goal for which
they are designed.  Two surviving policy grounds support the spousal
incompetence rule: preventing the threat to marital harmony, and avoiding the
natural repugnance of compelling a spouse to testify and having to witness this
“spectacle” in court.  Since the second rationale is not of concern where the
evidence of a spouse is adduced through a hearsay exception, the question to be
considered is whether a complete exclusionary rule to statements made prior to
trial is warranted on the basis of marital harmony.

 

The marital harmony rationale becomes considerably
less convincing where the evidence is tendered via a third party and not by the
spouse on the witness stand.  First, the spouse who makes the statement is not
put through the stress of having to decide whether or not to testify, as this
choice is already made by the time the trial occurs and the Crown seeks to
admit the statement.  Second, the husband and wife will not be put through the
strain of actually sitting through the difficult testimony at trial, and having
to face each other directly as accuser and accused.  Finally, most of the
damaging effect to the marriage will already have occurred by the trial. 
Balanced against this reduced threat to marital harmony are two pressing
rationales which weigh heavily in favour of allowing the admission of this
evidence: the recognition that the spousal incompetence rule severely hinders
the freedom of individual choice, and the fact that the trial is primarily a
truth-seeking inquiry.

 

The totality of these concerns tilts the balance
decidedly in favour of admitting the evidence.  The need to allow individuals to
freely choose whether to speak, and the importance of the trial as a
truth-seeking inquiry designed to redress harms to society, outweigh any need
to prevent the reduced threat to marital harmony where the statement is made
prior to trial.  It is not strictly necessary to decide the competence question
here as the witness is clearly not willing to testify.








Per La Forest J.:  The
issue of competency, which it is not strictly necessary to address here since
the wife in this case is unwilling to testify, would raise issues on a quite
different plane from those raised by the question of compellability.  A rule
prohibiting a spouse from testifying if he or she so wishes raises serious
questions about whether it unreasonably infringes on a person’s liberty and
equality interests protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
Such an infringement would require justification at a level akin to that
followed in the case of an alleged breach of Charter  rights by
legislative means.  With respect to the wife’s evidence given voluntarily at
the preliminary hearing, if it is hearsay, it is admissible under the
principled exception to the hearsay rule.  If it is not hearsay, it is highly
relevant evidence and there is no reason to reject it:  it was not covered by
the rule of spousal immunity, and the considerations that favour its admission
under the principled exception to the hearsay rule militate against exclusion
under the broad discretionary rule described in Corbett and Potvin.

 








Per Sopinka, McLachlin
and Major JJ. (dissenting):  The principled exception to the hearsay rule
created by the majority to allow hearsay statements of incompetent spouses into
evidence violates the policy underlying s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act 
by forcing spouses to provide evidence against each other.  The common law
recognized in s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act  has the main policy
goals of the maintenance of marital harmony and the prevention of the natural
repugnance that results in having one testify against his or her accused
spouse.  While the policy supporting s. 4  may be seen to militate against
the search for truth, for the overriding reason of marital harmony, it is
grounded in statute and is recognized in the provisions of the Canada
Evidence Act  so that if it is to be changed it clearly falls to Parliament
to do so.  Should the previous testimony of G be used to convict H,  it would
violate the policy foundation of s. 4  and have the potential to destroy an
otherwise successful marriage.  This is so whether the evidence is given at the
trial or given at the preliminary hearing before the marriage and read in at
the trial.  The admission of the evidence offends both the letter and the
spirit of the spousal incompetence rule.  The Crown would not be permitted to
obtain through direct testimony the evidence it is attempting to introduce
through a principled exception to the hearsay rule.  G could not take the stand
at trial.  Reading in her testimony from the preliminary inquiry equates with
forcing her to give testimony against her husband.  This is using the so-called
back door to overcome the prohibition acknowledged in s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act .  A principled exception to hearsay should not be used to
allow the Crown to introduce lower quality evidence when they are barred by the
spousal incompetence rule from introducing direct testimony from her to the
same effect.  This violates the law and is contrary to express legislative
policy.

Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 








1                                  
The Chief Justice and Iacobucci
J. -- The co-appellant Kevin Roy Hawkins was a police officer with the
Waterloo Regional Police Force.  Pursuant to an internal investigation of
Hawkins conducted in 1987-88, the Crown believed that Hawkins had provided the
co-appellant Claude Morin, a former president of the Satan's Choice Motor Cycle
Club, with confidential information concerning police surveillance of the Club
in return for money.  The key figure in the Crown's investigation was Cherie
Graham, the girlfriend of Hawkins.  At the time of the preliminary inquiry, the
Crown called Graham as a competent and compellable witness, and Graham made a
number of statements under oath and cross-examination which incriminated
Hawkins.  However, shortly after this appearance, Graham retained her own counsel
and sought to testify again.  This application was granted, and, in her
subsequent testimony, Graham recanted key portions of her previous statements,
offering explanations with respect to the events in question that were in
direct contradiction to what she had previously told the court.  Following the
completion of the preliminary inquiry, and prior to trial, Graham and Hawkins
were legally married.

 

2                                  
The question in these appeals is whether the Crown should have been able
to compel Graham to testify at trial, and if not, whether the Crown should have
been able to read her preliminary inquiry testimony into evidence at trial. 
The trial judge found that Graham was not competent for the Crown, owing to the
common law rule of spousal incompetence.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
agreed that the witness was not competent for the Crown, but held that the
evidence could have been admitted pursuant to s. 715  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , or under the principled exception to the hearsay rule as
developed in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, R. v. Smith, [1992]
2 S.C.R. 915, and R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740.  The minority
would have admitted the evidence through a modification of the common law rule
of spousal incompetence, such that a spouse would only be incompetent if
married to the accused person at the time of the charge.

 








3                                  
In our view, the circumstances of this case do not warrant modifying the
common law rule of spousal incompetence.  Both the trial judge and the Court of
Appeal were correct in holding that Graham was not a competent witness for the
Crown at the trial, as she had entered into a valid and genuine marriage with
the co-appellant Hawkins.  The Court of Appeal was incorrect in concluding that
the testimony of Graham before the inquiry could be read into evidence pursuant
to s. 715  of the Criminal Code .  However, in our opinion, the Court of
Appeal was correct in concluding that the testimony could be admitted for the
truth of its contents through a principled exception to the hearsay rule at
common law.  The statements of Graham before the preliminary inquiry satisfy
the requirements of necessity and reliability under the Khan, Smith
and B. (K.G.) framework.  While the trial judge enjoyed a residual
discretion to exclude her prior statements, we are not persuaded that the risk
of prejudice to Hawkins and Morin outweighs the probative value of the
statements.  The Crown was entitled to put these statements to the trier of
fact, subject to appropriate considerations and instructions relating to
weight.  Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeals and affirm the order of a
new trial.

 

I.  Factual
and Procedural Background

 

4                                  
During the early 1980s, the co-appellant Constable Kevin Roy Hawkins was
assigned responsibility for gathering intelligence on the activities of
motorcycle clubs, in particular the Satan's Choice Motor Cycle Club, operating
within the Kitchener-Waterloo area.  At the time, the co-appellant Claude Morin
was the president of the Satan's Choice Club in Kitchener.  Pursuant to an
internal police investigation of Hawkins, the Crown believed that Hawkins had
provided Morin with confidential information relating to on-going police
surveillance of the Club's alleged trafficking activities, and that Hawkins had
received a $5,000 bribe from Morin in exchange for his assistance.  The
cornerstone of the investigation was the information provided by Cherie Graham.

 

5                                  
Cherie Graham was a dancer at the Breslau Hotel in Kitchener.  Hawkins
met Graham at the hotel in March 1984.  Hawkins was married at the time, but he
soon left his wife and moved in with Graham.  In the ensuing years, the two
embarked on several joint financial ventures, including the management of a
donut shop and the purchase and sale of a number of houses.

 








6                                  
The relationship, however, was stormy and volatile and was marked by a
series of separations and reconciliations.  In March 1987, Graham confided in
two friends (who were police officers) that Hawkins was physically abusive
towards her.  She also told them that Hawkins had engaged in questionable
dealings with Morin.  On the basis of this information, the police opened an
investigation into Hawkins.

 

7                                  
On June 22, 1987, in response to further threats from Hawkins, Graham
formally contacted the police and was interviewed by Sgt. Doug Lawrence. 
During this taped conversation, Graham disclosed more details of her
boyfriend's involvement with Morin.  More specifically, she stated that Hawkins
had received $5,000 from Morin in exchange for information relating to on-going
police investigations, and that Hawkins was expecting to receive a further
$7,000 to $10,000 from a planned drug transaction.  On November 28, 1987,
Graham met with Sergeant Lawrence again.  During that brief conversation (also
taped), Graham generally confirmed her previous statements.  She also said that
Hawkins had become increasingly suspicious of her, and that she feared for her
safety.

 

8                                  
On November 29 and 30, Hawkins spoke with Inspector J. MacDonald on the
telephone.  He asked the inspector whether marriage to Graham would render her
non-compellable.  A week later, Hawkins made similar inquiries to Staff
Sergeant Koniuch and the two men concluded that spouses were competent but not
compellable to testify against one another.  Hawkins then said to Koniuch:
""I guess I'm going to have to marry her.""

 








9                                  
On January 29, 1988, Hawkins and Morin were jointly charged with
conspiracy to obstruct justice under ss. 465(1) (c) and 139(2)  of the Criminal
Code .  Hawkins was also charged with having corruptly accepted money and
obstruction of justice under ss. 120(a) and 139(2) of the Code. 
Over the following months, Graham and Hawkins stayed in contact and met to
discuss the possibility of marriage as a means of preventing Graham’s
testifying at trial.

 

10                              
At the end of March, Hawkins, his lawyer and Graham met to discuss the
effects of marriage upon Graham's competence and compellability for the Crown. 
On June 16, 1988, Hawkins spoke to Constable Stuebing about marrying Graham so
that she would be incompetent for the Crown.

 

11                              
In July 1988, Graham left Hawkins to enter the witness protection
program.

 








12                              
A preliminary inquiry was convened on September 7 and 8, 1988. 
The Crown called Graham as a competent and compellable witness.  Under oath,
Graham described her abusive relationship with Hawkins, and repeated the
contents of her two conversations with Sergeant Lawrence.  In particular, she testified that Hawkins and Morin
were friends.  Morin would frequently call Hawkins at home during the evenings,
and Hawkins would then go and meet Morin.  Graham stated that one night Hawkins
came home with an envelope containing $5,000 which he told her Morin had given
him in exchange for information in relation to police surveillance.  She stated
that Hawkins told her that he was expecting to receive another $7,000 to
$10,000 from Morin in relation to a narcotic transaction, but the transaction
ultimately fell through.  Graham further testified that Hawkins had brought
photographs of bikers and copies of police files on individual bikers to their
home which he later gave to Morin.  Finally, she acknowledged that she and
Hawkins had previously discussed marriage as a means of avoiding her appearance
before the court.  Graham's testimony was subject to
cross-examination by four defence counsel (counsel for the two appellants, as
well as counsel for two other accused), but she stood by the substance of her
statements.  Her testimony was transcribed, but it was not completely recorded
on audiotapes.

 

13                              
On October 3, 1988, Graham retained independent counsel and asked the
court to be recalled as a witness.  The judge granted her request over the
Crown's objection, and a continuation of the inquiry was scheduled for January
19, 1989, and February 20, 1989.  In the intervening period, Graham removed
herself from the witness protection program and reconciled with Hawkins.  The
couple purchased a house together, but Hawkins continued to live in a separate
apartment.  A judicial order was issued in December prohibiting Hawkins from
communicating with Graham, but it appears that she nonetheless continued to
communicate with Hawkins.

 

14                              
In her second appearance before the inquiry, Graham recanted most of her
earlier testimony with respect to Hawkins' alleged corrupt dealings with
Morin.  She explained that most of her previous testimony, as well as her
earlier recorded conversations with Sergeant Lawrence, had been coached by the
police.  She did not retract her previous statements in relation to her fear of
Hawkins, his threats of abuse and violence, his threats to her life, his
friendly connections with Morin, or her discussions with Hawkins on marriage as
a means for preventing her from testifying at trial.

 

15                              
Hawkins and Morin were committed to stand trial on March 21, 1989.  One
week later, Hawkins and Graham obtained a marriage licence, and, on March 31,
1989, they were married.  At the date of this Court's hearing, the couple
remained married.

III.  Judgments
Below

 

A.                Ontario
District Court -- Motion

 

17                              
In a pre-trial motion before LeSage Dist. Ct. J. (as he then was), the
Crown sought a declaration that Graham was a competent and compellable witness
for the Crown.  The Crown argued that the marriage was a ""sham""
entered into for the sole purpose of preventing Graham from being called as a
prosecution witness at trial.  Alternatively, the Crown argued that Graham's
prior testimony before the preliminary inquiry was admissible under s. 715 of
the Code.

 

18                              
On July 27, 1990, LeSage Dist. Ct. J. denied the motion.  He concluded
that the marriage was ""valid and legitimate"", and did not represent a
""sham"".  As well, he held that s. 715  could not be used to circumvent
the common law rule of spousal incompetence.  Upon a further motion by the
appellants, on December 24, 1990, LeSage J. stayed the prosecution on grounds
of unreasonable delay.  However, the Ontario Court of Appeal subsequently set
aside the stay and remitted the matter to the General Division for trial: 
(1991), 52 O.A.C. 114, aff’d [1992] 3 S.C.R. 463.

 








B.                Ontario
Court (General Division) -- Trial

 

19                              
At the outset of the trial, a new motion was brought before Philp J. to
have Graham declared a competent and compellable witness for the Crown.  While
the Crown abandoned its original position, conceding that the marriage was
genuine, it now contended that, since one of the purposes of the marriage was
to frustrate the administration of justice, the traditional common law rule
should not be allowed to operate.  In support of its position, the Crown relied
on Hawkins' inquiries to his fellow officers, and Graham's admission before the
preliminary inquiry that the couple had discussed marriage as a means of
avoiding her appearance at trial.  The Crown also continued to argue that even
if Graham was not competent and compellable, her original testimony before the
preliminary inquiry ought to be admitted under s. 715 of the Code, or
under a principled exception to the hearsay rule.

 

20                              
Philp J. denied the motion.  He found that Graham was not a competent or
compellable witness for the Crown.  He acknowledged the incremental change to
the common law rule made by this Court in R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 654, but declined to create a new exception to the rule where the
accused has entered into a ""marriage of convenience"".   He concluded
that such an exception would be contrary to the very purpose of spousal
incompetence, which is ""to preserve marital harmony and also to prevent
the natural repugnancy that results in a spouse testifying against his or her
accused spouse"".

 








21                              
Philp J. further found that Graham's preliminary inquiry testimony could
not be admitted under s. 715 of the Code.  In his view, the spousal
incompetency of Graham did not amount to a refusal to give evidence, as
required by the section.  In the alternative, Philp J. found that admitting the
evidence would operate unfairly against Hawkins.  Therefore, he chose to
exercise his discretion, which is preserved by s. 715 , to exclude evidence
which would unduly prejudice the accused.  The prejudice would arise from the
difficulty facing the trier of fact in judging the truthfulness of Graham's
statements from written transcripts or from the playing of audio tapes.  Philp
J. also found that it would be unfair to permit the Crown to read Graham's preliminary
inquiry testimony into evidence when it was barred from admitting the same
evidence through direct testimony.

 

22                              
Finally, Philp J. held that Graham's prior testimony could not be
admitted under a principled exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to Khan,
Smith, and B. (K.G.).  The trial judge was satisfied that the
requirement of necessity was met, but he was not persuaded that the prior
testimony before the inquiry was sufficiently reliable.  He was particularly
troubled by the fact that the jury would not have the opportunity to observe
the demeanour and expressions of Graham in the witness box.  Furthermore, he
underscored the contradictory nature of her successive statements, and the
numerous external influences which may have permanently contaminated her
testimony.  As he explained:

 

 

. . . because of the events leading up to the giving of the two
versions, the involvement of the police, the involvement of Mr. Hawkins, and
the many threats made against Ms. Graham, the beatings to which she was subjected
and the promises apparently held out to her by the police, as well as the
apparent influence the police had on her in obtaining the statements, and then
the subsequent testimony in September which was given while she was under the
witness protection programme, then the subsequent January recantation after
having spent some time back with her husband, I cannot find the necessary
ingredient of reliability necessary to allow her prior evidence to be read into
this trial.

 

 








He noted that,
even if the statements satisfied the requirements of reliability and necessity,
they should nonetheless be excluded because the risk of prejudice outweighed
the probative value of the evidence.  Furthermore, the creation of a principled
exception in this instance would undermine the purpose of the common law rule
of spousal incompetency and endanger the harmony of the accused's marriage.

 

23                              
Following the ruling on the motion, the Crown decided that it would not
offer any evidence in support of a conviction.  Accordingly, the jury rendered
directed acquittals of the two appellants on May 25, 1993.

 

C.                Ontario
Court of Appeal (1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 229

 

1.  Arbour J.A. (Galligan J.A. concurring)

 

24                              
On February 28, 1995, a majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal  allowed
the appeal.  Arbour J.A. found that Graham was incompetent and uncompellable to
testify against Hawkins, as the marriage between Graham and Hawkins was still
in existence.  In her view, so long as the marriage is not fraudulent or a
sham, marital partners are entitled to the full legal benefits which the union
entails.  She rejected the Crown’s invitation to create an exception to the
common law rule.

 








25                              
However, Arbour J.A. found that Graham's previous testimony before the
preliminary inquiry could be admitted under s. 715 of the Code.  She was
of the view that Graham's decision to wed Hawkins was equivalent to a
""refusal to testify"", as ""[Graham] deliberately put herself
beyond the reach of the court"" (p. 242).  Unlike the trial judge, Arbour
J.A. was satisfied that the admission of the statements under s. 715  would not
result in unfairness to the accused.  She did not believe that it would be
unfair for the jury to weigh the contradictory statements without an
opportunity to witness Graham's demeanour in the stand.  Furthermore, the
admission of such statements through s. 715  would not indirectly circumvent the
purpose of the spousal incompetency rule.  As she explained (at pp. 243-44),
“Cherie Graham cannot be called by the Crown to give evidence.  It does not
follow, however, that her evidence is inadmissible if it can be put before the
court by some other means”.

 

26                              
Alternatively, Arbour J.A. was persuaded that the statements could be
admitted under a principled exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to Khan,
Smith, and B. (K.G.).  The dual criteria of necessity and
reliability were both satisfied in this instance.  She agreed that it was
reasonably necessary to admit the hearsay evidence of Graham, because of her
unavailability for trial.  With regard to reliability, while there were serious
contradictions in Graham's testimony, Arbour J.A. stressed that ""when
reliability is used as a condition of admissibility of hearsay evidence, it
must not be confused with the ultimate reliability or truth of the hearsay
statement"" (p. 245).  Rather, the examination of reliability must focus on
circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, in particular, the opportunity of
contemporaneous cross-examination, the administration of an oath, and the
presence of the declarant in court.  While the admission of Graham's previous
testimony would lack the third circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness,
Arbour J.A. nonetheless concluded that the statements were sufficiently
reliable (at pp. 249-50):

 








The evidence which [the Crown] sought to have
admitted in this case was an accurately recorded sworn statement which was
fully cross-examined in the presence of the respondents by their counsel.  I do
not wish to overstate the importance of actual cross-examination.  A mere
opportunity to cross-examine may suffice to render the statement admissible, as
is the case under s. 715 of the Code.  In this case, a full cross-examination
did take place.  Thus, the only possible hearsay danger that would stand in
the way of admissibility is what was referred to in K.G.B. as
""presence"".  Considering the circumstantial guarantees of
trustworthiness offered by the oath and cross-examination, that single factor
is insufficient, in my opinion, to provide a principled basis upon which to bar
the admissibility of Cherie Graham's evidence.  Had she died, become ill,
left the country, or had she stated in court that she refused to testify, the
Crown would have been entitled to introduce her evidence given at the
preliminary inquiry without having to show that it was ""reliable"".  I
can find nothing in the principles upon which the hearsay rule is based which
commands a different result in this case.  [Emphasis added.]

 

27                              
She rejected the claim that the admission of such evidence under a
principled exception would operate unfairly against the accused, maintaining 
that, if Hawkins needed to, he could always call Graham as a witness (at p.
250):

 

I find the proposition that an accused is being treated unfairly by
being deprived an opportunity to cross-examine the evidence of a witness that
only he can call to be untenable.

 

Thus, subject
to proper instructions to the jury, Arbour J.A. would have permitted Graham’s
testimony to be read into evidence at trial.

 

2.    Weiler J.A. (concurring in the result)

 

28                              
Weiler J.A. would have similarly allowed the appeal, but for different
reasons.  She first considered s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act , and
noted that it does not ratify the common law rule of spousal incompetence, but
rather, presumes its existence and restricts its application in the
circumstances described in subss. (2) and (4).  Section 4(5)  allows a spouse to
be called as a witness without the consent of the other spouse where the common
law permits an exception to the rule of spousal incompetence.  These common law
exceptions, as stated in Salituro, supra, are not static, but
evolve over time.

 








29                              
Weiler J.A. identified two conflicting values at stake: the public
interest in a fair trial and the preservation of marital harmony.  Because she
rejected the submission that Graham’s evidence could be admitted pursuant to s.
715 , she found that the only way to ensure a fair trial was to make Graham a
competent and compellable witness for the Crown.  This required a modification
of the common law rule of spousal incompetence.

 

30                              
According to Weiler J.A., the timing of a marriage is a relevant
consideration in the application of the competency rule.  She referred to s.
4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act , which says:

 

Nothing in this section affects a case where the
wife or husband of a person charged with an offence may at common law be called
as a witness without the consent of that person.

 

In her view, a
plain reading of this section indicates that the rule of spousal incompetency
should only apply to persons who were married at the time the spouse was
charged.  Since Hawkins married Graham following the indictment, Weiler J.A.
found that the Crown could compel Graham to testify.

 

31                              
However, the modified rule would limit the spouse’s testimony to
conversations which occurred prior to the marriage.  In this way, the
competency rule would be made consistent with the spousal privilege accorded by
s. 4(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act .

 

32                              
In contrast to the majority, Weiler J.A. declined to admit Graham's
previous testimony through the operation of s. 715 .  She concluded that the
language of s. 715  could not be read so as to encompass a witness rendered
incompetent by virtue of her ""condition or state"" (p. 268).








 

33                              
Weiler J.A. went on to hold that the statements of Graham given before
the inquiry could not be read into evidence through a principled exception to the
hearsay rule.  In her view, the statements did not satisfy the threshold test
of reliability as articulated in Smith and B. (K.G.).  More
specifically, the statements lacked sufficient circumstantial guarantees of
trustworthiness: the oath had apparently had no effect on Graham's veracity
before the inquiry; and the trier of fact would have no opportunity to observe
Graham's demeanour at trial.

 

34                              
The co-appellants appeal to this Court as of right from the overturning
of an acquittal under s. 691(2)(a) of the Code.

 

IV.  Issues

 

35                              
1.    Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in holding that the common law
rule of spousal incompetency should not be modified in the circumstances of
this case?

 

2.                Did the Ontario Court of Appeal
err in holding that transcripts of Graham's preliminary inquiry testimony could
be read in at trial pursuant to s. 715  of the Criminal Code ?

 

3.                Did the Ontario Court of Appeal
err in holding that Graham's preliminary inquiry testimony was admissible
through a principled exception to the hearsay rule?

 








V.  Analysis

 

A.                Should the common law rule of
spousal incompetency be modified?

 

36                              
The common law rule is that a spouse is an incompetent witness in
criminal proceedings in which the other spouse is an accused, except where the charge
involves the person, liberty or health of the witness spouse.  See, e.g., Lord
Audley's Case (1631), Hutt. 115, 123 E.R. 1140,  at p. 1141; Bentley v.
Cooke (1784), 3 Doug. K.B. 422, 99 E.R. 729; R. v. Bissell (1882), 1
O.R. 514 (Q.B.).  The traditional rule has been modified by the passage of the Canada
Evidence Act .  Section 4(1) of the Act makes a spouse competent to testify
on behalf of the accused in a criminal trial, and s. 4(2)  makes the spouse both
competent and compellable for the Crown for certain specified offences which
generally tend to implicate the health and security of the witness spouse.  But
these statutory exceptions aside, the Act otherwise preserves the general
common law rule that the spouse of an accused, willing or not, is not competent
to testify against the accused at the behest of the Crown.

 








37                              
At common law, it was
well accepted that the rule of spousal incompetency renders a spouse incapable
of testifying in relation to events which occurred both before and during
the marriage: Pedley v. Wellesley (1829), 3 C. & P. 558, 172 E.R.
545.  See Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8, at § 2230.  This
principle was more recently underscored by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R.
v. Lonsdale (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 201.  Citing common law authorities
continued under s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act , Sinclair J.A. held
for the Court of Appeal, at p. 203, that the Crown may not call the spouse of
an accused as a competent witness to testify in relation to events which
occurred prior to the marriage.

 

 

38                              
Numerous justifications for the rule have been advanced over the history
of the common law, but only two appear to have survived to the modern era.  As
originally noted by Lord Coke, in his Institutes of the Laws of England,
the first justification for the rule is that it promotes conjugal confidences
and protects marital harmony.  The second justification is that the rule
prevents the indignity of conscripting an accused’s spouse to participate in
the accused’s own prosecution.  Wigmore describes this latter justification as
the “natural repugnance in every fair-minded person to compelling a wife
or husband to be the means of the other’s condemnation, and to compelling the
culprit to the humiliation of being condemned by the words of his intimate life
partner” (emphasis in original):  Wigmore on Evidence, supra,
vol. 8, § 2228, at p. 217.

 

39                              
However, as this Court recognized in Salituro, supra, at
pp. 672-73, serious criticisms have been levelled against these two surviving
justifications of the traditional rule.  It has been called arbitrary for
excluding other familial relationships, and antiquated, because it is based on
outmoded notions of marriage.  Perhaps most importantly, rendering a person
incapable of testifying solely on the basis of marital status does strip an
individual of key aspects of his or her autonomy.  As Iacobucci J. noted for
the Court at p. 673:

 

 








There is in my opinion a more fundamental
difficulty with the reasons for the rule.  The grounds which have been used in
support of the rule are inconsistent with respect for the freedom of all
individuals, which has become a central tenet of the legal and moral fabric of
this country particularly since the adoption of the Charter . . . .The
common law rule making a spouse an incompetent witness involves a conflict
between the freedom of the individual to choose whether or not to testify and
the interests of society in preserving the marriage bond.

 

40                              
Some have suggested an alternative approach whereby a spouse
could be declared competent against his or her spouse, but not compellable. 
The United Kingdom recently endorsed such a rule with the passage of s. 80 of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (U.K.), 1984, c. 60.  For a
discussion of the Act, see Cross and Tapper on Evidence (8th ed. 1995),
at pp. 236-40; Phipson on Evidence (14th ed. 1990), at pp. 154-55.  The
United States Supreme Court adopted a similar modification of the common law
rule.  The court held that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a spouse
is a competent but not compellable witness for the prosecution, with the
witness spouse having the privilege to refuse to testify adversely: Trammel
v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980).  See Uniform Rules of Evidence,
Rule 504.  In Canada, the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of
Evidence has also recommended the abolition of the traditional rule in favour
of a modern rule which makes a spouse a competent but not compellable witness
for the prosecution:  Report of
the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence (1982), at
pp. 256-60; Uniform Rules of Evidence, s. 92(1). See also, Law Reform
Commission of Canada, Report on Evidence (1975), at pp. 88-90 (Evidence
Code, at ss. 54-57) (recommendation that spouse of accused be competent but not
compellable if the value of the testimony outweighs any potential disruption to
the relationship).

 








41                              
Another possible alternative, recognized in Salituro, supra,
at p. 676, is that the spouse of an accused could be declared as both a
competent and a compellable witness for the Crown.  This would be
consistent with the general common law rule that competence implies
compellability.  See Hoskyn v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, [1979]
A.C. 474 (H.L.), at p. 484, per Lord Wilberforce, at p. 500, per
Lord Edmund-Davies.  In Canada, see
Gosselin v. The King (1903), 33 S.C.R. 255, at pp. 276-77 (spouse of
accused both competent and compellable by prosecution, prior to An Act
further to amend The Canada Evidence Act, 1893, S.C. 1906, c. 10, s. 1);
Re Spencer and The Queen (1983), 145 D.L.R. (3d) 344 (Ont. C.A.), at p.
351  aff’d [1985] 2 S.C.R. 278; R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R.
451, at p. 522, per Iacobucci J. (“the general rule that witnesses are
compellable”), and at pp. 619-20, per Sopinka J.  The Law Reform Commission
of Canada has previously argued that making the witness spouse both competent
and compellable would relieve the witness of the difficult pressures of
choosing to testify against his or her life partner.  The Commission has
further contended that such an approach would open the artificially closed list
of offences defined in s. 4(2)  and 4(4)  of the Canada Evidence Act .  See
Law of Evidence Project, Study Paper No. 1, Competence and Compellability
(1972), at pp. 6-7.  It has also been argued that this approach would  reduce
the incidence of spousal abuse, as accused spouses would be unable to abuse
their competent partners to dissuade them from testifying.  See R. v.
McGinty (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 36 (Y.T.C.A.), at p. 60.  We are of the view that both these approaches, by vesting the spouse
of an accused with the choice to testify against his or her partner, are
arguably more consistent with the protection of the marital bond as well as the
autonomy and dignity of the individual.

 

42                              
While such alternative approaches to the rule of spousal incompetency
may serve to promote the autonomy and dignity of an individual spouse, it is
our opinion that any significant change to the rule should not be made by the
courts, but should rather be left to Parliament.

 








43                              
The common law rule of spousal incompetence has remained largely
unchanged for some 350 years.  The respondent has submitted that there is ample
scope for judicial development of the rule.  While it is true that this Court
has signalled its willingness to adapt and develop common law rules to reflect
changing circumstances in society at large (see, e.g., Ares v. Venner,
[1970] S.C.R. 608; Watkins v. Olafson, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750; Khan,
supra), it is clear that the courts will only make incremental
changes to the common law.  So, for example, the change implemented in Salituro,
did not strike at the original justifications of marital harmony and repugnance
which animated the substance of the common law rule.  As the Court stated at p.
674:

 

 

Where spouses are irreconcilably separated, there is no marriage bond
to protect and we are faced only with a rule which limits the capacity of the
individual to testify.

 

 

By contrast,
complex changes to the law with uncertain ramifications should be left to the
legislature.

 

44                              
On the basis of the criticisms of the common law rule, discussed above,
the respondent advanced two arguments.  First, the Crown advocated a
modification of the traditional rule along the lines suggested by Weiler J.A.,
whereby a spouse would be rendered competent if the marriage was solemnized
after the issuance of an information or indictment.  Alternatively, the
respondent invited this Court to create an exception to the rule of spousal
incompetency where an accused marries a witness for the purpose of insulating
that witness from being called by the prosecution.

 








45                              
Both of the proposed changes, far from being incremental, would
strike at the heart of the traditional rule of spousal incompetency.  A
marriage entered into following the swearing of an indictment may be perfectly
valid and genuine, and there may indeed be a marital bond worthy of protection.  Furthermore, as noted previously, this
proposed exception runs afoul of the settled view that the rule of spousal
incompetence applies to testimony relating to events which precede the marriage
(i.e., events which precede the marriage even if the marriage was solemnized
after the laying of formal charges).

 

46                              
Similarly, a marriage which is motivated by a desire to take advantage
of the spousal incompetency rule may nonetheless be a true marriage, deserving
of the law’s protection.  It has long been recognized at common law that a
spouse is entitled to rely on the benefits of spousal incompetency even if one
of the purposes of the marriage was to preclude testimony before a court.  See,
e.g., Wigmore on Evidence, supra, at §2230; Cross and Tapper
on Evidence, supra,  at p. 236 (the rule of spousal incompetency
applies “whatever the motive for marrying”).

 

47                              
In this instance, the Crown has conceded that the marriage of Hawkins
and Graham is genuine.  At the time of this Court's hearing, the couple were
approaching their seventh wedding anniversary.  There was no evidence that
either of the two partners had failed to fulfil their reciprocal obligations of
care and support.  Under the circumstances, making Graham compellable by the
Crown would threaten the couple’s genuine marital harmony and undermine the
purpose of the spousal incompetency rule.  In this regard, we note the position
of the trial judge:

 

 








I have difficulty, however, in the case at bar in being satisfied
that there does not exist at this time a good and successful marriage, hence
the need to preserve matrimonial harmony in this case still exists and must be
of paramount concern. . . . I would also be concerned with whether the
exception in this particular case would result in difficulties and
repercussions in the apparently on-going successful marriage of the witness and
the accused.

To create such an exception, thereby allowing Ms. Graham to testify,
would be contrary to the purpose of the common law rule to preserve marital
harmony and also to prevent the natural repugnancy that results in a spouse
testifying against his or her accused spouse.  It would encourage perjury by
her to preserve the marriage or, if truthful, a break-down of the marriage. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

48                              
Either of the two proposed changes to the common law rule of spousal
incompetency would amount to far more than an incremental change in the law. 
Such a change is unprecedented and of uncertain consequences.  As the trial
judge said:

 

. . .  I am of the opinion that to create such a new exception as
requested would create uncertainty as to the consequences resulting from such a
change that would be completely out of the control of the courts.

 








49                              
Furthermore, the change advocated by the respondent would be
unworkable.  It would require the courts to examine the motivation for marriage
in this case.  Absent evidence that the marriage was a sham, we fail to see how
the court can begin to inquire into the reasons for the marriage.  There is no
justification for such an inquiry unless there should be concrete evidence that
the marriage was legally invalid.  Courts and tribunals are permitted to
inquire into this most personal of realms only in specific, limited
circumstances as prescribed by the legislature or Parliament, for example, in
the immigration context (see s. 4(3) of the Immigration Regulations, 1978,
SOR/78-172, which provides that a Canadian citizen may not sponsor a spouse
where that spouse ""entered into the marriage primarily for the purpose of
gaining admission to Canada as a member of the family class and not with the
intention of residing permanently with the other spouse"").

 

50                              
We emphasize that the matter may be different if the evidence clearly
established that the only purpose of the marriage was to avoid criminal
responsibility by rendering a key witness uncompellable and that the partners
had no intention of fulfilling their mutual obligations of care and support. 
In such circumstances, the marriage would be a ""sham"", and the court
may be willing to take this into account.  For instance, in Lutwak v. United
States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the spouse of
an accused could not invoke the rule of incompetency, as the evidence clearly
demonstrated that the parties had no intention of living together as spouses. 
However, this is not the case in the Hawkins-Graham marriage.

 

51                              
For these reasons, we are in agreement with the trial judge, and
the majority of the Court of Appeal, that no modification of the common law
rule of spousal incompetence should be made in this case.  Graham was not a
competent witness for the Crown, and, accordingly,  her viva voce evidence could not be admitted
at trial.  We express no opinion as to whether Graham, even if competent, would
have also been compellable in this instance.  However,
it remains to be seen whether her evidence could have been admitted by an
alternative means.

 

B.                May Graham's
testimony before the preliminary inquiry be read into evidence at trial through
s. 715 of the Criminal Code?

 

52                              
Assuming that Graham is found to be an incompetent witness at trial, the
Crown alternatively seeks to have the transcripts of Graham's testimony before
the preliminary inquiry read into evidence under s. 715  of the Criminal Code .








 

53                              
Section 715 traces
its origins to An Act respecting the duties of Justices of the Peace, out of
Sessions, in relation to persons charged with Indictable Offences, S.C.
1869, c. 30, s. 30.  The original version of s. 715  was modelled on comparable
English legislation regarding the admission of evidence taken at preliminary
hearings.  See Administration of Justice Act (No. 1), 11 & 12 Vict.,
c. 42, s. 17 (1848).  As it presently reads, s. 715 
provides that where a person whose evidence was given at a previous trial on
the same charge or was taken in the course of the investigation or on the
preliminary inquiry refuses to be sworn or to give evidence, or is now dead,
insane, so ill as to be unable to travel or testify, or is absent from Canada,
then that person's testimony may be read as evidence in the proceedings without
further proof.  The evidence must also have been given in the presence of the
accused.  However, even if preliminary inquiry evidence satisfies these
criteria, s. 715  preserves a residual discretion in the trial judge to exclude
such evidence: R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525. 

 

54                              
Graham’s marriage clearly cannot be read into the section as grounds for
admitting the transcripts of her preliminary inquiry evidence.  The marriage of
Graham and Hawkins does not represent a refusal to give evidence: the common
law rule of spousal incompetency disqualifies a spouse from giving evidence,
regardless of the spouse's choice.  Indeed, there is no way of knowing whether
Graham actually would have refused to testify; she may have chosen to testify
for the defence.

 








55                              
For these reasons, it is our opinion that the majority of the Court of
Appeal erred in holding that transcripts of Graham's preliminary inquiry
testimony could be read in at trial pursuant to s. 715  of the Criminal Code . 
It is therefore unnecessary to express any view on the nature of a trial
judge's residual discretion to exclude previous testimony under s. 715 , and
whether this residual discretion should have otherwise been exercised in this
instance.  However, we do not believe that our conclusion regarding the
application of s. 715  necessarily precludes the potential admission of the
transcripts at common law.

 

56                              
On its face, s. 715  does not indicate whether it was intended to
displace the pre-existing common law governing the admission of prior
testimony.  Some cases earlier this century suggested that the provision was
indeed exhaustive, i.e. that preliminary inquiry evidence may only be
admitted at a criminal trial through the operation of s. 715 .  See R. v.
Snelgrove (1906), 12 C.C.C. 189 (N.S.S.C.); Cuff v. Frazee Storage &
Cartage Co. (1907), 14 O.L.R. 263 (Div. Ct.); Caufield v. The King
(1926), 48 C.C.C. 109 (Que. K.B.).  The Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Snelgrove
defended this interpretation on two separate grounds: first, the Criminal
Code  was generally intended to be a comprehensive criminal statute; second,
the predecessor of s. 8(3) of the Code (continuing common law
justifications and excuses) implicitly excluded other rules of common law. 
Professor Schiff, however, suggests that the exhaustiveness of s. 715  remains
an open question: Evidence in the Litigation Process (4th ed. 1993), at
pp. 431-32, nn. 13-14.  See, as well, The Law of Evidence in Canada, at
p. 274, n. 420.

 








57                              
We believe that the preferable interpretation is that s. 715  is not a
""comprehensive code"" governing the admissibility of preliminary
inquiry testimony.  As noted by Schiff, supra, at p. 431, the provision
was originally modelled after the Administration of Justice Act (1848)
in the United Kingdom, and English courts have held consistently that this
statute and its successors did not displace the common law.  See, e.g., R.
v. Thompson, [1982] 1 All E.R. 907 (C.A.), at p. 912.  Furthermore, this
interpretation is consistent with the Criminal Code 's general approach
to the law of evidence.  The substantive offences articulated by the Code
presume the existence of a body of rules of evidence derived from the common
law.  While the Code modifies and abolishes some rules, it does so only
in specific instances and through language to that effect.  Accordingly, if
preliminary inquiry testimony does not meet the requirements for admissibility
under s. 715 , it remains open for the trial judge to consider whether such
testimony may still be read into evidence by reference to the principles of the
common law.

 

C.                May Graham's testimony before
the preliminary inquiry be read into evidence at trial through a principled
exception to the hearsay rule?

 

58                              
The prevailing view in the common law world is that evidence at trial of
statements made by a witness in a prior adjudicative proceedings (""former
testimony"" or ""prior testimony"") represents a form of hearsay. 
The great historical opponent of this view, however, was Wigmore.  Wigmore
strongly advocated a definition of hearsay which was centred on the party's
inability to cross-examine the declarant.  Because preliminary inquiry
testimony is subject to contemporaneous cross-examination, Wigmore argued that statements
made by a declarant in prior adjudicative proceedings where cross-examination
was available were substantively admissible in a subsequent proceeding, as such
statements did not constitute hearsay.

 

59                              
However, the vast majority of scholars disagree with Wigmore and
maintain that testimony in former proceedings falls within an expansive
definition of the hearsay rule.  See Cross and Tapper on Evidence, supra,
at p. 721; McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992), vol. 2, at § 301; Phipson
on Evidence, at p. 931; The Law of Evidence in Canada, at p. 270.

 








60                              
We similarly find that such prior testimony falls within the ambit of
the hearsay rule.  In the past, this Court has generally declined to adopt a
single comprehensive definition of the hearsay rule, for fear that an
exhaustive definition of the rule may fail to capture the full breadth of
circumstances where a statement by an out-of-court declarant will raise one or
more of the traditional hearsay dangers (namely, the lack of oath, the lack of
contemporaneous cross-examination, and the lack of demeanour evidence).  See Smith,
at p. 924.  The testimony of a declarant in a prior proceeding, prima facie,
raises a hearsay danger because the trier of fact cannot examine the demeanour
of the declarant at trial.  Indeed, if such testimony did not represent hearsay,
there would be no need for provisions similar to s. 715 , as such prior
testimony would be substantively admissible in all circumstances, even if the
declarant was otherwise available to testify.

 

61                              
Regardless of the appropriate characterization of such former testimony,
the common law was historically prepared to admit such evidence either as
non-hearsay or as an exception to the hearsay rule in specific circumstances
where the declarant was generally unavailable to testify at trial.

 








62                              
Early in the history of the common law, English courts held that prior
testimony given in a previous proceeding may be read into evidence in a
subsequent civil proceeding where the parties were the same and where the
testimony was open to cross-examination:  Wright v. Doe d. Tatham (1834),
1 Ad. & E. 3, 110 E.R. 1108, at pp. 18-19, per Tindal C.J.  The
courts equally held that prior testimony could be read into evidence in
subsequent criminal proceedings for the truth of its contents where the
declarant had died prior to trial: R. v. Beeston (1854), Dears. 405, 169
E.R. 782 (C.C.A.); R. v. Lee (1864), 4 F. & F. 63, 176 E.R. 468. 
See R. v. Hall (P.B.), [1973] 1 Q.B. 496 (C.A.), at p. 504, per
Forbes J.  See Wilson J.’s discussion of the position of the common law in Potvin,
supra, at p. 540.

 

63                              
In Canada, the relevant authority on the admission of such testimony in
civil proceedings appears to be Walkertown (Town) v. Erdman
(1894), 23 S.C.R. 352.  In Erdman, the plaintiff commenced an action
against the town, and an examination de bene esse was held prior to
trial.  Erdman, however, subsequently died, and his wife pursued a distinct
action against the town.  Even in the absence of any statutory rule, the Court
held that the record of the examination was admissible, as the town had the
opportunity to cross-examine Erdman (which it in fact exercised), and the same
issues were raised in both actions.

 

64                             
Some early cases had indicated that prior testimony could only be
admitted in a criminal trial where the witness was unavailable as a result of
death or by “procurement” of the court:  R. v. Scaife (1851), 2 Den.
281, 169 E.R. 505, at p. 507.  But more modern cases have been willing to admit
such evidence in circumstances of ""unavailability"" beyond death.  See
Thompson, supra, at pp. 912-13 (prior testimony admitted in
circumstances of illness). See also  Cross
and Tapper on Evidence, at p. 721; Phipson on Evidence, at p. 933.

 

65                              
However, in Canada, the development of the common law rule for the
reception of prior testimony in criminal proceedings was halted with the
adoption of the predecessor of s. 715 of the Code shortly after
Confederation.  We believe that the proper course would be to examine whether
Graham’s preliminary inquiry evidence ought to have been admitted through a
principled exception to the hearsay rule.

 








66                              
In Khan and Smith, this Court signalled the beginning of a
modern principled framework for defining exceptions to the hearsay rule.  The
Court rejected the traditional approach of the common law premised on rigid,
categorical exceptions to the hearsay rule in favour of a more flexible
approach which seeks to give effect to the underlying purposes of the rule.  As
Lamer C.J. said in Smith, at p. 932:

 

 

. . . Khan should not be understood as turning on its particular
facts, but, instead, must be seen as a particular expression of the fundamental
principles that underlie the hearsay rule and the exceptions to it.  What is
important, in my view, is the departure signalled by Khan from a view of
hearsay characterized by a general prohibition on the reception of such
evidence, subject to a limited number of defined categorical exceptions, and a
movement towards an approach governed by the principles which underlie the rule
and its exceptions alike.

 

With this
Court's subsequent holdings in B. (K.G.), supra, and, most
recently, in R. v. U. (F.J.), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764, this new approach has
become firmly entrenched in our jurisprudence.

 

67                              
Under this reformed framework, a hearsay statement will be admissible
for the truth of its contents if it meets the separate requirements of
""necessity"" and ""reliability"".  These two requirements
serve to minimize the evidentiary dangers normally associated with the evidence
of an out-of-court declarant, namely the absence of an oath or affirmation, the
inability of the trier of fact to assess the demeanour of the declarant, and
the lack of contemporaneous cross-examination.

 

68                              
Consistent with the spirit of this modern approach, the twin
requirements of ""necessity"" and ""reliability"" must always
be applied in a flexible manner.  As Lamer C.J. stressed in U. (F.J.),
at p. 787:








 

Khan and Smith establish that hearsay
evidence will be substantively admissible when it is necessary and sufficiently
reliable.  Those cases also state that both necessity and reliability must be
interpreted flexibly, taking account of the circumstances of the case and
ensuring that our new approach to hearsay does not itself become a rigid
pigeon-holing analysis.

 

If a hearsay
statement satisfies these two requirements, the trial judge may put the
statement to the trier of fact, subject to appropriate safeguards and to
cautions regarding weight.

 

69                             
At the same time, as underscored in B. (K.G.), this modern
framework should also be applied in a manner which preserves and reinforces the
integrity of the traditional rules of evidence.  Accordingly, the new hearsay
analysis should not permit the
admission of statements which the declarant, if he or she had been available
and competent at trial, would not have been able to offer into evidence through
direct testimony because of the operation of an evidentiary rule of
admissibility.  As Lamer C.J. stated, at p. 784, in discussing the application
of the Khan and Smith approach to the evidentiary use of prior
inconsistent statements:

 

 

. . . prior inconsistent
statements will only be admissible if they would have been admissible as the
witness's sole testimony.  That is, if the witness could not have made the
statement at trial during his or her examination-in-chief or cross-examination,
for whatever reason, it cannot be made admissible through the back door, as it
were, under the reformed prior inconsistent statement rule. [Emphasis added.]

 

 








For the purposes of illustration, the
Chief Justice, at pp. 784-86, identified two categories of statements which the
declarant could not have made as part of his or her sole testimony if the
declarant was capable of testifying at trial: hearsay statements which in
themselves fell outside a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, and
statements (where the declarant is a state actor) repeating an admission
obtained in violation of the accused’s right to silence under R. v. Broyles,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 595.  In both such cases, the declarant could not have offered
such statements into substantive evidence through his or her sole testimony as
a result of an exclusionary rule of evidence.  Thus, in the absence of the
declarant at trial, the principled framework should not be applied to permit
the admission of such statements for the truth of their contents through the
back door.

 

70                              
With these principles in mind, we turn to examine whether Graham’s
preliminary inquiry testimony is sufficiently necessary and reliable to permit
its reception at a subsequent criminal trial under a principled exception to
the hearsay rule.

 

1.    Necessity

 

71                              
Under this Court's principled framework, hearsay evidence will be
necessary in circumstances where the declarant is unavailable to testify at
trial and where the party is unable to obtain evidence of a similar quality
from another source: B. (K.G.), at p. 796.  Consistent with a flexible
definition of the necessity criterion, there is no reason why the
unavailability of the declarant should be limited to closed, enumerated list of
causes.  As Wigmore articulated the necessity criterion (Wigmore on Evidence,
supra, at §1421):

 

 

(1)  The person whose assertion is offered may now
be dead, or out of the jurisdiction, or insane, or otherwise
unavailable for the purpose of testing.  [Italics in original; underlining
added.]

 

 








But as this
Court indicated in B. (K.G.), at pp. 797-98, the statement of a declarant
may still meet the necessity criterion in limited circumstances where the
declarant is not unavailable in the strict physical sense.  See, e.g., R. v.
Rockey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 829, at para. 20, per McLachlin J.

 

72                              
For the purposes of these appeals, it will suffice to hold that the
preliminary inquiry testimony of a witness will satisfy the criterion of
necessity where the witness is generally unavailable to testify at trial. 
Without restricting the precise content of ""unavailability"", the categories
of absence recognized under s. 715 , specifically death, illness, and insanity,
offer a helpful guide to the types of circumstances under which it will be
sufficiently necessary to consider the admission of the witness's former
testimony.

 

73                              
In this instance, we are satisfied that Graham was unavailable to
testify on behalf of the Crown for the purposes of the necessity criterion. 
The prosecution could not call upon Graham to testify as a result of her
spousal incompetency, and there was no other means of presenting evidence of a
similar value before the court.  In both Khan, at p. 548, and Rockey,
supra, at para. 20, the Court similarly found that the necessity criterion
would be met in circumstances where a child declarant was legally incompetent
to give viva voce evidence at trial.

 

2.    Reliability

 

74                              
The requirement of reliability will be satisfied where the hearsay
statement was made in circumstances which provide sufficient guarantees of its
trustworthiness.  In particular, the circumstances must counteract the
traditional evidentiary dangers associated with hearsay.  As the Court
explained in B. (K.G.), at p. 787:








 

 

The history of the common law exceptions to the
hearsay rule suggests that for a hearsay statement to be received, there must
be some other fact or circumstance which compensates for, or stands in the
stead of the oath, presence and cross-examination.

 

 

75                              
The criterion of reliability is concerned with threshold reliability,
not ultimate reliability.  The function of the trial judge is limited to
determining whether the particular hearsay statement exhibits sufficient
indicia of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis
for evaluating the truth of the statement.  More specifically, the judge must
identify the specific hearsay dangers raised by the statement, and then
determine whether the facts surrounding the utterance of the statement offer
sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to compensate for those
dangers.  The ultimate reliability of the statement, and the weight to be
attached to it, remain determinations for the trier of fact.

 

76                             
We are persuaded that a witness's testimony before a preliminary
inquiry will generally satisfy this threshold test of reliability since there
are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.  A preliminary inquiry will
involve precisely the same issues and the same parties as the trial.  The
hearsay dangers associated with testimony in such an adjudicative proceeding
are minimal.  Preliminary inquiry testimony is given under oath, and is also
subject to the adverse party's right to contemporaneous cross-examination.  It
is only tainted by the lack of the declarant's presence before the trier
of fact.  As this Court previously
stressed in B. (K.G.), at p. 792, the inability to observe the
declarant's demeanour on the stand can handicap the trier of fact's ability to
assess the credibility of the declarant:








 

 

When the witness is on the
stand, the trier can observe the witness's reaction to questions, hesitation,
degree of commitment to the statement being made, etc.  Most importantly, and
subsuming all of these factors, the trier can assess the relationship between
the interviewer and the witness to observe the extent to which the testimony of
the witness is the product of the investigator's questioning.  Such subtle
observations and cues cannot be gleaned from a transcript, read in court in
counsel's monotone, where the atmosphere of the exchange is entirely lost.

 

 

77                              
However, the existence of this sole danger is not fatal to the threshold
reliability of prior testimony.  In both Smith and Khan, the
trier of fact was unable to observe the demeanour of the declarant, but this
Court nonetheless found that surrounding indicia of reliability compensated for
this disadvantage.  Indeed, under many of the recognized exceptions to the
hearsay rule, the trier of fact will not enjoy the opportunity to observe the
declarant on the stand.  See, e.g., Ares v. Venner, supra
(business records exception).  In our view, this limited danger is more than
compensated by the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness inherent in the
adversarial, adjudicative process of a preliminary inquiry.  A declarant's
statements before an inquiry are given under oath or affirmation before the
adverse party, and the accuracy of the statement is certified by a written
transcript which is signed by the judge.  Most importantly, the statement is
subject to contemporaneous cross-examination and, as Arbour J.A. noted, the
party against whom the hearsay evidence is tendered has the power, at trial, to
call the witness whose out-of-court statement is being offered.  Indeed, it is
difficult to imagine more reliable circumstances for a declarant to utter an
out-of-court statement which is then tendered into evidence.

 








78                              
In this regard, it is worth repeating that the early common law
was prepared to admit former testimony under certain circumstances, thus
implicitly accepting the general reliability of former testimony
notwithstanding the lack of the declarant's presence.  In both the United
States and Great Britain, legislators have concluded that testimony in
preliminary hearings is sufficiently reliable to permit its substantive
reception at trial.  In Great
Britain, Parliament has effectively codified the historical position of the
common law through a number of statutes.  See Cross and Tapper on Evidence,
at p. 721.  In the U.S., Rule 804(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence
permits the use of the prior testimony of an unavailable witness through an
exception to the hearsay rule where the adverse party had the opportunity to
cross-examine the declarant. The U.S. Supreme Court has
underscored the ""guarantees of trustworthiness in the accoutrements of the
preliminary hearing itself"":  Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980),
at p. 73.  McCormick stated that ""few [hearsay] exceptions measure up in
terms of the reliability of statements under former testimony"":  McCormick
on Evidence, at p. 322.

 

79                              
For these reasons, we find that a witness's recorded testimony before a
preliminary inquiry bears sufficient hallmarks of trustworthiness to permit the
trier of fact to make substantive use of such statements at trial.  The
surrounding circumstances of such testimony, particularly the presence of an
oath or affirmation and the opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination,
more than adequately compensate for the trier of fact's inability to observe
the demeanour of the witness in court.  The absence of the witness at trial
goes to the weight of such testimony, not to its admissibility.

 








80                              
In this instance, the statements of Graham were made under oath before a
properly constituted preliminary inquiry, and they were subject to the
opportunity of contemporaneous cross-examination by counsel for both Hawkins
and Morin (an opportunity which appears to have been vigorously exercised in
this instance).  As well, the statements of Graham were transcribed under
circumstances which support their authenticity.  Accordingly, we find that the
statements of Graham before the inquiry satisfy the criterion of reliability.

 

81                              
The trial judge held that Graham's testimony before the preliminary
inquiry was so inherently unreliable that it failed to pass the test of
threshold reliability set out in Khan, Smith and B. (K.G.). 
In his view, the value of her testimony was permanently corrupted as a result
of its internal contradictions, and as a result of her exposure to numerous
threats and inducements during the inquiry.  We disagree with the trial judge's
application of the principled framework.  These considerations relate to the
actual probative value of Graham's testimony, and thus relate to the question
of ""ultimate reliability"" rather than ""threshold
reliability"".  As stressed previously, the test of threshold reliability
is limited to an examination of the surrounding circumstances of the prior
statements to determine whether there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness
to counteract the traditional hearsay dangers.  However, considerations of the
weight and probative value of a declarant's statements may be relevant to the
exercise of the trial judge's residual discretion to exclude evidence.  Thus,
we shall defer our analysis of the judge’s conclusions on the inherent
plausibility of Graham’s testimony to our discussion of the court’s residual
discretion.

 

3.    Initial Conclusions

 








82                              
In cases where the testimony of a witness before a preliminary inquiry
is not rendered admissible by s. 715 of the Code, the testimony may
still be substantively admissible at the ensuing trial under a principled
exception to the hearsay rule if the witness’s prior statements meet the dual
requirements of “necessity” and “reliability”.  In our view, statements before
the inquiry will generally be necessary at trial where the witness is no longer
available to testify.  Such prior statements will also generally be reliable
where they were delivered under oath and subject to the opportunity of
cross-examination within a larger adjudicative proceeding which promotes the
search for truth.  Accordingly, under the Khan, Smith and B.
(K.G.) framework, a trial judge may permit the trier of fact to consider
such statements for the truth of their contents if the witness could have offered
such statements into evidence as a competent and available witness at trial
according to the ordinary rules governing the admissibility of evidence.  Where
necessary, the trial judge should properly caution the jury in relation to the
proper weight to be attached to such statements given the witness's lack of
presence in court.  The trial judge, of course, continues to be vested with the
residual discretion to exclude such statements where their probative value is
outweighed by their risk of prejudice.

 

83                              
For the purposes of these appeals, we are not called upon to decide
whether testimony given in a prior adjudicative proceeding other than a
preliminary inquiry may be similarly received into evidence at a criminal trial
under a principled exception to the hearsay rule.  See, e.g., R. v. Finta,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 701, at pp. 852-55, per Cory J. (admissibility of prior
deposition in absence of cross-examination in context of war crime
prosecution).  Similarly, it is unnecessary to determine whether testimony delivered
before a preliminary inquiry in one criminal proceeding may be read into
evidence at a criminal trial in a separate criminal proceeding (i.e., a trial
involving a different charge, or a different accused).  Finally, we have not
considered whether and under what circumstances a witness's preliminary inquiry
testimony may be admitted for its substantive use as a prior inconsistent
statement in accordance with the principles of B. (K.G.) and U.
(F.J.).  See R. v. Clarke (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Ont. Ct. (Gen.
Div.)), aff'd (1994), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 275 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused,
[1995] 3 S.C.R. vi.








 

84                              
In this instance, we are persuaded that Graham's statements before the
inquiry on September 7 and 8, 1988, and January 19 and February 20, 1989, are
sufficiently necessary and reliable to permit the Crown to make substantive use
of such statements at trial under a principled exception to the hearsay rule. 
We also hold that the body of Graham's statements was properly admissible as direct
testimony before the preliminary inquiry.  The substance of her incriminating
statements represented party admissions (i.e., ""Hawkins told me X""),
which fall under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.  To the extent
that some of her statements may have been improperly received before the
inquiry under the ordinary rules governing the admissibility of evidence, they
should not then be admitted at trial under the principled hearsay framework. 
Thus, it will be open to the co-appellants to object to the reception of
specific statements on this basis during their new trial.

 

4.    The Trial Judge's Residual Discretion

 








85                             
It remains to be seen whether the trial judge ought to have
nonetheless excluded Graham's evidence before the inquiry under his residual
discretion at common law.  Even where a particular hearsay statement satisfies
the criteria for necessity and reliability under the reformed framework, the
statement remains subject to the judge's residual discretion to exclude the
statement where ""its probative value is slight and undue prejudice might
result to the accused"": Smith, supra, at p. 937. The existence of this discretion, of
course, is constitutionalized by the guarantee of a fair trial under s. 11 (d)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms :  R. v. Harrer,
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at p. 579.  And as underscored by McLachlin J. in R. v.
Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 610, the meaning of “prejudice” must be broadly
understood as encompassing both prejudice to the accused and prejudice to the
trial process itself.

 

86                              
In his discussion of
the court’s residual discretion under both s. 715  and the principled framework, the trial judge suggested that the admission of the transcripts of
Graham's prior testimony at trial would result in undue prejudice to the
co-appellant Hawkins.  It was submitted that the probative value of her
testimony was slight in light of the direct contradictions within her testimony
and her exposure to numerous outside influences.  This probative value was arguably
further diminished by the inability of the trier of fact to assess the
credibility of Graham on the stand.  Furthermore, the trial judge found that
the reception of such evidence would result in unfairness to Hawkins, as it
would indirectly undermine the operation of the spousal incompetency rule and
endanger the harmony of his “on-going successful” marriage with Graham.  The
majority of the Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that the admission of such
testimony under a principled exception would not operate unfairly against the
co-appellants Hawkins and Morin.

 

87                              
We find that the trial judge should not have exercised his discretion to
exclude the evidence of Graham's testimony before the preliminary inquiry.  In
our view, the risk of undue prejudice arising from Graham's testimony did not
substantially exceed the potential probative value of such evidence at trial.

 

(a)   Probative Value

 








88                              
To begin, we do not accept that Graham's prior testimony was devoid of
probative value as a result of the internal contradictions of her testimony. 
The simple fact of recantation, in our view, does not provide a basis for the
exclusion of a witness's testimony.  Indeed, if it were otherwise, it is
difficult to see how a prior inconsistent statement which met the requirements
of B. (K.G.) and U. (F.J.) could ever survive exclusion under a
trial judge's residual discretion.  In a typical situation of a recantation on
the stand, the trier of fact will be able to observe the witness's
contradictory testimony under both direct examination and cross-examination. 
Notwithstanding the internal inconsistencies of such testimony, the trier of
fact may reasonably conclude on the basis of all the evidence before it that
the witness's original story ought to be preferred over the witness's
subsequent recantation, or vice versa.

 

89                              
In this instance, even in the absence of Graham's presence in court, we
believe that the transcripts of the inquiry have probative value in determining
whether or not the co-appellants committed the alleged offences.  The trier of
fact will still be able to scrutinize the content of Graham's transcribed
testimony, including her choice of words and verbal hesitations, under both
direct and cross examination.  When these transcripts are viewed in light of
the other surrounding evidence presented by the Crown, the trier of fact may
still be able to conclude reasonably that one of her contradictory versions of
events ought to be preferred over the other.  Additionally, Graham's
preliminary inquiry testimony has  probative value in relation to the matters
in respect of which she did not contradict herself (e.g. Hawkins'
propensity for abuse and Hawkins’ general knowledge of Morin).

 








90                              
Finally, we do not agree that Graham's exposure to numerous
outside influences deprived her testimony of its potential probative value.  We
are not persuaded that the myriad of individuals pressuring Graham so contaminated
her testimony that she was reduced to a mere puppet of outside interests. 
Furthermore, there was no evidence that the police or Hawkins elicited her
testimony by direct inducement or by coercion.  In summary, notwithstanding the
contradictions in and outside influences upon Graham's testimony, we find that
the trier of fact may indeed derive significant probative value from her
statements at the preliminary inquiry.  The trier is ultimately free to discount select portions of her former
testimony, or to reject her testimony in its entirety, based on their findings
of credibility.  But we are not persuaded that Graham’s testimony was so corrupted and its
evidentiary value so slight that a reasonable and well-instructed jury would be
unable to draw any inferences from it.

 

(b)   Prejudice and Unfairness

 

91                              
The trial judge found that Hawkins would suffer undue prejudice from the
admission of Graham's former testimony since the admission of such evidence
would effectively remove the legal protection Hawkins enjoys under the spousal
incompetency rule.  Specifically, Philp J. reasoned that, if the Crown is
precluded from calling Graham as a competent witness at trial out of respect
for Hawkins’ marital harmony, then that same respect should prevent the Crown
from reading Graham's preliminary inquiry testimony into evidence.

 

92                              
The Court of Appeal, by contrast, saw no unfairness to the accused.  As
Arbour J.A. stated (at pp. 243-44): ""Cherie Graham cannot be called by the
Crown to give evidence.  It does not follow, however, that her evidence is
inadmissible if it can be put before the court by some other means.""

 








93                              
We should first point out that there has been no
evidence indicating how the admission of Graham’s preliminary inquiry
testimony  would actually prejudice the accused and the trial process.  It is
only this sort of prejudice that is relevant to the exercise of discretion. 
Nonetheless, to this point, the concern has been whether admitting Graham’s
statements would result in any “unfairness” and  undermine the accused’s 
relationship with her.  In this respect, we agree with the conclusions of the
Court of Appeal.  The reception of Graham’s prior testimony through a
principled exception to the hearsay rule would not result in undue unfairness
to the co-appellant. The admission of the transcripts at trial would not
undermine the established protection of the spousal incompetency rule.  The
rule serves to protect the appellant’s dual interests in preserving his marital
harmony and in avoiding the “natural repugnance” of having his spouse testify
against him in the course of the marriage.  But neither of those interests is
threatened in this instance.  

 

94                              
If Graham was compelled to testify at trial for the prosecution
following her marriage with Hawkins, his marital harmony would indeed be
jeopardized.  However, we do not believe that his marital bond would be
similarly threatened if the prosecution simply read into evidence the testimony
which Graham willingly gave before an adjudicative proceeding prior to the
marriage.

 








95                              
It is hard to accept, conceptually or practically, that Graham’s
testimony caused any lasting disharmony between them, when one reviews the
sequence of events and the conduct of the parties.  The preliminary inquiry was
held on September  7 and 8, 1988.  Graham appeared voluntarily as a witness for
the Crown.  She later appeared before the resumed inquiry in early 1989 and
partially recanted her previous testimony.  She did not retract her previous
statements in relation to her fear of Hawkins, his threats of abuse and
violence, his friendly connections with Morin, his threats to her life and her
discussions with Hawkins on marriage as a means for preventing her from
testifying at trial.  Despite these incriminating words of Graham’s, Hawkins
nonetheless married Graham on March 31, 1989.  If this previous testimony did
not irreparably harm their romantic and emotional bond prior to their nuptials,
looking at all the circumstances, it is difficult to see how the production of
transcripts accurately recounting this testimony would do so now.

 

 

96                              
Furthermore, it is difficult to see how the admission of the transcripts
would result in an incident of ""natural repugnance"" to the marriage. 
As Wigmore explained this second surviving justification of the spousal
incompetency rule, the law must prevent the inherent human harshness in
permitting an accused's spouse to assume the stand to assist in the accused's
prosecution.  But since the Crown may not call or compel Graham to assume the
stand, Graham is not being conscripted and the threat of a repugnant spectacle
is avoided.  In short, the operation of the principled exception to the hearsay
rule would not thwart the purposes underlying the spousal competency rule.

 

(c)   Conclusion

 








97                              
In the balance of considerations, and notwithstanding considerations of
“unfairness” to the accused in his marital relationship, the risk of prejudice
arising from the admission of Graham's preliminary inquiry testimony did not
significantly exceed the potential probative value of such evidence at trial. 
The trial judge should not have exercised his residual discretion to exclude
her testimony, and the transcripts ought to have been put to the trier of fact,
subject to appropriate safeguards and instructions.  The Crown, of course,
would be obliged to present Graham’s preliminary inquiry testimony before the
trier of fact in its entirety (i.e., both of her appearances).  We reiterate
that the credibility of Graham at various points during the inquiry and the
ultimate weight to be attached to her evidence remain within the province of
the trier of fact.

 

 

VI.  Conclusions
and Disposition

 

98                              
We have reached the following conclusions.  The Court of Appeal was correct
in concluding that Graham was an incompetent witness for the Crown, and that an
exception to the common law rule of spousal incompetence should not be made on
the facts of this case.  However, with respect, the Court of Appeal did err in
holding that the transcripts of Graham’s preliminary inquiry could be read in
at trial under s. 715  of the Criminal Code .  But the Court of Appeal was
correct in its alternative conclusion that the substance of the transcripts
could be read into evidence at common law under a principled exception to the
hearsay rule.  The reception of the transcripts at trial would not result in
unfairness to either of the co-appellants.  The Crown was entitled to put the
transcripts before the trier of fact for the truth of their contents, subject
to appropriate considerations and instructions relating to weight.

We accordingly dismiss the appeals and affirm the order of a new
trial.

 

 

\\La Forest J.\\

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 








100             La Forest J. -- I agree with  Justice
L’Heureux-Dubé and simply wish to add two observations.

 

101             The
first has to do with the issues concerning whether the wife is a competent and
compellable witness.  As L’Heureux-Dubé J. points out, the wife in this case is
unwilling to testify, so it is in strictness only necessary to address the
question of compellability.  The issue of competency would raise issues on a
quite different plane.  A rule prohibiting a spouse from testifying if he or
she so wishes raises serious questions about whether it unreasonably infringes
on a person’s liberty and equality interests protected by the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Such an infringement would, in my view,
require justification at a level akin to that followed in the case of an
alleged breach of Charter  rights by legislative means; see my comments
in R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, at pp. 891-92.  This would seem
to me to raise a very significant challenge, one that could, however, be
avoided by adapting the common law to limit the rule to cases of compulsion.

 

102             My
second point relates to the wife’s evidence given voluntarily at the
preliminary hearing.  I do not have to get into the issue of whether or not it
is hearsay.  If it is hearsay, I agree that it is admissible under the
principled exception to the hearsay rule.  If it is not hearsay, it is highly
relevant evidence and I see no reason to reject it:  it was not covered by the
rule of spousal immunity, and the considerations that favour its admission
under the principled exception to the hearsay rule militate against exclusion
under the broad discretionary rule described in R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1
S.C.R. 670, and R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525.

 

\\L’Heureux-Dubé J.\\








The following are the reasons delivered by 

 

103           L’Heureux-Dubé J. -- This case raises
the issue of the scope and extent of the spousal incompetence rule in criminal
cases.   I have read the reasons for judgment of my colleagues, and I agree
with the Chief Justice and Justice Iacobucci that these appeals should be
dismissed. I come to this result, however, by a different route, and wish to
elaborate upon what I see as the key issue in this case: when can statements
made by a spouse prior to trial be admitted for their substantive content as
exceptions to the hearsay rule?

 

104           Before
addressing this issue, I wish to note that I am in substantial agreement with
the Chief Justice and Iacobucci J. regarding the first two issues raised in
this case. On the question of whether the appellant’s spouse in this case could
be compelled to testify, I agree that given the evidence of a valid marriage
between the appellant and his spouse, the common law should not be varied to
allow the Crown to compel this witness’s testimony.  I am also of the view that
s. 715  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , does not offer an
opportunity to admit the preliminary inquiry testimony in this case.

 








105           The
question that remains, therefore, is whether the statements made at the
preliminary inquiry, while the witness was not yet __ although she
later became __  the spouse of the appellant, can nonetheless be
admitted as an exception to the rule against hearsay, as developed by this
Court in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, R. v. Smith, [1992] 2
S.C.R. 915, and R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740.  The Chief Justice
and Iacobucci J. have determined that the  preliminary inquiry testimony is
both reliable and necessary, thus fulfilling the criteria to admit hearsay
evidence.  I agree with this conclusion.  The issue that separates them from
the opinion of Justice Major is whether, despite the indicia of reliability and
necessity, the evidence should nevertheless be excluded as it offends the
spirit and purpose of the spousal incompetence rule.    

 

106           Both
opinions address this residuary question quite differently.  The
Chief Justice and Iacobucci J. deal with it under the rubric of “fairness”. 
They ultimately conclude that the trial judge exercised a discretion to exclude
the evidence on this ground, but was incorrect in so doing.  Fairness, as
defined, apparently depends upon whether an accused can establish that his
marriage would suffer in a way which is incompatible with the goals behind the
spousal incompetence rule.  Since in this case it was not demonstrated, the
Chief Justice and Iacobucci J. conclude that the evidence should have been
properly admitted.  

 

107           
Major J. approaches this question from a notably different perspective.  In his
view, the question of discretion does not have to be addressed.  He would
preclude the Crown from ever admitting the hearsay evidence of a husband or
wife.  According to him, given that the policy behind the common law rule is
designed to prevent spouses from having to provide evidence against each other,
it should not be confined solely to testimony at trial; rather it should
effectively bar one spouse from helping to convict the other, regardless of how
that evidence is provided.

 








108           While
I am unable to agree with his ultimate conclusions, I prefer the approach of
Major J. in this case.  The admission of evidence through a hearsay exception
should not depend in any way upon an abstract measuring of “unfairness” to the
accused.  In my view,  it is not open to an accused to argue that he or she
will be unfairly convicted merely because a rule of evidence, in this
case the spousal incompetence rule, did not apply in his or her favour.  The
position of the Chief Justice and Iacobucci J. is also fraught with evidentiary
difficulties.  In most cases, a determination of “unfairness” would depend on a
speculative appraisal of the potential for damage to an accused’s marriage
because of the admission of a statement made prior to trial by his or her
spouse.   This potential harm would be almost impossible to predict: David
Medine, “The Adverse Testimony Privilege: Time to Dispose of a ‘Sentimental
Relic’” (1988), 67 Oreg. L. Rev. 519, at p. 555.  An analysis
of the theoretical disruption of an accused’s marriage on a case-by-case basis
is simply an inadequate manner to proceed with this problem.  

 

109           I
agree with Major J. that the threshold question which must be asked is whether
such evidence is precluded from being admitted because it is barred by the
spousal incompetence rule.  If the answer to this question is in the negative, there
is no need to consider “fairness” on a case-by-case basis.  I note that this
issue has been dealt with at length in the United States and by lower courts
and has always proceeded in the manner I have set out; see for example: United
States v. Archer, 733 F.2d 354 (5th Cir. 1984); R. v. Kobussen
(1995), 130 Sask. R. 147 (Q.B.).

 








110           In
addressing this issue, it is essential to keep the hearsay question
analytically distinct from the issue of spousal competence. For example, here,
the Crown legally obtained evidence from a witness, in the form of  testimony
at a preliminary inquiry.  Because of the spousal incompetence rule, the Crown
was precluded from calling this witness at trial.  Nevertheless, the statement
still existed as evidence in a tangible form, and an attempt was then made to
introduce it.  While, generally, statements of this sort cannot be led at trial
because of the hearsay rule, it is not so where the evidence fits into a
recognized exception.  This is a proper manner of adducing evidence, and if the
preliminary inquiry testimony is not prohibited by the hearsay rule, it should
be admitted unless some other rule of evidence prevents this route.

 

111           Given
this approach, I have some difficulty with Major J.’s repeated concern that
this evidence is going through “the back door”.  With respect, admitting
evidence through a hearsay exception always proceeds through this so-called
“back door”, and yet this Court has consistently found this to be a permissible
avenue.  Obviously, if it were possible to adduce the evidence directly, the
Crown would not need to use a hearsay exception.  There is nothing inherently
wrong in making use of available evidence.  Major J. states that allowing
hearsay statements into evidence is equivalent to “forcing spouses to provide
evidence against each other” (para. 153).  I cannot agree with this
conclusion.  In this case, for example, the witness was clearly not “forced” to
give evidence.  On the contrary, she approached the police herself and
volunteered to testify.  I fail to see how admitting the evidence as hearsay
suddenly imbues the evidence with a coercive quality.  It is quite a different
matter where there is actual coercion.  In those cases, the hearsay evidence
will often be excluded as it will lack the indicia of reliability necessary for
admission.  I reiterate that evidence which is prima facie admissible
should only be excluded where some other evidentiary rule trumps it and
precludes admission. 

 

112           Major
J. agrees that the evidence here is reliable, and ostensibly “necessary”, but
he suggests that it should not be admitted via the principled exception to the
hearsay rule, as the testimony was not available from the witness directly.  He
cites from the judgment of the Chief Justice in B. (K.G.), supra, at p.
784,  in support of his proposition:

 








. . . I would adopt the
requirement embodied in the provision proposed by the Law Reform Commission of
Canada, and in the English Civil Evidence Act 1968, that prior
inconsistent statements will only be admissible if they would have been
admissible as the witness's sole testimony.  That is, if the witness could not
have made the statement at trial during his or her examination-in-chief or
cross-examination, for whatever reason, it cannot be made admissible through
the back door, as it were, under the reformed prior inconsistent statement
rule.

 

Major J. concludes from this passage that the out-of-court
statements in the case at bar should not have been introduced:

 

Although Lamer C.J.’s statement of the rule is in the
context of prior inconsistent statements, and discusses the issue as a
preliminary matter, it can be applied to the case at bar.  This was also the
view of Weiler J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal at p. 269 C.R.:

 

 

If Graham were called to testify at
Hawkins’ trial (without any modification of the common law) she could not make
any statement because she would be considered incompetent.  In this sense, the
evidence would not satisfy the precondition for the admissibility of hearsay
evidence required under K.G.B.  One cannot admit statements through the
“back door” when a witness could not make those statements at trial.

 

The Crown is attempting to introduce evidence through
a principled exception to hearsay, evidence which the Crown would not be
permitted to obtain through direct testimony.  This is using the so-called back
door, to overcome the prohibition acknowledged in s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act .

 

 








113           I
strongly disagree with this position.  In my view, following this logic to its
ultimate conclusion would completely obliterate every exception to the hearsay
rule.  In any case where the Crown is attempting to tender hearsay testimony
it is unable to obtain the testimony through direct evidence.  In
the so-called Khan situation, for example, the child witness is first
ruled incompetent, and thus, is unable to directly provide testimony. 
According to the reasoning of Major J., the Crown should not be able to then
attempt to admit the hearsay statements of the child as it could not have
access to them directly.  This would be a rather peculiar proposition and
contrary to the very object of the principled exception to the hearsay rule. 
As the Chief Justice and Iacobucci J. correctly point out, the hearsay analysis
focuses on whether the statement could have been made by the witness, if he
or she were competent and available to testify at trial.  B. (K.G.)
simply does not stand for the proposition for which Major J. has cited it.

 

114           In
my view, this evidence fits rather easily into the principled exception to the
hearsay rule.  It remains, therefore, to deal with the substantive question of
whether the spousal incompetence rule prevents the admission of the
out-of-court statements of a spouse.  I am of the view, for the reasons which
follow, that this question should be answered in the negative.

 

Rationales Behind the Spousal Incompetence Rule

 

115           The
basis for not permitting a spouse to testify for the prosecution is the common
law rule presuming spousal incompetence.  This rule has been extensively
criticized, most recently by this Court in R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R.
654; see also John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman and Alan W. Bryant, The Law
of Evidence in Canada (1992), at p. 616.   Nevertheless, it is at least
tacitly recognized by s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-5 .  I would not, however, go as far as Major J. in stating that “[s]ection 4
ensures that spouses, otherwise credible witnesses, who possess relevant
evidence never testify in court” (para. 152).  Rather, I agree with the Chief
Justice and Iacobucci J. that this rule is grounded in the common law, and thus
the scope of the rule is subject to the interpretation of the courts; see also
Professor Schiff, Evidence in the Litigation Process (4th ed. 1993), at
p. 212.  

 








116           The
question at the very heart of this case, therefore, is what exactly is the
extent of this rule?  Does the incompetency of a spouse merely prevent
testimony at trial, or is it intended to exclude all evidence which emanates
from a spouse?   The first part of an answer to this question is easily
discernible from the case law.  Like Major J., I am of the view that the
incompetence of a witness does not necessarily preclude the admission of his or
her evidence by another route:  Khan, supra; R. v. Rockey,
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 829. Strictly speaking, whether evidence from an incompetent
witness can be admitted through the testimony of  a third party depends on the
underlying reason for the incompetency.        

 

117           In
this regard, I would note that the question of whether statements made prior to
trial by a spouse can be admitted has apparently never been addressed in this
country. What the appellant appears to be asking is for the court to extend the
scope of the spousal incompetence rule to prevent not only the in-court
testimony of a spouse, but the out-of-court statements as well.  If this is to
be the result, such an extension must be warranted; furthermore, this
conclusion must be justified in light of the modern day position on spousal
incompetence.  As Iacobucci J. stated in Salituro, supra, at p.
673:

 

The common law rule making a spouse an incompetent
witness involves a conflict between the freedom of the individual to choose
whether or not to testify and the interests of society in preserving the
marriage bond.

 

 

While Iacobucci J. stated that it was not necessary for the purposes
of deciding Salituro to determine the result of the conflict, I believe
that the ultimate decision on whether to admit such out-of-court statements
mandates a certain degree of inquiry into this area.

 

 

 








118           I
would add that the spousal incompetence rule must also be considered in light
of the trial’s goal as a truth-seeking inquiry.  As I have stated on more than
one occasion, the pre-eminent role of the trial is to ascertain the truth: see
for example, R. v. Levogiannis, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475; R. v. Burlingham, [1995]
2 S.C.R. 206.  Evidentiary principles which constrain
the truth-seeking process should be carefully tailored so that they do not
exceed what is strictly necessary to accomplish the goal for which they are
designed.  In this regard, I agree with the comments of  Burger C.J. of the
United States in Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), at pp.
50-51, who, in deciding upon the scope of a spouse’s ability to give evidence,
said:

 

                        Testimonial
exclusionary rules and privileges contravene the fundamental principle that
“‘the public ... has a right to every man’s evidence.’”   United States v.
Bryan, 339 U.S. 323, 331 (1950).  As such, they must be strictly construed
and accepted “only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to
testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending  the
normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining
truth.”  Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter,
J., dissenting).  Accord, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709-710
(1974).

 

 

119           With
that in mind, I will proceed to examine the rule itself and its underlying
rationales.  In Salituro, supra, at p. 672, Iacobucci J.
discussed the various justifications which exist for the spousal competence
rule and stated:

 

The general testimonial incompetence
of a wife for or against her husband was accepted in Lord Audley's Case
(1631), Hutt. 115, 123 E.R. 1140, at p. 1141.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

 

Since
that time, at least four distinct justifications have been advanced for the
rule but only two of these survive today.  The most important justification is
that the rule protects marital harmony.  The danger to marital harmony of
making a spouse a competent witness was first mentioned by Lord Coke, and was
most recently emphasized in the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case at
bar, in R. v. Bailey, supra, and in R. v. Sillars, supra. 
A second reason sometimes mentioned is what Wigmore called the ""natural
repugnance to every fair‑minded person to compelling a wife or
husband to be the means of the other's condemnation"" (Wigmore on
Evidence (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8, p. 217, § 2228 (emphasis in original)).

 








The two
justifications which have not survived are that a spouse is an incompetent
witness because husband and wife are in law a single person (although this
justification survived into the eighteenth century), and that husband and wife
are disqualified from being witnesses for or against each other because their
interests are identical.

 

 

 

120           As
Iacobucci J. points out, the early justifications for the rule mandated a
strong and absolute rule of spousal incompetency.  Essentially, spouses could
not be trusted to give evidence at trial, and thus it was necessary to ensure
that no evidence was adduced by them, as it was thought to be manifestly
unreliable. Similarly, if the spouse and the accused were to be regarded as
“one” person, it would have been unfair to compel testimony from this “unit” in
order to convict one of its component members.  Both of  these thoroughly
discredited rationales today are, of course, based on archaic notions of a
woman’s role in society and within the marriage.   If they continued to exist
today, however, and were justifiable, I would have no difficulty concluding that
out-of-court statements could not be admitted at trial.  The logic would
clearly extend to the situation before us.  Of course, given that the
rationales themselves are not soundly based, we no longer recognize or rely
upon them.

 

121           What
remains, therefore, are two surviving policy grounds which support the rule:
(1) preventing the threat to marital harmony, and (2) avoiding the natural
repugnance of compelling a spouse to testify, and having to witness this
“spectacle” in court.  As the Chief Justice and Iacobucci J. correctly state,
this second rationale simply does not concern us where the evidence of a spouse
is adduced through a hearsay exception.  Thus, we must consider  whether a
complete exclusionary rule to such statements made prior to trial is warranted
on the basis of marital harmony.

 








122           This
very question has been discussed at length in the United States.  My colleague
Major J. states that marital harmony is affected equally by testimony  and
where statements made out of court by a spouse are tendered as evidence.  He
goes on to subscribe to the view of the U.S. Court of Appeal, 5th Circuit, in Ivey
v. United States, 344 F.2d 770 (1965), at p. 772, which said:

 

[The hearsay witness’s] testimony
relating what [the accused’s wife] had told him about [the accused’s]
participation in the importation not only violates the rule against admitting
hearsay testimony but also the rule against admitting testimony of one spouse
against the other.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

She might as well be permitted to testify against her
husband in open court as to permit the introduction of a statement she had made
against him out of court.

 

 

123           It
is worth noting, in my view, that the case cited for this proposition is no
longer good law in the United States.  In fact, virtually every court which has
considered this case has explicitly decided not to follow it.  As one court
observed, Ivey has been “distinguished . . . into oblivion”: United
States v. Archer, supra, at p. 358.  Essentially, the American
courts have concluded that introducing a statement made prior to trial does not
have the same effect as having a spouse testify at trial.  I agree.

 

124           Of
course, the law relating to spousal incompetence in the United States has been
markedly different from the law in Canada since the decision of the Supreme
Court in Trammel, supra, made the spousal testimonial privilege
one which gave the potential witness the discretion to decide whether to invoke
it, rather than an absolute bar.  (See Milton C. Regan, Jr., “Spousal Privilege
and the Meanings of Marriage” (1995), 81 Va. L. Rev. 2045, for an
outline of the law in different American jurisdictions.)    Nevertheless, even
prior to Trammel, when the law was virtually identical to our own, and
spouses were generally unable to testify for the prosecution, U.S. courts
concluded that hearsay statements from a spouse should be admitted.   

 








125           In
United States v. Tsinnijinnie, 601 F.2d 1035 (9th Cir. 1979), the
prosecution attempted to tender a hearsay statement, otherwise admissible, made
by the accused’s wife.  Despite objections from the accused, the court decided
to admit the hearsay statement as it determined that the rationales behind the
spousal testimony privilege simply did not apply where the evidence was
admitted via a third party (at pp. 1038-39):

 

. . . we should consider whether the purposes of the
privilege would be furthered by extending it to testimony by a third person.  Hawkins
v. United States, [358 U.S. 74 (1958)], outlined two justifications for the
spousal privilege: fostering marital harmony and avoiding the spectacle of
pitting one spouse against the other.  It is unlikely that either goal is
served by excluding a spouse’s out-of-court statements.

 

In United States v. Mackiewicz,
401 F.2d 219 (2d Cir. 1968), . . . hearsay statements of a husband implicating
his wife were admitted.  The spouses were co-defendants and the admission could
have been justified as co-conspirator admissions, but the Second Circuit
considered whether the marital privilege was even applicable to third party
testimony.  It concluded it was not, because the impact on marital harmony
would be slight:

 

     “This is not a case where the prosecution called
the husband to the stand.  If he had testified under those circumstances, the
common law rule would have been violated.  Here, however, we are one step
removed from actual testimony.  Therefore, there is no chance that we might be
repulsed by a spouse actually testifying against his mate, see McCormick, Evidence
§ 66.  Nor is there a chance that marital frictions will be aggravated, . . .
for there is the convenient buffer of the third person actually making the
remarks.”

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

 

We agree that the marital privilege
should not be extended to bar a witness from relating an excited utterance by a
spouse.  The possible benefits that would derive from such an extension cannot
justify excluding the evidence which is relevant and often highly probative.  

 

 

 








This reasoning has been repeatedly followed: United States v.
Archer, supra; United States v. Brown, 605 F.2d 389 (8th Cir. 1979);
United States v. Doughty, 460 F.2d 1360 (7th Cir. 1972); United
States v. Cleveland, 477 F.2d 310 (7th Cir. 1973); United States v.
Chapman, 866 F.2d 1326 (11th Cir. 1989); United States v. Donlon,
909 F.2d 650 (1st Cir. 1990); Ballard v. State, 311 S.E.2d 453 (Ga.
1984).

 

126           Similarly,
Professors Louisell and Mueller in Federal Evidence (1985),
vol. 2,  at pp. 874-75, have described the state of the U.S. jurisprudence
in the following manner:

 

Pretty clearly the privilege does
not bar proof of the out-of-court statements of a spouse: Assuming that they
are relevant, that they are not within the other spousal privilege (the one for
spousal confidences, which is considered in the next section), that hearsay
objections are overcome, and that they are provable by the testimony of some
third person, they are not excludable by virtue of the spousal testimony
privilege.  No married person holds a privilege to stop his or her spouse from
making statements abroad in the world which are adverse to his interests, and
when such statements by one spouse are offered against another in court, any
resultant strain upon the marriage and affront to human dignity comes at least
as much from the out-of-court conduct of the spouse as from the trial itself.

 

 

 








127           I
agree with these conclusions.  The main rationale for the spousal incompetence
rule loses much of its conviction where the evidence is tendered via a third
party and not by the spouse on the witness stand.  This is so for several
reasons.  First, the spouse who makes the statement is not put through the
stress of having to decide whether or not to testify, as this choice is already
made by the time the trial occurs and the Crown seeks to admit the statement. 
Thus, he or she is not put in the position of having to actually stand and
convict his or her spouse at trial.  There is none of the internal and external
pressure, in and of itself damaging to marital harmony, which exists where a
spouse must decide whether to give damning testimony or face a charge of
contempt.  Second, the husband and wife will not be put through the strain of
actually sitting through the difficult testimony at trial, and having to face
each other directly as “accuser” and “accused”.  Finally, as Louisell and
Mueller point out, most of the damaging effect to the marriage will already
have occurred by the trial.  In the majority of cases, the marital bond will
have been broken by the actual making of the statement, or conversely, it will
have survived to trial and will not be made worse by the reading in of the
evidence:  Trammel, supra, at p. 52. 

 

 128          I recognize that there is still
some potential damage to a couple’s marital harmony.  In this regard, it is
important to note that we do not have an independent doctrine of marital
harmony which operates to preserve marriages at the expense of obtaining
evidence.  It is well established that the police during the course of
investigation may enlist the spouse of an accused in gathering evidence to aid
in a prosecution: R. v. McKinnon (1989), 70 C.R. (3d) 10 (Ont. C.A.); United
States v. Archer, supra, at p. 358.  Surely, where the police obtain
the aid of a witness during an investigation which leads to the conviction of
his or her spouse, this cannot be any better for marital harmony than where the
spouse testifies at trial; still, this type of evidence has traditionally been
admitted.  

                 

129          Furthermore, the conclusion of Major J. is
also at odds with prior decisions of this Court.  In R. v. Jean, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 400, in a brief judgment this Court affirmed in full the reasons of
Moir J.A. in the Alberta Court of Appeal (1979), 7 C.R. (3d) 338.  That case concerned the
intercepted communications by wiretap of a conversation between a husband and
wife.  While the statements of the spouses were ultimately excluded based on
the statutory provision under consideration, all the judges agreed that the
evidence would have been admissible at common law, as “[i]t would appear logical that it does
not matter how the conversation is overheard or intercepted if the person who
overheard the conversation or the tape that recorded it could be produced in
court”
(p. 352).

 








130          Similarly, in Lloyd  v. The Queen,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 645, this Court  affirmed the principles set out in Jean,
although the evidence was once again excluded pursuant to a specific statutory provision. 
There, a husband and wife were both charged with conspiracy to traffic a
narcotic.  The Crown had obtained wiretap evidence of a conversation between
the two of them which the accused tried to have excluded.  During the course of
his opinion, McIntyre J. (Martland J. and Lamer J. (as he then was) 
concurring), in dissent but not on this issue, made the following remarks with
respect to s. 4(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act , which attaches a
privilege to marital communications (at pp. 654-55):

 

The privilege
created by s. 4(3)  is against compulsory disclosure of marital communications. 
The spouse, to whom the communication has been made, however, while he or she
may not be compelled to disclose it, is of course free to do so if he or she
wishes.  It is evident then that the privilege, the right to elect whether the
communication will be disclosed or not, is personal to the recipient spouse,
and it is equally evident from the wording of s. 4  that the privilege
is one pertaining to a spouse giving evidence in Court.  In other words, it is
a testimonial privilege giving a right to withhold evidence, but it cannot be
said that the information itself is privileged.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

See also R. v. Andrew (1986), 26
C.C.C. (3d) 111 (B.C.S.C.); United States v. Archer, supra, at p.
358.

 

131          Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant in The
Law of Evidence in Canada, supra, at pp. 684-85, have succinctly
summed up the issue as follows:

 

Third persons, who have either intentionally or accidentally
overheard or intercepted a communication passing between a husband and wife, by
means other than electronic surveillance by some agency of the state, are
allowed to and may be compelled to testify with respect to the communication.

 

 








132           I
note that the same reasoning has been applied in the United Kingdom.  In Rumping
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1962] 3 All E.R. 256 (H.L.), the
accused mailed a letter to his wife which contained certain admissions.  It was
intercepted and adduced against him as evidence. The House of Lords examined a
line of older cases for the purpose of determining the extent of the marital
communication privilege.  The factual situation in Rumping was quite
different from what we are faced with in the case at bar, as there, it was the
accused who made the out-of-court communication. Lord Morris canvassed the 19th
century jurisprudence and discovered cases which would have allowed testimony
of communications by the non-accused spouses as well, if testified to by third
parties: R. v. Smithies (1832), 5 C. & P. 332, 172 E.R. 999; R.
v. Bartlett (1837), 7 C. & P. 832, 173 E.R. 362. When those cases were
decided, of course, a spouse was not competent to give any evidence.  Lord
Morris concluded by stating (at pp. 268, 271 and 276) that:

 

[The appellant’s submissions]
involve the further contention, which now calls for inquiry, that at common law
there were two separate rules: that apart from what I may call the general
common law rule that one spouse was incompetent to give evidence concerning the
other there was a separate and distinct rule that no person at all could give
any evidence of any communication between spouses.

 

My Lords, though authority is not
lacking which pronounces the general rule that at common law husbands and wives
were not allowed to give evidence for or against each other, I can find no
authority in support of the suggested separate and distinct rule.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Though, subject to certain
exceptions, the general common law rule applied in criminal cases, such
authorities as there are appear rather to negative than to support the
existence of a rule as contended for on behalf of the appellant. . . .  [I]n R.
v. Bartlett a ruling was given which was similar to that in R. v.
Smithies.  When a prisoner was in custody his wife came into the room
and it was proposed to give in evidence what she said in his presence. 
Objection was taken on the ground that as the wife could not be examined on
oath against the prisoner what she said could not be used as evidence against
him.  The objection was overruled.

 








                                                                   .
. .

 

My Lords, a survey of the
authorities and of the statutory provisions leads me to the view that there has
never been a rule at common law that no evidence may be given by anyone as to
communications made between husband and wife during marriage.

 

See also the reasons of Lord Hodson at pp. 278-79.

 

133           While
these cases deal with a somewhat different issue concerning the marital
communications privilege, the reasoning remains inconsistent with the judgment
of Major J.  In each case, a spouse made statements in conversation with the
accused which, if not prevented by a statutory provision, were admitted to aid
the prosecution.  According to  Major J., these statements could never be admitted,
not because they would be protected by privilege, but because they would be
excluded on the grounds of an extended spousal incompetency rule.  In my view,
this reasoning is simply incompatible with the jurisprudence as it currently
stands.

 

134           In
summary, I am of the view that the marital harmony rationale becomes
considerably less convincing where a spouse makes statements in the presence of
third parties prior to trial.  Balanced against this reduced threat to marital
harmony are two pressing rationales which weigh heavily in favour of allowing
the admission of this evidence.  First is the recognition that this rule
severely hinders the freedom of individual choice.  As Iacobucci J. stated in Salituro,
supra, at p. 673, this freedom is “a central tenet of the legal and
moral fabric of this country particularly since the adoption of the Charter ”. 
The entire thrust of the rule goes against the notion that a person is free to
make his or her own choices.

 








135           Similarly,
Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, the authors of The Law of Evidence in Canada,
supra, at p. 616,  have commented:

 

In any event, the spouse is still
not generally competent or compellable on behalf of the Crown.  This seems to
be an archaic position, at least on the issue of competency.  First, there is
an anomalous distinction between common-law and legal marital relationships.  Secondly,
it is paternalistic.  If a husband or a wife wishes to testify against the
other spouse, why should society determine that it is in the best interests of
that relationship that the testimony not be received?  As Professor
McCormick stated [McCormick on Evidence (2nd ed. 1972), § 65, at pp.
145-46]:

 

The privilege has sometimes been defended on the
ground that it protects family harmony.  But family harmony is nearly always
past saving when the spouse is willing to aid the prosecution.  The privilege
is an archaic survival of a mystical religious dogma and of a way of thinking
about the marital relation that is today outmoded. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

136           Second,
we must remember that the trial is primarily a truth-seeking inquiry.  The
spousal incompetence rule has been called “a legal irony” in that it prevents
the state from having access to probative and relevant testimony because of an
extrinsic social policy.  As David Medine, supra, at pp. 545-46, stated,
summarizing the theory of a noted commentator on evidence law:

 

Wigmore also found a certain irony
in the balance struck between society’s interest and that of the marital
parties.  If A has wronged B, and A’s spouse’s testimony is needed to establish
the wrong, is it a sensible policy to protect A’s marriage at the expense of
B’s ability to prove the wrong?  According to some commentators, the privilege
protects little more than the wrongdoer who hides behind it.

 

 

 








137           In
my view, the totality of these concerns tilts the balance decidedly in favour
of admitting the evidence.  The damage to marital harmony from admitting the
hearsay evidence is considerably reduced where the statement is made prior to
trial.  In this regard, the need to allow individuals to freely choose whether
to speak, and the importance of the trial as a truth-seeking inquiry designed
to redress harms to society, outweigh any need to prevent this reduced threat.

 

138           I
am mindful of the fact that the conclusion I have reached also casts serious
doubt on at least the “incompetence” aspect of the rule preventing spouses from
giving evidence in a criminal trial.  It may well be that where a spouse is
willing to testify at trial, the rationale of marital harmony is not enough to
prevent this individual choice.  This was the conclusion reached by the United
States Supreme Court in Trammel, supra.  Whether or not this
witness would be compellable, of course, is another question entirely.

 

139           It
is not necessary, however, for me to decide the competence question today. 
Here, the witness is clearly not willing to testify, and the parties made their
arguments strictly on this basis.   In addition, in deciding this case I did
not have to consider the potential impact of the rationale that a spouse’s
testimony at trial would cause a natural repugnance.  That factor, along with
the more severe threat to the harmony of marriage which would result from
permitting the trial testimony of a spouse, would have to be considered.

 

140           I
note that maintaining the incompetence rule would be a peculiar result, as it
would mean that a spouse willing to give evidence could do so out of court, yet
would be forbidden from testifying at trial. In my view, this unstable
situation further demonstrates that this area of the law contains “significant
inconsistencies and is in serious need of rationalization at the legislative level”;
per Morden J.A. in R. v. Czipps (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 166 (Ont.
C.A.), at p. 172.  That statement, made over 15 years ago, continues to ring
out today, and would be wisely heeded.              

 








Conclusion

 

141           The
evidence in the case at bar was not created in a manner which offends the
spousal incompetence rule, and therefore, there is no need to prevent its
admission.  Similarly, there is no need to consider any potential “unfairness”
to the appellant’s marriage arising from the admission as part of a
case-by-case inquiry.   I would dispose of this case in the manner proposed by
the Chief Justice and Iacobucci J.

 

\\Major J.\\

 

The reasons of Sopinka, McLachlin and Major JJ. were
delivered by

 

142           Major J. (dissenting) -- I agree with
the reasons of the Chief Justice and Justice Iacobucci except on two issues. 
The first is their use of the principled exception to the hearsay rule to avoid
the policy underlying s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act ., R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-5 .  The second is their interference with the trial judge’s residual
discretion to exclude evidence.

 

143           As
my view on the first issue results in allowing the appeals it is unnecessary to
elaborate on the second issue.

 








144           The
appellant Hawkins and the co-accused were jointly charged with conspiracy to
obstruct justice.  Hawkins was also charged with having corruptly accepted
money and obstruction of justice.  Graham, the girlfriend of Hawkins, provided
damaging evidence against him at the preliminary inquiry on these charges.  She
later returned to the preliminary inquiry and recanted much of her previous
testimony.  Before trial, Hawkins and Graham married.  The trial judge found
her not compellable to give testimony at trial against her husband, the
appellant, citing the common law rule of spousal incompetence that underlies s.
4  of the Canada Evidence Act .  The Crown then sought to introduce a
transcript of the evidence given by Graham at the preliminary inquiry before
their marriage.  The trial judge refused to allow the admission of the
transcript.

 

145           The
Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the trial judge, and would have allowed the
admission of the transcript: (1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 229, 22 O.R. (3d) 193, 96
C.C.C. (3d) 503, 79 O.A.C. 241.  Arbour J.A. based her decision to admit the
evidence alternatively on s. 715  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , and the principled exception to hearsay.  In a concurring opinion, Weiler
J.A. would have modified the common law rule of spousal incompetence to allow
the Crown to compel Graham to testify, but would not have found the prior
testimony admissible under either theory accepted by Arbour J.A.   At the date
of this Court’s hearing, the couple remained married.

 








146           The
spousal incompetence rule has been part of the common law for more than two
hundred years.  Its present form, recognized and slightly modified by s. 4  of
the Canada Evidence Act , renders the spouse of an accused person
incompetent to testify for the prosecution against their accused spouse.  It
was argued before this Court that the rule should be incrementally modified in
this case, similar to what was done in R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R.
654, to allow the Crown to compel Graham to testify against her husband.  I
agree with my colleagues, at their para. 45, that the “proposed changes, far
from being incremental, would strike at the heart of the traditional rule of
spousal incompetency”.  I also agree that making Graham compellable by the
Crown would threaten the couple’s genuine marital harmony.  The Chief Justice
and Iacobucci J. are correct in their conclusion that the common law rule of
spousal incompetence does not need modification.

 

147           I
agree with the Chief Justice and Iacobucci J. that s. 715  of the Criminal
Code  is not applicable to these facts.  It is not accurate to describe
Graham’s marriage to Hawkins as a refusal to give testimony.  The law renders
her incompetent to give testimony, regardless of her choice.

 

148           I
disagree with their conclusion that the facts in this case permit the use of a
principled exception to the hearsay rule.   

 

Overriding Spousal Incompetence

 

149           To
introduce evidence through the principled exception to the hearsay rule, two
elements must be satisfied: necessity and reliability.  My colleagues find the
necessity element easily satisfied; see para. 73 of their reasons:

 

In this instance, we are satisfied
that Graham was unavailable to testify on behalf of the Crown for the purposes
of the necessity criterion.  The prosecution could not call upon Graham to
testify as a result of her spousal incompetency, and there was no other means
of presenting evidence of a similar value before the court.  In both Khan,
at p. 548, and Rockey, supra, at para. 20, the Court similarly
found that the necessity criterion would be met in circumstances where a child
declarant was legally incompetent to give viva voce evidence at trial.

 








This reasoning appears to ignore the fact that in both R. v. Khan,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, and R.  v. Rockey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 829, per
McLachlin J., what created the necessity for the use of  hearsay testimony was
s. 16  of the Canada Evidence Act , and not the common law underlying s. 4 
as in the present case.  The sections have different policy goals, and must be
treated differently in the analysis of the necessity element of the principled
exception to hearsay.

 

150           For
ease of reference the relevant parts of the sections read:

 

4.
(1)  Every person charged with an offence, and, except as otherwise provided in
this section, the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so
charged, is a competent witness for the defence, whether the person so charged
is charged solely or jointly with any other person.

 

16.
(1) Where a proposed witness is a person under fourteen years of age or a
person whose mental capacity is challenged, the court shall, before permitting
the person to give evidence, conduct an inquiry to determine

 

(a) whether the person understands the nature
of an oath or a solemn affirmation; and

 

(b) whether the person is able to communicate
the evidence.

 

 

                        (2) A
person referred to in subsection (1) who understands the nature of an oath or a
solemn affirmation and is able to communicate the evidence shall testify under
oath or solemn affirmation.

 

                        (3) A
person referred to in subsection (1) who does not understand the nature of an
oath or a solemn affirmation but is able to communicate the evidence may,
notwithstanding any provision of any Act requiring an oath or a solemn
affirmation, testify on promising to tell the truth.

 

                        (4) A
person referred to in subsection (1) who neither understands the nature of an
oath or a solemn affirmation nor is able to communicate the evidence shall not
testify.

 








151           The
policy behind s. 16  is to ensure that witnesses who take the stand are able and
likely to be telling the truth.  The section renders certain potential
witnesses incompetent to give testimony because the law doubts their
testimonial ability to enhance the search for truth.  Individual statements,
however, may have been made in the past by these incompetent witnesses in such
circumstances that the court is reasonably sure of the statements’ veracity. 
Normally, these out-of-court statements are separately barred from admission by
the hearsay rule.  In the cases of Khan and Rockey this Court
used a principled exception to the hearsay rule to introduce these individual
statements into evidence through a hearsay witness where there existed
circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness surrounding their making.  The
element of necessity, required to introduce these statements, is that of
witness incompetence under s. 16 .  By using an exception to hearsay, the court
is actually fulfilling the policy of s. 16  in ensuring that the search for
truth includes this trustworthy evidence that would not normally be heard in
court.

 

152           On
the other hand, the common law recognized in s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act 
has the main policy goals of the maintenance of marital harmony and the
prevention of the natural repugnance that results in having one testify against
his or her accused spouse.  The policy supporting s. 4  is very different from
that behind s. 16 .  Section 4  ensures that spouses, otherwise credible
witnesses, who possess relevant evidence never testify in court.  The policy
may be seen to militate against the search for truth, for the overriding reason
of marital harmony.  However, the policy is grounded in statute and is
recognized in the provisions of the Canada Evidence Act  so that if the
policy is to change it clearly falls to the Parliament of Canada to do so.

 








153           The
principled exception to hearsay created by my colleagues to allow hearsay
statements of incompetent spouses into evidence violates the policy of s. 4  by
forcing spouses to provide evidence against each other.  It amounts to an
extension of the principled exception to hearsay to make the evidence
admissible through the so-called back door.  This should not happen.  It is
clear the best form of this evidence, direct testimony, is barred from the
courtroom for policy reasons.  We should not use the very policy that bars the
direct testimony to allow the introduction of lower quality hearsay testimony.

 

154           I
cannot accept that the admission of this evidence could not have a detrimental
effect on the marriage of Hawkins and Graham.  It was conceded that this is not
a “sham” marriage, but one that has lasted over seven years.  The parties have
fulfilled their mutual obligations of care and support.  Should the previous
testimony of Graham be used to convict Hawkins,  it would violate the policy
foundation of s. 4  and have the potential to destroy an otherwise successful
marriage. 

 

155           This
is so whether the evidence is given at the trial or given at the preliminary
hearing before the marriage and read in at the trial.  The fact that the
evidence was in existence prior to the marriage creates at most a distinction
without any difference.  The admission of the evidence offends both the letter
and the spirit of the spousal incompetence rule.  My colleagues concede that
this is not a case where the common law rule of spousal incompetence should be
modified.  This should also apply with equal force to Graham’s testimony given at
the preliminary inquiry.

 

156           I
subscribe to the view expressed by the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Fifth
Circuit in Ivey v. United States, 344 F.2d 770  (1965), at p. 772:

 

[The hearsay witness’s] testimony
relating what [the accused’s wife] had told him about [the accused’s]
participation in the importation not only violates the rule against admitting
hearsay testimony but also the rule against admitting testimony of one spouse
against the other.

 

 . . .

 

She might as well be permitted to testify against
her husband in open court as to permit the introduction of a statement she had
made against him out of court.  [Emphasis added.]








 

 

157           This
is not an entirely new issue.  In Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton rev.
1961), vol. 8, at §2232, the learned authors comment that:

 

It can be argued that that which is privileged is the
testimonial utterance in any form, by the wife or husband, offered against the
other.  Hearsay statements -- oral or documentary -- are testimonial
utterances.  Hence, it would follow that they are equally privileged with
testimony on the stand.

 

 

 

The authors of Wigmore are referring, in this section, to the
use of hearsay exceptions in general.  It is important to affirm this
statement.  When evidence is excluded for policy reasons, that policy should
not form the basis for the admission of that evidence by the indirect method
proposed by my colleagues.

 

158           In
§2232, quoted above, the authors of Wigmore  cross-reference  §2325, on
attorney-client privilege, which states:

 

Clearly the privilege could not
permit an evasion by receiving the voluntary extrajudicial disclosures of the
attorney.  Supposing them to be somehow admissible in spite of the hearsay
rule, they would be equally a violation of the privilege with his voluntary
disclosures on the stand.  If his disclosure has taken the form of handing a
confidential document to a third person, the objection is equally forcible, and
the question is not complicated with the hearsay rule.

 

 

 








It is hardly arguable that the necessity element of the principled
exception to hearsay would be satisfied by the accused’s assertion of
solicitor-client privilege over a “piece” of hearsay evidence.  It is unlikely
that my colleagues would even consider the use of the principled exception at
all.  It would subvert the policy underlying privilege.  So too does the use of
the principled exception in the present case avoid the policy underlying the
spousal incompetence rule.

 

159           A
species of this argument has been considered by this Court.  In R. v. B.
(K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, Lamer C.J. discussed the threshold that must
be met before the admission of prior inconsistent statements through the
principled exception to hearsay (at p. 784):

 

. . . I would adopt the requirement embodied in the
provision proposed by the Law Reform Commission of Canada, and in the English
Civil Evidence Act 1968, that prior inconsistent statements will
only be admissible if they would have been admissible as the witness’s sole
testimony.  That is, if the witness could not have made the statement at trial
during his or her examination-in-chief or cross-examination, for whatever
reason, it cannot be made admissible through the back door, as it were, under
the reformed prior inconsistent statement rule.

 

 

 

Although Lamer C.J.’s statement of the rule is in the context of
prior inconsistent statements, and discusses the issue as a preliminary matter,
it can be applied to the case at bar.  This was also the view of Weiler J.A. in
the Ontario Court of Appeal, at p. 269 C.R.:

 

If Graham were called to testify at
Hawkins’ trial (without any modification of the common law) she could not make
any statement because she would be considered incompetent.  In this sense, the
evidence would not satisfy the precondition for the admissibility of hearsay
evidence required under K.G.B.  One cannot admit statements through the
“back door” when a witness could not make those statements at trial.

 

 

 








The Crown is attempting to introduce evidence through a principled
exception to hearsay, evidence which the Crown would not be permitted to obtain
through direct testimony.  This is using the so-called back door to overcome
the prohibition acknowledged in s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act .  Graham
could not take the stand at trial.  Reading in Graham’s testimony from the
preliminary inquiry equates with forcing her to give testimony against her
husband.

 

160           There
appears to be little Canadian jurisprudence on this question.  However, the
same situation arose almost contemporaneously in Saskatchewan.  In R. v.
Kobussen (1995), 130 Sask. R. 147 (Q.B.), the girlfriend of the accused
gave evidence at a preliminary inquiry.  They married before the trial.  As she
was therefore incompetent to testify against her husband at trial, the Crown
attempted to introduce into evidence a transcript of her preliminary inquiry
testimony.  Baynton J. cited the section of Lamer C.J.’s judgment in B.
(K.G.) quoted above for the proposition that the reformed prior
inconsistent statements rule should not be used to admit evidence that would be
inadmissible as direct testimony, and then held (at p. 152) that:

 

If this admissibility principle or
condition applies to hearsay statements in general, and not just those that are
[sic] constitute prior inconsistent statements, it can be argued that
the Crown in tendering Ms. Myden’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry is
doing indirectly what it cannot do directly at the trial.  The Crown is
prevented by a rule of evidence, (not just the old hearsay rule, but a common
law rule of competency and compellability often referred to by the case law and
legal authors as a “spousal privilege”), from calling Ms. Myden as a witness at
trial.  If her testimony at the preliminary inquiry is allowed in, it is in
many respects equivalent to her testifying on behalf of the Crown at the trial
of her husband.  Her testimony at the trial is what the common law and s. 4 
[of] the Canada Evidence Act  preclude.

 

. . .

 

 

If it is the testimony of the spouse as a witness at
the trial that is precluded or privileged, then it seems contrary to the
principles of “spousal privilege” (that involves not only compellability but
competence), that the testimony of that spouse can nevertheless be introduced
by the Crown on the basis of an expanded hearsay admissibility rule.

 

 

 








It was clear to Baynton J. that using a hearsay exception would
avoid the policy of spousal incompetence.

 

161           In
Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), the United States Supreme
Court  modified the common law rule on spousal incompetence to give the
witness-spouse, rather than the accused spouse, control over whether they would
give testimony in a case where their spouse is the accused.  This was done by
modifying the common law, and not overriding a statute like s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act .  I have already agreed with my colleagues that we should not
modify the rule of spousal incompetence.  Nor should we avoid that rule by the
use of a hearsay exception.

 

162           A
principled exception to hearsay should not be used to allow the Crown to
introduce lower quality evidence (the transcript of Graham’s preliminary
inquiry testimony) when they are barred by the spousal incompetence rule from
introducing direct testimony from her to the same effect.  This violates the
law and is contrary to express legislative policy.  I would restore the
decision of Philp J. to exclude this evidence.

 

163           It
may be that the policy excluding spousal evidence does not serve societal
interests.  If that is so it seems apparent that the change should be
legislative.

 

164           I
would allow the appeals and restore the decision of  Philp J.

This appeal is here as of right.  We agree with the Court of Appeal that this
was not one of the clearest cases in which a stay of proceedings was
warranted.  In our opinion, the Court of Appeal was justified in reviewing and
reversing the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion by reason of the trial
judge’s failure to take into account the absence on the part of the appellant
of timely objection to non‑disclosure and by reason of the trial judge’s
error in finding that a stay was the only appropriate remedy.  The appeal is
dismissed.

Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Identification ‑‑ Videotape recorded by security camera during
robbery ‑‑ Trial judge identifying accused in court as perpetrator
of  crime on basis of  videotape ‑‑ No corroborating testimony that
accused was person depicted in tape ‑‑ Whether videotape alone
provides necessary evidence to enable trier of  fact to identify  accused as
perpetrator of crime ‑‑ If so, whether trial judge erred in
circumstances of case in identifying and convicting accused solely on basis of
videotape evidence.

 








The accused was charged with robbing a convenience
store.  The store clerk described the robber to the police and, a few days
later, was shown 12 photographs.  At trial, the clerk stated that he suspected
three of the men shown, one of whom was the accused, but that he could be no
more than 25 to 30 percent sure that any of them was the robber.   He also
stated that, when he was first shown the photographs, the one he suspected the
most was not the accused.  The Crown introduced as evidence the videotape of
the robbery, recorded by the store security camera, and the clerk testified
that it showed all of the robbery.  At the conclusion of the review of the
videotape, the clerk was asked if the man who robbed him was in court, to which
he replied that he did not think so.  A police officer who knew the accused
testified that when he arrested him his facial appearance was different from
that in court.  The Crown closed its case and the defence elected to call no
evidence.  The trial judge directed herself as to the frailties of eyewitness
identification but indicated that the videotape was very clear and that the
robber was in the camera long enough for her to make a careful observation. 
She concluded that the person who committed the robbery on the tape was the
accused and she convicted him. The Court of Appeal quashed the accused’s
conviction as unreasonable and entered an acquittal.  The court found that the
trial judge should not have relied solely on her own comparison between the
appearance of the person on the videotape and the appearance of the accused in
court to reach a conclusion that had no other foundation in the evidence.

 

Held (Sopinka and Major
JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and La
Forest, L’Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci  JJ.: 
Courts have recognized the importance and usefulness of videotapes  in the
search for truth in criminal trials as this type of evidence can serve to
establish innocence just as surely and effectively as it may establish guilt. 
A video camera records accurately all that it perceives and it is precisely
because videotape evidence can present such very clear and convincing evidence
of identification that triers of fact can use it as the sole basis for the identification
of the accused before them as the perpetrator of the crime.

 

Once it is established that a videotape has not been
altered or changed, and that it depicts the scene of a crime, it becomes
admissible and relevant evidence.  Not only is the tape real evidence, but it
is also, to a certain extent, testimonial evidence as well.  It should be used
by a trier of fact in determining whether a crime has been committed and
whether the accused before the court committed the crime.  The degree of
clarity and quality of the tape, and to a lesser extent the length of time
during which the accused appears on the videotape, will all contribute to
establishing the weight which a trier of fact may properly place upon the
evidence.  The time of depiction may not be significant for even if there are
but a few frames which clearly show the perpetrator that may be sufficient to
identify the accused.

 

Although triers of fact are entitled to reach a
conclusion as to identification based solely on videotape evidence, they must
exercise care in doing so.  When a jury is asked to identify an accused in this
manner, clear directions must be given to them as to how they are to approach
this task.  They should be instructed to consider carefully whether the video
is of sufficient clarity and quality and shows the accused for a sufficient
time to enable them to conclude that identification has been proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.  If it is the only evidence adduced as to identity, the jury
should be reminded of this.  Further, they should be told, once again, of the
important requirement that, in order to convict on the basis of the videotape
alone, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it identifies the
accused.  A trial judge sitting alone must be subject to the same cautions and
directions as a jury in considering videotape evidence of identification.

 








Here,  the trial judge did not err in finding the
accused guilty of  robbery.  The videotape is of excellent quality and depicts
the accused for a significant period of time.  The evidence of  the tape is of
such clarity and strength that it provided convincing evidence upon which the
trial judge could properly base her finding of fact that the accused was the
person shown in the tape.  There was no need for corroboration of this tape.
The fact that the store clerk could not identify the accused is not of great
significance.  The violent and menacing jab made by the robber with a large
knife directed towards the clerk suggests that self‑preservation, not
identification, may very reasonably have been the clerk’s prime concern at the
time of the robbery.

 

Per Sopinka and Major 
JJ. (dissenting):  While  the sensory observations of a trial judge, based on a
review of a videotape and the appearance of the accused, are admissible
evidence of ""identity"" to support a guilty verdict, the evidence in
this case makes it clear that the verdict rendered at trial was
""unreasonable"" within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(I) of
the Criminal Code .  The accused was convicted on the basis of very weak
identification evidence, which was undermined by the evidence of the Crown's
only eyewitness.

 








                   The trial judge relied on her own observations of
the videotape to convict the accused.  She made these observations after having
viewed the 30‑second video only once.  She  made no reference to specific
characteristics of the man on the videotape that conformed to the appearance of
the accused and there was no confirmatory evidence supporting her observations
of the video and the accused.  Not only did the trial judge’s observations not
have any support in the evidence but, more importantly, her observations were
contradicted by the evidence of the store clerk ‑‑ the only person
who actually witnessed the crime ‑‑ who, despite his opportunity to
view the accused and the tape in the courtroom, was unable to conclude that the
accused was the man on the video.  There was also evidence that, a few days
after the robbery, the store clerk  identified a person other than the accused
as the more likely perpetrator of the crime.   Further, it is significant that
the trial judge’s observations are entirely untested by cross‑examination
and they cannot be tested on appeal.  In order to evaluate the
reasonableness of the evidence upon which a trier of fact relies, a court of
appeal must be able to examine all the evidence.  All the assurances about the
clarity of the video are of no avail if the court  cannot see the person with
whom the comparison is being made.  The accused’s conviction was thus based on
evidence that amounted to no more than the untested opinion of the trial judge
which was contradicted by other evidence that the trial judge did not reject.  
In the circumstances of this case, it was unreasonable for the trial judge to
convict based on her opinion alone.  In light of the inherent frailties of
identification evidence, the accused’s conviction rests on a shaky foundation
and is unsafe and unsatisfactory.  The verdict cannot be supported by the
evidence.

Cory J. -- Can a videotape
alone provide the necessary evidence to enable the trier of fact to identify
the accused as the perpetrator of the crime?  That is the question that must be
resolved on this appeal.

 








I.       Factual Background

 

2             
In 1991, during the early morning hours of May 13, Mahmood Wahabzada was
the sole employee in a Mac’s Milk store.  At about 2:00 a.m., a man armed
with a knife entered the store and ordered him to open the cash register. 
Mr. Wahabzada complied.  The robber took some $230 from the register and
fled.  The store clerk described the robber to the police as hefty with a
strong build, blond hair, a mustache and taller than his own height of 175
centimetres.  He could not recall the clothes worn by the robber.  As he
explained at the trial “You know that time is a very panic time.  One cannot
remember everything”.  Two days after the robbery, the store clerk was shown
photos of 12 men.  He suspected three of the men shown, one of whom was the
respondent (accused).  At the trial, he testified that he thought that the man
shown in photograph number 8, who was not the respondent, could be the
robber but he was only 25 to 30 percent sure.  He said that when he was first
shown the photos he could be no more definite than to say that he “mostly”
suspected photograph number 8.

 

3             
The police officers gave evidence that when he was shown the photos the
store clerk exclaimed “that’s him” when looking at photo number 6 (which
was of the respondent) or “He looks just like him” referring to the same photo,
but added “He looks a bit like him also” when referring to photo number 8.

 

4             
The Crown introduced as evidence the videotape of the robbery, recorded
by the store security camera.  The store clerk testified that it showed all of
the robbery.  At the conclusion of the review of the videotape, the clerk was
asked if the man who robbed him was in court, to which he replied that he did
not think so.

 








5             
A detective who had known the respondent for some years was present at
the time of his arrest.  He testified that the respondent then had a sparse
mustache covering the upper part of his lip, which was not present on the day
of the trial.  In cross‑examination, the officer acknowledged that the
respondent had denied committing the robbery and said that he’d been home with
his mother and brother.  The defence did not present any evidence.

 

II.     The Courts Below

 

A.     Judgment at Trial

 

6             
It is necessary in this appeal to set out some of the discussions which
took place between counsel for the defence during his submissions and the trial
judge as well as portions of the reasons.  Counsel for the respondent cautioned
the trial judge of the frailties of eyewitness identification.  In response and
as part of her reasons, the trial judge stated:

 

I have directed my mind, but what about that video tape?  I mean the
video tape does away with a lot of the frailty of identification by a witness
who said to me he was frightened, he was nervous, he couldn’t recall some of
it.  And look at the tape.  The tape doesn’t lie.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

. . . a movie showing the robbery being committed is surely
one of the best forms of evidence you’ve got.  And not only was the movie ‑‑
the man’s face was practically in front of the screen.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

I looked at that video, and I looked at it very
carefully, and I can honestly tell you there is no doubt in my mind that the
man who committed that robbery on that video was your client.

 

                                                                   . . .

 








As I said earlier, I’ve directed myself to all the
frailties of the I.D. cases.  And over my years as counsel, I know I was
involved in a number where it was a serious issue, and I’m well aware of all of
it, and the reason behind the case law.

 

And a lot of the reasons for those frailties are the
very things that exist in this case.  An act of violence, which happens quickly
and unexpectedly to a victim who is terrified.

 

At best he could say that Photograph 6 looked like,
and he also pointed to 8 and to 11.  He said quite bluntly: I was afraid.  I
can’t remember all.  He also doesn’t have English as a first language.

 

Now, I’ve seen video tapes in the past that have
been grainy, where the lighting hasn’t been good, where there’s no clear view
over a period of time of the robbery and of the perpetrator.

 

This particular video tape is very clear.  The
lighting is very good.  The man is in the camera for long enough to make a
careful observation.  And the issue of beyond a reasonable doubt is when I’m
obliged to make a decision, and I cannot ignore what my eyes tell me, and my
eyes tell me, and there’s no dispute this isn’t a video tape of the robbery,
that the person who committed that robbery is Mr. Nikolovski, and I can’t
ignore that. . . .

 

It would be mere speculation for me to say, there’s
one chance in a million he’s got an absolute twin running around, who happened
to rob that store, that’s getting into the realm of speculation at that point.

 

The trial
judge concluded, without calling upon the Crown:

 

. . . I think we’ve beaten this to death. . . . I’m
satisfied that the robbery was committed by your client.  I’m satisfied on
looking at that tape that that’s him and he’s convicted.

 

B.     The Court of Appeal

 

7             
The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and
entered the acquittal of the respondent: (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 676, 73 O.A.C.
258, 92 C.C.C. (3d) 37, 34 C.R. (4th) 98.

 








8             
Arbour J.A., on behalf of a unanimous court, agreed with the trial judge
that the videotape was of very good quality and that the image was sharp and
clear.  She observed as well that there was no doubt that the videotape would
permit a comparison to be made between the robber and the accused appearing
before the trial judge.

 

9             
However, she was doubtful whether a prosecution could be successful
where identification evidence was made solely on the basis of a photograph or
videotape without confirmatory evidence from a witness linking the accused to
the crime.  She observed that no one identified the respondent as the man in
the videotape, except the trial judge.  She expressed the view that the Crown
ought to have called the detective who had known the respondent for some years
to testify as to whether the person on the videotape and the respondent were
one and the same.

 

10         
Thus, the court determined that, although the trial judge was not in
error in reaching her conclusion on the basis of the videotape evidence, it
still remained to be decided whether the conviction was unreasonable.  On this
issue, Arbour J.A. stated (at pp. 690‑91 O.R.):

 

In a case such as this one where the
identification is made exclusively by the trier of fact and has no other
support in the evidence, and operating within the constraints of appellate
review that such a record creates, I can only conclude that the conviction is
unreasonable. . . .

 

The videotape was properly entered as an exhibit at
trial after the witness identified it as depicting accurately the scene of the
robbery, and the trial judge would have been entitled to examine the videotape
to assess the credibility of the identification evidence based on the
videotape, had there been any.  However, in my view the trial judge should
not have relied solely on her own comparison between the appearance of the
person on the videotape and the appearance of the accused in court to reach a
conclusion that had no other foundation in the evidence.  In all the
circumstances, I consider that this amounts to an unsafe verdict.  [Emphasis
added.]

 








11         
Therefore, it appears to be the opinion of the Court of Appeal that
corroboration by a witness that the person shown in the videotape is the
accused is essential and its absence is fatal to the case.

 

III.    Issues to Be
Resolved

 

12         
1.        Can a trier of fact identify the accused before the court as
the perpetrator of the crime on the basis of a viewing of the videotape alone
without any corroborating testimony that the accused is the person depicted in
the tape?

 

2.      On the facts presented in this case, did
the trial judge err in identifying and convicting the accused solely on the
basis of the videotape evidence?

 

IV.    The Purpose of
Evidence Adduced at Criminal Trials

 

13         
The ultimate aim of any trial, criminal or civil, must be to seek and to
ascertain the truth.  In a criminal trial the search for truth is undertaken to
determine whether the accused before the court is, beyond a reasonable doubt,
guilty of the crime with which he is charged.  The evidence adduced must be
relevant and admissible.  That is to say, it must be logically probative and
legally receivable.  The evidence may be that of eyewitnesses, or it may be
circumstantial, including the production of physical evidence which is often
termed “real evidence”.  In every criminal case, if there is to be conviction,
the evidence must be sufficiently convincing that the trier of fact is
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.

 








14         
With the progress of scientific studies and advances in technology,
evidence put forward particularly as to identification has changed over the
years.  The admission of new types of evidence is often resisted at first and
yet, later accepted as commonplace and essential to the task of truth finding. 
Fingerprint evidence may be the first example of scientific evidence leading to
identification.  Similarly, blood typing with its ever increasing refinements
can be extremely helpful in identification.  DNA testing is yet another
example.  It must never be forgotten that evidence of this type can serve to
establish innocence just as surely and effectively as it may establish guilt. 
The case of Guy‑Paul Morin serves as a constant reminder of this.

 

V.     The Evolution of
the Use of Audio Tapes, Photographs and Videotapes as Evidence in Canada

 

15         
It may be helpful to consider the evolution of the use of audio and
video tape evidence in Canada.  In R. v. Pleich (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d)
13, at p. 32, the Court of Appeal for Ontario recognized that tape
recordings are real evidence that had, as well, many of the characteristics of
testimonial evidence.  In R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1, the
use of audio tapes was considered by the same court.  It found that it was the
tapes themselves that constituted the evidence which should be considered by
the jury.  It emphasized that the tapes could provide cogent and convincing
evidence of culpability or equally powerful and convincing evidence of
innocence.  It stressed that the members of the jury must have equipment
available to them so that they could themselves listen to the tapes and reach
their decision as to the weight that should be given to them.  It was expressed
in this way (at pp. 47‑48 and 49):

 

It is true that the tapes themselves constitute
the evidence which should be and must be considered by the jury.  It is the
tapes which will demonstrate not simply the words spoken by an accused or co‑conspirator,
but also the emphasis given to particular words and phrases and the tone of
voice employed by the participants during the intercepted conversations.  Upon
hearing the tape, the jocular exclamation will be readily distinguishable from
the menacing threat of violence.  The tapes may provide cogent and convincing evidence
of culpability or equally powerful and convincing evidence of innocence.








                                                                   . . .

 

As well the necessary equipment must be made available so that
the jury may listen to the tapes themselves.  [Emphasis added.]

 

16         
I agree with the reasoning and conclusion on this issue set out in Pleich
and Rowbotham.  A tape, particularly if it is not challenged as to its
accuracy or continuity, can provide the most cogent evidence not only of the
actual words used but in the manner in which they were spoken.  A tape will
very often have a better and more accurate recollection of the words used and
the manner in which they were spoken than a witness who was a party to the
conversation or overheard the words. As a result of Rowbotham, the trier
of fact in Ontario was very properly authorized to use his or her own senses in
determining the weight that should be accorded to the evidence of an audio
tape.  There is no reason why this same reasoning should not be applied to
videotapes.

 

17         
The admission of videotapes as evidence seems to be a natural
progression from audio tapes.  In R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740,
at pp. 768 and 774, this Court praised the evidence obtained from
videotapes as a “milestone” contributing to the “triumph of a principled
analysis over a set of ossified judicially created categories”.  In R. v.
Leaney, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393, the main identification evidence against the
accused was a videotape of the crime in progress and the testimony of five
police officers.  Although this Court held that the evidence of four of the
police officers ought to have been excluded, it upheld the conviction of Leaney
on the basis of the trial judge’s own observations of the videotape and his
comparison of the tape to the accused in the box.  At page 415,
McLachlin J., for the majority, stated:

 








Given the trial judge’s clear statement that he
arrived at his conclusion as to identity independently of the evidence of the
police officers, their evidence assumes the character of mere surplusage, which
does not vitiate the judge’s conclusion that Leaney was one of the persons
shown on the video screen.  To put it another way, the judge, properly
instructing himself, concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Leaney
participated in the break‑in.

 

18         
Similarly in R. v. L. (D.O.), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, L’Heureux‑Dubé
J., in concurring reasons, noted that the modern trend has been to admit all
relevant and probative evidence and allow the trier of fact to determine the
weight which should be given to that evidence, in order to arrive at a just
result.  She observed that this is most likely to be achieved when the decision
makers have all the relevant probative information before them.  She wrote at
p. 455, that “[i]t would seem contrary to the judgments of our Court (Seaboyer
and B. (K.G.) . . .) to disallow evidence available through
technological advances, such as videotaping, that may benefit the truth seeking
process”.

 

VI.    Some Comparisons
Between Videotape Evidence and that of Eyewitnesses

 








19         
Thus the importance and usefulness of videotapes have been recognized. 
This is as it should be.  The courts have long recognized the frailties of
identification evidence given by independent, honest and well-meaning
eyewitnesses.  This recognized frailty served to emphasize the essential need
to cross‑examine eyewitnesses.  So many factors come into play with the
human identification witness.  As a minimum it must be determined whether the
witness was physically in a position to see the accused and, if so, whether
that witness had sound vision, good hearing, intelligence and the ability to
communicate what was seen and heard.  Did the witness have the ability to
understand and recount what had been perceived?  Did the witness have a sound
memory?  What was the effect of fear or excitement on the ability of the witness
to perceive clearly and to later recount the events accurately?  Did the
witness have a bias or at least a biased perception of the event or the parties
involved?  This foreshortened list of the frailties of eyewitness
identification may serve as a basis for considering the comparative strengths
of videotape evidence.

 

20         
It cannot be forgotten that a robbery can be a terrifyingly traumatic
event for the victim and witnesses.  Not every witness can have the fictional
James Bond’s cool and unflinching ability to act and observe in the face of
flying bullets and flashing knives.  Even Bond might have difficulty accurately
describing his would be assassin.  He certainly might earnestly desire his
attacker’s conviction and be biased in that direction.

 

21         
The video camera on the other hand is never subject to stress.  Through
tumultuous events it continues to record accurately and dispassionately all
that comes before it.  Although silent, it remains a constant, unbiased witness
with instant and total recall of all that it observed.  The trier of fact may
review the evidence of this silent witness as often as desired.  The tape may
be stopped and studied at a critical juncture.

 








22         
So long as the videotape is of good quality and gives a clear picture of
events and the perpetrator, it may provide the best evidence of the identity of
the perpetrator.  It is relevant and admissible evidence that can by itself be
cogent and convincing evidence on the issue of identity.  Indeed, it may be the
only evidence available.  For example, in the course of a robbery, every
eyewitness may be killed yet the video camera will steadfastly continue to
impassively record the robbery and the actions of the robbers.  Should a trier
of fact be denied the use of the videotape because there is no intermediary in
the form of a human witness to make some identification of the accused?  Such a
conclusion would be contrary to common sense and a totally unacceptable
result.  It would deny the trier of fact the use of clear, accurate and
convincing evidence readily available by modern technology.  The powerful and
probative record provided by the videotape should not be excluded when it can
provide such valuable assistance in the search for truth.  In the course of
their deliberations, triers of fact will make their assessment of the weight
that should be accorded the evidence of the videotape just as they assess the
weight of the evidence given by viva voce testimony.

 

23         
It is precisely because videotape evidence can present such very clear
and convincing evidence of identification that triers of fact can use it as the
sole basis for the identification of the accused before them as the perpetrator
of the crime.  It is clear that a trier of fact may, despite all the potential
frailties, find an accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of the
testimony of a single eyewitness.  It follows that the same result may be
reached with even greater certainty upon the basis of good quality video
evidence.  Surely, if a jury had only the videotape and the accused before
them, they would be at liberty to find that the accused they see in the box was
the person shown in the videotape at the scene of the crime committing the
offence.  If an appellate court, upon a review of the tape, is satisfied that
it is of sufficient clarity and quality that it would be reasonable for the
trier of fact to identify the accused as the person in the tape beyond any
reasonable doubt then that decision should not be disturbed.  Similarly, a
judge sitting alone can identify the accused as the person depicted in the
videotape.

 

VII.   Use of
Photographic Evidence in Other Jurisdictions

 

A.     United Kingdom

 

24         
The question as to whether a jury could, without other evidence, use a
photo taken by a security camera to identify the accused arose in R. v.
Dodson, [1984] 1 W.L.R. 971 (C.C.A.).  In that case it was unanimously held
that the photographs were relevant and admissible evidence that could be used
by the jury to identify the accused.  The position was put in this way at
pp. 978‑79:








 

We entertain no doubt that photographs taken by
the process installed and operated in the branch office of the building society
are admissible in evidence.  They are relevant to the issues as to (a) whether
an offence was committed and (b) who committed it.  What is relevant is,
subject to any rule of exclusion ‑‑ we know of none which is
applicable to this situation, prima facie admissible. . . .

 

Moreover, we reject the attempt here made to
persuade this court to prevent a jury from looking at photographs taken by
means of this technique, looking at a defendant in the dock and then to
conclude if it be safe to do so that the man in the dock is the man shown in
the photographs.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

It is, however, imperative that a jury is warned by
a judge in summing up of the perils of deciding whether by this means alone or
with some form of supporting evidence a defendant has committed the crime
alleged.  According to the quality of photographs, change of appearance in a
defendant and other considerations which may arise in a trial, the jury’s task
may be rendered difficult or simple in bringing about a decision either in
favour of or against a defendant.  So long as the jury having been brought face
to face with these perils are firmly directed that to convict they must be sure
that the man in the dock is the man in the photograph, we envisage no injustice
arising from this manner of evaluating evidence with the aid of what the
jurors’ eyes tell them is a fact which they are sure exists.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

25         
These conclusions were repeated and affirmed by the same court in R.
v. Downey, [1995] 1 Cr. App. R. 547.  Thus the English courts have come to
the conclusion that photographic evidence may, without more, be considered by a
trier of fact in determining whether the accused before them is the person
appearing in the photograph.  In my view, there cannot be any distinction
between a still photograph and a videotape.  Indeed, a videotape may well
provide stronger evidence than a still photograph.

 

B.  United States of America

 








26         
The current edition of Wigmore (Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 3
(Chadbourn rev. 1970), § 790) indicates a change in the position of the writers
of the text.  Earlier editions took the position that the photograph may be
admissible only as the testimony of a qualified eyewitness who, instead of
giving a verbal description of what the picture portrays, adopts it as a
substitute for his or her description.  This was known as the “pictorial
testimony” theory of photographs.  However, with the advances in the art of
photography and an increasing awareness of the evidentiary uses of photographs,
the Wigmore text now recognizes that once there is an adequate assurance of the
accuracy of the process producing the picture, the photograph should be
received as a so‑called silent witness or as a witness which “speaks for
itself”.  The text puts the position in this way at pp. 219‑21:

 

These consequences remain to be more fully
considered.  It is sufficient to note at this point that, by universal judicial
concession, a map, model, or diagram, takes an evidential place simply as a non‑verbal
mode of expressing a witness’ testimony....

 

Upon like principles a photograph may be admissible
as the testimony of a qualified witness who instead of verbalizing his
knowledge of what the picture portrays, adopts it as a substitute for
description with words.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

This theory which has been aptly dubbed the
“pictorial testimony theory of photographs”, was advanced in prior editions of
this work as the only theoretical basis which could justify the receipt of
photographs in evidence.  With later advancements in the art of photography,
however, and with increasing awareness of the manifold evidentiary uses of the
products of the art, it has become clear that an additional theory of
admissibility of photographs is entitled to recognition.  Thus, even though no
human is capable of swearing that he personally perceived what a photograph
purports to portray (so that it is not possible to satisfy the requirements of
the “pictorial testimony” rationale) there may nevertheless be good warrant for
receiving the photograph in evidence.  Given an adequate foundation assuring
the accuracy of the process producing it, the photograph should then be
received as a so‑called silent witness or as a witness which “speaks for
itself.”

 

The demands of this theory for recognition and the
inadequacies of the older view to meet the modern needs of forensic proof are
tellingly put in the following forceful opinion:

 








Peters J., in People v. Bowley, 59 Cal. 2d
855, 859, 382 P.2d 591, 594, 31 Cal. Rptr. 471, 474‑475 (1963): 
According to Professor Wigmore, a photograph is no more than the nonverbal
expression of the witness upon whose foundation testimony its authenticity
rests. (3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) §790, pp. 174‑175; ibid.
§792, p. 178; ibid. §793, p. 186.  See International Union etc. v.
Russell, 264 Ala. 456, 88 So. 2d 175, 186, 62 A.L.R.2d 669.)  It is merely that
witness’ testimony in illustrated form; a “pictorial communication of a
qualified witness who uses this method of communication instead of or in
addition to some other method.”  (3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) §793,
p. 186.) . . .

 

Other authorities disagree.  They urge that once
a proper foundation has been established as to the accuracy and
authenticity of a photograph, “it speaks with a certain probative force in
itself.”  (Scott, Photographic Evidence (1942) §601, p. 476.) 
“(P)hotographs may, under proper safeguards, not only be used to illustrate
testimony, but also as photographic or silent witnesses who speak for
themselves. . . . (A) picture taken with adequate equipment under proper
conditions by a skilled photographer is itself substantive evidence to be
weighed by the jury.” (Gardner, The Camera Goes to Court (1946) 24 N.C.L.
Rev. 233, 245.  See State v. Goyet, 120 Vt. 12, 132 A.2d 623, 631; A. & N.
Dept. Stores v. Retail etc. [1950] 2 D.L.R. 850; McKelvey, Evidence (5th ed.
1944) 663‑664.)

 

Until now, this court has not been called upon to
state the theory upon which photographs are admitted into evidence.  (See
Comment, 8 Hastings L.J. (1957) 310.)  In doing so we recognize that
photographs are useful for different purposes.  When admitted merely to aid a
witness in explaining his testimony they are, as Wigmore states, nothing more
than the illustrated testimony of that witness.  But they may also be used
as probative evidence of what they depict.  Used in this manner they take on
the status of independent “silent” witnesses.  (See McKelvey, Evidence (5th
ed. 1944) §379, p. 668).

 

                                                                   . . .

 

There is no reason why a photograph or film,
like an X‑ray, may not, in a proper case, be probative in itself.  To
hold otherwise would illogically limit the use of a device whose memory is
without question more accurate and reliable than that of a human witness. 
It would exclude from evidence the chance picture of a crowd which on close
examination shows the commission of a crime that was not seen by the
photographer at the time.  It would exclude from evidence pictures taken with a
telescopic lens.  It would exclude from evidence pictures taken by a camera set
to go off when a building’s door is opened at night.  (See Scott, Photographic
Evidence (1942) §197, pp. 211‑213; Crim.L.Rev. [1957] p. 708.) 
We hold, therefore, that a photograph may, in a proper case, be admissible
into evidence not merely as illustrated testimony of a human witness but as
probative evidence in itself of what it shows.  [Underlining added.]

 

27         
Thus, it is apparent that there is in the United Kingdom and in the
United States strong support for the position advanced in these reasons.

 








VIII. Summary of the
Positions as to the First Issue (the Use That Can Be Made of Photographs or
Videotape)

 

28         
Once it is established that a videotape has not been altered or changed,
and that it depicts the scene of a crime, then it becomes admissible and
relevant evidence.  Not only is the tape (or photograph) real evidence in the
sense that that term has been used in earlier cases, but it is to a certain
extent, testimonial evidence as well.  It can and should be used by a trier of
fact in determining whether a crime has been committed and whether the accused
before the court committed the crime.  It may indeed be a silent, trustworthy,
unemotional, unbiased and accurate witness who has complete and instant recall
of events.  It may provide such strong and convincing evidence that of itself
it will demonstrate clearly either the innocence or guilt of the accused.

 

29         
The weight to be accorded that evidence can be assessed from a viewing
of the videotape.  The degree of clarity and quality of the tape, and to a
lesser extent the length of time during which the accused appears on the
videotape, will all go towards establishing the weight which a trier of fact
may properly place upon the evidence.  The time of depiction may not be
significant for even if there are but a few frames which clearly show the
perpetrator that may be sufficient to identify the accused.  Particularly will
this be true if the trier of fact has reviewed the tape on several occasions
and stopped it to study the pertinent frames.

 








30         
Although triers of fact are entitled to reach a conclusion as to
identification based solely on videotape evidence, they must exercise care in
doing so.  For example, when a jury is asked to identify an accused in this
manner, it is essential that clear directions be given to them as to how they
are to approach this task.  They should be instructed to consider carefully
whether the video is of sufficient clarity and quality and shows the accused
for a sufficient time to enable them to conclude that identification has been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  If it is the only evidence adduced as to
identity, the jury should be reminded of this.  Further, they should be told
once again of the importance that, in order to convict on the basis of the
videotape alone, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it
identifies the accused.

 

31         
The jury or trial judge sitting alone must be able to review the
videotape during their deliberations.  However, the viewing equipment used at
that time should be the same or similar to that used during the trial.  I would
think that very often triers of fact will want to review the tape on more than
one occasion.

 

32         
A trial judge sitting alone must be subject to the same cautions and
directions as a jury in considering videotape evidence of identification.  It
would be helpful if, after reviewing the tape, the trial judge indicated that
he or she was impressed with its clarity and quality to the extent that a
finding of identity could be based upon it.  This courtesy would permit Crown
or particularly defence counsel to call, for example, expert evidence as to the
quality of the tape or evidence as to any changes in appearance of the accused
between the taking of the videotape and the trial and to prepare submissions
pertaining to identification based on the tape.

 

IX.     Application
of the Criteria Pertinent to Videotape in the Case at Bar

 

33         
The Court of Appeal correctly recognized that the trial judge could
properly consider the videotape, which they conceded was clear and of high
quality.  Despite this, they appear to have concluded that there had to be some
corroboration of the tape itself before the trial judge could rely upon it to
identify the accused.  On this point, I must respectfully disagree.








 

34         
I viewed the tape and it is indeed of excellent quality and great
clarity.  The accused is depicted for a significant period of time.  At one
point, it is almost as though there was a close‑up of the accused taken
specifically for identification purposes.  There is certainly more than
adequate evidence on the tape itself from which the trial judge could determine
whether or not the person before her was the one who committed the robbery. 
The fact that the store clerk could not identify the accused is not of great
significance.  When the tape is viewed, it is easy to appreciate that the clerk
might not have been able to properly focus upon the identity of the robber. 
The violent and savagely menacing jab made by the robber with a large knife
directed towards the clerk suggests that self‑preservation, not
identification, may very reasonably have been the clerk’s prime concern at the
time of the robbery.  Yet, the tape remained cool, collected, unbiased and
accurate.  It provides as clear a picture of the robbery today as it did when
the traumatic events took place.

 

35         
The evidence of the tape is of such clarity and strength that it was certainly
open to the trial judge to conclude that the accused before her was the person
depicted on the tape.  The trial judge was aware of the difficulties and
frailties of identification evidence and acknowledged them in her reasons. 
Nonetheless, she was entitled on the evidence before her to conclude beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.  There was no need for
corroboration of this tape.

 








36         
There was no suggestion that the tape had been tampered with or that it
did not represent the commission of the crime.  Indeed there was quite properly
no objection to its admission.  The videotape can and should speak for itself. 
It provided the convincing evidence upon which the trial judge could properly
base her finding of fact that the accused was the person shown in the tape. 
The trial judge did not err in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused was guilty of the robbery.  It follows that I can find no basis upon
which the Court of Appeal was justified in concluding that the decision of the
trier of fact was unreasonable or unsafe.

 

37         
I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of
Appeal and restore the conviction of the respondent.

 

The reasons of Sopinka and Major JJ. were delivered by

 

38         
Sopinka J. (dissenting) --
I have read the reasons of Cory J. and while I agree that the observation of
the videotape by the trial judge who compared the videotape of the crime with
the accused was evidence of identification, I agree with the unanimous decision
of the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances of this case, it was
unreasonable for the trial judge to convict based on her opinion alone.  In
order to arrive at this conclusion, it is necessary to review the evidence.

 

I.       Facts

 

39         
On May 13, 1991, at approximately 2:00 a.m., Mr. Mahmood Wahabzada was
working alone at a Mac’s Milk store when an individual entered the store and
told him to open the cash register.  The robber took about $230 and left the
store.  The robber’s face was not covered, but he was wearing something on his
head.  Mr. Wahabzada described the robber to police as hefty with a strong
build, blond hair and a mustache.  He said that his own height was 175
centimetres and that the robber was taller than that.

 








40         
A few days after the robbery, Mr. Wahabzada was shown a series of
photographs by police in an album containing 12 colour photographs.  Two police
officers testified about Mr. Wahabzada’s comments in response to the
photographs.  They attributed varying degrees of certainty to his choice of
photograph number 6, which was conceded to have been a photograph of the
respondent, as a photograph of the man who robbed him.  According to the
officers, Mr. Wahabzada said, “that’s him”, or “He looks just like him”, when
pointing to number 6, but also said, “He looks a bit like him also”, referring
to number 8.  This evidence was at variance with the evidence of Mr. Wahabzada
who stated that he suspected photographs number 6, 8 and 11, but that he could
be no more than 25 or 30 percent sure that any of them was the robber.  He was
more sure that it was number 8 than the other two.  Number 6 was conceded to be
a photograph of the respondent.  The evidence at trial was, in part, as
follows:

 

Q.       I’m showing you an album, as you called it, having twelve
pictures in it.  Is this what you were shown by the officers?

 

A.       Yeah.

 

Q.       All right.  And were you able to recognize
anyone, sir?

 

A.       Yeah.  I suspect this man -- and either this one or this one
-- I think this one.

 

Q.       All right.  Do you remember what you said?

 

A.  Yeah, I say that I suspect only twenty-five percent or thirty
percent, no more than that.

 

Q.       On which one?

 

A.       On these both guys.  Mostly this guy.

 

THE COURT:  Middle row, Photos 6 and 8 -- twenty-five percent mostly this
guy, being Photo 8.

 

MR. COLLINS: Thank you.

 

THE COURT: And I’m doing 8 counting four across the top, and then 5
through 8 as the second line.

 

MR. COLLINS: Does the Crown confirm the judge’s?

 

MR. VESA: Yes.  He’s also pointing at Number 11.

 








THE COURT: And he also in his first comment said this looks like, and
he pointed to Number 11 as well.

 

MR. VESA: Q.  Were you able to come to a more definite conclusion than
that, sir, as to which picture?

 

A.  I can’t.

 

Q.  Do you remember if you did on that day?

 

A.  Mostly on this guy.

 

THE COURT: Mostly 8.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

41         
During his testimony at trial, Mr. Wahabzada was shown a videotape which
he identified as an accurate depiction of the robbery in the store on May 13,
1991.  After having reviewed the videotape, and while the respondent was seated
alone in the prisoner’s box, Mr. Wahabzada was asked in examination-in-chief by
the Crown:

 

Q: Do you see the man here today who robbed you that night, sir?

 

A: No, I don’t think he is.

 

Q: You don’t think he?

 

A: No.  

 

42         
An officer testified that when he arrested the respondent on May 22,
1991, his facial appearance was different from that in court, in that at the
time of the arrest the respondent had a sparse mustache.  The officer also testified
that, upon being arrested, the appellant denied his involvement in the robbery
and offered an alibi, stating that he had been at home with his mother and
brother at the time of the robbery.

 








43         
When the Crown closed its case, there was no evidence on the record of
identification except the trial judge’s subjective conclusion with respect to
her observation of the video which, at that point, was unannounced and
unknown.  In these circumstances, counsel for the respondent elected to call no
evidence.  It was only during argument that the trial judge expressed her
opinion based on her observation of the video and the respondent.  Since her
opinion was the only evidence of identification, these remarks concerning what
she had observed became the reasons for judgment.

 

II.     Analysis

 

1.      Section 686(1)(a)(I) of the Criminal
Code

 

44         
In undertaking a review under s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , the appellate court must carefully consider
all of the evidence that was before the trier of fact.  As stated by a majority
of this Court in R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 915:

 

In an appeal founded on s. 686(1) (a)(i) the
court is engaged in a review of the facts.  The role of the Court of Appeal is
to determine whether on the facts that were before the trier of fact a jury
properly instructed and acting reasonably could convict.  The court reviews the
evidence that was before the trier of fact and after re-examining and, to some
extent, reweighing the evidence, determines whether it meets the test.

 

 








As a result,
it is only where the Court has considered all of the evidence before the
trier of fact and determined that a conviction cannot reasonably be supported
by that evidence that the Court can invoke s. 686(1) (a)(i) and overturn
the trial court’s verdict.

 

45         
This power of review by an appellate court takes on special significance
in a case in which the sole issue is identification.  In R. v. Quercia
(1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 383, Doherty J.A., speaking for
himself and Osborne J.A., stated:

 

This is a case in which the conviction of the appellant depends
entirely on the identification of him by the victim.  Where the Crown’s case
rests on eyewitness identification, one is always very concerned about the
reliability of a finding of guilt.  Legal history and data compiled by
behavioural scientists demonstrate the validity of that concern: see “Pretrial
Eyewitness Identification Procedures”, Law Reform Commission of Canada Study
Paper (1983), at p. 7-15.  The spectre of erroneous convictions based on
honest and convincing, but mistaken, eyewitness identification haunts the
criminal law.  That ghost hovers over this case.

 

Section 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code 
mandates limited appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence on appeals
from convictions.  An appellate court must set aside a conviction if that
verdict “is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”.  The review
countenanced by s. 686(1) (a)(i) is not limited to a determination
of whether there was any evidence to support the conviction....

 

 

46         
In my view, a review of the evidence in this
case makes it clear that the verdict rendered at trial was
""unreasonable"" within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Code. 
Indeed, it would appear that the respondent was convicted on the basis of very
weak identification evidence, which was undermined by the evidence of the
Crown's only eyewitness.  In assessing the ""reasonableness"" of the
evidentiary foundation upon which the conviction was entered, it is necessary
to consider two fundamental questions.  First, are the sensory observations of
a trial judge, based on a review of a videotape and the appearance of the
accused, admissible evidence of ""identity"" to support a guilty
verdict?  If this first question is answered in the affirmative, the Court must
go on to consider whether or not the evidence of identity in this
particular case was sufficient to justify the respondent's conviction.  








 

2.      Videotape Identification

 

47        
The appellant relies
heavily on this Court's decision in R. v. Leaney, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393. 
The appellant submits that Leaney clearly establishes that the sensory
observations of a trial judge, based on a review of a videotape and
observations of the accused, are admissible to prove the identity of the
accused as the person who was displayed on the video screen.  While I agree
that the principles in Leaney support the appellant's position on the
first question, they fail to support the ""reasonableness"" of the
verdict rendered at trial on the facts of this case.

 

48        
In Leaney, the
accused (Leaney) was videotaped with his co-accused (Rawlinson) breaking into
the Owl Drug Mart in Edmonton, Alberta.  At trial, the following evidence was
admitted to establish Leaney's ""identity"" as the man on the
videotape:

 

(a)  Five police officers
who had viewed the videotape affirmed that the accused were the men depicted on
the tape;

 

(b)  Leaney's fingerprints
and palm prints were found on ""Owl Drug Mart boxes"" that had been
found in Rawlinson's apartment after the robbery;

 

(c)  Leaney had been seen
in Rawlinson's apartment the day before the robbery;

 

(d)  Leaney and Rawlinson
matched a ""general description"" of the culprits given by an
eyewitness; and

 








(e)  Rawlinson admitted his
participation in the crime, although this admission was not evidence against
Leaney.

 

 

The trial judge considered this evidence,
and compared Leaney's appearance with that of the man on the videotape.  In
light of all of the evidence, Leaney was convicted.

 

49        
On appeal, the Court
of Appeal determined that the evidence of four of the five police officers was
inadmissible as non-expert opinion concerning identity.  The fifth officer
(Sergeant Cessford), however, was familiar with Leaney and was able to note
specific physical characteristics and idiosyncrasies of the accused that were
also exhibited by the man on the videotape. The majority of the Court of Appeal
held that even if the trial judge erred in admitting Cessford’s evidence
without first holding a voir dire, such an error made no difference to
the outcome of the trial.  The majority therefore dismissed the appeal.

 

50        
A majority of this
Court agreed with the Court of Appeal that the identification evidence given by
the four policemen (other than Cessford) was inadmissible.  With respect to
Sergeant Cessford, the Court was of the view that his evidence was admissible notwithstanding
the trial court's failure to hold a preliminary voir dire.  The Court
was of the view that the evidence of the police was unnecessary, however, given
the judge's opportunity to view the video and the accused.  According to the
majority, at p. 414:  

 








The
trial judge viewed the videotape several times and had ample opportunity during
the course of the sixteen-day trial to form an opinion as to whether the
persons shown on the tape were the accused.  The tape contained several face shots
of each accused.  At the end of the trial, the trial judge stated that he had
formed the firm conclusion that the persons shown on the videotape were the
accused.  His pronouncements make it clear that this opinion was formed
independently of the evidence of any of the police officers on the question.

 

The Court went on to state, at p. 415,
that:

 

Given
the trial judge's clear statement that he arrived at his conclusion as to
identity independently of the evidence of the police officers, their evidence
assumes the character of mere surplusage, which does not vitiate the judge's
conclusion that Leaney was one of the persons shown on the video screen.

 

51         
The Court concluded that since the observations of the trial judge were
not tainted by the inadmissible identification evidence of the police officers,
these observations together with the other admissible evidence justified the
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) (formerly s. 613(1)(b)(iii)). 
At page 416, McLachlin J., for the majority, states:

 

The test set out in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739 is
met: there is no possibility that a reasonable jury, properly instructed and
acting judicially, could fail to convict on the admissible evidence
presented on the break-in incident. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

52         
Accordingly, Leaney does not support the proposition that
reliance by a trial judge on his or her own observations unaided by other
evidence is reasonable.

 








53         
Leaney does support the proposition that the judge’s observations
are evidence, and were in that case cogent evidence, that might have survived
an attack under s. 686(1) (a)(I).  It is useful to contrast the quality
of the video identification evidence in Leaney with the evidence in this
case.

 

54        
In Leaney, the
trial judge had reviewed the tape repeatedly and spent 16 days at trial
observing Mr. Leaney's appearance.  In rendering his decision, the trial judge
in Leaney made the following observations in support of his conclusion
that the accused was the man on the videotape:

 

The two
persons responsible for the commission of the offence came into the range of
the camera.  Again, the lighting was good, focus was good but I could see no
distortion of the picture whatsoever.... 

 

The
taller of the two, second person; on the video, he appears dark, long hair,
Metis or Native appearance, very tall, much taller than Rawlinson and there's a
perfect example when they are standing back to back when the hips of the taller
man are almost to the height of the shoulders of Rawlinson, much taller man. 
Wearing a peaked cap of a baseball type which subsequently shows in the video a
tree on the right-hand side of the indicator on the front of the cap which is
similar to a cap seized by the police and was an exhibit.  He's wearing a
down-filled type ski jacket, jeans with jacket, appearing above the waist, a
comb, round shaped tail, in the right rear pocket.  These are not as good__there
is not as good a view of this face of this person, but again having had the
opportunity to view the video and the accused, Frank Leaney in the court over
16 days, I have no difficulty in saying without hesitation that they are one
and the same; the man in the video is Frank Leaney.

 

 

The thoroughness of the comparison made
between the accused and the tape in Leaney was stressed in this Court's
comments on the quality of the evidence.  As McLachlin J. stated at p. 414:

 

The
trial judge viewed the videotape several times and had ample opportunity during
the course of the sixteen-day trial to form an opinion as to whether the
persons shown on the tape were the accused.  The tape contained several face
shots of each accused.

 

 








55        
Clearly, the detailed
observations made in Leaney stand in contrast to the remarks made by the
judge in the instant case.  After a trial that was completed in one day, and
after having viewed the 30-second video only once, the trial judge made the
following ""observations"":

 

I looked
at that video, and I looked at it very carefully, and I can honestly tell you
there is no doubt in my mind that the man who committed that robbery on that
video was your client.

 

                                                                    ...

 

How can
I disregard that?  I don't need glasses. 

 

                                                                    ...

 

This
particular video tape is very clear.  The lighting is very good.  The man is in
the camera for long enough to make a careful observation.  And the issue of
beyond a reasonable doubt is when I'm obliged to make a decision, and I cannot
ignore what my eyes tell me, and my eyes tell me, and there's no dispute this
isn't a video tape of the robbery, that the person who committed that robbery
is Mr. Nikolovski, and I can't ignore that and I can't say well -- I don't see
how I can ignore that properly.

 

 








Unlike the trial judge's decision in Leaney,
the trial judge in this case made no reference to specific characteristics of
the man on the videotape that conformed to the appearance of the accused. 
Generally, testimony by a person not acquainted with the accused that the
accused is the culprit without any description of identifying features of
appearance such as colouring of the skin or hair, complexion, facial features,
height, weight, age and clothing is little more than an expression of opinion
and is generally accorded little weight.  See R. v. Spatola, [1970] 4
C.C.C. 241 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 249.  Moreover, the trial judge in this case
lacked the assurance of confirmatory evidence (such as the cap and fingerprints
in Leaney) that would have supported her observations of the video and
the accused.  

 

56         
Not only did the trial judge’s observations not have any support
in the evidence but, more importantly, the judge’s observations were actually
contradicted by the evidence of the only person who actually witnessed the
crime.  Mr. Wahabzada, the victim
of the robbery, had viewed his assailant ""in the flesh"" and
effectively testified that Mr. Nikolovski was not the villain.  Like the trial
judge, Mr. Wahabzada viewed the 30-second tape of the crime in question, and
was present in the courtroom and able to make careful observation of the
accused.  Despite this opportunity to view the accused and the tape, Mr.
Wahabzada was unable to conclude that the accused was the man on the video. 
Indeed, Mr. Wahabzada went so far as to say that the villain was not present in
the courtroom, while the accused was seated alone in the prisoner's box.

 








57         
In addition to the other frailties to which I have referred, it is
significant that the judge’s observations are entirely untested by
cross-examination.  Cross-examination in identification is of special
importance.  Here, not only was there no opportunity to cross-examine, but the
substance of the judge’s observations was unknown until the case for both the Crown
and defence was closed.  Not only are the judge’s subjective observations not
tested by cross-examination but they cannot be tested on appeal.  In order to
evaluate the reasonableness of the evidence upon which a trier of fact relies,
the Court of Appeal must be able to examine all the evidence.  All we can do is
see one side of a coin that has two sides.  All the assurances about the
clarity of the video are of no avail if we cannot see the person with whom the
comparison is being made.

 

58         
In summary, this conviction was based on evidence that amounted to no
more than the untested opinion of the trial judge which was contradicted by
other evidence that the trial judge did not reject.  This included evidence
that the victim, a few days after the robbery, identified a person other than
the accused as the more likely perpetrator of the crime.  The trial judge
simply relied on her own observations, the accuracy of which we are not in a
position to assess.  Having regard for the inherent frailties in identification
evidence, I conclude that the conviction rests on a shaky foundation and is
unsafe and unsatisfactory.  I am satisfied that the verdict is unreasonable and
cannot be supported by the evidence.

 

59         
I would dismiss the appeal.

                   The appellant was employed as
a district engineer by the provincial transportation department.  During 1984
the general manager of a company engaged in the construction of roads for the
province and various municipalities placed the appellant’s wife on the
company’s payroll as a standby flag person.  She was never asked to do any work
yet she received payments from the company in the amount of some $7,400.  The
company also provided her with a record of employment confirming that she had
been employed for 20 weeks, thereby qualifying for unemployment insurance
benefits.  The appellant was in charge of overseeing the construction of roads
for the province and municipal authorities within the province.  He dealt
frequently with the company’s general manager, and had the authority to direct,
suspend and generally supervise the work done by the company.  The appellant
was aware that his wife received cheques for 20 weeks from the company and yet
had not been called upon to work during that period.  He was aware that standby
flag persons did not usually get paid when they were not working; that the
company was laying off people doing flag work in the period in which she was
hired; and that despite this practice his wife had remained on the payroll
without working.  He was aware that the cheques payable to his wife were put in
a special envelope and delivered to himself or his wife.  He knew that he had
not sought or obtained the consent of his employer to the receipt of any
benefit.  The appellant and his wife were charged with two counts of fraud and
the appellant with a breach of s. 121(1) (c) of the Criminal Code ,
which makes it an offence for an official or employee of the government to
accept from a person who has dealings with the government a benefit of any kind
directly or indirectly, by himself or through a member of his family, unless he
has the consent in writing of the head of the branch of government that employs
him.  They were convicted on all three charges following a trial by jury.  The
Court of Appeal unanimously allowed their appeal against the two fraud
convictions, and a new trial was directed on those counts, but it dismissed the
appellant’s appeal against his conviction for breach of s. 121(1) (c).

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and
McLachlin JJ.:  The crucial purpose encompassed by s. 121(1) (c) is
not merely to preserve the integrity of government, but to preserve the
appearance of integrity as well.  Given the heavy trust and responsibility
taken on by the holding of a public office or employ, it is appropriate that
government officials are correspondingly held to codes of conduct which, for an
ordinary person, would be quite severe.  Damage to the government’s integrity
can occur where benefits are received by government employees even where no ill
motive existed.  It is inefficient for a government to be paralyzed by rumour
and innuendo while an inquiry is made into the motivation behind a certain
benefit or advantage conferred on an official.  The section criminalizes
behaviour whereby a government official or employee, under certain
circumstances, accepts a benefit from a person who has dealings with the
government.  The offence created is a “conduct” crime, meaning that it does not
require a particular result to flow from the commission of the prohibited act.

 

                   Parliament worded s. 121(1) (c)
broadly and did not intend to restrict its application solely to situations
where the gift was motivated by the recipient’s position in government.  The
section’s potentially wide application can be limited through statutory
interpretation without introducing an additional element.  The first component
of the section is that a commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind
be given by a person having “dealings with the government”.  The proper
interpretation of the term “dealings” is the narrow one, whereby only where
persons are in the process of having commercial dealings with the government at
the time of the offence is the conduct trapped under the section.

 

                   The second element of the actus
reus is the receipt of that “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any
kind” by a government employee.  The phrase “of any kind” was not meant to
widen the scope of the provision’s reach.  It was not worded or intended to
mean “of whatever amount” or “of any value”, but rather was intended to trap
diverse forms of  benefits other than those of a strictly monetary nature. 
Many of the absurd consequences of adopting an unlimited wide meaning of the
term “advantage or benefit” can be avoided by a stricter reading of the term,
and a recognition that it requires the beneficiary to have secured a material
or tangible gain before falling into the confines of the section.  It is
important to consider the relationship between the parties as well as the scope
of the benefit.  The closer the relationship, the less likely the gift should
be perceived as an advantage or benefit to the recipient.  Whether a gift can
be seen as a true “benefit” to someone is a question of fact for the jury to
determine based on all the evidence in the case.

 

                   With respect to mens rea,
since this offence constitutes a “conduct” crime, it requires that to be
culpable the accused know of the conduct he or she committed, and have
knowledge of the circumstances in which it occurred.  In order to prove the
offence in s. 121(1) (c), it is thus necessary for the Crown to
prove the following fault elements:  (a) an employee's conscious decision to
accept what in all of the circumstances is found to be a ""commission,
reward, advantage or benefit of any kind""; and (b) knowledge (or wilful
blindness) at the time of the receipt that the giver was having dealings with
the government and that the employee's superior had not consented to his or her
receipt of the ""commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any
kind"".  Since this level of mens rea is  recognized as a valid form
of criminal culpability, there is no need to add any additional components. 
The motivation behind a particular benefit is not a completely irrelevant
consideration, however, as it is an important factor in determining the
appropriate level of culpability.  Clearly, where a government employee
actually possessed a corrupt intention in accepting a benefit he or she will
usually merit a higher sentence than a person lacking such a motive.

 

                   A new trial should be ordered
in this case.  As found by Cory J., the trial judge’s persistent interference,
along with the errors committed during the charge to the jury, do not permit
the conclusion that the appellant received a fair trial.

 

                   Per Sopinka, Cory and Iacobucci JJ.:  The important
aim of s. 121(1) (c), which is to ensure the integrity of government
employees, should be taken into consideration in the interpretation and
application of the section.  The requisite acts necessary to constitute the
offence are the giving of a “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any
kind” by a person having “dealings with the government”, the receipt of the
“commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a government
employee, and the absence of the consent of the government employee’s superior
to the receipt of the benefit.  The commission, reward, advantage or benefit of
any kind must consist of something of value which constituted a profit to the
employee and was derived at least in part from the employee’s relation to or
position with the government.  The mental element of blameworthiness for
s. 121(1) (c) should be assessed subjectively and requires proof not
only that the accused was aware or knew of the requisite elements of the
offence but also that he knew that he received the benefit at least in part
because of his position with the government; or that he was wilfully blind to
circumstances which would lead to that conclusion; or was reckless as to the
consequences of accepting the benefit without the consent and permission of his
superior, that is to say he was aware of the risk of his actions breaching the
provision but nonetheless took the risk of proceeding in that manner.

 

                   The evidence presented in this
case indicates that the actus reus of the offence was established and
there was strong and cogent evidence upon which a jury properly instructed
could find that the accused had the requisite intent or was wilfully blind to
the situation or was reckless as to the consequences of his actions. 
Unfortunately the trial judge did not give the proper instructions as to the
requisite intent.  He also erred in his directions to the jury on a number of
other matters.  The issue of credibility was vital to the resolution of the
case.  The trial judge ought to have given instructions as to the character
evidence presented and the use that could be made of it.  His failure to do so
adversely affected the fairness of the trial.  In addition, there was untoward
interference with both counsel’s conduct of their respective cases by the judge
throughout the trial.  The errors made by the trial judge and the whole conduct
of the trial have a cumulative effect that makes it readily apparent that no
other disposition than that of a new trial would achieve a fair result.  The
curative provisions of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) are accordingly not
applicable.

\\L’Heureux-Dubé J.\\

 

                   The judgment of La Forest,
L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

1                 L’Heureux-Dubé J. -- I have had the advantage
of reading the reasons of Justice Cory and I agree with his view that this
appeal should be allowed.  As he has expressed, the persistent interference of
the trial judge, along with the errors committed during the charge to the jury,
do not permit the conclusion that the appellant received a fair trial.  Where I
part company from my colleague, however, is with regard to the proper
interpretation of s. 121(1) (c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 .  In my view, the conclusion he comes to results in a virtual
rewriting of the provision and one contrary to the object and spirit of the
law.

 

2                        This
appeal is brought on the basis that the trial judge, and subsequently the Court
of Appeal, improperly defined the mens rea for this offence.  In his
address to the jury, the trial judge stated that a conviction should be entered
if, inter alia, the Crown had proved that the appellant possessed an
“intention to cause the external circumstances of the offence”.  According to
the appellant, this instruction is problematic in that it, in effect, creates a
strict liability offence whereby persons lacking a “criminal intention” can fall
within the literal wording of the section.

 

3                 I have
great difficulty with this particular submission.  Quite simply, this offence
cannot be one of strict liability as it requires a bona fide mental
element.  At a minimum, the charge given to the jury required they find that
the appellant possessed an intention to commit a prohibited act, while having
subjective knowledge of the circumstances.   As Doherty J.A. recognized when
dealing with this very offence in R. v. Greenwood (1991), 8 C.R. (4th)
235 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 255-56:

 

                   A conscious choice to perform a prohibited act,
combined with knowledge that all or at least some of the relevant circumstances
exist, is a well-recognized form of criminal culpability: see R. v. Sault Ste.
Marie (City), supra, at p. 1324 (S.C.R.), pp. 373‑374 (C.C.C.), (pp.
52-54 C.R.); A. W. Mewett and M. Manning, Criminal Law -- 2d. ed.
(Toronto: Butterworths, 1985), pp. 116‑120; Law Reform Commission of
Canada, Criminal Law -- The General Part (Working Paper 29) (1982), pp.
24‑26.  Knowledge combined with a volitional act may be seen as a minimum
level of culpability. However, for many crimes which do not require proof that
any consequence flowed or was intended to flow from the doing of the prohibited
act in the relevant circumstances, a volitional act combined with knowledge of
the relevant circumstances generally constitutes the only culpability
requirement. Indeed, in its recent work, Recodifying the Criminal Law
(Working Paper No. 31) (1987), at pp. 21‑23, the Law Reform Commission of
Canada, in its proposed General Part for a new Criminal Code ,
recommends, where the definition of a crime does not require proof of a
particular consequence, that the culpability or fault requirement consist of a
volitional act done with knowledge of, or recklessness as to, the existence of
the circumstances set out in the statutory definition. The Crown's submission
is firmly rooted in contemporary notions of criminal culpability.

 

 

4                 I agree. 
Clearly, what the appellant takes issue with is not that s. 121(1) (c)
lacks a fault requirement, but that the offence, as it was set out by the trial
judge, has the potential to trap conduct which should not be considered
criminal, and thus punish offenders undeserving of sanction.  This is the
thrust of the reasons of my colleague, and it is this issue which I propose to
address.

 

5                 The
provision of the Code at issue here reads as follows:

 

121. (1)  Every one
commits an offence who

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(c)  being an official or employee of the government, demands,
accepts or offers or agrees to  accept from a person who has dealings with the
government a commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind directly or
indirectly, by himself or through a member of his family or through any one for
his benefit, unless he has the consent in writing of the head of the branch of
government that employs him or of which he is an official, the proof of which
lies on him.

 

 

6                 After an
examination of the provision, Cory J. concludes (at para. 116)  that this
offence encompasses the following elements.  To constitute the actus reus,
the conduct must include:

 

(a) the giving of a “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any
kind” by a person having “dealings with the government”;

 

(b) the receipt of the “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any
kind” by a government employee; 

 

(c) the absence of the consent of the government employee’s superior to
the  receipt of the benefit; and

 

(d) that the “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind
must  consist of something of value which constituted a profit to the employee
derived at least in part from the employee’s relation to or position with the
government.”

 

 

 

7                 As to the
mental element, the accused must have knowledge of the elements set out in (a),
(b) and (c) and also must know that he was receiving the benefit at least in
part because of his position in government.

 

8                 I have no
difficulty with the elements (a), (b) and (c) as detailed by Cory J.  In my
view, however, the effect of component (d) is to add an additional physical and
mental element to the provision.  I would note that this element is not a
feature of Parliament’s drafting, but was  read into the section by my
colleague.  He has added these requirements in order to limit what is, in his
view, an otherwise overly broad section.

 

9                 This
conclusion is, in my view, quite unnecessary.  The section, properly read,
captures no more conduct than is strictly necessary to achieve its purpose. 
Accordingly, I come to a considerably different result with regard to the
essential elements of this provision. 

 

Interpretation of s.
121(1) (c)

 

10               My
colleague, Cory J. begins his analysis of the section with the following
proposition (at para. 95):

 

Before considering the acts which form an integral part of the crime
and the element of blameworthiness, it is necessary to consider the possible
scope or breadth of application of the section.  

 

11               Essentially,
his approach to this case follows this very guideline.  Rather than attempting
to interpret the applicable section by analyzing its intent and the objective
of Parliament in enacting it, my colleague begins from the position that we
must tailor the breadth first.  In my view, this is a backward manner of
interpretation.   I suggest that it is improper that the breadth of a section’s
potential application should be our guiding principle.

 

12               In
interpreting any section of the Criminal Code , or indeed, of any
statute, it is always crucial to begin by considering the section itself and
the rationale which is underlying it.  This is in accordance with the
contextual approach I have discussed recently in Manulife Bank of Canada v.
Conlin, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 415,  Verdun v. Toronto-Dominion Bank,
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 550, and 2747-3174 Québec Inc. v. Québec (Régie des permis
d’alcool), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919.  It follows that a proper
understanding of the provision must begin with an examination of all relevant
and admissible indicators of legislative meaning in an attempt to discern the
section’s purpose.  Therefore, I propose to begin with this
analysis.

 

Purpose of s. 121(1) (c)

 

13               There is
little doubt that s. 121 was enacted for the important goal of preserving the
integrity of government.  This section of the Criminal Code  is one of
the myriad ways in which the government seeks to achieve this purpose.  For
example, a glance at the surrounding Criminal Code  ss. 119  to 125 
reveals different methods by which the law attempts to deter conduct by persons
dealing with or employed by government.  Obviously, the criminal law is not the
only method utilized; a variety of other statutes contain provisions which deal
with corrupt or fraudulent practices, while there are also conflict of interest
and ethical guidelines to regulate behaviour.  See for example Financial
Administration Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-11 ,  ss. 80  and 81 ; Conflict of
Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders (1994).

 

14               It is
hardly necessary for me to expand on the importance of having a government
which demonstrates integrity.   Suffice it to say that our democratic system
would have great difficulty functioning efficiently if its integrity was
constantly in question.  While this has not traditionally been a major problem
in Canada, we are not immune to seeing officials fall from grace as the result
of a violation of the important trust we place in their integrity.  See, for example,
R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 860.   I would merely add that the
importance of preserving integrity in the government has arguably increased
given the need to maintain the public’s confidence in government in an age
where it continues to play an ever increasing role in the quality of everyday
people’s lives.  As the U.S. Congress has stated about its own anti-corruption
measures:

 

                   The necessity for maintaining high ethical standards
of behaviour in the Government becomes greater as its activities become more
complex and bring it into closer and closer contact with the private sector of
the Nation’s economy.

 

As quoted in United States v. Evans, 572 F.2d 455 (5th Cir.
1978),  at p. 480.

 

15               It is quite
accepted that criminal law has a role to play in this area. Protecting the
integrity of government is crucial to the proper functioning of a democratic
system.  Criminal law has a historic and well-established role in helping to
preserve that integrity. 

 

16               Section
121(1)(c) has a special role to play in this regard.  This Court has
decided on several occasions that the crucial purpose encompassed by this
section is not merely to preserve the integrity of government, but to
preserve the appearance of the integrity as well. In Greenwood,
supra, at pp. 250-51, Doherty J.A. made several remarks in this respect
regarding the purpose of s. 121(1) (c):

 

Canadian courts have repeatedly recognized that s. 121(1) (c)
exists to preserve both the integrity of the public service and the appearance
of integrity of the public service. The government's business must be free from
any suggestion of ""under‑the‑table"" rewards or benefits
made to those who conduct business on behalf of the government by those who
stand to gain from those dealings: see, e.g., R. v. Cooper, supra, at p.
875 (S.C.R.), p. 29 (C.C.C.); Giguere, supra, at p. 462 (S.C.R.), p. 12
(C.C.C.) (pp. 12-13 C.R.); R. v. Cooper (No. 2) (1977), 4 C.R. (3d)
S-10, 35 C.C.C. (2d) 35 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 36 (C.C.C.) (p. S-11 C.R.); R. v.
Sinasac (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 81 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 84.

 

                   That integrity is compromised not only by bribery
and corruption in their crassest forms, but by other insidious arrangements
whereby a government employee profits from his or her position or employment by
way of a private benefit or advantage received from a person having dealings
with the government. Such advantages or benefits can create the appearance of
impropriety and suggest that the loyalty of the employee has been divided
between his or her government employer and the private benefactor. I adopt the
comments of Judge Lyon of the Ontario District Court, who on imposing sentence
on one Gerald McKendry (the government employee who received the benefits
referred to in R. v. Cooper, supra) said, in a passage quoted with
approval in R. v. Ruddock (1978), 25 N.S.R. (2d) 77, 36 A.P.R. 77, 39
C.C.C. (2d) 65 (C.A.), at p. 71 (C.C.C.): 

 

  “It is obvious in my view that altogether apart from s. 110(1)(c)
(now s. 121(1) (c)) that the appearance of objective, uncorrupted
impartiality must be of the highest importance. This indeed is an ethic which
has been given the full support of the criminal law in the section that I have
made reference to, and the reason for that, I think, is obvious because the
appearance of justice is equally important as justice itself.    And the
appearance of honesty and integrity in dealings by Government employees
particularly where large sums of public money is (sic) involved must be
at all costs preserved lest the  failure to do so could result in de facto
corruption, one  perhaps sliding imperceptibly into the other. It is clearly
for this reason that s. 110(c) has been enacted.”

 

 

                   The need to preserve the appearance of integrity
within the public service requires that the words ""advantage or
benefit"" include all gifts which can potentially compromise that
appearance of integrity.

 

 

17               I
substantially agree with this statement.  In particular, I believe Lyon J.A.
was correct when he indicated that preserving the appearance of integrity, and
the fact that the government is fairly dispensing justice, are, in this
context, as important as the fact that the government possesses actual
integrity and dispenses actual justice.  The two concepts are, however,
analytically distinct.  For a government, actual integrity is achieved when its
employees remain free of any type of corruption.  On the other hand, it is not
necessary for a corrupt practice to take place in order for the appearance
of integrity to be harmed.  Protecting these appearances is more than a
trivial concern.  This section recognizes that the democratic process can be
harmed just as easily by the appearance of impropriety as with actual
impropriety itself.

 

18               In my view,
given the heavy trust and responsibility taken on by the holding of a public
office or employ, it is appropriate that government officials are
correspondingly held to codes of conduct which, for an ordinary person, would
be quite severe.   For the public, who is the ultimate beneficiary of honest
government, it is not so easy to sort out which benefits are legitimate and
which are laden with a sinister motivation.  Moreover, it is inefficient for a
government to be paralyzed by rumour and innuendo while an inquiry is made into
the motivation behind a certain benefit or advantage conferred on an official. 
What Parliament is saying through this provision is that the damage sought to
be prevented is actually done once the benefit is conferred,
and not after an ex post facto analysis which demonstrates that no harm
was intended.  It is from the point of the conferral of the benefit forward that
the appearance of integrity has been slighted.

 

19               It follows,
therefore, that I do not share the view of Cory J., at para. 94, where he sets
out the purpose of the section as follows:

 

If government contracts can be bought by benefits paid to government
employees the entire civil service becomes suspect and is dishonoured.  The
fundamental importance of the subsection must be apparent to all.  Its aim
is to ensure the integrity of government employees.  This vitally
important aim and purpose should be taken into consideration in the
interpretation and application of the section. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

Upon finding this purpose,
my colleague goes on to find that  there must be actual misconduct for there to
be damage done to the government’s integrity.  I do not share this view. 
Rather, Parliament has explicitly stated that such damage can also occur where
benefits are received by government employees even where no ill motive
existed.   It is for this reason that the net in s. 121(1) (c) was cast
so wide.  

 

20               I find
support for this conclusion through a comparison of the surrounding provisions
in s. 121.  If  preventing the actual corruption of government employees were
the purpose of s. 121(1) (c), there would be little need for s. 121(1) (a),
as the two provisions would be virtually identical.  This section reads as
follows:

 

                   121. 
(1) Every one commits an offence who

 

                   (a) directly or indirectly

 

(i) gives, offers or agrees to give or offer to an official or to any
member of his family, or to any one for the benefit of an official, or

 

(ii) being an official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept
from any person for himself or another person,

 

a loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for
cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in
connection with 

 

(iii) the transaction of business with or any matter of business
relating to the government, or

 

(iv) a claim against Her Majesty or any benefit that Her Majesty is
authorized or is entitled to bestow, 

 

whether or not, in fact, the official is able to cooperate, render
assistance, exercise influence or do or omit to do what is proposed, as the case
may be;

 

21               This
section clearly tries to preserve the actual integrity of government
employees by deterring them from taking benefits in return for giving or
promising  some sort of reward to the benefactor.  It is noteworthy that no
actual return need be made to be trapped under the section.  It is sufficient
for culpability  if the gift was given for an ulterior purpose, in that it was
designed to compromise the integrity of the employee.  The purpose behind the
section recognizes that the integrity of government employees can be
compromised when they accept rewards because of their position in government. 
This is in stark contrast, however, to s. 121(1) (c) which does not
explicitly require the reward to come as a result of the employee’s position. 
It does not have to.  This is not the evil the section is designed to prevent. 

 

22               Furthermore,
the very nature of the offence that Parliament has enacted supports this
notion.   In Greenwood, supra, at p. 247, Doherty J.A.
characterized this offence as a “conduct” crime, meaning that it does not
require a particular result to flow from the commission of the prohibited act. 
I agree with this assessment, and, furthermore, find it quite useful in
illustrating the difference between my position and that of Cory J.   In his
text Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1993), at pp. 30-31,  Professor Gillies draws
a distinction between “conduct” crimes  and “result” crimes:

 

The so-called “conduct” crime is one in which the behaviour which is
personal to D is itself the mischief the crime is aimed at discouraging, viz.,
the actus reus does not extend to proof of substantive harm caused by this
personal activity.  The “result” crime is one the actus reus of which consists
of conduct personal to D, and the causation of substantive harm by this
conduct.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   The conduct crime is aimed at deterring behaviour
which has the potential to inflict substantive harm.  The result crime
penalises the actual infliction of this harm, and in so doing deters its
infliction.

 

 

The actual wording of s.
121(1) (c) clearly requires no consequence, as it is designed to deter
behaviour which has the potential to inflict serious harm.  In my view,
the interpretation suggested by Cory J. has transformed this offence into a
“result” crime.  According to his view, before a conviction can be entered, the
Crown must prove that the benefit was the result of some corrupt purpose.  I
cannot agree with this conclusion. In my view, it is clear that no “result” is
required by the provision.

 

23               In summary,
the purpose of s. 121(1) (c) is to protect and preserve the appearance of
the government’s integrity.  The section accomplishes this task by
criminalizing behaviour whereby a government official or employee, under
certain circumstances, accepts a benefit by a person who has dealings with the
government.  

 

24               My
colleague, however, appears to have rejected this as a valid criminal law
purpose.  In his reasons, he expresses concern about situations where benefits
might be  accepted absent a corrupt intention.   It would seem that at the
heart of this analysis is the assumption that Parliament did not intend to
criminalize this action, as “no reasonable member of the community would regard
[it] as blameworthy” (para. 97).  In “tailoring” the provision to avoid
capturing violators who lack a corrupt intention, Cory J. is essentially
finding that the criminal law should not be involved in these types of
situations. 

 

25               It is
necessary, therefore, to do an examination into the proper limitations of the
criminal law.  Before coming to the conclusion that certain conduct should or
should not be considered “criminal”, I believe that we must examine whether
Parliament has the authority to attach sanctions to such conduct.  For the
purposes of this appeal, it is not necessary for me to exhaustively define the
exact limits of the criminal law; however, a look at some of the underlying
principles in this area would be helpful in resolving the difficult issues
raised here. 

 

26               The
question of the proper scope of the criminal law has been oft considered by
both academics and jurists.  Mewett & Manning on Criminal Law (3rd
ed. 1994),  at pp. 16-17,  have set out the issue in the following way:

 

How does one determine what acts ought to be subject to criminal
sanctions?  Some acts, such as a breach of contract or negligent behaviour, may
cause untold damage and yet not be criminally punishable while others, such as
the theft of a piece of garbage or a minor assault, may cause little or no
damage and yet be subject to criminal sanctions.  In fact, the harm caused,
while one element to be considered, is only one element.  Indeed, in some
crimes such as conspiracy or attempt, no harm at all may actually materialize.
. . . 

 

                   Criminal law is premised on the belief that there
are some acts that ought to be prevented and on the belief that a criminal
process is the best way to achieve this . . .

 

. . . the essence of criminal law is its public nature.  A crime is, in
fact, not a wrong against the actual person harmed, if there is one -- the
victim as he may be called (although it may also and coincidentally be a civil
wrong against him) -- but a wrong against the community as a whole.  The
prevention -- or lessening, since total prevention is not possible -- of crime
cannot be left to an individual’s choice but is the responsibility of any
member of the community and, in particular, those who represent the state --
the police or the prosecuting authorities.

 

 

 

27               Given this
public nature, it is fitting that Parliament has consistently played the major
role in defining exactly what type of conduct can be considered criminal in
nature.  This power is outlined in the Constitution Act, 1867 , where the
federal government is given the exclusive power to set out and regulate the
criminal law.   It is not just the provinces who are prevented from
establishing criminal offences;  the judiciary is also prevented from
re-enacting or creating sanctions pursuant to the common law as a result of s.
9  of the Criminal Code .  

 

28               Since 1982,
however, the major limitation upon parliamentary supremacy with respect to the 
criminal law has been  the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . All
legislative provisions of Parliament are now subject to review under the Charter ,
and where a statute conflicts with the fundamental values expressed therein,
the provision cannot stand if it was not enacted for a pressing objective and
tailored to suit this need.  In fact, as was exemplified in R. v. Zundel, [1992] 2
S.C.R. 731, where this Court struck down the criminal prohibition against
publishing false news, it will occasionally come to pass that an entire section
of the Code will be invalidated because it simply cannot be rationalized
with the Charter .  Nevertheless,
where, as is the case here, the values of the Charter  do not come into
play, Parliament generally must be left to its role of asserting the public
good through the criminal law.  

 

29               Cory J.
recently addressed the proper scope of the criminal law in Knox Contracting
Ltd. v. Canada, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 338, at p. 348, and stated:

 

                   A very helpful definition of criminal law can be
found in the Reference re Validity of Section 5(a) of the
Dairy Industry Act (Margarine Reference), [1949] S.C.R. 1.  In that case Rand J. stated
at p. 49:

 

A crime is an act which the law, with appropriate penal sanctions,
forbids; but as prohibitions are not enacted in a vacuum, we can properly look
for some evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public against which
the law is directed.  That effect may be in relation to social, economic or
political interests; and the legislature has had in mind to suppress the evil
or to safeguard the interest threatened.

 

                   Dickson J., as he then was, in dissenting reasons in
R. v. Hauser,
[1979] 1 S.C.R. 984, defined the subject in this way at p. 1026:

 

                   Head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act
empowers Parliament to make substantive laws prohibiting, with penal
consequences, acts or omissions considered to be harmful to the State, or to
persons or property within the State. 

 

 

 

30               I agree
with this description.  Parliament, therefore, retains the power to designate
the specific acts which it considers harmful to the State.  The criminal law is
not “frozen as of some particular time”:  R. v. Zelensky, [1978] 2
S.C.R. 940, at p. 951.  This principle was expressed in greater detail in RJR-MacDonald
Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, where the
appellants argued that legislation controlling the advertisement of tobacco
products, the Tobacco Products Control Act, was not validly enacted by
the federal government as it did not have “an affinity with a traditional
criminal law concern” (p. 259).  La Forest J., for a majority of the Court on
this issue, dismissed this ground of appeal for the following reasons (at pp.
259-61):

 

It has long been recognized that Parliament's power to legislate with
respect to the criminal law must, of necessity, include the power to create new
crimes.  This was made clear as early as 1931, when the Privy Council upheld
the validity of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, in PATA,
supra.  That legislation criminalized a wide array of commercial
activities not hitherto perceived to have an affinity with criminal law
concerns.  However, Lord Atkin explained that this fact alone was not
sufficient to preclude the application of the criminal law power.  He stated,
at pp. 323-24:

 

                   In their Lordships' opinion s. 498  of the Criminal
Code  and the greater part of the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act
fall within the power of the Dominion Parliament to legislate as to matters
falling within the class of subjects, ""the criminal law including the
procedure in criminal matters"" (s. 91 , head 27).  The substance of the Act
is by s. 2  to define, and by s. 32  to make criminal, combines which the
legislature in the public interest intends to prohibit.  The definition is
wide, and may cover activities which have not hitherto been considered to be
criminal.  But only those combines are affected ""which have operated
or are likely to operate to the detriment or against the interest of the
public, whether consumers, producers, or others""; and if Parliament
genuinely determines that commercial activities which can be so described are
to be suppressed in the public interest, their Lordships see no reason why
Parliament should not make them crimes.  ""Criminal law"" means
""the criminal law in its widest sense"":  Attorney-General for
Ontario v. Hamilton Street Ry. Co., [1903] A.C. 524.  It certainly
is not confined to what was criminal by the law of England or of any Province
in 1867.  The power must extend to legislation to make new crimes. . . .  It
appears to their Lordships to be of little value to seek to confine crimes to a
category of acts which by their very nature belong to the domain of
""criminal jurisprudence""; for the domain of criminal jurisprudence
can only be ascertained by examining what acts at any particular period are
declared by the State to be crimes. . . .  (Emphasis added.)

Soon after that decision, in Attorney-General for British Columbia
v. Attorney-General for Canada, [1937] A.C. 368, the Privy Council adopted
similar reasoning to uphold a prohibition on price discrimination under the
criminal law power.  Later, this Court, following in large part the reasoning
employed by the Privy Council in PATA, supra, sustained a
prohibition of resale price maintenance under the criminal law power (Campbell
v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. vii) and a federal law authorizing the courts
to make orders prohibiting the continuation of illegal practices or to dissolve
illegal mergers; see Goodyear Tire, supra.  In the Goodyear
Tire case, at p. 311, Rand J. reaffirmed the reasoning in the PATA
case and made the following observation:

 

It is accepted that head 27 of s. 91 of the Confederation statute is to
be interpreted in the widest sense, but that breadth of scope contemplates
neither a static catalogue of offences nor order of sanctions.  The evolving
and transforming types and patterns of social and economic activities are
constantly calling for new penal controls and limitations and that new modes of
enforcement and punishment adapted to the changing conditions are not to be
taken as being equally within the ambit of parliamentary power is, in my
opinion, not seriously arguable.

 

In my view, the reasoning in PATA and Goodyear Tire is
directly applicable here.  The simple fact that neither tobacco consumption nor
tobacco advertising have been illegal in the past in no way precludes
Parliament from criminalizing either of those activities today.

 

 

 

31               The notion
of criminality, thus, is not a static one, but one which very much changes over
time.   As society changes, the conception of what types of conduct can
properly be considered criminal also evolves.  There are a myriad of different
activities which at one point in time were considered legal, but which we now
consider criminal.  The offence of criminal harassment is one obvious example. 
For many years, it was not recognized as criminal to persistently follow
someone and cause them to fear for their safety, so long as no contact was
made.  Now, that has distinctly changed with the addition of s. 264 of the Code,
which makes this conduct a crime.  In my view, this principle was expressed
well in R. v. Lafrenière, [1994] O.J. No. 437 (Ont. Ct. (Prov. Div.)) by
Greco Prov. Div. J., who stated the following with regard to the criminal
harassment provisions (at para. 7):

 

                   If one analyzes the section closely it becomes
apparent that conduct or behaviour by an accused which had previously been
viewed as innocent, in the sense that it was not criminal conduct, in certain
circumstances and under certain conditions may now become criminal conduct.

 

See also R. v. Hau,
[1994] B.C.J. No. 677 (Prov. Ct.).

 

32               In
addition, we should not be swayed by the fact that the underlying activity in
this case, receiving a benefit or advantage, happens to be quite legal.  Such
is also the case in a number of criminal provisions.  Nevertheless, the law
recognizes that in certain circumstances perfectly legal activity can become
criminal.  As MacDonnell Prov. Div. J. correctly recognized with respect  to
the criminal harassment provisions:

 

It is important to recognize that the conduct referred to in the four
categories in ss. 264(2) is not per se unlawful.  Indeed, if it were, there
would have been no need to enact s. 264 .  It is not per se criminal to follow
someone, to communicate with them, or even to watch and beset a place where
they are (unless one has the specific intent set out in s. 423(1) of the
Code).  It is not even an offence to engage in ""threatening conduct"",
unless that conduct falls within one of the specific sections of the Code
dealing with threats, such as ss. 264.1, 265(1)(b), 346(1), 423(1)(a) or (b),
and 424. In enacting s. 264 , Parliament has taken conduct which by itself is
lawful and, in certain circumstances, made it criminal. [Emphasis
added.]

 

(R. v. Johnston,
[1995] O.J. No. 3118 (Ont. Ct. (Prov. Div.)), at para. 29.)

 

33               This is
quite analogous to the situation here.  While it is true that in most cases,
nothing could be more innocent than accepting a gift or a benefit from someone,
under certain circumstances that type of conduct can be considered criminal. 
There is nothing inherently improper in criminalizing the receipt of benefits. 


 

34               The
importance of this discussion is simply that once we recognize that our
conception of criminality is somewhat fluid, it is a factor to consider in
determining the proper limits of the criminal sanction.  My colleague suggests
that a government employee who receives benefits from someone who has dealings
with the government does not commit a criminal offence.   Essentially, he is
saying that Parliament did not mean to enact such a law, because this conduct,
without more, could not constitute a criminal act.  I disagree.  Parliament has
identified what it considers an evil against the public, has set out a
legitimate objective, and has written a prohibition into the statute which
restricts specific actions.  In my view, this is a valid exercise of the
criminal law power, and as such, the judiciary should not rewrite it to suit
its own particular conception of what type of conduct can be considered
criminal.  As Lamer J. (as he then was) recognized in R. v. Smith,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1070, adopting  Borins Dist. Ct. J. in R. v.
Guiller, Ont. Dist. Ct., September 23, 1985, unreported, at p. 15:

 

                   It is not for the court to pass on the wisdom of
Parliament with respect to the gravity of various offences and the range of
penalties which may be imposed upon those found guilty of committing the
offences.  Parliament has broad discretion in proscribing conduct as criminal
and in determining proper punishment.

 

 

 

35               I agree
with this approach.  It should not, however, be taken that I am suggesting that
the courts have no role to play in helping to interpret criminal provisions and
ensure that they remain carefully tailored to what Parliament intended.  As
Doherty J.A. describes it in Greenwood, supra, at p. 246:

 

The courts, however, play a crucial role in the process through the
interpretation of the language used by Parliament, and the application of
certain common law principles which, in the main, operate to set the necessary
fault requirement: see R. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City), [1978] 2 S.C.R.
1299. . . .

 

Doherty J.A., however,
went on to expand upon this by saying that this interpretative role should be
informed by certain concerns (at pp. 246-47):

 

                   In addition to these specific interpretative aids,
the general underlying purpose of the criminal law must inform the
interpretation of any provision which creates a crime. The criminal law is
essentially a means whereby society seeks to prevent, and, failing that, punish
blameworthy conduct which strikes at the fundamental values of the community.
The criminal law is, however, a weapon of last resort intended for use only in
cases where the conduct is so inconsistent with the shared morality of society
so as to warrant public condemnation and punishment: see The Criminal Law in
Canadian Society (Government of Canada, 1982), Libman v. R., [1985]
2 S.C.R. 178,  . . .  21 C.C.C. (2d) 369, . . . at p. 212 (S.C.R.), p. 231
(C.C.C.). There must be at least a rough equivalence between what judges say is
criminal and what the community regards as morally blameworthy. Judicial
interpretation of statutory language so as to declare conduct criminal which
members of the community view as innocent or morally neutral does a disservice
to the overall operation of the criminal law: see Law Reform Commission of
Canada, Our Criminal Law (1976); Sayre, “Public Welfare Offences”
(1933), 33 Col. L.R. 55; J.L. Edwards, Mens Rea in Statutory Offences
(1955) at pp. 244-251.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

36               I agree
with this approach, so long as the focus remains upon interpretation.  I
repeat that judges should not attempt to rewrite a statute under the guise of
interpreting it.  If Parliament chooses to criminalize conduct which,
notwithstanding Charter  scrutiny, appears to be outside of what a judge
considers “criminal”, there must be a sense of deference to the legislated
authority which has specifically written in these elements.  In my view, what
Doherty J.A. actually recognized when he stated that the judiciary should not
declare innocent conduct criminal is a principle of statutory construction
which decrees that Parliament does not intend through the criminal law to trap
trivial, non-criminal conduct.  As Gonthier J. expressed in Ontario v.
Canadian Pacific Ltd., [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, at p. 1082:

 

Where a provision is open to two or more interpretations, the absurdity
principle may be employed to reject interpretations which lead to negative
consequences, as such consequences are presumed to have been unintended by the
legislature.  In particular, because the legislature is presumed not to have
intended to attach penal consequences to trivial or minimal violations of a
provision, the absurdity principle allows for the narrowing of the scope of the
provision.

 

 

37               Finally, I
would also add that in considering whether the effect of the law conforms to
the “underlying purpose of the criminal law” we must not focus narrowly on the
impugned provision.  Often, a particular provision may seem harsh on its face,
but a number of defences exist which reduce its severity.  In that sense, a
judge in searching to discover the proper meaning of a provision must consider
the whole of the law and how it will be applied, as opposed to the section in
the abstract, before choosing an interpretation. 

                   

38               In this
regard, I would also point out that the section at issue here is like few
others in that it offers a simple, complete and exonerating defence to any
government employee.  Inherent in the reasons of Cory J. is that the section
might trap conduct which, although it might appear corrupt on the surface,
might truly be quite innocent.  Unlike fraud, or bribery offences, however,
this section offers an easy solution to any employee concerned about the
propriety of his or her conduct.  All the employee must do to be completely
absolved of responsibility is get the consent of his or her superior in
writing.  In my view, this does not impose a particularly onerous
requirement.  Where the employee has any doubts about accepting a gift,
Parliament has made it clear that it would rather the person get the consent of
his or her superior.  At least one commentator has suggested that this defence
should be enough to clarify any potential problems with the mens rea of
the section: John C. Pearson, Annotation to R. v. Greenwood (1992), 8
C.R. (4th) 236.

 

39               It is with
this background in mind that I approach the interpretation of this particular
section of the Code.  There can be no question that this section deals
with a serious offence and that Parliament intended to deal with it seriously. 
Charges must proceed by way of indictment, and there is a maximum penalty of
five years’ imprisonment.

 

Actus Reus of s. 121(1) (c)

 

40               The
interpretation of the section was recently considered in  Greenwood, supra, 
by the Ontario Court of Appeal.  My colleague takes the position that this
decision properly defines the approach we should take to this section.  While I
am in agreement with much of what was said by Doherty J.A. in that case, I
ultimately find myself in disagreement with his conclusions.  

 

41               The
language of s. 121(1) (c) consists of three separate elements which can
be broken down into the following components:

 

(a) the giving of a ""commission, reward, advantage or benefit of
any kind"" by a person having ""dealings with the government"";

 

(b) the receipt of that ""commission, reward, advantage or benefit
of any kind"" by a government employee; and

 

(c) the absence of the consent of the government employee's superior to
the receipt of the ""commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any
kind"".

 

42               Nevertheless,
these elements contain many terms which require the clarification of the
courts.  Without this interpretation, I agree with Cory J. that this section
would have a virtually unlimited meaning.   Interpretation in this regard is of
course a standard feature of the criminal law, and should not be taken as
suggesting that a provision does not offer sufficient particularity to the
public.  In this regard, I substantially agree with Arbour J.A., in R. v.
Fisher (1994), 88 C.C.C. (3d) 103 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 109-10, who in
replying to a constitutional challenge to the  very section at issue here, made
the following remarks:

 

In its substantive conception, fair notice requires not only that the
law be brought home to persons governed by it, but that the law convey in an
intelligible way what the proscribed conduct is.  The fact that citizens would
be surprised to find how broadly the net has been cast by Parliament in
criminalizing corruption in the public service does not mean that the law is
broad to the point of vagueness.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   The decision of this court in Greenwood,
supra, elaborates upon the meaning of the statutory components of s.
121(1) (c).  As so interpreted, the enactment provides adequate guidance
to government employees who are required to comply with s. 121(1) (c) of
the Criminal Code , and it also curtails appropriately discretionary
enforcement.  The text of that provision, as judicially interpreted, cannot, in
my view, be said to be unconstitutionally vague.

 

See also: Ontario v.
Canadian Pacific Ltd., supra; R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical
Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606.

 

43               This
approach, of course, recognizes that judicial interpretation has a crucial role
to play in giving fair notice to the public.  It is not merely whether the
statute on its plain reading conveys accurate notice, but how it will be read
in its proper context which must be considered as well.

 

44               In Greenwood,
supra, Doherty J.A. concentrated his focus mainly upon the
interpretation of the term “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any
kind”.  He came to the conclusion that this wording had the potential to trap a
large scope of non-criminal conduct and thus it was important to limit it as
much as possible.  His starting point was that a literal reading of the term
“advantage or benefit of any kind” included gifts and all sorts of trivial
favours, including the situation where a person having dealings with the
government purchases a government employee a cup of coffee.  Cory J. has come
to the same conclusion.

 

 

45               Doherty
J.A. believed that the key to interpreting the rather open-ended term
“advantage or benefit” was the concept of profit (at p. 252):

 

                   It is noteworthy that the other offences created by
s. 121(1)  also used the words ""advantage or benefit"", without any
apparent qualification. The offences created by those sections, however, limit
the scope of those words by requiring that the advantage or benefit be given or
received for a specific purpose, (s. 121(1) (a), (d), (e)
and (f)) or in relation to the giver's dealings with the government (s.
121(1) (b)): see R. v. Giguere, supra, at p. 458 (S.C.R.), p. 9
(C.C.C.). Those sections differentiate between criminal benefits and other
benefits by reference to the giver's or recipient's state of mind. No such
limitation is found in s. 121(1) (c). However, that section creates a crime
which is as serious and serves the same purpose as the other offences created
by s. 121. It is therefore necessary to choose, from the available
definitions, meanings for the words ""advantage or benefit"" which
limit s. 121(1) (c) to its intended purpose.

 

                   In my view, the word ""profit"" found in
both the definition of ""advantage"" and ""benefit"" sounds the
keynote for the meaning of those words in the context of s. 121(1) (c). A
government employee receives an advantage or benefit when that employee
receives something of value which, in all of the circumstances, the trier of
fact concludes constitutes a profit to the employee (or a family member)
derived, in part at least, because the employee is a government employee, or
because of the nature of the work done by the employee for the government. 
This definition encompasses not only arrangements involving a quid pro quo but
also those more subtle forms of potential corruption whereby an employee gets
something from an individual who has dealings with the government because he or
she is a government employee, even though the giver expects nothing in return
and the employee has done nothing to earn the thing given.   [Emphasis added.]

 

 

46               In essence,
for the purpose of not trapping the recipient of a trivial benefit, Doherty
J.A. introduced a new element into the section.  With the greatest of respect,
it is neither desirable nor necessary to do so.  In my view, Parliament worded
this section broadly and did not intend to restrict its application solely to
situations where the gift was motivated by the recipient’s position in
government.  I believe it is possible to limit the section’s potentially wide
application through statutory interpretation without introducing an additional
element. 

 

47               I propose
to examine each component of the actus reus in order to determine
whether the section contains adequate safeguards to prevent the recipient of a
minor benefit from falling into the criminal system.

 

(a)the giving of a ""commission, reward, advantage or benefit of
any kind"" by a person having ""dealings with the government""                                                                    

 

48               The first
component of the section is that a commission, reward, advantage or benefit of
any kind be given by a person having dealings with the government.  I agree
with Cory J. that at first glance this section appears to have virtually
unlimited application.  On a literal interpretation, it is difficult to find a
person in modern society who does not have some form of dealings with the
government.  It cannot have been the intention of Parliament to  encompass
every person in Canada, and many living abroad, into the section.  Given the
important purpose of preserving integrity, it would appear to me that the
section is not interested in regulating the ordinary dealings which go on
between Canadians and the government, but is truly concerned with persons who
at the time of the commission of the offence had specific or ongoing business
dealings with the government and that the gift was such that it could have an
effect on those dealings.

 

49               I come to
this conclusion for two reasons.  First, in the related s. 121(1) (b),
the wider term “dealings of any kind” is used as opposed to the present section
which merely employs the term “dealings”.  It is reasonable to assume that
Parliament deliberately chose to omit the additional words “of any kind” and in
doing so, intended to ascribe a narrower meaning to “dealings” in s. 121(1) (c).

 

50               Second, I
would point out that while the English provision of the Criminal Code 
uses the wide term “dealings”, the French version of the text is expressed in a
narrower manner.  It states: 

 

étant fonctionnaire ou employé du gouvernement, exige, accepte ou offre
ou convient d’accepter d’une personne qui a des relations d’affaires
avec le gouvernement une commission, une récompense, un avantage ou un bénéfice
de quelque nature. . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

 

The French text means,
literally, that the giver must be conducting business dealings, or  have
business relations with the government.  Since  the two versions are somewhat
different, we must attempt to find a shared meaning:  R. Sullivan, Driedger
on the Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 223; Pierre-André
Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at p.
275. It does not appear that the sections are contradictory; rather, the
English version is open to different interpretations while the French version
is open to just one.  Given the purpose of the statute, which is to preserve
the appearance of integrity, I believe the French version is the applicable
one.  I find it hard to see how the purpose of the statute would be furthered
by accepting the broader English meaning.  As the French version eliminates any
ambiguity in the statute, it is incumbent upon the Court to accept this
narrower meaning.  

 

51               Therefore,
I conclude that the proper interpretation of this term is the narrow one,
whereby only where persons are in the process of having commercial dealings
with the government at the time of the offence is the conduct trapped under the
section.  I find it unnecessary to expand at length about what would constitute
“business dealings” for the purpose of the section.  This was not the principal
argument before this Court, and there is no doubt that this factor would be satisfied
on the facts of this case.  I believe the term is easily amenable to judicial
interpretation and should not cause any difficulty.

 

(b)the receipt of that ""commission, reward, advantage or
benefit of any kind"" by a government employee

 

52               It is this
portion of the provision which would appear to attract the greatest scrutiny of
both Doherty J.A. in Greenwood and Cory J. here.  The concern appears to
be that the words “advantage or benefit” are used without any qualification and
seem to be virtually unlimited.  Indeed, Cory J. points out that the words “of
any kind” would seem to make the section virtually limitless.  He concludes by
saying (at para. 95):

 

The section makes it an offence for an employee to accept or agree to accept
from a person who has dealings with the government a commission, reward,
advantage or benefit of any kind directly or indirectly, by himself or
through a member of his family, unless he has the consent in writing of the
government that employs him.  Thus if a government employee accepts, on a rainy
day, a ride downtown from a friend who does business with the government he has
received a benefit.  That could hold true as well for the cup of coffee or
occasional lunch bought by the friend for the government employee. [Emphasis in
original.]

 

 

53               I do not
agree that the phrase “of any kind” was meant to widen  the scope of the
provision’s reach.  It was not worded or intended to mean “of whatever amount”
or “of any value” such that the recipient of a cup of coffee should come within
the confines of the section.  On the contrary, I believe that Parliament’s true
intent in adding the words “of any kind” was to trap diverse forms of 
benefits, as opposed to indicating that it would be criminal to accept benefits
of any value.  To the extent that the term could support both
interpretations, I once again look at the French version of the Criminal
Code , which sets out the section in the following way:

 

étant fonctionnaire ou employé du gouvernement, exige, accepte ou offre
ou convient d’accepter d’une personne qui a des relations d’affaires avec le
gouvernment, une commission, une récompense, un avantage ou un bénéfice de
quelque nature, directement ou indirectement, par lui-même ou par
l’intermédiare d’un membre de sa famille ou de toute personne à son profit, à
moins d’avoir obtenu, du chef de la division de gouvernement qui l’emploie ou
dont il est fonctionnaire, un consentement écrit dont la preuve lui incombe. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

54               Once again,
this wording of the provision sheds some light on the latent ambiguity.  The 
term “de quelque nature” operates somewhat differently from “of any
kind” and strongly supports the interpretation I have suggested above.  It
indicates that what Parliament was truly intending by the section was to
attract diverse forms of benefits.  Thus, a government employee who receives a
house at no cost is in the same position as one who happens to receive cash
compensation.  

 

55               I believe
that the approach taken in Pezzelato v. The Queen, 96 D.T.C. 1285
(T.C.C.), in this regard is quite instructive.   The decision deals with s.
6(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, which is concerned with whether a
person receives a benefit “of any kind whatever received or enjoyed . . . in
the year in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of an office or
employment”.

 

56               While the
specific facts of Pezzelato are not particularly helpful as the main
question was whether it was a benefit received by virtue of the appellant’s
employment, the pragmatic approach taken to the term “benefit of any kind” by
Bowman T.C.C.J. merits consideration.  I recognize of course that as a taxation
case, this decision deals with markedly different principles; however it is
interesting in that it states clearly that the term “benefit of any kind” is
not unlimited in scope (at p. 1288):

 

The sole question is: was it a benefit?  The word in the French version
is ""avantage"".

 

                   The matter has been much litigated in this court and
in higher courts.  Before I deal with the cases, I should like to approach the
problem simply as a matter of principle and of common sense.  Notwithstanding
the breadth of its wording section 6 is not intended to create an artificial
concept of income from employment.  Rather, it is designed to recognize the
numerous and varied ways in which an employee may be remunerated for his or her
services and to bring them within the net of taxation.  It is not intended to
expand beyond the ordinary understanding of the word benefit (avantage)
things that are not benefits at all.  In other words, the wide net that section
6 casts relates to the manner in which the benefit is conferred, not to the
definition of the benefit.2

                                                          


2                  The
words ""of any kind whatever"" do not appear to add anything to or
extend the ordinary meaning of benefit.  A benefit is, after all, a benefit. 
If something is not a benefit it does not become one by adding the words
""of any kind whatever"".  I can only assume that the additional words
are not intended to add to the meaning of benefit, but to prevent the meaning
of the word from being restricted by being interpreted as (ejusdem) generis
with board and lodging.

 

 

See also Vine Estate v.
Minister of National Revenue (1989), 29 F.T.R. 59, at p. 67.

 

 

 

57               I come to a
similar conclusion here.  In my view, the words “of any kind” do not add to the
term “benefit” in any way other than to suggest that Parliament intended to
trap benefits other than those of a strict monetary nature.

 

58               This of
course does not completely address the question of what exactly Parliament did
intend to encompass through the terms it used.  The words “benefit” and
“advantage” by themselves can still be understood to capture a wide variety of
conduct.  My colleague is rightly concerned about this section imposing a
criminal sanction for a benefit received which is so minimal it clearly does
not warrant such a harsh reprisal.  I agree that such an interpretation would
be clearly absurd, and as such is not one which should be followed.  As stated
in Driedger, supra, at p. 79:

 

Where it appears that the consequences of adopting an interpretation
would be absurd, the courts are entitled to reject it in favour of a plausible
alternative that avoids the absurdity. 

 

 

59               Given the
absurd consequences of adopting an unlimited wide meaning of the term
“advantage or benefit” it is incumbent to search out an interpretation which
avoids  these consequences.  In my view, many of these can be avoided by a
stricter reading of the term, and a recognition that it requires the
beneficiary to have secured a material or tangible gain before falling into the
confines of the section.  In this regard, I have no difficulty with the
description of this as a “profit” by Doherty J.A.  I merely differ from him in
the conclusion that this profit must have come from the accused’s position in
government.

 

60               Cory J.,
however, concludes that without this strict confining on the term, the
provision will attract too wide a scope of conduct.  He cites, inter alia,
a government employee who accepts an innocent cup of coffee or occasional lunch
from a friend, or receives a lift from someone when caught in the rain, and
points out that these people could be caught by a literal reading of benefit,
or even profit.  I would note that he has in fact gone farther than Doherty
J.A. in Greenwood, supra, and required a subjective awareness of
the motivation behind the gift as well.

 

61               This is not
the first time our Court has been faced with a Criminal Code  section
with potentially wide application, nor is it the only section in the Code
which, if literally interpreted, could capture innocent activity.  While I
agree with my colleague that we do not want to capture the recipient of a cup
of coffee, his reasons have done much more than that.  Cory J.’s definition
would exclude anyone who did not intend to receive this benefit because of his
or her position in government.  This seems to be completely contrary to the
section’s role in preserving the appearance of integrity in government.  

 

62               I cite, as
an example, the hypothetical situation of a government employee who has
business dealings with a lifelong friend who has construction contracts with
the government.  Suppose this friend, out of genuine friendship, decides to
build his friend a $200,000 house at no cost.  According to Cory J., this type
of situation would not fall within the scope of the section if the government
employee had a genuine belief that this gift was strictly out of friendship. 
In my view, this is exactly the type of situation the section was designed to
capture.

 

63               While the
occasional free lunch or dinner might not concern the public, the conclusion
may well be different in a situation where the friend purchases lunch or dinner
every day, or for a sustained period of time.  What may cast a shadow upon the
appearance of integrity will likely depend on a number of different factors.  I
wish to point out that to impose a restriction, as I believe my colleague has
done, which puts all of these transactions out of reach is a virtual rewriting
of the section; it is to do what Parliament has specifically restrained from
doing.  In my view, as much as is possible within the valid corners of the law,
and absent constitutional considerations which mandate otherwise, we should
respect Parliament’s wishes on these matters and not impose unwanted
hindrances. 

 

64               I believe
the term “advantage or benefit” can be interpreted in a manner which does not
include the recipient of a cup of coffee.   In Hoefele v. The Queen, 94
D.T.C. 1878 (T.C.C.), the court found that to constitute a benefit worthy of
measurement, it needed to be a “material economic advantage” (p. 1880).  It
was  recognized, therefore, that trivial advantages did not satisfy the
confines of the law.  In a taxation sense, a benefit does not occur when the
payment is a reimbursement or does not advance the recipient’s position in any
material sense.

 

65               The
decision of R. v. Dubas, [1992] B.C.J. No. 2935 (S.C.), aff’d without
reference to this point (1995), 60 B.C.A.C. 202, is also instructive in narrowing
the section’s application.  In that decision, the Deputy Minister of Health for
British Columbia was charged after it became known that he had accepted a hotel
room and hotel expenses from a company which manufactured high technology
hospital equipment and often sold this equipment to agents of the ministry. 
MacDonell J. utilized the following approach in deciding the case (at paras.
29-30):

 

                   It is apparent from the authorities that all of the
circumstances must be considered in deciding whether Mr. Dubas received a
benefit or not.  In deciding that, the purpose of the trip has to be
considered:  whether it was essentially on government business and, if so, what
advantage was there to Mr. Dubas to receive free accommodation.  Was it the
government, or the taxpayers of British Columbia, who received the benefit by
not having to pay for the trips which would otherwise be paid for by the
Ministry, or was the benefit for Siemens? . . .

 

                   With respect to Count 1, I am of the view that no
benefit was received by Mr. Dubas from Siemens Electric Ltd. with respect to
the February/March, 1986 trip.  All that was provided was accommodation of
which the Minister was aware and approved.  Mr. Dubas was there on government
business and, if the trip were authorized and had the accommodation not been
offered, he would be entitled to charge out the expenses for it.  In neither
case does he personally benefit.  Accordingly, I conclude that the Crown has
failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused under Count
1.

 

66               In my view,
this reasoning is quite appropriate.  While conduct similar to that in the Dubas
case might attract sanction under a government’s conflict of interest
guidelines, it does not fall within the purpose or wording of s. 121(1) (c). 
It is true that the appearance of integrity may be harmed by such conduct, but
it is not because the government employee  personally benefits. 
This particular section is designed to prevent  an employee from actually
benefiting.  Where this does not occur, the criminal sanction is not warranted.

 

67               This would
also address many of the situations suggested by Cory J.  Where friends take
each other to dinner on a reciprocating basis, it is unfair to suggest that one
“benefits” by receiving a dinner on an isolated occasion.  It would be
acceptable for an accused in such a situation to raise evidence which showed
that this was part of an ongoing relationship between friends who periodically
exchanged dinners.  Where the benefits, however, were obviously one-sided, it
might lead to a different conclusion.  This would be a matter for the trier of
fact to consider on all the facts of the case, and its unique circumstances.

 

68               In this
regard, it is important to consider the relationship between the parties as
well as the scope of the benefit.  Obviously, the closer the relationship, the
less likely the gift should be perceived as an advantage or benefit to the
recipient.  The size of the gift is also a crucial indicator.  Where a gift is
trivial, like a cup of coffee, I fail to see how it could ever be seen as a
true  “benefit” to someone.  The same situation is not apparent when the gift
is a car, a large sum of money, or a house.  In these cases, a trier of fact
might well find that the person has benefited from the gift well beyond
anything he or she has contributed.  Simply stated, it is a question of fact
for the jury to determine based on all the evidence in the case.  In most
instances, this determination should not be a difficult one.  In fact, while
this case deals with the potential application of the section, the appellant
was unable to cite one reported case where the Crown actually pursued someone
for the receipt of a “trivial” benefit.  Where it would be difficult, however,
it would still not require a finding that it was conferred because of the
person’s role in government.

 

69               In my view,
this interpretation removes the possibility that the section will trap trivial
and unintended violations.   Nevertheless, assuming that situations could still
arise which do not warrant a criminal sanction, there might be another method
to avoid entering a conviction: the principle of de minimis non curat lex,
that “the law does not concern itself with trifles”.  This type of solution to
cases where an accused has “technically” violated a Code section has
been proposed by the Canadian Bar Assocation, in  Principles of Criminal
Liability: Proposals for a New General Part of the Criminal Code of Canada
(1992), and others: see Professor Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise
(3rd ed. 1995) at pp. 542-46.  I am aware, however, that this principle’s
potential application as a defence to criminal culpability has not yet been
decided by this Court, and  would appear to be the subject of some debate in
the courts below.  Since a resolution of this issue is not strictly necessary
to decide this case, I would prefer to leave this issue for another day.

 

70               In summary,
the actus reus of the offence provides adequate safeguards to prevent an
overly broad application.  This in itself is sufficient to dispose of this
appeal.  However, as Cory J. discussed the mens rea of the offence at
length in his reasons, I propose to make some comments on this issue as well.

 

Mens rea of s. 121(1) (c)

 

71               As
aforementioned, this offence constitutes a “conduct” crime, and as such,
requires that the accused, to be culpable, know of the conduct he or she
committed, and have knowledge of the circumstances in which it occurred.  As
such, in order to prove the offence in s. 121(1) (c), it is necessary for
the Crown to prove the following fault elements.  For the purposes of the
present case, I will ignore the question of the onus of proving a superior’s
consent in setting out the necessary requirements, which are:

 

(a) an employee's conscious decision to accept what in all of the
circumstances is found to be a ""commission, reward, advantage or benefit
of any kind""; and

 

(b) knowledge (or wilful blindness) at the time of the receipt that the
giver was having dealings with the government and that the employee's superior had
not consented to his or her receipt of the ""commission, reward, advantage
or benefit of any kind"".

 

As I stated at the outset,
this level of mens rea is  recognized as a valid form of criminal
culpability, and thus there is no need to add any additional components. 

 

72               I do not
wish to be misunderstood, however,  as suggesting that the motivation behind a
particular benefit is a completely irrelevant consideration.  On the contrary,
it is an important factor in determining the appropriate level of culpability.
Where a corrupt intention actually exists on the part of the employee receiving
the benefit, it is a factor to consider in determining an appropriate
punishment.  As Lamer C.J. recognized in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
633, at pp. 645-46:

 

The effect of s. 213
is to violate the principle that punishment must be proportionate to the moral
blameworthiness of the offender, or as Professor Hart puts it in Punishment and
Responsibility (1968), at p. 162, the fundamental principle of a morally
based system of law that those causing harm intentionally be punished more
severely than those causing harm unintentionally.  The rationale underlying
the principle that subjective foresight of death is required before a person is
labelled and punished as a murderer is linked to the more general principle
that criminal liability for a particular result is not justified except where
the actor possesses a culpable mental state in respect of that result:  see R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, per McIntyre J., and R. v. Buzzanga and Durocher (1979), 49
C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.), per Martin J.A. 
In my view, in a free and democratic society that values the autonomy and free
will of the individual, the stigma and punishment attaching to the most serious
of crimes, murder, should be reserved for those who choose to intentionally
cause death or who choose to inflict bodily harm that they know is likely to
cause death.  The essential role of requiring subjective foresight of death in
the context of murder is to maintain a proportionality between the stigma and
punishment attached to a murder conviction and the moral blameworthiness of the
offender. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

73               This
approach was applied by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in sentencing an
accused for this very offence in R. v. Ruddock (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d)
65, at p. 72:

 

                   In my opinion, there are varying degrees of
culpability envisaged by s. 110(c).  By that I mean that it seems
to me that a Government official who directly demands a commission, etc., from
some one who has dealings with the Government on the pretext that unless such
commission is forthcoming he will sidetrack such dealings, has committed a more
serious breach of the section than say, Mr. Tanguay (R. v. Tanguay
(1975), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 77) who accepted a colour television set valued at $305
from a contractor doing business with Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
(of which Mr. Tanguay was assistant director).  In his case the Quebec
Court of Appeal substituted an absolute discharge for the suspension of
sentence ordered by the trial Court.

 

 

74               The
decision in R. v. Tanguay (1975), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 77 (Que. C.A.), is an
excellent example of this point.  In that case, no corrupt motive appears to
have been alleged by the Crown against the accused; nevertheless, he accepted
what was at that time a rather expensive television set from someone with whom
he regularly had business dealings.  On a comparative scale, however, given the
lack of ill motive and relatively small nature of the benefit, an absolute
discharge was an appropriate resolution.

 

75               Clearly,
where a government employee actually possessed a corrupt intention in accepting
a benefit it will usually merit a higher sentence than the person lacking such
a motive.  Similarly, persons accepting smaller benefits which are less likely
to impact on the actual integrity of the government can be dealt with
through the discharge provisions in s. 736  of the Criminal Code : 
Pearson, Annotation to R. v. Greenwood, supra.

 

76               While I
feel this is sufficient to satisfy the demands of this case, I wish to briefly
address the particular manner in which my colleague has dealt with the fault
element of this offence.  Although I differed with the manner in which Doherty
J.A., in Greenwood, supra, defined the actus reus of s.
121(1) (c), had I accepted his definition of the physical elements, I
would also have agreed with his position regarding the corresponding mens
rea elements rather than that proposed by Cory J.

 

77               After a
thorough analysis, Doherty J.A., at pp. 252-53, concluded that the crucial
question of whether a gift received by a government official constituted a
benefit or advantage depended on an objective appraisal of the circumstances:

 

In considering whether the gift constituted a benefit or advantage, the
nature of the gift, the prior relationship if any, between the giver and the
recipient, the manner in which the gift was made, the employee's function with
the government, the nature of the giver's dealings with the government, the
connection, if any, between the employee's job and the giver's dealings, and
the state of mind of the giver and the receiver would all have evidentiary
significance, as no doubt would other factors which may arise in any given
case. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

He went on to add that
while this conclusion depended, to a certain extent, upon the accused’s state
of mind, it was solely a matter of determining whether the actus reus
had been proved (at pp. 253-54):

 

                   It must be stressed that in deciding whether the
thing given to the employee constitutes a benefit or advantage for the purposes
of s. 121(1) (c), one is concerned with an aspect of the conduct
requirement (actus reus) of the offence and not with the fault requirement
(mens rea). The question is settled by an objective assessment of all of the
relevant evidence and not exclusively by reference to the recipient's
subjective state of mind. The fact that the employee did or did not regard a
gift as a profit by him from his employment is but one factor to be considered
in deciding whether the gift amounts to an ""advantage or benefit"" for
the purposes of s. 121(1) (c).

 

                   This objective approach to the elements of the
conduct requirement is typified by R. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, . .
. 37 C.C.C. (3d) 97, . . . where McIntyre J., for the court, in defining the
conduct requirement for the crime of sexual assault, said at p. 302 (S.C.R.),
p. 103 (C.C.C.):

 

“Sexual assault is an assault within any one of the definitions of that
concept in s. 244(1)  of the Criminal Code  which is committed in
circumstances of a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim
is violated. The test to be applied in determining whether the impugned
conduct has the requisite sexual nature is an objective one: ""Viewed
in the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal  context of the
assault visible to a reasonable observer?"" (Taylor, supra,
per Laycraft C.J.A., at p. 269). The part of the body touched, the nature of
the contact, the situation in which it occurred, the words and gestures
accompanying the act, and all other circumstances surrounding the conduct,
including threats which may or may not be accompanied by  force, will be
relevant (see S.J. Usprich, ""A New Crime in Old Battles: Definitional
Problems with Sexual Assault"" (1987), 29 Crim. L.Q. 200, at p.
204). The intent or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent
that this may appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in  considering
whether the conduct is sexual. If the motive of  the accused is sexual
gratification, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence it may be a
factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual. It must be emphasized,
however, that the existence of such a motive is  simply one of many factors to
be considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the
circumstances.” [Emphasis added by Doherty J.A.]

 

Doherty J.A. felt that
once the Crown had proved this element of the actus reus, it was  unnecessary
to go farther and prove that the accused knew exactly why the benefit had been
conferred.  He rejected the need for  a “corrupt” or “dishonest” motive to
ground a conviction.  He came to this conclusion based on the clear statutory
language to this effect, and because of the important purpose behind s. 121(1) (c). 
Cory J. found this approach unacceptable and found that a corrupt intention
needed to be established, despite the explicit absence of such a requirement in
the statute.  In his view, whenever the mental element of an offence must be
established subjectively, each aspect of the actus reus requires a
corresponding subjective mental awareness.

 

78               With
respect, I prefer the approach of Doherty J.A. in this regard.  Several
decisions of this Court have established that subjective mental awareness need
not attach to every  part of the conduct requirement of a particular crime:  R.
v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944; R. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
293; R. v. Lohnes, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 167.  The analogy to Chase in
particular is quite appropriate.  While the Crown must prove that an actor knew
that he had received some form of benefit, it is not necessary to prove as an
essential element that the accused knew the benefit was received because of his
position in government.

 

79               I also have
some concern with the  phraseology that my colleague has adopted with regard to
the necessary mental elements of criminal offences.   Specifically, he states,
in discussing whether an objective or subjective mens rea should be
adopted for an offence (at para. 106):

 

                   In some circumstances the mental element should be
assessed on an objective basis. For example, in regulatory offences the mental
element of blameworthiness may be assessed objectively.  See R. v. Wholesale
Travel Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154.  The same holds true for dangerous
driving; see R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867.  Similarly R. v.
Gosset, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 76, dealt with the careless use of a firearm in a
charge of manslaughter and the mental element was assessed objectively.  The
same approach was taken in R. v. Finlay, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 103, where the
accused was charged with careless storage of a firearm.  However, unless the
wording of the section creating the crime indicates otherwise or the nature of
the crime itself dictates a different approach, then the mens rea or
blameworthy aspect must be assessed subjectively.

 

At another point, he cites
from Professor Stuart, who in his text Canadian Criminal Law supra,
at p. 194, states:

 

                   Where the definition of the crime contains no mens
rea words, and cannot be interpreted as a crime of objective negligence, it
should be interpreted as an offence of subjective mens rea. . . .

 

                   The only authority to the contrary is the Supreme
Court in DeSousa, Creighton and Godin reading in an
objective rather than a subjective substantive standard in interpreting crimes
relying on so-called predicate offences.  This must surely be confined to that
special category of offence.  The approach of our courts to unlawful act
manslaughter has long been objective at a time when the established tradition
has been to interpret other Criminal Code  offences as requiring the subjective
standard.

 

 

 

80               In my view,
both of these excerpts appear to suggest that the mens rea of an offence
is simply the assessing of the “blameworthy aspect” which is either subjective
or objective.  I am somewhat uncomfortable with the way Professor Stuart refers
to “an offence of subjective mens rea”, suggesting that an offence must
be either subjective or objective with no possible middle ground.  In fact,
quite often the mens rea of an offence will be comprised of both
objective and subjective elements.  This has been recognized by this Court on
more than one occasion: Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, supra;
Lohnes, supra.  In order to avoid confusion, I prefer to clearly
state that the mens rea of a particular offence is composed of the
totality of its component fault elements.  The mere fact that most criminal
offences require some subjective component does not mean that every
element of the offence requires such a state of mind.  See also Eric Colvin, Principles
of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 55.

 

81                      I
also disagree with the statement of Professor Stuart which would appear to
confine objective fault standards to offences which have such a component
specifically written into the statute, or to so-called “predicate offences”
like unlawful act manslaughter.  This approach is simply not consistent with
the way in which this Court has defined standards of fault.  One good example
is the unanimous decision of Lohnes, supra.  On that occasion,
this Court read an objective fault element into the offence of “causing a disturbance”
under s. 175(1) (a).  The section reads as follows:

 

                   175. (1) Every one who

 

(a)  not
being in a dwelling‑house, causes a disturbance in or near a public
place,

 

(i) by fighting,
screaming, shouting, swearing, singing or using insulting or obscene language,

 

                                                                   . .
.

 

is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

 

82               Much like
the scenario I suggested above, this offence actually possesses both a
subjective and an objective fault element.  In order to be convicted, an
accused must first subjectively intend to cause the underlying act which leads
to the disturbance, i.e. fighting, swearing, etc.  Once that occurs, the
remaining element is determined on an objective standard.  Whether the accused
intended a disturbance to result or not is of no consequence.  As McLachlin J.
wrote (at p. 182), what is necessary for a finding of guilt is that “the disturbance must be one which may reasonably have been
foreseen in the particular circumstances of time and place”.  

 

83               I believe Lohnes
is quite instructive in this regard.   Nevertheless, I feel it is wise to
refrain from making bold pronouncements on the question of which crimes can
legitimately possess objective fault elements; see Martineau, supra,
at p. 682 per Sopinka J.   In my view, this will often depend on the
wording of a particular section as well as its legislative purpose  and
context.  Many of the issues raised by Cory J. have not been firmly decided by
this Court and I feel it should be left to an appropriate case to resolve them. 

 

Disposition

 

84               I would
allow the appellant’s appeal.   Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeal
must be set aside, and a new trial ordered.  The charge to the jury on
s. 121(1) (c) should be in accord with these reasons.

 








\\Cory J.\\

 

                   The
reasons of Sopinka, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. were delivered by

 

1                        Cory J. -- At
issue on this appeal is the interpretation and application of s. 121(1) (c)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  That section makes it
an offence for an official or employee of the government to accept from a
person who has dealings with the government a benefit of any kind directly or
indirectly, by himself or through a member of his family, unless he has the
consent in writing of the head of the branch of government that employs him.

 

Factual
Background

 

1                        The
appellant Morgan Hinchey was employed as a district engineer by the Department
of Transportation for the Province of Newfoundland.  Beothuck Crushing and
Paving Limited is a construction company engaged in the construction of roads
for the Province and various municipalities.  During the summer and fall of
1984, James Wall, the General Manager and one of the owners of Beothuck, placed
Barbara Hinchey, the wife of the appellant, on the payroll of the company as a
standby flag person.  Barbara Hinchey was never asked to do any work by
Beothuck yet she received payments from the company in the amount of some
$7,400.  Beothuck also provided Barbara Hinchey with a record of employment
confirming that she had been employed for 20 weeks as a flag person from
July 30, 1984 to December 14, 1984, thereby qualifying for
unemployment insurance benefits.  She made an application for unemployment
insurance benefits based upon the employment record and received $11,100.

 

1                        The
appellant, as district engineer of the Department of Transportation, had a
great deal of experience in the construction industry.  He was in charge of
overseeing the construction of roads for the Province and municipal authorities
within the Province.  In that position he frequently dealt with James Wall
acting on behalf of Beothuck which was principally engaged in road construction
work.  The appellant had the authority to direct, suspend and generally
supervise the work done by Beothuck.  Prior to the time James Wall offered to
put the appellant’s wife on the payroll of Beothuck he and the appellant had
business dealings but they were neither close friends nor did they have a
social relationship.

 

1                        The
appellant was aware that his wife received cheques for 20 weeks from
Beothuck and yet had not been called upon to work during that period.  He was
aware that standby flag persons did not usually get paid when they were not
working; that Beothuck was laying off people doing flag work in September and
October; and that despite this practice his wife had remained on the payroll
without working.  He was aware that the cheques payable to Barbara Hinchey were
put in a special envelope and delivered to himself or his wife.  He knew that
he had not sought or obtained the consent of his employer to the receipt of any
benefit.  When the RCMP were investigating the situation, the appellant falsely
told them that his wife had been working for Beothuck on a fox farm.  He met
with James Wall and obtained his agreement that he would confirm the fox farm
story if questioned by the police.  He also convinced his wife to present the
same story.

 

1                        The
appellant and his wife were charged with two counts of fraud (counts 1 and
3) and the appellant with a breach of s. 121(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  (count 2).  They  were convicted on all three charges following a
trial by jury.  The Court of Appeal for Newfoundland unanimously allowed their
appeal against the two fraud convictions and a new trial was directed on those
counts:  (1994), 123 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 222, 382 A.P.R. 222.  The Court,
however, dismissed the appeal against the appellant’s conviction for breach of
s. 121(1) (c).  Leave was granted to the appellant by this Court to
appeal his conviction under that section:  [1995] 1 S.C.R. viii.

 

Court of Appeal

 

1                        In
dismissing the appeal from the s. 121(1) (c) conviction, Gushue J.A.
(with whom Marshall and Steele JJ.A. concurred) wrote (at p. 226):

 

While
at least some of the errors made by the trial judge in his charge could apply
also to count No. 2, there can be no doubt that the requisite elements of that
offence were proven.  Indeed, it is not denied by Morgan Hinchey that he, as an
official or employee of Government, directly accepted or agreed to accept
rewards, advantages or benefits from Beothuck, and/or indirectly through
Barbara Hinchey.  Further, it was established that this was done without the
consent in writing of the appropriate Government official or officials.  As to
the mental element, it was necessary for the Crown to prove only that Morgan
Hinchey intended to cause the above external circumstances of the offence.  The
onus was on him to prove otherwise and this was not done.

 

1                        Gushue
J.A. was of the view that even if any of the trial judge’s errors of law were
relevant to count No. 2, the provisions of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) would
apply because there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the
registering of this particular conviction.  I would observe that although the
reference to the onus resting on the accused may be in error it has no effect
on the outcome since it was established that the appellant knew he did not have
his employer’s consent to receive a benefit.

 

1                        The
Court of Appeal found a number of errors made by the trial judge with respect
to counts 1 and 3.  One error involved the failure of the trial judge to refer
to the defence’s character evidence in his charge to the jury and to direct the
jury as to how they should consider that evidence.  Gushue J.A. went on to
express the view that the impact of his failure to do so on count 2 was
“negligible”.

 

The Relevant Section of the Code

 

1                        121.
(1)  Every one commits an offence who

 

                          (a)  directly

the tender of that person, or

 

(ii)  demands,
accepts or offers or agrees to accept from another person who has made a tender
a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for the withdrawal
of his tender.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The Importance of
s. 121(1) (c)

 

1                        There
can be no doubt of the importance and significance of this section.  It is
designed to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of officials and employees
of the government.  Federal, provincial and municipal governments carry on
business on a very large scale.  The magnitude and the quantity of contracts
which governments enter into is of such an extent that it is extremely
significant not only to the business community but to all Canadians.  This is
not an adverse comment on the actions of government but rather a reflection of
the reality of today’s society.  The magnitude and importance of government
business requires not only the complete integrity of government employees and
officers conducting government business but also that this integrity and
trustworthiness be readily apparent to society as a whole.  Should government
contracts be awarded on the basis of benefits paid to government employees
rather than merit and cost this will weaken and tear the very fabric of both
government and society.  If government contracts can be bought by benefits paid
to government employees the entire civil service becomes suspect and is
dishonoured.  The fundamental importance of the subsection must be apparent to
all.  Its aim is to ensure the integrity of government employees.  This vitally
important aim and purpose should be taken into consideration in the
interpretation and application of the section.

 

Constituent
Elements of s. 121(1) (c)

 

1                        Section
121(1)(c), like all crimes, requires proof of an act or a failure to act
known as the actus reus coupled with an element of fault or
blameworthiness referred to as the mens rea.  Before considering the
acts which form an integral part of the crime and the element of
blameworthiness, it is necessary to consider the possible scope or breadth of
application of the section.  The section makes it an offence for an employee to
accept or agree to accept from a person who has dealings with the government a
commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind directly or
indirectly, by himself or through a member of his family, unless he has the
consent in writing of the government that employs him.  Thus if a government
employee accepts, on a rainy day, a ride downtown from a friend who does
business with the government he has received a benefit.  That could hold true
as well for the cup of coffee or occasional lunch bought by the friend for the
government employee.  Obviously the section was never designed to include in
its prohibition these very minor benefits.  Nor should it apply to the exchange
of those lunches and dinners that has long been a pattern of behaviour between
old friends.  However, benefits on a larger scale might well warrant closer
scrutiny and require the obtaining of permission from the government employing
the official.  A reasonable balance must be struck that recognizes both the
great dangers involved in paying benefits to government employees and the
normal exchange of minor favours between friends.

 

1                        It
will be remembered that the Newfoundland Court of Appeal determined that the
blameworthiness aspect or mental element of the offence was satisfied if the
Crown established that the accused:

 

(I)knowing
that he was an official or employee of the government;

 

(II)directly
or indirectly accepted a reward, advantage or benefit

 

(III)from
a person whom he knew had dealings with the government and

 

(IV)knew
that he did not have the consent of his superior to receive that reward,
advantage or benefit.

 

This was the manner in which the
trial judge instructed the jury with regard to the section.  It is the position
of the appellant that this approach was improper and establishes an inadequate
basis for the mental element of blameworthiness.

 

1                        The
same section was considered by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Greenwood (1991), 8 C.R. (4th) 235.  In his careful reasons Doherty J.A.
found that the purpose of the section was to preserve both the integrity of the
public service and the appearance of integrity of the public service.  He
recognized that this aspect of the section had been repeatedly recognized in
cases such as R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 860; R. v. Giguère,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 448; R. v. Sinasac (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 81 (Ont.
C.A.).  He stressed that it was important to bear in mind that the underlying
purpose in defining the boundaries of the section was to ensure that it did not
encompass conduct of the accused which no reasonable member of the community
would regard as blameworthy.  In this regard he stated (at p. 251):

 

                   The
need to preserve the appearance of integrity within the public service requires
that the words “advantage or benefit” include all gifts which can potentially
compromise that appearance of integrity.

 

                   While
the purpose of s. 121(1) (c) is an important one, its potentially
wide application, given the far‑flung business activities of modern
government and the numbers of people engaged in performing those activities,
requires that one must also recognize the limits of that purpose.  The section
is not intended to make government employees social pariahs who cannot, without
the consent of their superior, engage in the routine familial and social
relationships which constitute an integral part of our society.

 

He noted that appropriate limits
on interpretation of the section could be effected by restricting the meaning
of the constituent elements of the offence or by reading into it a mens rea
requirement which ensures that only morally blameworthy activity comes within
its purview.

 

1                        Doherty
J.A. pointed out that s. 121(1) (c) differed from the other
subsections of that section in that ss. 121(1) (a), (b), (d),
(e) and (f) make it a crime to offer or receive an advantage in
consideration for or in relation to the giver’s dealings with the government. 
Thus he determined that the scope of criminal liability must be wider in
s. 121(1) (c) and that the fault requirement for that subsection was
different from the others.

 

1                        He
identified the actus reus of the offence to be (at p. 247):

 

(a) 
the giving of a “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a
person “having dealings with the government”;

 

(b) 
the receipt of that “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a
government employee; and

 

(c) 
the absence of the consent of the government employee’s superior to the receipt
of the “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind”.

 

1                        In
his view the meaning of the expression “commission, reward, advantage or
benefit of any kind” included gifts consisting of something of value which
constituted a profit to the employee derived, at least in part, from the
employee’s relation to the government.  He concluded that unless this
definition was met, the giving of something of value was not such a commission,
reward, advantage or benefit but a gift, and the conduct would not come within
the scope of s. 121(1) (c).

 

1                        As
for the mental element or fault aspect he found (at pp. 262-63) that it could
be found in :

 

                   (a)an
employee’s conscious decision to accept what in all the circumstances is found
to be a “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind”; and

 

                   (b)knowledge
(or wilful blindness) at the time of the receipt that the giver had dealings
with the government and that the employee’s superior had not consented to his
or her receipt of the “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind”.

 

1                        I
am in general agreement with the reasoning of Doherty J.A. as to the actus
reus of the offence but I would, with respect, differ as to the mental
element or blameworthy requirement.

 

The Requirement of a Mental
Element and the Nature of that Mental Element Required for s. 121(1) (c)

 

1                        Section
121(1)(c) does not set out the mental element which is required for this
crime.  In those circumstances, before the advent of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , the mental element of blameworthiness had to be read
into the section.  See R. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City), [1978] 2
S.C.R. 1299.

 

1                        With
the passage of the Charter  it was apparent that s. 7  of the Charter 
requires that every crime include a mental element of fault.  See for example Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R 486; R. v. Vaillancourt,
[1987] 2 S.C.R 636.  The mental element is an essential factor of every
offence.  No matter how important s. 121(1) (c) may be to ensuring
the maintenance of high standards of public servants our criminal law requires
that the requisite mens rea be established.  Every individual accused of
a crime is entitled to no less.

 

1                        Depending
on the wording and the provisions of the particular section and the context in
which it appears the constitutional requirement of mens rea or
blameworthiness may be satisfied in different ways.  A criminal offence will
usually require proof of a positive state of mind such as intent which can be
inferred from the acts and words of the accused or by his recklessness or
wilful blindness.

 

1                        In
some circumstances the mental element should be assessed on an objective
basis.  For example, in regulatory offences the mental element of
blameworthiness may be assessed objectively.  See R. v. Wholesale Travel
Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154.  The same holds true for dangerous
driving; see R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867.  Similarly R. v.
Gosset, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 76, dealt with the careless use of a firearm in a
charge of manslaughter and the mental element was assessed objectively.  The
same approach was taken in R. v. Finlay, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 103,
where the accused was charged with careless storage of a firearm.  However,
unless the wording of the section creating the crime indicates otherwise or the
nature of the crime itself dictates a different approach, then the mens rea
or blameworthy aspect must be assessed subjectively.  See the reasons of
McLachlin J. in R. v. Théroux, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5, at p. 18.  There
she wrote:

 

Most
scholars and jurists agree that, leaving aside offences where the actus reus
is negligence or inadvertence and offences of absolute liability, the test for mens
rea is subjective.  The test is not whether a reasonable person would have
foreseen the consequences of the prohibited act, but whether the accused
subjectively appreciated those consequences at least as a possibility.  In
applying the subjective test, the court looks to the accused’s intention and
the facts as the accused believed them to be: G. Williams, Textbook of
Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1983), at pp. 727‑28.

 

                   Two
collateral points must be made at this juncture.  First, as Williams
underlines, this inquiry has nothing to do with the accused’s system of
values.  A person is not saved from conviction because he or she believes there
is nothing wrong with what he or she is doing.  The question is whether the
accused subjectively appreciated that certain consequences would follow from
his or her acts, not whether the accused believed the acts or their
consequences to be moral.  Just as the pathological killer would not be acquitted
on the mere ground that he failed to see his act as morally reprehensible, so
the defrauder will not be acquitted because he believed that what he was doing
was honest.

 

                   The
second collateral point is the oft‑made observation that the Crown need not,
in every case, show precisely what thought was in the accused’s mind at the
time of the criminal act.  In certain cases, subjective awareness of the
consequences can be inferred from the act itself, barring some explanation
casting doubt on such inference.  The fact that such an inference is made does
not detract from the subjectivity of the test.

 

1                        Professor
Don Stuart, in his very helpful text Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise
(3rd ed. 1995), at p. 194, sets out the principle in these words:

 

                   Where
the Criminal Code  definitions of an offence include a clear mens rea
word, such as “intentionally”, “wilfully”, “knowingly”, Parliament has made its
choice of the subjective test clear.

 

                   Where
the definition of the crime contains no mens rea words, and cannot be
interpreted as a crime of objective negligence, it should be interpreted as an
offence of subjective mens rea.  Decisions reading in subjective fault
requirements for drug offences and the former offence of rape are still
authoritative.  McLachlin J., who delivered the majority judgment in Creighton,
also authored the majority judgment in Theroux (1993) in which the Court
interpreted the ambiguous word “fraudulent” to require a subjective mens rea
requirement for theft and fraud.  In Clemente (1994) the Supreme Court
read into the offence of threatening to cause death or serious harm the
requirement of an intent to intimidate or instill fear or an intent to be taken
seriously.

 

                   The
only authority to the contrary is the Supreme Court in DeSousa, Creighton
and Godin reading in an objective rather than a subjective substantive
standard in interpreting crimes relying on so‑called predicate offences. 
This must surely be confined to that special category of offence.  The approach
of our courts to unlawful act manslaughter has long been objective at a time
when the established tradition has been to interpret other Criminal Code 
offences as requiring the subjective standard.

 

1                        He
then sets out the policy favouring subjective awareness in this manner (at
pp. 194-95):

 

It
best reflects the need for state punishment only when allowance has been made
for individual differences and all the circumstances.  For most Criminal Code 
offences it has proved to be a workable test.  The high conviction rate for
drug offences, which require subjective mens rea, is convincing evidence
that the subjective standard is not a recipe for lawlessness.  Triers of fact
are not duped by bogus defences. . . .

 

1                        I
am in substantial agreement with the position taken by Professor Stuart.  There
is nothing in the wording of s. 121(1) (c) or in the nature of the
crime the section describes which indicates that an objective assessment of the
mental element should be made.  Accordingly, it should be assessed
subjectively.  It might well be that in light of the importance of
s. 121(1) (c) the imposition of an objective standard of
blameworthiness based solely upon knowledge of the actus reus elements
of the offence could be achieved and readily justified.  However that would be
for Parliament to effect.

 

Recklessness

 

1                        Whether
or not an accused had the necessary subjective mens rea or mental state
of blameworthiness required to commit a specific crime can of course be
inferred from the actions and words of the accused.  It has been recognized by
this Court that the mental element for many offences is broadened or extended
by the concepts of recklessness and wilful blindness.  In Sansregret v. The
Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, McIntyre J. recognized the significance of the
concept of recklessness in determining whether the accused had the necessary
intent to commit the offence of rape.  At p. 582 he stated:

 

In
accordance with well‑established principles for the determination of
criminal liability, recklessness, to form a part of the criminal mens rea,
must have an element of the subjective.  It is found in the attitude of one
who, aware that there is danger that his conduct could bring about the result
prohibited by the criminal law, nevertheless persists, despite the risk.  It
is, in other words, the conduct of one who sees the risk and who takes the
chance.  It is in this sense that the term ‘recklessness’ is used in the
criminal law and it is clearly distinct from the concept of civil negligence.

 

1                        Further
in Théroux, supra, it was held that fraudulent conduct could
include recklessness in the sense of “knowledge of the likelihood of the
prohibited consequences” (p. 10).

 

Wilful Blindness

 

1                        The
mental requirement of the crime may also be satisfied by applying the concept
of wilful blindness.  Glanville Williams in his textbook Criminal Law:  The
General Part (2nd ed. 1961), at pp. 157-58, explained the wilful
blindness approach in these words:

 

. . .
the rule is that if a party has his suspicion aroused but then deliberately
omits to make further enquires, because he wishes to remain in ignorance, he is
deemed to have knowledge. . . .

 

In
other words, there is a suspicion which the defendant deliberately omits to
turn into certain knowledge.  This is frequently expressed by saying that he
“shut his eyes” to the fact, or that he was “wilfully blind.”

 

He observed that Lord Hewart C.J.
expressed it by saying that:

 

the
respondent deliberately refrained from making inquiries the result of which he
might not care to have.

 

1                        In
R. v. Jorgensen, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 55, at p. 111, Sopinka J. noted
that a finding of wilful blindness involves an affirmative answer to the question:
“Did the accused shut his eyes because he knew or strongly suspected that
looking would fix him with knowledge?”  He went on to state:  “The
determination must be made in light of all the circumstances.”

 

1                        In
Sansregret, supra, this Court held that the circumstances were
not restricted to those immediately surrounding a particular offence but could
be more broadly defined to include past events.  McIntyre J. distinguished
wilful blindness from recklessness and quoted with approval a passage from Glanville
Williams with regard to its application (at pp. 584 and 586):

 

                   Wilful
blindness is distinct from recklessness because, while recklessness involves
knowledge of a danger or risk and persistence in a course of conduct which
creates a risk that the prohibited result will occur, wilful blindness arises
where a person who has become aware of the need for some inquiry declines to
make the inquiry because he does not wish to know the truth.  He would prefer
to remain ignorant.  The culpability in recklessness is justified by
consciousness of the risk and by proceeding in the face of it, while in wilful
blindness it is justified by the accused’s fault in deliberately failing to
inquire when he knows there is reason for inquiry.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   The
rule that wilful blindness is equivalent to knowledge is essential, and is
found throughout the criminal law.  It is, at the same time, an unstable rule,
because judges are apt to forget its very limited scope.  A court can properly
find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said that the defendant
actually knew.  He suspected the fact; he realized its probability; but he
refrained from obtaining the final confirmation because he wanted in the event
to be able to deny knowledge.  This, and this alone, is wilful blindness.  It
requires in effect a finding that the defendant intended to cheat the
administration of justice.  Any wider definition would make the doctrine of
wilful blindness indistinguishable from the civil doctrine of negligence in not
obtaining knowledge.

 

1                        Although
this would seem to be a rather narrow approach to wilful blindness it certainly
can and should be applied in appropriate cases.  As Professor Don Stuart points
out in Canadian Criminal Law, supra,  there is no reason to
absolve those who are deliberately ignorant since a person who is deliberately
ignorant of a likely risk is sufficiently culpable.  At p. 212 he writes:

 

The
saga of Sansregret does not make one sanguine about the doctrine of
wilful blindness.  However, if we are careful to maintain the subjective test,
the extension to wilful blindness seems to be a sensible widening of the net. 
We should not absolve those who are deliberately ignorant.  This could be
applied as well to the concept of foresight or knowledge of consequences.  One
who is deliberately ignorant about a likely risk is sufficiently culpable.

 

I agree with these comments.  The
requisite mens rea for the crime can thus be established by
demonstrating that the accused had the requisite intent or was reckless or
wilfully blind.

 

What Then is the
Requisite Mental Element for s. 121(1) (c)?

 

1                        The
requisite acts or actus reus necessary to constitute the crime are
these:

 

(a)
the giving of a “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a
person having “dealings with the government”;

 

(b)
the receipt of the “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a
government employee; and

 

(c)
the absence of the consent of the government employee’s superior to the receipt
of the benefit.

 

The commission, reward, advantage
or benefit of any kind must consist of something of value which constituted a
profit to the employee and was derived at least in part from the employee’s
relation to or position with the government.

 

1                        In
my view the mental element of blameworthiness for s. 121(1) (c)
requires proof not only that the accused was aware or knew of the requisite
elements of the offence but also that he knew that he received the benefit at
least in part because of his position with the government; or that he was
wilfully blind to circumstances which would lead to that conclusion; or was
reckless as to the consequences of accepting the benefit without the consent
and permission of his superior, that is to say he was aware of the risk of his
actions breaching the subsection but nonetheless took the risk of proceeding in
that manner.

 

1                        Ample
evidence was adduced upon which a jury properly instructed could have found
Hinchey was guilty on any of these three bases.  First, the requisite mental
element could be established in this case as in others by considering the words
and actions of the accused in light of the surrounding circumstances.  For example,
neither the accused nor his wife was a friend of James Wall.  They did not
customarily exchange gifts. The benefit received was substantial, it was paid
somewhat surreptitiously and there was no work performed by the wife of the
accused for the “salary” she received.  The accused was aware of the benefit
received by his wife.  He knew that Wall was engaged in the construction of
roads for the province and that in his position as District Engineer he would
be dealing with Wall.  He attempted to mislead the investigators into believing
his wife had done work for Wall at his fox farm.  At no time did the accused
seek the consent of his employer to receive the benefit.

 

1                        Thus
the nature of the relationship between the accused and James Wall; the work
James Wall did for the province; the position of the accused as District
Engineer; the substantial amount of the benefit; the surreptitious payment of
the benefit to the wife of the accused; the attempt to mislead the
investigators all taken together would permit a reasonable jury to infer that
the accused knew that a benefit had been paid to him, at least in part because
of his position with the government, and without the consent of his employer. 
On that basis it would be open to the jury to convict.

 

1                        When
the requisite mens rea for s. 121(1) (c) is under
consideration in a case a number of factors will have to be taken into
account.  They may include:  the position in government held by the accused;
the business and social relationship existing between the accused and the
person paying the benefit; the amount and nature of the benefit; the manner in
which the benefit was paid:  for example were attempts made to disguise the
benefit?  Factors such as these when considered in the context of all the surrounding
circumstances can provide the basis for the finder of fact to properly infer
that the accused was aware of the requisite elements of the offence and that he
had received the benefit at least in part because of his position with the
government and enter a conviction.

 

1                        This
is the same pattern of reasoning that must be followed whenever the mental
element or mens rea of an offence must be established on a subjective
basis.  It is certainly not an untoward burden to place on the Crown.  Rather
it is the norm and is applicable whenever the offence requires a subjective
approach to be taken in determining the mental element of the crime.

 

1                        I
believe that the suggested approach to the mental element required by
s. 121(1) (c) is appropriate.  If the mental element were held to be
no more than knowledge of the actus reus then the acceptance of any
benefit could suffice to constitute the commission of the offence.  The section
could not have been designed to make a government clerk or secretary guilty of
a crime as a result of accepting an invitation to dinner or a ticket to a
hockey game from one known to do business with the government.  On the other
hand, a higher ranking government official who was for example responsible for
the procurement of products for the government and who regularly accepted
hockey tickets and dinners from a vendor of the products could well be on
dangerous ground.  There must be a way of distinguishing these situations and
that, I venture to say, is by taking into account the suggested mental element
of the offence.  Its application would ensure that only those for whom the
section was designed would come within its purview and yet ensure that this
important section could be readily applied in appropriate circumstances.

 

1                        Further,
the facts of this case present  a classic example of a situation where the
wilful blindness and recklessness of the accused very properly should be taken
into consideration.  This position is, I believe, similar to that correctly
taken by the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Rouleau (1984), 14 C.C.C.
(3d) 14.

 

1                        The
evidence presented in this case indicates that the actus reus of the
offence was established and there was strong and cogent evidence upon which a
jury properly instructed could find that the accused had the requisite intent
or was wilfully blind to the situation or was reckless as to the consequences
of his actions.  On any of these bases the mental element could have been
properly inferred and the accused could have properly been found guilty.  Unfortunately
the proper instructions were not given by the trial judge as to the requisite
intent.  Further on a number of other matters the trial judge erred in his
directions to the jury.  In addition the conduct of the trial was to say the
least unfortunate.

 

Errors in the
Charge

 

1                        With
regard to s. 121(1) (c) the trial judge ought to have instructed the
jury that the conduct necessary to constitute the offence included

 

(a)
the giving of a “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a person
having “dealings with the government”;

 

(b)
the receipt of the “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a
government employee; and

 

(c)
the absence of the consent of the government employee’s superior to the receipt
of the benefit.

 

and that the commission, reward,
advantage or benefit of any kind should be considered to consist of something
of value which constitutes a profit to the employee derived at least in part
from the employee’s position with the government.

 

1                        As
to the mental element, the trial judge should have instructed the jury that
based upon the words and actions of the accused they must be satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused had knowledge of the elements set out in (a),
(b) and (c) and that he knew that he was receiving the benefit at least in part
because of his position with the government.

 

1                        Next,
the jury should have been instructed that insofar as the mental element is
concerned they could also find the accused guilty if they were satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt that the accused had been reckless or wilfully blind.  With
respect to recklessness, the jury should have been told that if they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was aware that his conduct
could bring about the result prohibited by s. 121(1) (c) and
nevertheless persisted in that conduct, which is to say he was reckless as to
the consequences of his actions, it was open to them to find that the accused
was guilty.

 

1                        As
to wilful blindness, the jury should have been charged that having regard to
all of the surrounding circumstances, they could find the accused guilty if
they found that he was wilfully blind.  The phrase “wilful blindness” means
that the accused suspected that he was or would be guilty of an offence if he
persisted in his conduct but despite this suspicion he refused to make
inquiries that would confirm or deny his suspicions.  In other words,
notwithstanding his suspicions, he refused to ascertain the true state of
affairs and chose instead to remain wilfully blind because to make inquiries
would fix him with knowledge of the commission of the offence.

 

1                        In
summary, if the requisite actions or conduct were established and the jury was
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant possessed the requisite
intent or was reckless or wilfully blind as those terms have been described
they could convict the accused.

 

Did the Accused
Receive a Fair Trial?

 

1                        The
errors made by the trial judge and indeed the whole conduct of the trial have a
cumulative effect that makes it readily apparent that no other disposition than
that of a new trial would achieve a fair result.

 

1                        At
the outset it is important to remember that the Court of Appeal directed a new
trial with regard to the two counts of fraud.  In the course of their reasons
leading to that disposition the Court of Appeal stated (at pp. 232-33):

 

While
I do not intend to go into this aspect of the appeal in detail inasmuch as a
decision has already been reached as to disposition, the transcript clearly
demonstrates untoward interference with both counsel’s conduct of their
respective cases by the judge throughout the trial.  In the course of the
trial, which lasted over two weeks, the judge continually questioned counsel
(indeed “grilled” is perhaps a more apt description) both prior to and during
the examination of many witnesses as to the form and nature of the evidence to
be given.  On at least eight occasions the judge suspended the proceedings,
excused the jury and of his own volition entered into what he termed as voir
dires for that purpose.  He clearly attempted to influence the manner in which
both counsel were presenting their respective cases.

 

1                        Further,
the Court of Appeal with regard to the fraud charges made observations which I
think are equally applicable to the charge under s. 121(1) (c) (at
p. 232):

 

                   Throughout
his charge, the trial judge clearly gives the impression that the case totally
hinged on the credibility of the two accused.  He also made it very clear that
he did not believe their testimony and, again, that such lack of credibility
may be equated with their dishonest intent to carry out the alleged acts and,
further, as proof of their dishonest conduct throughout.

 

1                        In
my view these comments must be as applicable to the charge under
s. 121(1) (c) as they were to the two fraud charges.

 

1                        Further,
the trial judge referred to one juror as a “lunkhead” and suggested that
another may be “a bitter man”.  Those comments in themselves cast a cloud over
the proceedings.  A review of the transcripts makes it apparent that the
proceedings were more in the nature of an ordeal than a trial.  Certainly they
indicate that the accused could not have received a fair trial.

 

1                        In
addition, the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury with regard to
character evidence.  The issue of credibility was vital to the resolution of
the case.  The trial judge ought to have given directions as to character
evidence and the manner in which it should be considered.  This was
particularly true in light of the derogatory comments made by the Crown in its
closing address regarding the character evidence called on behalf of the
accused.  The jury should have been instructed that character evidence may be
of assistance not only in assessing the credibility of the accused but also
that it was relevant to show that it was improbable that the accused would have
committed the crime.  See R. v. Logiacco (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 374
(Ont. C.A.).  There it was said at p. 378:

 

                   It
can be seen that the charge was correct in its reference to the use the jury
might make of the character evidence in considering the credibility of the
accused.  Unfortunately, it failed to make reference to the important principle
that the jury could also use the character evidence as the basis for an
inference that the appellant was not likely to have committed the crime
charged. . . .

 

                   A
direction with regard to this principle was essential in this case as the issue
of credibility was crucial.

 

1                        There
was a complete failure to instruct the jury with regard to the use of the
character evidence which was presented.  This testimony was of vital importance
to the defence since it was the position of Morgan Hinchey that he had no
intention of doing anything improper or illegal and that he made every effort
to ensure that his wife was legitimately employed.  No matter how tenuous that
position might seem to be it remains that the credibility of Hinchey was
fundamentally important to his defence.  It follows that the failure to refer
to this evidence and instruct the jury with regard to the use that could be
made of it adversely affected the fairness of the trial.  Indeed it has been
held that the failure of a trial judge to properly instruct the jury with
regard to character evidence is a serious misdirection or non‑direction
of such gravity that it cannot be rectified by the curative provisions of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii).  See R. v. Tarrant (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d)
385 (Ont. C.A.).

 

1                        Unfortunately
I cannot agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that any errors with
respect to s. 121(1) (c) made by the trial judge could be cured
pursuant to s. 686(1) (b)(iii).  The errors of the trial judge and
his conduct of the proceedings particularly when viewed cumulatively make it
impossible to apply the curative provisions of that section.  The general
conduct of the trial was such that any reasonable bystander would conclude that
the accused could not have had a fair trial.  See R. v. Pouliot, [1993]
1 S.C.R. 456, approving the dissenting reasons of Fish J.A. (1992), 74 C.C.C.
(3d) 428, at pp. 448‑49.
