2769281,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Fung [2016] NSWSC 522,"Judgment


	
	These are proceedings seeking restraining orders under s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). The restraining orders now sought concern the property described in schedules two and three of the Summons, being amounts of cash.
	
	
	Under s 19 a court with proceeds jurisdiction must order that property must not be disposed of in accordance with sub-s (1) of s 19 if certain conditions are met. The conditions are that it is a proceeds of crime authority that applies for the order, that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is derived from one of the types of offences referred to in s 19(1)(d), that there is an affidavit from an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the property is the proceeds of the offence or if the offence is a serious offence that the property is an instrument of the offence, and that the court is satisfied that the officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.
	
	
	In the present case, I am satisfied that the requirements of s 19 have been met. The application is made by a proceeds of crime authority, being the Commissioner of the AFP. The property concerned is demonstrated by the affidavit of the authorised officer to be the proceeds of an indictable offence or as an instrument of a serious offence, that is the offence with which two persons have been charged, namely an offence contrary to s 400.4(2) of the schedule to the Criminal Code. That is an offence relevantly of dealing with money that is the proceeds of crime and at the time the value of the money was AUD100,000 or more.
	
	
	There is an affidavit from an authorised officer, Jodie Earl, setting out the officer’s suspicion that the property is the proceeds of the offence mentioned. I am satisfied from reading that affidavit that the suspicion that the authorised officer has is reasonably held.
	
	
	The present proceedings have named a Defendant. Mr Lloyd appears for that Defendant. He has sought effectively that the restraining orders now sought should not be made in the same proceedings that led to the making of restraining orders by Wilson J on 6 April in relation to a motor vehicle referred to in schedule one to the summons. The basis for suggesting that the matter should be separated derives from the criminal proceedings which have been instituted against the Defendant. In that regard Mr Lloyd points to the naming of Mr Fung as a Defendant in these proceedings when , on his instructions, the cash seized does not belong to the Defendant.
	
	
	The proceedings named the Defendant because the restraining order in relation to the car was sought pursuant to s 18 of the Act. The Defendant was the owner of the car. Were the proceedings only to involve the cash seized the proceedings would have been ex parte proceedings under s 19. I can see no prejudice to the Defendant arising out of the criminal proceedings from the present restraining orders being made in the same proceedings that the restraining order was made in respect in respect of the motor vehicle.
	
	
	The Plaintiff seeks leave to amend paragraph 5 of the summons filed so that the reference to schedule 2 is a reference to schedule 3. Leave is granted in that respect.
	
	
	The Plaintiff also seeks orders under s 38 of the Act that the official trustee take custody and control of the property. In the light of the nature of the property and what is contained in Ms Earl’s affidavit I consider that orders under s 38 should be made.

2769282,Anderson v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 86,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: Mr Ronald Anderson appeals from a continuing detention order made by the primary judge on 18 December 2015 pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act): State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1970. Save for the two month period from 17 October until 18 December 2015, Mr Anderson has been imprisoned continuously for more than twenty years. In fact he has spent most of the last three decades in prison. He is 51 years old. His criminal record was accurately described by the primary judge as horrendous, and is set out in more detail below.
	
	
	Speaking generally, the Act required the primary judge to be satisfied of two matters before a continuing detention order might be made. The first was that Mr Anderson posed an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he was not kept under supervision. The second was that adequate supervision would not be provided by an extended supervision order. The form of the supervision order which was proposed by the State and accepted by Mr Anderson is described in more detail below. It imposed significant limitations on his liberty.
	
	
	We have concluded, in accordance with Mr Anderson’s submissions, that the primary judge’s reasons disclose error in the way they dealt with the second of those two matters. Her Honour failed to have regard to a report which the Act made mandatory. More generally, her Honour focussed on the risk posed if Mr Anderson were not supervised and did not adequately evaluate the extent to which the proposed conditions would be effective in reducing that risk, which is required by s 5D of the Act. We have also accepted the State’s submission that this Court should not itself determine whether a continuing detention order should be made, on the basis that the State wishes to provide up-to-date psychiatric evidence (the existing expert opinions are some nine and five months old, and accordingly do not have regard to the most recent conduct of Mr Anderson). For those reasons, we have concluded that the continuing detention order must be set aside, and the State’s application must be remitted. However, we have accepted Mr Anderson’s submission that in the meantime, an interim supervision order should be made, as was previously the position.
	
	
	We wish to add two introductory observations. The first is that the result of the orders we propose will be that there has not yet been a determination in accordance with law of the question whether Mr Anderson should be subject to a continuing detention order. For that reason, these reasons do not in a fully detailed way summarise the evidence bearing upon the risks posed by Mr Anderson’s release from custody and the adequacy of the supervision orders. We are conscious of the fact that this decision is, in a very real respect, interim, and that another judge will have to determine the question on a final basis and on different (and in all probability better) evidence in the imminent future. That judge should not consider himself or herself bound by the necessarily abbreviated descriptions of the evidence we have used in these reasons.
	
	
	The second is that we would infer that one reason, perhaps the principal reason, for the errors in the decision of the primary judge was the pressure of time to which her Honour was subjected. The primary judge dealt with a large body of material and produced a lengthy judgment only four days later, at the close of the Law Term, which is typically the busiest period of the year. Applications under the Act are very important to the victims of an offender and their families, to the potential victims of the offender and their families, to the wider community, and to the offender and his or her family. Many such applications – and we would regard the present litigation as an example – involve a very difficult decision by a judge. It is in the interests of everyone that such applications not be resolved in circumstances of unnecessary urgency.
	


Procedural history of the litigation


	
	Mr Anderson was due to be released on Saturday 17 October 2015, following a total effective sentence of 13 years. An application for an extended supervision order under s 5C or a continuing detention order under s 5D of the Act could be made at any time after 17 April 2015: ss 6(2) and 13B(3). The State’s summons was not filed until 6 October 2015. As well as orders for psychiatric examination and interim detention, the State’s summons sought final orders of a continuing detention order for 12 months, followed by an extended supervision order for a period of five years. The summons was listed for directions on Friday 9 October 2015, and for a hearing on Monday 12 October 2015.
	
	
	On Thursday 15 October 2015, Hamill J made orders for psychiatric examination and that Mr Anderson be subject to an interim supervision order for a period of 28 days: State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1515. The interim supervision order was extended for two further periods of 28 days, first by Adams J on 11 November 2015: [2015] NSWSC 1679, and subsequently by Schmidt J on 8 December 2015: [2015] NSWSC 1871.
	
	
	The State’s summons was listed for final hearing before the primary judge on Monday 14 December 2015. The existing interim supervision order expired on 6 January 2016. Moreover, s 10C(2) prevented that order from being renewed for any period after 14 January 2016. The primary judge was, accordingly, obliged to determine the application on a final basis with a high degree of urgency.
	
	
	Three psychiatric experts were cross-examined at the final hearing: Dr Furst, on his 3 August 2015 report, and Drs Ellis and O’Dea, the two psychiatrists who examined Mr Anderson pursuant to the orders made by Hamill J. The State tendered in excess of 1000 pages of material, and written submissions in excess of 200 paragraphs. The latter were clearly excessive and placed an unnecessary burden on the primary judge. 
	
	
	Before turning to the reasons of the primary judge, it is convenient to address the structure of the Act.
	


The structure of the Act


	
	The Act is premised upon the proposition that there is a class of offenders who have been convicted of serious crimes and have served the entirety of their sentences of imprisonment, but who, even so, should not enjoy unconditional liberty in the community, because of the risks of reoffending. The Act identifies “high risk sex offenders” and “high risk violent offenders” (those two classes are not mutually exclusive). Speaking generally, the Act treats each of those classes of people in the same way. Orders were sought against Mr Anderson on the basis that he was a high risk sex offender, and it was common ground that he was such.
	
	
	The Act requires applications for extended supervision orders and continuing detention orders to include a report prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner assessing the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence or serious violence offence, as the case may be: ss 6(3) and 14(3). To that end the Act requires there to be a preliminary hearing, at which the Court may appoint two such psychiatrists, psychologists or medical practitioners to conduct separate examinations: ss 7(4) and 15(4). The Act also authorises the making of interim supervision (ss 10A and 10B) and interim detention orders (ss 18A and 18B). Strict time limits are imposed by the Act. In particular, an interim order may only be made for a period of 28 days, and may only be extended for a period not exceeding three months.
	
	
	In relation to the final orders which are the subject of the present appeal, ss 5B, 5C and 5D are central.
	


“5B High risk sex offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2) An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.

5C Extended supervision orders for high risk sex offenders

(1) The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2) An order made under this section is an extended supervision order.

(3) An extended supervision order made under this section may also be referred to as a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.

5D Continuing detention orders for high risk sex offenders

(1) The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the detention of an offender if the offender is a high risk sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.

(2) An order made under this section is a continuing detention order.

(3) A continuing detention order made under this section may also be referred to as a high risk sex offender continuing detention order.”


	
	It suffices in order to summarise and resolve the essential submissions which arise on this appeal to observe that ss 5B and 5D mandate a two stage process. The first question is that posed by s 5B, which is whether the person is a high risk sex offender. This entails the Court being satisfied, to a high standard, that the offender would pose an “unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision”. Only if the answer to that question is affirmative can there be power to make either a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order.
	
	
	The second question only arises if the person is a high risk sex offender. It is the question posed by s 5D, which is whether the Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. If the answer to that question is affirmative, then there is power to make a continuing detention order. (For the purposes of this appeal, we put to one side the separate discretion whether to make a continuing detention order at all, discussed in State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280 at [14]-[15].)
	
	
	There are at least four important differences between the questions posed by ss 5B and 5D. The first two differences flow directly from the text of the statute. One is that the Act requires a different level of satisfaction to be achieved in relation to the first, as opposed to the second. Another is that the second question is only reached in the event that the first question has been answered affirmatively.
	
	
	A third is that it is established that the test of “adequate supervision” in s 5D is not “anchored” to an assessment of “unacceptable risk”, but involves a wider ranging inquiry, including having regard to the secondary purpose of the Act of encouraging rehabilitation: see State of New South Wales v Donovan.
	
	
	A fourth is that there is a wide range of conditions which could be imposed by an extended supervision order, so that the issue posed by s 5D also involves considering a range of conditions and whether if imposed they would constitute adequate supervision: see Lynn v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 57.
	
	
	Finally, an appeal lies from the making of or the refusal to make an order. There is no occasion in this appeal to address the nature of that appeal. The parties proceeded on the basis that it was necessary for Mr Anderson to establish legal error.
	


The decision of the primary judge


	
	Although the matter was listed for two days, the hearing completed at the end of the first day, and her Honour advised the parties that she would list the proceedings for judgment on Friday 18 December 2015. On that day, her Honour delivered reasons of 164 paragraphs, and made a continuing detention order for a period of 12 months, followed by an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years commencing from the date of the expiry of the continuing detention order. Mr Anderson appeals only from the continuing detention order. At all times, he has consented to the imposition of an extended supervision order, in the terms sought by the State, a copy of which is contained in the Schedule to this judgment.
	


Two minor matters


	
	Two minor matters may be mentioned about the judgment. The first is that, owing to a typographical correction which did not alter the substance of the judgment, the paragraph numbering of the judgment as delivered to the parties differs from that made available on Caselaw. The difference is a single paragraph. In what follows, we shall refer to the paragraph numbering in the version on Caselaw.
	
	
	The second is that her Honour made a further order (order 4) to the effect that reports be provided to Corrective Services officers. That order reflected what was conceded to be an error in the final relief sought in the State’s summons. An order of this nature is appropriate in a preliminary application under the Act, but is not called for when final orders are made.
	
	
	Nothing substantive turns on either matter, although both are consistent with the urgency which attended to the preparation and delivery of the judgment.
	


The opening section of the judgment


	
	Her Honour dealt with the procedural history of the litigation at [1]-[7], and the statutory framework at [8]-[26]. Notwithstanding the concession by Mr Anderson, it remained essential for her Honour to be “satisfied to a high degree of probability” that Mr Anderson met the elements of the definition of a “high risk sex offender” pursuant to s 5B. Her Honour appreciated as much, and said at [25]:
	


“There is no real dispute that the defendant is a high risk sex offender, and I am satisfied of that to the high standard specified by s 5B(2) of the Act.”

That conclusion was not challenged on appeal.


	
	Given that Mr Anderson consented to the making of an extended supervision order, and there was no dispute about any of the conditions attaching to such order, the critical issue was that posed by s 5D. Her Honour correctly identified the substantial question arising from s 5D(1) at [26]:
	


“The question is whether a continuing detention order is necessary for the safety and protection of the community, as the State contends, or whether, as the defendant submits, the Court should find that an extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision of the defendant, and ensure the community’s protection.”


	
	Her Honour then dealt with Mr Anderson’s personal circumstances and his history of criminal offending at [27]-[89], and the evidence of his response to the interim supervision order in force over the preceding eight weeks at [90]-[100]. Her Honour dealt in some detail with the psychiatric evidence of the three psychiatrists who were cross-examined, at [101]-[142].
	


The final section of the judgment


	
	The final section of her Honour’s judgment is the section of greatest importance for the purposes of this appeal. It was headed “Is Supervision Enough?” That section was introduced by [143]:
	


“The principal question for the Court to determine is whether adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order, such that a CDO should be made, as sought by the State. There is no issue that the defendant meets the threshold criteria in the Act and is a ‘high risk sex offender’: s 5C(1). The issue that is in dispute is whether that risk can be managed in the community, formally, the question posed by s 5D(1).”


	
	In [144], her Honour anticipated the conclusion, stating that:
	


“Having carefully, indeed anxiously, considered all of the evidence, I am not satisfied that supervision in the community pursuant to an ESO is adequate.”


	
	At the conclusion of that section, in [162]-[163], her Honour reiterated her conclusion on the issue posed by s 5D(1) as follows:
	


“Having considered the evidence before the Court, and having had regard to the matters referred to in s 17(4) of the Act, I am satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.

Accordingly, I intend to make the orders sought by the State.”

Section 17(4) identifies 13 matters to which “the Supreme Court must have regard” in determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or extended supervision order.


	
	The intervening paragraphs, [145]-[161], are directed, in terms, to the risk posed by Mr Anderson in the event that his release is unsupervised. We have found it convenient in what follows to anticipate the submissions made by Mr Anderson on appeal when describing the paragraphs in this section of the judgment.
	
	
	Paragraph 145 is directed to a serious risk of reoffending posed by Mr Anderson in light of his lengthy criminal history and his failure to respond to “any form of restraint and supervision imposed upon him”. This is undoubtedly linked to the question posed by s 5D, but as we read her Honour’s reasons, the reference was to his breach of parole and bail in 1994. Nothing was said about the considerably more intrusive regime contemplated by the extended supervision order in 2015.
	
	
	Paragraph 146 referred to risk assessments based on static and dynamic factors, and paragraph 147 to the weight of the psychiatric evidence; neither paragraph referred to supervision at all. Paragraph 148 referred to Mr Anderson’s substance abuse disorder, and the fact that relapse by him could lead to catastrophic results. But again there was no analysis of the effect of the extended supervision order upon the risk of relapse.
	
	
	Paragraphs 149 and 150 referred to Mr Anderson’s lack of insight into his sexual offending, and 151 to what was said to be a refusal fully to engage in rehabilitative programmes, which were said to add to the risk posed by him and “points to his continuing non-compliance”. Again, these paragraphs did not mention the conditions of the proposed supervision order.
	
	
	Paragraphs 152 and 153 referred to the extended period of supervised parole envisaged by the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2002. Both paragraphs pointed to the risk of Mr Anderson being unable to cope without resort to drug use or other unproductive and risky behaviour, and the risk of an angry or violent response to the slights and injuries of daily life. But neither paragraph addressed the impact of the conditions of the proposed extended supervision order (such as the prohibition on the use or possession of drugs, and the random drug tests, to which he would be subject) upon that risk, nor did either paragraph make mention of the consequences of a breach of a condition of an extended supervision order (which are much more serious than those following a breach of a condition of parole).
	
	
	Paragraph 154 referred to Mr Anderson’s use of drugs in October 2015, which “[indicated] clearly his continuing inability to comply with prohibitions on drug use, and remain drug-free” and emphasised the risks of a relapse into drug use, but again made no assessment of the impact of the terms of the proposed supervision order.
	
	
	Paragraph 155 is the only paragraph in this section of the reasons (aside from the introduction and concluding paragraphs) which expressly refers to “adequate supervision”. It is as follows:
	


“The defendant’s compliance with the ISO is a positive feature of his case which he relies upon to argue that an ESO will provide adequate supervision for him and adequate protection for the community. Whilst I do not dismiss his positive conduct lightly, and am concerned at possibly halting or adversely affecting the defendant’s rehabilitation, I have viewed his period of compliant conduct and positive work history in light of three factors. They are, the longstanding and apparently deeply entrenched nature of the defendant’s anti-social conduct; the treatment resistant nature of the disorders from which he suffers; and the defendant’s well documented capacity to present an acceptable, if completely superficial, self-image to others when he thinks there is benefit to him. I am very troubled by the likelihood that the defendant’s recent compliance is no more than a manifestation of his desire to remain out of custody, and would evaporate as soon as that end had been achieved by this Court making an ESO.”


	
	Paragraphs 156 and 157 differentiated between custody based, and community based, rehabilitation, and did not address the adequacy of the supervision order.
	
	
	Finally, paragraphs 158-161, which conclude the section of the reasons entitled “Is Supervision Enough”, were directed exclusively to the risk of harm if Mr Anderson were released without supervision:
	


“158 The defendant has demonstrated a capacity to sexually offend in a most serious way, without regard to legal restraint or the restraints of common humanity, with disastrous and likely life-long consequences for his victim.

159 The gravity of the consequences of the risk posed by the defendant manifesting is very high indeed. Even if the risk of the defendant committing a serious sexual offence may be low, it has been recognised that a defendant may nevertheless pose an unacceptable risk pursuant to the statutory test: State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [94]; State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 at [16].

160 The test in s 5B(2) is satisfied if there is a risk that the defendant will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order for the defendant’s continuing detention is made: State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) at [20]; State of New South Wales v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 307 at [56]- [58]; State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 588 at [30]; State of New South Wales v KAS [2012] NSWSC 1139 at [6].

161 Whilst his eight weeks of liberty gives some indication that the risk posed by the defendant may not manifest, there is a solid body of evidence of much more deeply entrenched and long lasting anti-social behaviour that suggests the contrary conclusion.”

Grounds of appeal


	
	The amended grounds of appeal were all directed in various ways to the primary judge’s assessment of whether adequate supervision would be provided by the extended supervision order. It is not necessary to identify each of the grounds, which in any event overlapped. It suffices to identify two aspects of Mr Anderson’s challenge, which were at the forefront of both parties’ submissions. The first is a failure to address the issue of adequate supervision posed by s 5D. The second is a failure to have adequate regard, pursuant to s 17(4)(d1), to the risk management report prepared by Mr Makar.
	
	
	The principal point made by Mr Anderson was that in the dispositive paragraphs, [145]-[161], there was no substantial attention directed to the adequacy of the supervision that would be provided by the extended supervision order. Mr Johnston SC, who appeared with Mr Coady for the appellant, contrasted the questions posed by ss 5B and 5D and submitted:
	


“In effect, when one goes through the reasons that her Honour provides at [144] through to [164], it would appear ... that what her Honour is doing is making that evaluation of both factors at the same time and doesn’t adequately separate the two considerations.”


	
	Mr Johnston drew attention to the analysis which Hamill J had given to Mr Makar’s risk management report, to the evidence about how compliance with the conditions imposed by an extended supervision order was monitored and the incentives upon Mr Anderson to comply with the terms of a supervision order. His Honour concluded, taking into account the “onerous conditions and quasi-custodial nature of the supervision and accommodation” imposed by the proposed interim supervision order, that the imposition of such order would achieve the primary objective of the Act. Indeed, the greater part of his Honour’s judgment (at [28]-[48]) dealt with these matters.
	
	
	In contrast, Mr Johnston observed that the primary judge did not mention Mr Makar’s report in terms at all. Mr Makar’s report was, as Mr Kell, who appeared with Ms Phillips for the State, conceded, a mandatory relevant consideration by reason of s 17(4)(d1).
	
	
	More substantively, Mr Johnston observed that nowhere was there consideration of the impact of any of the proposed conditions of supervision. As it was put in oral address:
	


“[T]here just is no consideration of the conditions of the ESO, and the evidence that was relied upon both by the State and referred to in the submissions of the defence as to the adequacy of those conditions.”


	
	Those conditions were onerous. They were 53 numbered obligations, many of which turned upon the discretion of a Departmental Supervising Officer or “DSO”. The conditions included the following (which is not exhaustive).
	
	
	Electronic monitoring and reporting: Mr Anderson must wear electronic monitoring equipment as directed by his DSO. This equipment consists of a securely fitted anklet which identifies its wearer’s location using Radio Frequency (RF), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile (GSM) technologies. There was evidence that:
	


“The anklet is customised to the size of [the] offender’s ankle. It is made of grey plastic on the outside, is about the size of a large digital watch, is light in weight and is waterproof. The anklet is reinforced with steel bands and Kevlar which make it difficult to remove without the use of a special unlocking device. Once secured, if attempts to remove or damage the anklet are made, an alarm will be sent to EEMG staff.”


	
	Without descending into unnecessary detail, the system enables monitoring of Mr Anderson’s location 24 hours a day 7 days a week, with a capacity to initiate an alarm if he (say) did not adhere to the curfew or attended a location prohibited by his DSO (for example, a local bottle shop or hotel). Mr Anderson must report to his DSO as directed.
	
	
	Schedule of movements: Mr Anderson must provide if asked a weekly plan of his movements three days before it is due to start, must give 24 hours’ notice of any change in his schedule of movements and must not deviate from that schedule except in an emergency.
	
	
	Accommodation: Mr Anderson must live at an approved address and must be at that approved address between 9pm and 6am each day unless some other arrangement is approved by his DSO. Mr Anderson must not permit any other person to enter and remain, or stay overnight, at that address without the DSO’s prior approval.
	
	
	Drugs and alcohol: Mr Anderson must not possess or use alcohol or illegal drugs or prescription medication other than as prescribed, must submit to drug and alcohol testing as directed by his DSO, must not enter any licensed premises without his DSO’s approval, and must attend and participate in programmes and courses for drug and alcohol rehabilitation as directed by his DSO. He must not discharge himself from such programmes and courses without the prior approval of the DSO.
	
	
	Non-association:  Mr Anderson must not associate with people consuming or under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. If Mr Anderson starts a relationship, he is required to tell his DSO, who in turn may tell the person about Mr Anderson’s criminal history. He must not join any internet or mobile based social networking scheme without first obtaining the written permission of his DSO.
	
	
	Weapons: Mr Anderson must not possess or use any firearm, and must not carry on his person at any time after leaving his residence any knife or other cutting instrument or any rope, cord, cable ties, or other instrument of restraint.
	
	
	Communications: Mr Anderson must give his DSO a list of all communication devices, including phones, tablets, and computers, must obey any reasonable directions about the use of those devices, and must authorise his telephone and internet service providers to share information with his DSO about his accounts.
	
	
	Search and seizure: Mr Anderson must submit to a wide range of searches and inspections of his person and premises by his DSO and must allow his DSO to seize anything which, inter alia, the DSO reasonably suspects will compromise his compliance with the extended supervision order or which his DSO reasonably suspects relates to behaviour or conduct associated with an increased risk of committing a serious offence.
	
	
	Personal details and appearance: Mr Anderson must not change his name, use any other name, or change his appearance without the approval of his DSO, and must let Corrective Services photograph him.
	
	
	Medical intervention: Mr Anderson must advise his DSO of any healthcare practitioners that he consults and must agree to those practitioners sharing information, including reports on his progress and information he has told them, with each other and with his DSO. He must attend all psychological and psychiatric assessments, therapy, support and treatment that his DSO tells him to attend. That information is to be shared between all agencies involved in his supervision. If Mr Anderson ceases to take medication that he has been prescribed he is to notify his DSO within 24 hours.
	
	
	The regime consequent upon the making of an extended supervision order has three other important features. If Mr Anderson fails to comply with the requirements of the extended supervision order, he is guilty of an offence under s 12. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years or 500 penalty units, or both. Moreover, he would then become a “supervised sex offender” and may be made subject to a further application for a continuing detention order pursuant to s 13B. Finally, Div 3A confers power upon the Supreme Court to make “emergency detention orders” for the detention of an offender who is the subject of an extended supervision order, or an interim supervision order, who, because of altered circumstances, cannot be provided with adequate supervision, and who, without adequate supervision, poses an imminent risk of committing a serious offence.
	


Failure to address adequate supervision


	
	On one view, her Honour formed the opinion that Mr Anderson’s criminal history, his past contravention of parole and bail conditions, and his limited engagement in rehabilitation programmes in custody, coupled with the institutional misconduct charges accumulated in custody, meant that he would not adhere to the terms of any extended supervision order with the result that it was not necessary for her Honour to address the particular conditions proposed by the State. To the extent that that is the basis of the decision, it emerges most clearly from [155] which is reproduced above; it may perhaps also appear in [145]. However, even so we do not think that the evaluation of adequate supervision required by s 5D has occurred. For one thing, the fact that her Honour made an extended supervision order for five years commencing at the conclusion of the continuing detention order might suggest that her Honour was satisfied that after twelve months additional detention, adequate supervision would be provided, although her Honour’s reasons do not deal with this issue.
	
	
	If it were the case that Mr Anderson’s recent good conduct were motivated by the reality that any breach would lead to his imprisonment, then at least on one view that is supportive of the making of an extended supervision order. What is absent from [155] is an analysis of how the regime imposed by an extended supervision order would cause Mr Anderson’s recent compliance to “evaporate”. It will be seen in what follows when we address the expert evidence that even Dr Furst, who held the strongest views in favour of a continuing detention order, acknowledged that an extended supervision order would provide a “moderate” motivator to Mr Anderson to comply, while the other expert evidence was more optimistic.
	
	
	What is more, none of the 53 conditions proposed in the extended supervision order is mentioned in this section of the judgment. No mention is made of the impact those conditions will have on the aspects of Mr Anderson’s behaviour which pose a risk to the community. No mention is made of the consequences to Mr Anderson of their breach. To the contrary, this portion of her Honour’s reasons, fairly read, is directed to reasoning supporting a conclusion that the unsupervised risk posed by Mr Anderson’s return to the community is unacceptable. As it was put in argument:
	


“BATHURST CJ: The problem, putting it in colloquial terms and not nearly as eloquently as the President put to you, is that on one view, her Honour paid a great deal of attention to all the risks but not much to what was being proposed to avert it and particularly the Makar report.

KELL: Yes.

BATHURST CJ: That’s the difficulty, isn’t it?”


	
	It will be clear from the foregoing that there was no answer to that difficulty. The clear differentiation made by the Act between an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if unsupervised and adequate supervision does not appear in the reasons. It follows that material error is disclosed.
	


Failure to have regard to the risk assessment report from Corrective Services


	
	We would also reject the State’s submission that it should be inferred that her Honour had regard to the risk assessment from Corrective Services (the report prepared by Mr Makar), even though it is not mentioned in her Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	The starting point is that the reasons which are actually stated are to be understood, on appeal, as recording the steps that were in fact taken by the primary judge in arriving at the end result: The Waterways Authority v Fitzgibbon [2005] HCA 57; 79 ALJR 1816 at [130]. It is true that the primary judge said that she had considered all the evidence, and had had regard to the matters referred to in s 17(4).
	
	
	The obligation imposed by s 17(4)(d1) was that “the Supreme Court must have regard to ... any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community.” That imposed an obligation to have regard to the contents of the Makar report, which expressed views on the extent to which Mr Anderson could be managed in the community as opposed to in custody. Those were matters which went directly to the question of adequate supervision posed by s 5D.
	
	
	It could not be said that the report was prominent in the materials with which her Honour was burdened. It was to be found in the fifth lever arch folder of materials, behind tab 246, as is indicated by footnote 82 to paragraph 159 of the State’s written submissions to the primary judge.
	
	
	If the primary judge had considered the contents of the report, it would be expected that its contents would have been reflected in her Honour’s reasons. It would also be expected that there would be an account of whether her Honour agreed or disagreed with the views expressed in it. It is to be borne in mind that the report dealt squarely with the central issue posed by s 5D of adequate supervision.
	
	
	The report is a document of 16 pages. It identifies risks posed by Mr Anderson’s release from prison, and the measures which could be taken to address those risks. For example, there is extensive information about the nature and effectiveness of the electronic monitoring. There is no need to summarise the report in its entirety for present purposes. We take, by way of example, the matter which (because her Honour referred to it repeatedly in her judgment: see [67], [88], [147], [148] and [154]) was regarded as being of considerable significance: the risk posed by Mr Anderson relapsing into drug use.
	
	
	The risk of Mr Anderson relapsing into drug use was clearly identified in the report. The management strategy stated:
	


“• Mr Anderson to engage with a treatment provider in order to maintain treatment gains made.

• Community Corrections would ensure contact is maintained with any such treatment provider and it is envisaged that Mr Anderson’s progress would be regularly discussed.

• Mr Anderson would be subject to random urinalysis and targeted testing for alcohol use.

• Mr Anderson may be mandated to participate in treatment in a residential rehabilitation facility should he relapse into illicit substance use.”


	
	The report went on to indicate the limitations of that management strategy and the risks which remained. We do not for a moment consider that the proposed management strategy is necessarily a fool proof answer to the risks posed by Mr Anderson’s return to the community, and would readily acknowledge that some measure of risk remains, as did Mr Makar. However, the point of present relevance is that the reasons of the primary judge disclose no analysis of the effectiveness of the measures proposed to be put in place to manage the risk posed by Mr Anderson relapsing into substance abuse as discussed in the report. The failure to do so strengthens the inference that in fact the report was not taken into account.
	
	
	Given the volume of material, the placement of Mr Makar’s report within that volume of material, the centrality of its contents, and the urgency with which the decision was required, we are not persuaded that consideration was given to the report as was required by the Act. Accordingly, we would conclude that this ground of appeal is also made out.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, the appeal must be allowed. By way of summary, we have concluded that the existing continuing detention order was made without a proper evaluation of whether adequate supervision would be provided by an extended supervision order in the terms propounded by the State and accepted by Mr Anderson. We have also concluded that it was made without consideration of the report prepared by Corrective Services NSW for that very purpose, contrary to the requirement of the Act.
	
	
	The question then arises as to the course which should be taken by this Court.
	


Should the application be remitted?


	
	Mr Anderson submitted that this Court should, on the evidence before it, be satisfied that the extended supervision order to which he consented would provide adequate supervision for the purposes of s 5D, so as to avoid the need for a remitter. The State, however, submitted that “there should be a remittal of the proceeding for a number of reasons, including that there isn’t the current up-to-date evidence of the psychiatric opinion”.
	
	
	We agree with the State. By reason of s 75A(6) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), this Court has both the powers and the duties of the court at first instance, including making findings of fact, pursuant to s 5D. In determining whether adequate supervision would be provided by an extended supervision order, this Court is therefore required, by s 17(4)(b), to have regard inter alia to the reports prepared by qualified psychiatrists in relation to Mr Anderson. The evident intent of the mandatory regime for the conducting of psychiatric examinations shortly before the making of any order is for the Court to have the benefit of up-to-date assessments of the offender. The psychiatric opinions presently available are some five months out of date. Further, those opinions do not have regard to the whole of the period prior to 18 December 2015 during which Mr Anderson enjoyed conditional liberty, nor to his conduct in detention from 18 December 2015 to date. In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court would be assisted by expert opinion on the question whether Mr Anderson’s exemplary behaviour when released on an interim supervision order late last year was merely temporary or was likely to be sustained in the longer term.
	
	
	In our view, the issues are too important – for Mr Anderson, his mother and sister, as well as for his victims and the broader community – to be determined on a final basis on out-of-date information, without the benefit of up-to-date psychiatric opinion. The State’s application for a continuing detention order should be remitted for determination in accordance with law. The orders which we propose will oblige Mr Anderson to attend all psychological and psychiatric assessments as directed by his DSO, which will enable the updated reports sought by the State to be obtained.
	


What interim orders should be made?


	
	The final question is what order should be made pending the determination of the State’s application for a continuing detention order. Here, again, the parties were divided. Mr Anderson submitted that there should be an interim supervision order, as had been made by Hamill J and continued by consent on two subsequent occasions. The State asked this Court to make an interim detention order.
	
	
	The power to make the interim detention order sought by the State is conferred by s 18A, and the power to make the interim supervision order sought by Mr Anderson is conferred by s 10A. Both sections are made applicable to this Court on appeal by subss 75A(6) and (10) of the Supreme Court Act. The sections are as follows:
	


“18A Interim detention order–high risk sex offender

The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim detention of an offender if, in proceedings on an application for a continuing detention order, it appears to the Court:

(a) that the offender’s current custody (if any) will expire before the proceedings are determined, and

(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order.”

“10A Interim supervision order-high risk sex offender

The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim supervision of an offender if, in proceedings for an extended supervision order, it appears to the Court:

(a) that the offender’s current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined, and

(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.”


	
	The State seeks both an extended supervision order and a continuing detention order, so the opening words of both sections are satisfied. The effect of allowing the appeal and remitting the State’s application will be that the first precondition, in paragraph (a) of both sections, will be satisfied. It is sufficient in order to enliven the power to make either order if it appears to the Court that the matters alleged would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order. Although it is common ground that such an order should be made, it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied independently of this.
	
	
	That in turn means that it is necessary to be satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that Mr Anderson poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	We are so satisfied. What follows is an abbreviated account, focussing principally upon the offences involving serious sexual violence, which is taken in part from her Honour’s reasons and in part from the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2002, and expanded by reference to what Mr Anderson reported to Drs Ellis and O’Dea late last year.
	
	
	Mr Anderson has a very lengthy history of substance abuse, principally alcohol, cannabis, and heroin, but including amphetamine, methamphetamine and cocaine. He left school at the beginning of Year 8. Between 1982 and 1992, when Mr Anderson was aged 17-27, he was repeatedly convicted of assault, possession of drugs, break, enter and steal. He reported that his history of theft was driven by the need to finance his drug habit. His offending over the last three decades has included offences involving serious violence. In 1987 he assaulted a woman (his then partner), causing a wound to her eye which required sutures. In 1990 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The victim this time was a five year old boy, the son of his partner at the time, who sustained a broken rib and bruising when Mr Anderson lost his temper. In 1994 he was convicted of two offences of maliciously inflicting bodily harm with intent, based on his stabbing two men, telling the second, who had pleaded with him to calm down, “Die you little cunt”.
	
	
	For present purposes, where the focus is upon an unacceptable risk of Mr Anderson committing a serious sex offence, what is most significant about the 1994 offence is that it was committed while he was subject to parole and bail. For that offence, he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment, with a minimum non-parole period of seven years and six months.
	
	
	The crimes which were most serious and most relevant for present purposes were committed when Mr Anderson and another inmate escaped from Grafton Correctional Centre on 28 February 2001, and attacked a 50 year old woman, not known to them, as she walked to her car. She was assaulted, her mouth covered by tape and her hands bound. She was taken to an isolated area in a State forest, where she was raped by both men, threatened with being stabbed, and told “we could slit your throat”. She was forced to have oral sex with Mr Anderson and subjected to other sexual indignities. She was also robbed, before being left in a town. At hospital, the victim was found to have numerous abrasions and extensive bruising, a labial split and a dislocated left knee. Mr Anderson told Dr Ellis that he had been using heroin while in prison at the time, and that he and his co-offender had used speed after escaping.
	
	
	A Crown appeal on sentence was allowed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Both that Court and the sentencing judge regarded the criminality as falling “just short” of the worst case, bearing in mind that although the victim was in fear of her life and had suffered substantial injuries, the worst class of case could involve more substantial physical injuries. The Court of Criminal Appeal imposed an additional sentence of thirteen years, with a non-parole period of ten years:  R v Anderson [2002] NSWCCA 304. The primary judge observed at [62], with respect correctly, that the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal would have reflected the restraint relating to Crown appeals which predated the enactment of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (see R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7). Her Honour did not rely on that circumstance as a matter relevant to determining whether to make a continuing detention order, and (lest there be any doubt about it) it would have been erroneous to have done so. The fact that statute has subsequently altered the sentence for an offence is not relevant to the discretion to make an order under the Act at the conclusion of the term of imprisonment imposed under the superseded regime.
	
	
	While in custody, Mr Anderson has received further convictions for the possession of drugs, and more than 30 institutional misconduct charges. Three of those charges related to violence (in 1989, 1999 and 2008); largely they appear to have related to the possession of, or testing positively for, drugs. He escaped from custody in 1992 as well as on 28 February 2001. When interviewed by Corrective Services, he said that he had also escaped from Glen Innes Prison Farm a “half-dozen” times but had not been caught. A risk assessment report prepared by Corrective Services states that Mr Anderson “did not consider his behaviour of leaving the Glen Innes Prison Farm as constituting an escape as he had every intention of returning after he had met up with his girlfriend at the time”.  
	
	
	The same report summarised his history while in prison favourably:
	


“Outside of the above institutional charges and criminal convictions, the vast majority of custodial staff case notes reflect a positive view of Mr Anderson, his behaviour and his work ethic within custody over the duration of his incarceration. Mr Anderson is routinely described as co-operative, compliant and a dedicated worker.”


	
	Mr Anderson originally rejected participating in the Custody Based Intensive Treatment Program (CUBIT), but completed it in 2011. Also in 2011 he completed four of the five scheduled custody based maintenance group sessions, but refused to complete the course. In September 2015, he completed two further sessions of custody based maintenance.
	
	
	All of Drs Furst, Ellis and O’Dea were of the view that Mr Anderson would pose an unacceptable risk if released from prison unsupervised. As noted at the outset, Mr Anderson accepted as much, and consented to an extended supervision order with a duration of five years. We are of the view that a lengthy period of supervision is required, without which there would be an unacceptable risk that Mr Anderson would commit a serious sex offence. Hence, the power to make an interim detention order or an interim supervision order is available.
	
	
	That is not an end to the matter. It is one thing for the power to keep Mr Anderson in prison for a further 28 days to be available. It is another for it to be appropriate to exercise that power. The discretion as to which interim order should be made falls to be exercised in light of the primary objective of the Act (protecting the community) and its secondary objective (promoting the offender’s rehabilitation).
	
	
	We have concluded that the appropriate exercise of discretion is to make an interim supervision order, rather than an interim detention order.
	
	
	We have had regard to Mr Anderson’s appalling criminal history, and, especially, to the possibility that he might relapse into substance abuse and commit another serious crime of sexual violence, bearing in mind, especially, the spontaneity of his previous offending.
	
	
	We have had regard to the expert opinions. The body of expert opinion is not only out-of-date. It is also mixed. Without summarising all aspects of it, we indicate its nature in what follows.
	
	
	Dr Furst was highly sceptical, and indeed initially recommended a further continuing detention order for a period of five years. In contrast, Dr Ellis endorsed the treatment plan proposed in the probation and parole documents (which is reflected in the terms of the extended supervision order), although recognising, as we read his report, that making a continuing detention order would be open on the evidence. Dr O’Dea was less pessimistic still, and concluded:
	


“[W]ith the above ‘Proposed Conditions Interim Extended Supervision Order’ successfully in place, under the provisions of an ESO, Mr Anderson’s risk of committing a further ‘serious sex offence’ (as defined in Section 5(1) of the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006) would from a psychiatric perspective be adequately and appropriately managed.”


	
	Dr Ellis accepted in his testimonial evidence before the primary judge that an alternative view, namely, making a continuing detention order, was reasonably open. Dr O’Dea, although called by the State, was in substance cross-examined by counsel for the State, and maintained his preference for an extended supervision order, although he also acknowledged that an alternative view could be taken. For his part, Dr Furst acknowledged when cross-examined by counsel appearing for Mr Anderson that the conditions of an extended supervision order would constitute moderate motivators for Mr Anderson not to act in breach of it.
	
	
	In short, the expert opinion evidence does not disclose a clear-cut view as to the appropriate exercise of discretion. However, the relatively recent history of Mr Anderson points significantly in the direction of making an interim supervision order, rather than an interim detention order.
	
	
	First, the decision by Hamill J on the same issue was in favour of an interim supervision order, as opposed to an interim detention order. It is true that this Court has the benefit of evidence not then available to Hamill J. However, that further evidence is supportive of the making of an interim supervision order because, with one exception, the evidence points to continued compliance and good conduct both in the community and when imprisoned pursuant to the continuing detention order. We also note that the State did not seek to appeal from the order made by Hamill J.
	
	
	Secondly, the exception mentioned above is the fact, prominent in the State’s submissions on appeal and in the reasons of the primary judge, that at the end of his head sentence, Mr Anderson had relapsed into the use of drugs on one occasion. He was detected to have used Buprenorphine in the final days of his sentence, a matter which was not known when Hamill J’s orders were made. This is a matter of significant concern, given the association disclosed by Mr Anderson’s history between his substance abuse and offending, with potentially disastrous consequences.
	
	
	However, on balance, a number of countervailing matters outweigh the concern engendered by Mr Anderson’s use of drugs in October 2015. One is that, on the evidence before this Court, that was an isolated incident, which has not been repeated. Another is that Mr Anderson is well aware that the use (and for that matter merely the possession) of alcohol or illicit drugs is a contravention of the supervision order to which he will be subject, which is itself a serious crime and which, almost certainly, will result in his being returned to prison. In other words, the supervision order may be expected, of itself, to be a powerful motivating factor for Mr Anderson to comply with its conditions.
	
	
	Thirdly, we have regard to the stance taken by the State. Officers of the State became aware only days (and perhaps, only hours) after the order was made by Hamill J that Mr Anderson had relapsed into illicit drug use. No application was made to return the matter before Hamill J for review. Just as importantly, the order made by Hamill J expired after 28 days. The State, even so, consented to its extension. It did so on two separate occasions. There was no evidence or submission, when the matter was raised during the hearing of the appeal, that the State’s stance was the result of accident or inadvertence on those occasions.
	
	
	In those circumstances, we think that we must proceed on the basis that the State was satisfied that the single instance of relapse into drug use at the end of the head sentence did not materially impact upon whether a supervision order would provide adequate supervision. No other explanation is consistent with the stance taken by the State, through its lawyers, in November and December 2015.
	
	
	Fourthly, Mr Kell submitted that the making by this Court of an interim detention order would be to the preserve the status quo. That led to this exchange:
	


“KELL: Yes, and there wasn't the evidence that there is now from the experts at a final hearing, the oral evidence of the experts and, in my submission, it's really intended to preserve the status quo until the matter can go to a first instance primary judge who will deal with the matter, and there may be further evidence on what interim orders should be made.

BATHURST CJ: The problem with that is, on one view, her Honour erroneously altered the status quo. It's not necessarily palatable that you make an order preserving the effect of a decision erroneously reached when, firstly, three judges prior to that were content to make an extended supervision order. Whilst it was by consent, they had to be satisfied it was appropriate. And, secondly, at least over the time of the extended interim supervision orders, they were adequate or successful, it might be said.”


	
	We respectfully agree. We are doubtful that questions as to the status quo arise in the exercise of discretion under the Act in the same way as is familiar when an interlocutory injunction is sought. However, to the extent that the status quo is relevant, it cannot be that Mr Anderson should be kept in interim detention when three judges have proceeded on the basis that an interim supervision order is sufficient, and error infects the continuing detention order pursuant to which he is presently imprisoned.
	
	
	Fifthly, the best indicator of what is likely to happen in the next 28 days, if Mr Anderson is released from prison and subjected to an interim supervision order, is, in our view, what occurred in comparable circumstances last October. Mr Anderson’s conduct while subject to an interim supervision order was, so far as the evidence discloses, exemplary. We fully acknowledge the concerns expressed by the primary judge, to the effect that that exemplary conduct was a product of an appreciation that there was an imminent final hearing (see [155] which is reproduced above). Indeed, we share the concern. However, the same position will prevail as a result of the order which we propose. That is to say, Mr Anderson will be aware that in the imminent future, the continuing detention order sought by the State will be determined on a final basis. In addition to the considerable motivation flowing from the terms of the interim supervision order, Mr Anderson should be powerfully motivated to comply.
	
	
	Hence, we propose making an interim supervision order, with all of the conditions proposed by the State (and to which Mr Anderson made no objection). To be clear, none of the foregoing should be read as precluding the court to which this matter is remitted from reaching the conclusion that s 5D supported the making of a continuing detention order. We would anticipate that in any event the evidence before the court will be materially different from that presently available in respect of Mr Anderson’s conduct over the last six months.
	


Miscellaneous matters


	
	Having reached that conclusion, there are a number of more technical aspects to the orders which we propose which should be explained.
	
	
	We note that the interim supervision order made in October 2015 and extended in November and December 2015 expired when the primary judge made a continuing detention order: s 18D(1). The further interim supervision order made by this Court will be a new order, which may remain in place for no more than three months.
	
	
	The terms of that order will authorise Mr Anderson’s DSO to instruct him to subject himself to psychiatric assessment, for the purposes of obtaining updated reports, ideally from Drs O’Dea and Ellis.
	
	
	The existing extended supervision order is of a term of five years commencing “from the date of expiry of the continuing detention order”. We propose that the continuing detention order be set aside and the question whether a new one be made be remitted. However, no challenge was made to the existing extended supervision order.
	
	
	It follows that in the event that a continuing detention order is made, it should be followed by the extended supervision order for a period of five years. Alternatively, if a continuing detention order is not made, then the existing five year extended supervision order should commence immediately. The orders we propose below address this by varying the commencement date of the extended supervision order.
	
	
	In a similar case, this Court extended a detention order by one day before a supervision order took effect, in order to achieve an orderly transition from custody to supervision: see State of New South Wales v Donovan at [130]. It may also be noted that Hamill J delivered his judgment on the Thursday before the Saturday on which Mr Anderson’s sentence expired. It is appropriate for the same reasons to follow the same course here.
	
	
	Finally, it was common ground that in the event that the appeal were allowed, costs should follow the event.
	
	
	The formal orders we propose are as follows:
	



	
	Appeal allowed with costs.
	
	
	Set aside orders 1, 2 and 4 made on 18 December 2015, with effect from 11am 28 April 2016.
	
	
	Remit to a judge sitting in the Common Law Division the determination of the question whether a high risk sex offender continuing detention order should be made.
	
	
	Vary order 3 made on 18 December 2015 by replacing “from the date of the expiry of the continuing detention order” by the words “from the date of the expiry of any continuing detention order made on remitter pursuant to order 3 made by the Court of Appeal on 27 April 2016 or from the date of the determination on that remitter not to make a continuing detention order”, with the result that it reads:
	


“(3)   Pursuant to ss 5C and 9(1)(a) of the Act the defendant, for a period of 5 years from the date of the expiry of any continuing detention order made on remitter pursuant to order 3 made by the Court of Appeal on 27 April 2016 or from the date of the determination on that remitter not to make a continuing detention order, be subject to an extended supervision order and, pursuant to section 11 of the Act direct that, for the period of the extended supervision order, the defendant comply with the conditions set out below in the Schedule to these Orders.”


	
	Order, with effect from 11am 28 April 2016, that the appellant be the subject of an interim supervision order for a period of 28 days, and that he comply with the conditions of that order as set out in the Schedule below for the period of that order.
	
	
	Liberty to either party to apply to a single Judge of Appeal to vary the time at which orders (2) and (5) above commence.

2769289,R v FRAZER KEVIN TANKS [2016] NSWSC 519,"REASONS FOR sentence


	
	MATHEWS AJ:
	


Introduction


	
	On 8 February 2016 Frazer Tanks was indicted on a charge that, on 21 February 2014, at New Lambton, he murdered Stephen Donoghue. He pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. A jury trial then ensued in order to determine his guilt of the offence of murder. On 19 February the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty. I thereupon entered a conviction for the offence of manslaughter. Mr Tanks now comes to be sentenced for that offence. In addition, pursuant to s. 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the Crown has produced a certificate specifying, as a back-up or related offence, the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Christopher Curtin, and the offender has pleaded guilty to this offence. He is accordingly also to be sentenced in relation to this offence.
	


Background Facts


	
	The events leading to Mr Donoghue’s death took place on the evening of 10 February 2014, and the early hours of the next morning. At that time Mr Donoghue was sharing an apartment in Norma Street, Waratah (a suburb of Newcastle) with his ex-partner Kylie-Ann Bennett, and their son, then aged eight.
	
	
	Some time on the afternoon of Monday 10 February, two brothers, Christopher and Jeffrey Curtin, set out to go to the Mayfield Diggers Club for the daily happy hour. They arrived well before 5.00 pm, when the happy hour was due to commence, and in order to fill in the time they went and sat in a nearby park where they were drinking beer they had bought at a local hotel. There they were joined by the offender, Frazer Tanks, whom they had known previously. The three of them drank a bottle of beer each in the park, and then went to the Diggers Club, where they arrived shortly after 5.00. Whilst at the club they drank more beer and also played pool. According to Christopher Curtin, they stayed there for the happy hour, and maybe another hour as well, making a total of about two hours. Mr Curtin was the only one of the three to give evidence. The offender exercised his right not to give evidence, and Jeffrey Curtin had died in the meantime. Jeffrey Curtin’s statement, dated 24 February 2014, was read to the jury, but it did little to elucidate an issue I will be talking about later, namely the time at which the relevant events took place.
	
	
	Christopher Curtin said that when they were leaving the club he telephoned his friend Kylie-Ann Bennett and asked if they could go to her place and have some drinks with her. She agreed to this. Jeffrey Curtin decided not to go, so the two of them, the offender and Christopher Curtin, set off for the Norma Street apartment where Ms Bennett and Mr Donoghue were living. The offender had a bicycle, so he arrived shortly before Mr Curtin. Ms Bennett, who also gave evidence, said that she received the telephone call from Christopher Curtin in the early evening, and that he and the offender arrived at her home half an hour or three quarters of an hour later. When they arrived, she said, her son was preparing to go to bed. The four adults proceeded to sit in her lounge room, where they were drinking wine and watching the Winter Olympics on television. After they had been there for about an hour Ms Bennett said that the offender suddenly stood up, walked across the lounge room to where Mr Donoghue was sitting, and started to punch him. Mr Donoghue fell to the floor, lying on his side, and the offender proceeded to stomp on his head and kick him. She, Ms Bennett, tried to pull the offender away. She was screaming for someone to call the police and the ambulance. Christopher Curtin then jumped up and tried to grab the offender, but the latter punched him several times, causing him to fall backwards into a seated position, at which time the offender kicked him in the torso area. It is this assault which gives rise to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which the offender is also to be sentenced.
	
	
	The offender then made some threatening words, took his bicycle and left the apartment.
	
	
	Mr Donoghue had not moved from the time he first fell onto the ground. The first police officer on the scene noted that he had blood coming out of his left ear and that he was not responsive. This was at about 10 past 2 on the morning of 11 February. At 2.23 am the ambulance arrived. One of the paramedics noted that Mr Donoghue had what he described as “agonal respiration”, which usually indicates that the person is in cardiac arrest. That was certainly the case with Mr Donoghue, so they administered adrenalin, in accordance with normal protocol, and his heart started beating again. He was then taken to the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle. Mr Donoghue never recovered consciousness, and his condition was so serious that ten days later, on 21 February, his life support was removed, and he died.
	
	
	I will be discussing the medical evidence a little later, as it assumed considerable significance in the circumstances of this case. However I should first return and say something more about the events leading up to the fatal assault on Mr Donoghue.
	
	
	The only other eye witness to this assault was Christopher Curtin. His account was generally consistent with that of Ms Bennett. He described the offender as getting up, going over to Mr Donoghue, and knocking him off his chair with one or two punches. When Mr Donoghue was on the ground, the offender stomped on his head at least three times, before Ms Bennett and then he himself took steps to stop him. In retaliation, the offender struck and kicked Mr Curtin several times, causing a number of injuries. These were not sufficiently serious to constitute grievous bodily harm, but nevertheless Mr Curtin suffered some nasty abrasions and contusions, as testified by photographs of him taken shortly afterwards. As already mentioned, the offender is also to be sentenced for this assault.
	
	
	The young master Donoghue came into the room part of the way through all of this. He was interviewed the next morning by a police officer, and the DVD of the interview was an exhibit in the trial. However young master Donoghue had little to add which is relevant here, given that by the time he arrived Mr Donoghue was already lying on the ground, and the offender was striking and kicking Christopher Curtin. Accordingly, the interview was generally concerned with the offender’s actions in relation to Mr Curtin.
	
	
	Immediately after the assault on Mr Curtin, the offender took his bike and left the apartment. By that time there were a number of people outside the building, who saw him leave. The police were told the direction he had taken, and he was apprehended not long afterwards, close to the Waratah railway station. When first approached, he said: “I’ve just come from Waratah, where I got king hit.” Shortly afterwards he said: “the bloke who I just gave a bit of a touch up to he was knocking this chick off. The big fella I give a touch up to. He was knocking off this chick, my skinny mate from upstairs. Then he’s just come up and hit me up the side of my head. So I gave him a few back. I’m not gonna go to gaol.” The offender was arrested and taken into custody. He declined to say anything more about the evening’s events. He has been in custody ever since.
	


The Medical Evidence


	
	I turn now to discuss the medical evidence, and by far the most significant evidence in this regard came from the forensic pathologist, Dr Jane Vuletic, who conducted the post mortem examination on Mr Donoghue. Mr Donoghue, it will be remembered, survived for another ten days after sustaining his injuries, and eventually died on 21 February 2014. Dr Vuletic said that the direct cause of his death was hypoxic brain injury. This occurs when there has been a lack of oxygen to the brain for a period of time, resulting in irreversible brain damage. In Mr Donoghue’s case, the cardiac arrest he suffered immediately after the blow to his head would have caused this condition. There was also evidence, Dr Vuletic said, of blunt force injury to the head and the chest. The head injury consisted of a bruise to the right temple region, and the chest injury of extensive bruising to the left torso, accompanied by several fractures of the left ribs numbered 9 to 12, resulting in a left tension pneumothorax, as one of the broken ribs had punctured his lung. Mr Donoghue had also been suffering from a number of underlying conditions which rendered him particularly vulnerable to traumatic events such as occurred on this occasion. As relevant here, these included alcohol induced cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. His blood alcohol level when he arrived at the hospital on 11 February was .312, an extremely high reading, which Dr Vuletic said would have increased his risk of suffering a cardiac arrest.
	
	
	The other relevant medical evidence came from Dr Robert O’Connor, the last doctor to see Mr Donoghue before his life support was cut off. He emphasised that Mr Donoghue’s underlying conditions made him particularly vulnerable to trauma, but considered it probable that it was the blow to the head which set in train the chain of events leading to his death.
	
	
	This evidence was particularly significant at the trial, and remains so for sentencing purposes, as it goes to the issue of causation. The offender’s plea of guilty to manslaughter means that he accepted that an action or actions of his led to Mr Donoghue’s death, but a major issue still remained as to which action or actions constituted the immediate cause of death. During the trial this was highly relevant to the question of intent. The bulk of the medical evidence indicated that it was the initial blow to the head which was the effective cause of death. And the jury’s acquittal of the charge of murder indicates that, at the time of inflicting that blow, the offender did not intend to kill or really seriously injure Mr Donoghue.
	
	
	The other significant matter arising from the medical evidence relates to Mr Donoghue’s previous medical conditions, which meant that a relatively minor injury could have devastating consequences, as indeed happened on this occasion. The law is clear, that the perpetrator remains legally responsible for those consequences, whether or not he knew of the pre-existing condition. But it is a highly relevant matter when assessing the level of culpability of the offender’s actions. This, of course, provides a further endorsement of the jury’s verdict of not guilty of murder. When he delivered that single punch to Mr Donoghue’s head, the offender would have had no idea that it could lead to his death.
	
	
	On the other hand, I accept that when Mr Donoghue was lying on the ground, the offender continued to kick him, and probably also stomped on his head at least once, as described by both Christopher Curtin and Ms Bennett. The medical evidence as to the extent and nature of Mr Donoghue’s rib fractures strongly supports the proposition that further injuries to that region were inflicted when he was already on the ground.
	


The Timing of the Relevant Events


	
	There is one very strange feature about the evidence relating to the events of that night, and this relates to the timing. We know with certainty that it was immediately after 5.00 pm on Monday 10 February that the Curtin brothers and the offender went into the Diggers Club, and that Mr Donoghue sustained his injuries at or shortly after 2.00 the next morning. I am not going to spend much time on this, as it is peripheral to the main issues on sentence, but one cannot but think that something else must have been happening that night. According to the great bulk of the oral evidence, it was at about 7.30pm that the offender and Mr Curtin went to the Lorna Street apartment. They were described as sitting around drinking for an hour, or maybe two, before these events occurred. They were all drinking heavily, and at first I thought that in their state of intoxication they must have significantly under-estimated the time that they spent in the apartment before the assault on Mr Donoghue. But the telephone records, which were placed into evidence towards the end of the Crown case, showed that the first apparent telephone communication on the Monday evening between Christopher Curtin or the offender on the one hand and Ms Bennett on the other was a call made from the offender’s phone to Ms Bennett at 9 minutes to midnight, followed by two calls from Ms Bennett to the offender at 5 to 12 and 12.27 am respectively. If the offender and Christopher Curtin did not arrive at the Norma Street apartment until after midnight, it confirms the proposition that they were there for something between one and two hours before the critical events occurred. But it leaves totally unexplained what happened in the many intervening hours between leaving the Diggers Club at about 7.00 (if indeed they did so then), and going to Ms Bennett’s apartment.
	
	
	Whatever did happen in those intervening hours, there can be little doubt that, at the time when the fatal blow or blows were inflicted on Mr Donoghue, the offender was heavily intoxicated. His garbled accounts to the police officers who arrested him shortly afterwards bear testimony to this.
	


Aggravating and Mitigating Factors


	
	I turn to discuss the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors which are to be taken into account on sentence pursuant to s. 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”), being factors which are not inherent in the nature of the offences themselves. The aggravating factor or factors relating to the offences (as opposed to the offender) are: first, pursuant to s. 21A(2)(ea), that the offences were committed in the presence of a child under 18. Although young master Donoghue was not in the same room when his father was struck by the offender, he was close enough to come in and witness the assault on Christopher Curtin, while his father was lying on the ground. The Crown also submitted that s. 21A(2)(eb) applied, in that the offence was committed in the victim’s home. However Ms Manuell SC, who appeared for the offender, pointed out that, as the offender was lawfully in the home, this is not an aggravating factor. Pursuant to the judgment of James J (with whom Bathurst CJ and Johnson J agreed) in NLR v R [2011] NSWCCA 246, s. 21A(2)(eb) is not applicable when the offender was lawfully in the home where the offence was committed and was not an unauthorised intruder. Accordingly, this is not to be treated as an aggravating factor in this case.
	
	
	As to the relevant mitigating factors, s. 21A(3)(b) applies, in that neither offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. The fatal assault on Mr Donoghue was clearly an unpremeditated, spontaneous action on the part of the offender, albeit one which had devastating consequences. And the same can be said in relation to the assault upon Mr Curtain.
	
	
	This takes me to a discussion of the objective seriousness of the offences, particularly the manslaughter of Mr Donoghue.
	


The Objective Seriousness of the Offences


	
	The Crown submitted that this was an unprovoked attack on Mr Donoghue, and that the objective seriousness of this offence falls just above the mid-range for manslaughter. The Crown Prosecutor pointed out that the offender continued his assault on Mr Donoghue even after he was lying on the ground, by stomping on and kicking his head, and kicking him in the torso. Ms Manuell conceded that, in the light of the medical evidence as to Mr Donoghue’s rib fractures, the offender must have kicked him in that region. However she disputed that he kicked or stomped on Mr Donoghue’s head, submitting that the injury to his right temple might well have been caused by his fall to the floor. However both eye witnesses described the offender as kicking and stomping on Mr Donoghue’s head, and I accept that there must have been some action or actions along these lines. Clearly these further assaults are relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter, notwithstanding that, according to the medical evidence, the fatal injury had already been inflicted, and they therefore did not contribute to Mr Donoghue’s death.
	
	
	On the other hand, the blow or blows inflicted by the offender which caused Mr Donoghue’s death were not such as would, in the normal course of events, have had such devastating consequences. I have already discussed this aspect of the matter. Mr Donoghue had a number of underlying health conditions which made him particularly vulnerable, and which the offender would not have known about. This is a very significant matter which, in my opinion, substantially reduces the objective seriousness of this offence. After all, it is the action or actions causing death for which the offender is to be sentenced, which in this case constituted the punch or punches to Mr Donoghue’s face while the latter was seated at the table.
	
	
	In my opinion the objective seriousness of this offence is well below the midline for manslaughter.
	
	
	Similarly, I consider that the assault upon Christopher Curtain is below the midline of objective culpability. It was a spontaneous assault, and no weapon was used.
	
	
	At this point I turn to say something about the offender personally.
	


The Offender’s Background


	
	The offender was born on 18 July 1971 and is now 44 years old. His mother gave evidence during the sentencing proceedings in which she described his background. As a very young child he was good and obedient, but later sibling rivalry developed with his younger brother, and as he got older he started to get angry. When he was about 15 she became aware that he was using illegal drugs, particularly marijuana. He left school at the age of 16, and thereafter had a number of different jobs. The offender’s criminal record was also tendered on sentence, which showed an extensive record, dating back to November 1987, when he was only 16 years old. Over the next few years he came before the courts on a number of occasions, all for relatively minor offences. His first sentence of imprisonment was in August 1991, for possessing a prohibited drug. There have been many further convictions over the years, for a variety of offences, and the offender has been sentenced to imprisonment on a number of occasions. However since 2005 he has come before the courts on only a few occasions, in 2009 and again in 2011. On that last occasion, the offence was driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. Accordingly, it is quite some years since he has been convicted of any serious offences.
	
	
	According to the offender’s mother, he started to use heroin when he was about 24 years old. That was when things really deteriorated, she said. Starting in 2008 he attempted rehabilitation on a couple of occasions, by going into drug rehabilitation centres. The offender has a daughter who was born in January 2006, who lives with his mother. Both of them have kept contact with the offender since he has been in prison. Mrs Tanks described the offender as being very angry when he first went into prison, but said that recently he has become much calmer. She acknowledged that the offender will need a great deal of support when he is released from custody, and said that she would support him.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, it would seem that the combination of alcohol and illegal drugs have been the scourge of the offender’s life, and responsible for at least the major part of his offending over the years. I accept that, if the offender were to abstain from these substances, he would be unlikely to reoffend. This view is reinforced by the fact that the only offence committed by the offender in the five years before the current offences was an alcohol-related driving offence.
	


Other Relevant Matters


	
	The offender pleaded guilty to the manslaughter charge at the earliest reasonable opportunity. As Ms Manuell pointed out, had this plea been accepted by the Crown, a lengthy and difficult trial would have been avoided. Accordingly, he is entitled to a significant discount on sentence. He has never contested the fact that he assaulted Mr Curtin. In the circumstances I accept Ms Manuell’s submission that a discount of between 20% and 25% would be appropriate in relation to both offences. The sentences I am about to impose have already been adjusted accordingly.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period. As has been observed on many occasions, the range of culpability for manslaughter is greater than for any other offence. It can vary from a practical joke gone wrong at one end, to an act which is little short of murder at the other. In the present case, as already mentioned, I regard the offender’s culpability to be below the midline in objective gravity, principally by reason of Mr Donoghue’s previous medical conditions, which made him vulnerable to actions which, in the normal course of events, would not have caused any particularly significant injury.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is imprisonment for five years.
	
	
	It is appropriate at this stage to advert to the principal purposes of sentencing, as set out in s. 3A of the Act. They are as follows:
	



	
	To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence
	
	
	To deter the offender and others from committing similar offences
	
	
	To protect the community
	
	
	To promote the rehabilitation of the offender
	
	
	To make the offender accountable for his actions
	
	
	To denounce the conduct of the offender
	
	
	To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
	



	
	As relevant to the last of these purposes, extremely moving victim impact statements were presented in court on behalf of Mr Donoghue’s family members. These included his two sisters, as well as Ms Bennett, and his two children. On behalf of the Court I convey my heartfelt sympathy to each of them. No doubt they will think that the sentence I am about to impose is totally inadequate, having regard to the extent of their loss. However I hope they will understand that there are many other matters to be taken into account on sentence, particularly in relation to offences of this nature.
	
	
	Everything points to the fact that the offender has real prospects of rehabilitation, and is likely to benefit from a lengthy period of supervised release into the community. In my opinion this constitutes special circumstances which justify a variation between the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 11 February 2014, and his sentences are to commence on that date.
	
	
	I propose to impose a fixed term of imprisonment in relation to the assault on Christopher Curtin, and then partially accumulate the sentence for the manslaughter of Mr Donoghue.
	
	
	Mr Tanks, for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Christopher Curtin I sentence you to imprisonment for six months, commencing on 11 February 2014. For the manslaughter of Stephen Donoghue I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 11 May 2014 and expiring on 10 May 2018, with a balance of term of three years, commencing on 11 May 2018 and expiring on 10 May 2021. The total term of imprisonment is therefore seven years and three months. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 10 May 2018.

2769302,R v Orcher [2016] NSWSC 627,"Ex tempore Judgment


	
	An application has been made by the Crown to lead in re-examination a portion of paragraph 11 of voir dire Exhibit A. It is said, in a nutshell, that to the extent that defence counsel suggested to the witness that she had recently commenced to use dramatic terms to describe what the witness says the accused did to the deceased, the Crown should be permitted to get into evidence that, as long ago as 5 January 2015, the witness described the assault as ""vicious"", as shown by the paragraph in question.
	
	
	It is also said, in a nutshell, that the Crown should be entitled to lead that evidence pursuant to s 108 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In short, in order to get into evidence a prior consistent statement after a suggestion has been made in cross-examination, in effect, of what used to be called recent invention, it is said that, in those circumstances, s 108(3)(b) is in play. The section is as follows:
	


108 Exception: re-establishing credibility

(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness.

(2) (Repealed)

(3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if:

(a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or

(b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion,

and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.


	
	There are two aspects of the application that are problematic. The first is that defence counsel's impugning of the witness was based upon the recent use of a particular word, namely, ""slamming"". But it can be seen that word does not appear in paragraph 11.
	
	
	Separately from that, I think that there is a real issue of s 137 of the Evidence Act playing a role here. That is because, while I accept that the fact that the witness used a graphic descriptor on 5 January 2015 has some probative value, I think there will be a significant prejudicial effect. I say that because the use of the word ""vicious"" would not be admitted as a lay opinion or evaluation. It would not be admissible, pursuant to s 79 and the related sections of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	So that, in short, if the re-examination were permitted, I would need to direct the jury that that characterisation was not directly admissible but, rather, only being led for the very limited purpose of the jury determining whether, in truth, the witness commenced to use graphic descriptions of the alleged assault quite recently, or rather quite some months ago.
	
	
	There is force in what the Crown has said about the “leave factors” contained in s 192 of the Act, arguing in favour of a grant of leave. So much may be accepted.
	
	
	But I am concerned, first, about whether, in truth, the prior statement does, indeed, fit within s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Secondly, if I am wrong in that concern, I consider that the evidence should be excluded, because of the problem I have identified, pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Accordingly, the objection to the question is upheld.

		16 May 2016",2016-04-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769306,R v Turnbull (No. 9) [2016] NSWSC 781,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of cross-examination of Senior Constable Bradley Beddoes, questions have been asked with respect to the execution of a search warrant in the early hours of 30 July 2014 at the premises of the Accused named “Yambin”.
	
	
	The execution of the search warrant was video recorded. A number of still photographs taken from the video recording have been tendered and are Exhibit 2. In some photographs in Exhibit 2, there is apparent a document or documents from Cole & Butler, solicitors. That firm was and remains the firm of solicitors acting for the Accused.
	
	
	In the course of cross-examination, senior counsel for the Accused has tendered a letter dated 4 July 2014 (MFI8) from Mr Sylvester Joseph, the solicitor for the Accused, to the Accused. The letter relates to the commencement of proceedings in the Land and Environment Court in June 2014 against the Accused. The letter provides an opinion about the question of whether the proceedings were commenced in time and expresses certain opinions (apparently held by Mr Joseph) with respect to Mr Turner, the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown objects to the tender of the letter. An issue has been raised as to whether this particular letter was one of those which were obtained pursuant to the search warrant. For present purposes, I accept that it was.
	
	
	The photographs which have been tendered as Exhibit 2 contain images which appear to be at least similar to this document. The Crown has indicated that the documents in this class were returned to the legal representatives for the Accused after the execution of the search warrant, upon the basis that they were caught by client legal privilege. However, it is the Accused that seeks to tender the letter at present.
	
	
	It is submitted, on behalf of the Accused, that the letter goes to the state of mind of the Accused and bears upon matters communicated to him by his solicitor prior to the events of 29 July 2014. It is submitted that the letter itself is admissible, not as evidence of the truth of the contents of the document.
	
	
	In my view, the fact that the letter was apparently seized by police in the execution of the search warrant does not render it admissible. The question then is, how is it relevant, keeping in mind the provisions in ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The state of mind of the Accused is a matter which can be the subject of evidence in different forms. Senior counsel for the Accused has indicated, as he is entitled, that at this stage he will not respond definitively as to whether the Accused will be called in the trial.
	
	
	In my view, there are some fundamental difficulties with the relevance and potential use of this document if it was admitted into evidence at this time.
	
	
	If the Accused gives evidence in the trial, so that his state of mind is the subject of evidence from him, then the position might, and I underline might, be different. But I am quite unpersuaded at the moment that the letter, MFI8, is relevant and admissible and I decline to admit it.

		20 June 2016",2016-04-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769307,R v Obeid (No 9) [2016] NSWSC 520,"Judgment


	
	On 22 April 2016, the Court heard argument on an application made by the State of New South Wales (the “State”) that the accused, Edward Moses Obeid, be denied access to certain documents placed before the Cabinet of New South Wales in 2007 concerning the adoption of a proposed Commercial Lease Policy (“CLP”) applicable to property owned by the Maritime Authority of New South Wales. The State contended that access should be refused on the basis that the public interest in preventing their disclosure outweighs the public interest in access being granted.
	
	
	For the reasons that follow, I uphold this claim in relation to some of the documents the subject of the application but reject it in respect of two documents which are briefly described below. In providing reasons for this conclusion, it is necessary to be circumspect in describing the content of any of the documents to avoid any inadvertent undermining of the interest that the State seeks to uphold. Further, given the discussion below of the evidence adduced at an aborted trial of Mr Obeid in February 2016, and that his retrial is due to commence on 6 June 2016, an interim non-publication order under s 10 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) will be made preventing the publication of this judgment until further order. In the ordinary course, it is to be expected that the order will be lifted at the conclusion of Mr Obeid’s trial.
	


Background


	
	On 8 May 2015, Mr Obeid was arraigned in this Court on an indictment that charged him with one count of wilful misconduct in public office. Thereafter, various interlocutory applications were heard and determined. On 10 February 2016, Mr Obeid was arraigned before a jury panel on an amended indictment that charged him with that offence.
	
	
	On 24 February 2016, the jury were discharged prior to the closure of the Crown case: R v Obeid (No 7) [2016] NSWSC 132. The reasons for the discharge are immaterial to this application. A new trial date has been fixed for 6 June 2016.
	
	
	After the jury were discharged, the solicitors for the accused sought access to material held by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (“ICAC”) that was the subject of a prosecution disclosure notice served by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions during 2015. The notice listed all, or at least most, of the material retained by ICAC in respect of the inquiry that led to this prosecution. After some debate as to whether that material was required to be made available to the accused, he caused a subpoena to be issued to ICAC. When the subpoena was called upon, ICAC did not object to the production of any of the material sought. Instead, various emanations of the State have objected to the accused being granted access to some discrete parts of the material retained by ICAC on the basis that they are either the subject of legal professional privilege or are Cabinet documents such that the public interest warrants the refusal of access. The former claims either have been, or are in the process of being, resolved by negotiation. This judgment deals with the latter claims. In respect of both sets of claims it is not contended that there was any form of “waiver”, if that were possible, by the production per se of the material to ICAC for the purpose of its investigation.
	


The Crown and Defence cases


	
	To determine whether the interests of justice warrant the granting of access to any of the documents, it is necessary to identify the matters in issue at the aborted trial. There is no reason to believe they will not be issues at the retrial.
	
	
	The amended indictment presented against Mr Obeid states as follows:
	


“Between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007 in Sydney in the State of New South Wales, then holding public office as a Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, [he] did in the course of and connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by making representations to Stephen Paul Dunn, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, Maritime Property Division of the Maritime Authority of New South Wales, with the intention of securing an outcome from the said Maritime Authority favourable to Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Ltd in respect of its tenancies of properties at Circular Quay knowing at the time he made the representations that he had a commercial and/or beneficial and/or family and/or personal interest in the said tenancies which he did not disclose to Stephen Paul Dunn.”


	
	A brief summary of the prosecution case is set out in R v Obeid (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1380 at [15] to [22] (“Obeid No 2”) which should be read together with this judgment. As is clear from the amended indictment, the offence is alleged to have been committed between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007 and concerns Mr Obeid's alleged dealings with Mr Dunn, a senior employee of the Maritime Authority of New South Wales (“the Maritime Authority”) while Mr Obeid was a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales.
	
	
	Prior to the discharge of the jury at the aborted trial, the Crown Prosecutor adduced evidence from the former Chief Executive Officer of the Maritime Authority, Christopher Oxenbould. Mr Oxenbould described the evolution of a proposed CLP applicable to property owned by the Maritime Authority from early 2005 until its adoption by Cabinet in November 2007. In summary, the various iterations of the CLP from March 2005 until August 2007 allowed some limited scope for existing commercial lease holders to negotiate a renewal of their leases upon their expiry, but the general tenor of the policy was to require such leases be the subject of a market based tender or an expression of interest process in which existing leaseholders could only participate on the same basis as new entrants. Mr Oxenbould stated that Minister Tripodi, who assumed responsibility for the Maritime Authority from February 2006, [1]  supported this approach, although he, Mr Oxenbould, preferred a policy that favoured direct negotiations upon the expiry of an existing lease. [2] 
	
	
	Mr Oxenbould stated that within the Maritime Property division of the Maritime Authority there was a strongly held view that the process of renewal for the Circular Quay leases, including the leases referred to in the amended indictment, was a special case compared with those addressed in the proposed CLP. In particular, this view was that irrespective of the terms of the CLP they should only be renewed by a process of competitive tender. [3]  (The evidence does not suggest that this was conveyed to the Circular Quay lessees during the period 2005 to 2007.)
	
	
	Mr Oxenbould recalled that around mid-2007, the fate of the proposed CLP and the Circular Quay leases became linked. [4]  He stated that in September 2007, a draft CLP favouring direct negotiations with existing lease holders was produced by the staff members responsible for progressing the CLP, namely Mr Low and Mr Dunn. [5]  He said that this policy was approved by the Minister and then by Cabinet in late November 2007 with some immaterial revisions. The revised CLP was applied to the Circular Quay leases which led to the renewal of the leases at Circular Quay, including the tenancies referred to in the amended indictment.
	
	
	Mr Low also gave evidence at the aborted trial. He stated that he joined the Maritime Authority as General Manager of Ports in November 2006 [6] . He assumed responsibility for progressing the CLP. He recalled that in “[early] conversations the Minister was [in] favour of open tenders” [7] . He stated that at the direction of Mr Dunn a new draft of the policy was prepared which favoured direct negotiations over lease renewals rather than open tenders. [8]  He recounted a conversation with Minister Tripodi in relation to a new iteration of the CLP which favoured direct negotiations as follows: [9] 
	


“… I raised [the revised policy] with the Chief Executive and also with the Minister and in relation to the Minister I called his office and he rang me back personally some time later and I ran through the changes to the policy, one of which was retail leases. He didn't make any particular comment about that the change to section 4.5 about retail leases …”


	
	At the time the jury were discharged the Crown Prosecutor was yet to call Mr Tripodi. Mr Dunn had not given evidence before the jury but he had given evidence on a “Basha inquiry” in their absence (R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337). In that inquiry Mr Dunn stated that he was appointed as Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Maritime Authority on 15 August 2007 and then General Manager, Maritime Property Division approximately one week later. [10]  He reported to Mr Oxenbould, [11]  and assumed responsibility for finalising the CLP. [12]  Mr Dunn had previously been Director of Fisheries between 1999 and 2004. For some period during that time Mr Obeid was the Minister for Fisheries. Since that time Mr Dunn had met with Mr Obeid occasionally. [13] 
	
	
	Mr Dunn stated that, either immediately before or shortly after he commenced working for the Maritime Authority, he received a call from Mr Obeid [14] . He said that Mr Obeid asked him to meet with a barrister, Paul Scanlan, who was the representative of the Circular Quay tenants who they felt they had been mistreated by the Maritime Authority. [15]  Mr Dunn agreed that in the call Mr Obeid “did no more than or less than request [him] to meet with Mr Scanlan to hear their grievances” [16] . Mr Dunn and Mr Low then met with Mr Scanlan on 28 August 2007. He advised the then Minister, Mr Tripodi, that he had been contacted by Mr Obeid and asked to meet Mr Scanlan. Mr Dunn said that after he met Mr Scanlan he investigated the various matters that Mr Scanlan put to him on behalf of the Circular Quay lessees. [17]  He said that he was not advised by Mr Obeid or anyone else that Mr Obeid or any member of his family had an interest in the leases “other than a belief by some of the Maritime staff that [one of the tenants] Mr Abood was name dropping Mr Obeid during conversations”, although he did not know that Mr Abood was related to Mr Obeid. [18]  He stated that, if Mr Obeid’s interest had been disclosed, then he would have advised Mr Oxenbould and the Minister of the existence of a conflict of interest on Mr Obeid's part and referred to it in the material placed before Cabinet. [19] 
	
	
	Mr Dunn was not pressed during the Basha inquiry on the reasons why he proposed a change to the CLP or reversed the approach that had previously been adopted with the Circular Quay lessees, except that he agreed that his “conclusion that there was substance based in what Mr Scanlan had represented to [him] was reached by virtue of [his] investigation and uninfluenced by Eddie Obeid’s request that [he] meet him” [20] .
	
	
	The elements of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office were enunciated in R v Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 201 A Crim R 522 at [46] per Redlich JA (Ashley JA and Hansen AJA agreeing) as follows:
	


“… the elements of the offence are:

(1)   a public official;

(2)   in the course of or connected to his public office;

(3)   wilfully misconduct himself; by act or omission, for example, by wilfully neglecting or failing to perform his duty;

(4)   without reasonable excuse or justification; and

(5)   where such misconduct is serious and meriting criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.”


	
	The aborted trial was conducted on the basis that with respect to element (1) the jury would be instructed that, as a matter of law, a Member of the Legislative Council is a public official (see Obeid v R [2015] NSWCCA 309 at [119] to 123]). Elements (2), (3) and (5) were said to be in issue. At the time trial was aborted no submission had been made as to whether there was evidence that might amount to a reasonable excuse or justification for Mr Obeid's intervention, so for the present element (4) can be put aside.
	
	
	At the very least it was apparent from Senior Counsel for Mr Obeid's opening and his questioning of the witnesses noted above that it was to be contended on Mr Obeid's behalf that, even if Mr Obeid's communication with Mr Dunn was unwise or perhaps “improper” because of his interest in the leases, it was nevertheless a minor transgression and had no consequential effect on either the progress of the CLP or the negotiations between the Maritime Authority and the lessees. Accordingly, I apprehend that at the retrial it will be contended that Mr Obeid's intervention in the negotiations was so minor in nature and effect that it neither amounted to misconduct (much less wilful misconduct) to satisfy element (3) but, even if it did, it did not merit criminal punishment so as to satisfy element (5).
	


The documents the subject of the claim


	
	The documents that were originally the subject of the claim for public interest immunity were set out in exhibit PM-1 to the affidavit of Paul Miller affirmed 19 April 2016. Only Tabs 1 and 5 of exhibit PM-1 were tendered as the accused’s application for access to the balance of PM-1 was not pressed. The documents behind Tab 1 related to a Cabinet proposal to adopt a commercial leasing policy in the period December 2005 to March 2006, which did not eventuate. The documents behind Tab 5 related to the Cabinet’s adoption of the (revised) CLP on 26 November 2007. Of these documents, the claim for public interest immunity was not pressed in relation to the bulk of them, including the relevant Cabinet minutes, much of the Cabinet correspondence and advice and, in the case of Tab 5, the record of Cabinet’s decision. This position was taken because either the contents of this material were ventilated during an ICAC inquiry or the documents have been provided to the accused as part of the process of prosecutorial disclosure.
	
	
	In the end result, the documents the subject of this application were reduced to the following. First, there are eight items of Cabinet correspondence in the period December 2005 to March 2006 relating to a proposal that Cabinet adopt a commercial leasing policy. [21]  None of the authors of that correspondence are Crown witnesses. One of the authors gave evidence at the relevant ICAC inquiry.
	
	
	Second, there are six items of Cabinet correspondence relating to the Cabinet’s adoption of the commercial leasing policy on 26 November 2007. [22]  The author of one item of correspondence is a Crown witness, namely, Mr Tripodi. The author of one of the other items of correspondence was a witness before ICAC, but is not a Crown witness. [23] 
	
	
	Third, there is a memorandum constituting advice from within the Department of Premier and Cabinet concerning the proposal. [24] 
	
	
	Mr Miller is the General Counsel of the Department of Premier and Cabinet. As part of his duties he has drafted Cabinet minutes, Cabinet submissions and records of Cabinet decisions. He has attended meetings as Secretary to the Cabinet in the absence of the Cabinet Secretary. In his affidavit he describes the process of Cabinet decision making including that of Cabinet subcommittees. He also describes the necessity for secrecy and confidentiality of the proceedings of Cabinet in a manner consistent with that discussed in the authorities. Mr Miller emphasised that such confidentiality promotes “an environment in which Ministers are free to provide to Cabinet all the information relevant to an issue on a frank and candid basis” (at [25]).
	
	
	Mr Miller also describes the various categories of documents included in exhibit PM-1, specifically “Cabinet minutes” being in effect a proposal for Cabinet, Ministerial Advice and Correspondence, “Cabinet advices” being advices prepared by the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Treasury advice to the Budget committee, records of Cabinet decisions and instructions to Parliamentary Counsel. It follows from [20] to [22] that only two of these categories are relevant, namely, Ministerial Advice and Correspondence and Cabinet Advices, although, as noted, some Cabinet minutes and records of Cabinet decisions concerning the CLP were either tendered at the ICAC inquiry or have been made available to the Accused.
	
	
	In relation to Ministerial Advice and Correspondence, Mr Miller stated that correspondence from Ministers to the Premier containing the views of individual Ministers on policies proposed in Cabinet minutes are made available to all Cabinet members and “treated the same way as a Cabinet submission” (at [40]). He stated:
	


“[42]   Those preparing Cabinet Minutes or other advice for Ministers or Cabinet are often reliant on obtaining advice and information other persons within government and, on occasion, outside of government on issues to be discussed in the Cabinet Minutes. If those people preparing the advice for Cabinet are unable to obtain such advice and information without fear that such advice and views could be publicly disclosed then they may not seek such advice at all or if they do obtain such advice they may seek it in more limited terms. Further, those providing their advice or views may feel inhibited in the information they place in the document and affect the way in which other information is presented. This in turn will significantly detract from the quality of the advice being provided to Cabinet which in turn will detrimentally impact on the quality of the decision making ability of Cabinet.

[43]   In summary, it is vital to the development of public policy and the good administration of the affairs of the State that:

   a.   Ministers in Cabinet are able to have a free and candid discussion on issues that come before it for determination;

   b.   Ministers and Cabinet are able to obtain full and frank advice from government officers and external experts on issues that come before a Cabinet for determination;

   c.   Those advising the Ministers and Cabinet are able to obtain full and frank advice and views of other government officers and external experts on matters in respect of which they are providing advice to a Cabinet.

[44]   The threat of disclosure of documents that contain information about any of the above matters will adversely affect the proceedings of Cabinet and the quality of the advice given to Cabinet and will therefore inhibit Cabinet’s decision-making process. Such disclosure would tend to mute and impede the advice given to Cabinet and mute and impede the discussions and deliberations of Cabinet on future matters, including unrelated matters, because Ministers and those preparing advice for Cabinet could no longer be confident that their confidentiality would be respected and upheld by the courts.”


	
	In relation to Cabinet advices Mr Miller stated:
	


“[46]   These advices are not merely briefing notes but rather they comprise the primary way in which the Department of Premier and Cabinet provides advice to the Premier in respect of Cabinet Minutes placed by Minister before Cabinet. The documents analyse proposals being put by a Minister to Cabinet and note current policy issues relevant to the proposals being put. These advices also make recommendations to the Premier as to the position that he or she should take in respect of those proposals. The disclosure of such advice would undermine the collective responsibility of Ministers by disclosing the proposals and views put by the Premier to Cabinet or the relevant committee as well as possibly disclosing that Ministers took different views on an issue. Further, if such briefings were liable to be disclosed it would be very difficult for public servants to provide the necessary advice in a concise, rigorous and uninhibited manner.

[47]   The disclosure of such documents would undermine collective responsibility and breach the confidentiality of Cabinet’s process in the same way as would the disclosure of documents that directly reveal the content of deliberations of Cabinet. The risk of disclosure of such documents would also mean that Ministers and the Cabinet may not seek such advice or if they do then the risk of disclosure may reduce the quality and extent of that advice.”


	
	In Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43; 142 CLR 1 (“Sankey”) both Gibbs ACJ (at pp 45 and 46) and Stephen J (at pp 59 to 60) referred to the deference that should be afforded to the reasons advanced by a suitably qualified deponent for preserving the secrecy of Cabinet documents, although their opinion is not determinative. Accordingly I attach significant weight to the views expressed by Mr Miller in the above extracts and the balance of his affidavit. However, as Mr Miller acknowledges in his affidavit, he “is not in a position to depose to the public interest in the disclosure of the documents in these proceedings” which turns upon an assessment of their significance or potential significance to the prosecution of the accused.
	


Cabinet documents and Public Interest Immunity


	
	It was common ground on this application that the determination of the State’s objection to access was to be made in accordance with the common law, and not s 130 of the Evidence Act 2005 (NSW) which concerns the exclusion of evidence of matters of State. Section 131A of the Evidence Act operates to extend various provisions found within Divisions 1, 1A, 1C and 3 of Part 3.10 of the Evidence Act, including s 130, to most pre-trial applications for disclosure of documents. However it does not operate in the circumstance where the person objecting to the provision of the documents, which in this case is the State, is not the person required to produce the documents, which in this case is ICAC: State of New South Wales v Public Transport Ticketing Corporation [2011] NSWCA 60 (“PTTC”) at [32].
	
	
	At common law, the approach to be adopted to the determination of a claim for public interest immunity was stated in The Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1993) 176 CLR 604 (“NLC”) at 616 namely:
	


“The claim for public interest immunity must nonetheless be weighed against the competing public interest of the proper administration of justice, which may be impaired by the denial to a court of access to relevant and otherwise admissible evidence.”


	
	Further in relation to a so-called “class claim”, the Court in NLC added (at 617):
	


“In a case where a document fell into a class of document the disclosure of which would be injurious to the public interest regardless of the contents, a court could conclude that ‘disclosure would not really be detrimental to the public interest’ [as stated by Gibbs ACJ in Sankey at 43] only in circumstances where there was a competing public interest, such as the public interest in the advancement of justice, which outweighed the public interest in the preservation of confidentiality.”


	
	As stated, the claim for public interest immunity rests upon the status of the documents as Cabinet documents “regardless of [their] contents”. Each of NLC, Sankey and PTTC concerned Cabinet documents. In PTTC at [45]ff, Allsop P distilled a number of principles from Sankey and NLC concerning a public interest immunity claim in respect of such documents as follows:
	


“45. A number of propositions can be taken from their Honours' reasons to guide consideration of this issue. It is in the public interest that deliberations of Cabinet, including the decisions made by Cabinet, should remain confidential in support of the collective responsibility of Cabinet government: NLC at 615. It is the position of the body as responsible for the creation of state policy at the highest level that engenders the need for protection: NLC at 615. Thus, an important consideration is the protection of deliberations leading to the formulation of state policy, though this proposition should not be taken as meaning that only formulation of policy is to be protected. The threat of disclosure may impede or mute free and vigorous exchange in Cabinet: NLC at 615. Decision-making and policy development by Cabinet is to be uninhibited: NLC at 616. The division of claims into ‘class’ and ‘contents’ claims is rough, but acceptable, to differentiate types of documents the disclosure of which would injure the public interest, irrespective of contents, and those which ought not to be disclosed because of their contents: NLC at 616. Documents revealing Cabinet deliberations and decisions fall within the former class. But their immunity is not absolute: NLC at 616. The immunity must be weighed against the public interest in the administration of justice: NLC at 616. …

…

48. Their Honours [in NLC] then went on to say at 617 that the currency or controversiality of the subject matter is relevant to the balancing process. The character of the subject matter is, implicitly, also important. Their Honours had already spoken of policy and its formulation through the deliberations of Cabinet. Their Honours then emphasised that immunity of documents of Cabinet deliberations and Cabinet documents (ordinarily attracted irrespective of contents) is not absolute: NLC at 617-618. A court will initially lean against disclosure: NLC at 618. Whether circumstances are sufficient to displace the immunity depends in part on the nature of the class. As to this the majority [NLC] said at 618:

‘In the case of documents recording the actual deliberations of Cabinet, only considerations which are indeed exceptional would be sufficient to overcome the public interest in their immunity from disclosure, they being documents with a pre-eminent claim to confidentiality. The process of determining whether an order for disclosure of documents in that class should be made remains one of weighing the public interest in the maintenance of confidentiality against the public interest in the due administration of justice, but the degree of protection against disclosure which is called for by the nature of that class will dictate the paramountcy of the claim for immunity in all but quite exceptional situations.

Indeed, for our part we doubt whether the disclosure of the records of Cabinet deliberations upon matters which remain current or controversial would ever be warranted in civil proceedings. The public interest in avoiding serious damage to the proper working of government at the highest level must prevail over the interests of a litigant seeking to vindicate private rights. In criminal proceedings the position may be different.’ (emphasis added)

…

50. Cabinet documents in the form of documents recording the matters put to Cabinet for discussion (such as minutes for the consideration of Cabinet) have been held to be in the same position as records of the deliberations or decisions of Cabinet: Commonwealth v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] FCA 453; 98 FCR 31 at 42-43 [42]-[45]; Egan v Chadwick [1999] NSWCA 176; 46 NSWLR 563 at 573 [69] and J.D.Heydon, Cross on Evidence (LexisNexis Butterworths, 8th Australian ed, 2010) at p 961 [27065]. Thus, broadly, records of Cabinet deliberations and decisions and documents revealing the deliberations of Cabinet will be regarded as attracting the protection conferred by public interest immunity or by that afforded to matters of State, subject to the balancing of the competing interests. The public interest in preserving the secrecy of such documents will ordinarily be given considerable weight in the balancing process.

…

52. Conformably with the weighing or balancing process discussed in NLC and inhering within s 130 [of the Evidence Act], relevant considerations to take into account are whether the documents concern policy, the currency and contemporaneous controversiality of the subject matter, the character of the subject matter otherwise, for instance whether national security or high policy and the forensic relevance of the documents: see the Full Court in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 38; North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service Inc v Bradley [2001] FCA 1080 at [16] (Wilcox J); Betfair Pty Ltd v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140; 181 FCR 66 at [34] (Jagot J); and RP Data v Western Australian Land Information Authority [2010] FCA 922; 188 FCR 378 at [23] (Barker J)”


	
	The documents the subject of this application do not record the “actual deliberations” of Cabinet such that the statement in NLC at p. 618 that “exceptional circumstances” would need to be demonstrated before access is granted is not apposite. However, communications between Ministers concerning Cabinet proposals and advice to the Cabinet nevertheless attract the protection of public interest immunity (Sankey at p 99 per Mason J). Further, the documents the subject of this application concern the formation of policy which is a factor weighing against disclosure, however their subject matter, namely the leasing policy of the Maritime Authority, is neither controversial nor contemporaneous. The outcome of Cabinet’s deliberations has been known for many years and, while it was not the subject of much evidence, the formation of the CLP was at least touched upon during an ICAC inquiry. Overall, and bearing in mind Mr Miller’s evidence, I accept that there is a public interest that weighs against the disclosure of the documents noted in [20] to [22], but that finding is based solely on their status as either communications between Ministers about a Cabinet proposal or advice to the Cabinet and not upon any particular aspect of the CLP or the content of the communications.
	
	
	Against this must be weighed the competing public interest in the administration of justice. Each of NLC and PTTC concerned applications for the disclosure of documents for use in civil proceedings. NLC concerned proceedings to set aside an agreement between a Land Council and the Commonwealth Government on the grounds of unconscionability. PTTC concerned commercial litigation between a state owned corporation and a private company. However these are criminal proceedings, the subject matter of the charge is maladministration of political office which is said to be connected to a Cabinet decision, a number of related documents that would ordinarily be the subject of a public interest immunity claim on the same basis are either part of the Crown case or have been disclosed to the accused and the documents are sought by the accused to aid in his defence. At a level of generality above a consideration of the contents of particular documents, these factors weigh significantly in favour of disclosure.
	
	
	In Sankey at p 42, Gibbs ACJ rejected the proposition that State papers were “absolutely protected from production” instancing a potential “great injustice … in cases in which the documents were necessary to support the defence of an accused person” (see also Alister v The Queen (1983) 154 CLR 403 at 414 per Gibbs CJ, and p 456 per Brennan J). In Sankey, Cabinet documents were sought to aid a private prosecution of a former Prime Minister and senior Ministers on conspiracy charges alleged to have arisen out of their conduct while in office. According to Stephen J, in such a case a number of “particular considerations” arose from the “unusual character” of the proceedings (at p 56) which his Honour described as follows:
	


“The character of the proceedings has a triple significance. First, it makes it very likely that, for the prosecution to be successful, its evidence must include documents of a class hitherto regarded as undoubtedly the subject of Crown privilege. But, then, to accord privilege to such documents as a matter of course is to come close to conferring immunity from conviction upon those who may occupy or may have occupied high offices of State if proceeded against in relation to their conduct in those offices. Those in whom resides the power ultimately to decide whether or not to claim privilege will in fact be exercising a far more potent power: by a decision to claim privilege dismissal of the charge will be well-nigh ensured. Secondly, and assuming for the moment that there should prove to be any substance in the present charges, their character must raise doubts about the reasons customarily given as justifying a claim to Crown privilege for classes of documents, being the reasons in fact relied upon in this case. Those reasons, the need to safeguard the proper functioning of the executive arm of government and of the public service, seem curiously inappropriate when to uphold the claim is to prevent successful prosecution of the charges: inappropriate because what is charged is itself the grossly improper functioning of that very arm of government and of the public service which assists it. Thirdly, the high offices which were occupied by those charged and the nature of the conspiracies sought to be attributed to them in those offices must make it a matter of more than usual public interest that in the disposition of the charges the course of justice be in no way unnecessarily impeded. For such charges to have remained pending and unresolved for as long as they have is bad enough; if they are now to be met with a claim to Crown privilege, invoked for the protection of the proper functioning of the executive government, some high degree of public interest in non-disclosure should be shown before his privilege should be accorded.”


	
	The emphasis in this passage on ensuring that persons who occupy high office are answerable for crimes they may have committed reflects the fact that Sankey concerned an attempt to access Cabinet documents to aid in a prosecution. As noted, the present case concerns an application by the accused to obtain documents for the purposes of their defence. However, at the very least, no more restrictive approach is warranted in such cases where the accused seeks access as opposed to the prosecution. Moreover, the above passage highlights what may be implicit in the balancing test that must be applied in such cases, namely, that where the very subject matter of criminal proceedings is the alleged corruption of the processes of government, especially at a Cabinet level, a claim for public interest immunity over documents pertaining to that process is that much harder to maintain.
	


Submissions


	
	The written and oral submissions made on behalf of the State comprehensively addressed the case law concerning claims for public interest immunity over Cabinet documents and the factors warranting access being denied in this case, which in turn reflected the matters raised by Mr Miller. I have in large part accepted its analysis and placed significant weight on Mr Miller’s affidavit although, as I have stated, care needs to be taken in weighing up the competing interests in a case where the subject matter of the prosecution is the alleged corruption of government processes.
	
	
	Further, while the State was armed with full knowledge of the contents and effect of the documents which enabled it to make detailed submissions in support of matters warranting a denial of access, understandably it lacked familiarity with the aborted trial and the accused’s case, which hampered its ability to address the public interest in favour of granting access. In its written submissions, the Crown focused on the terms of the amended indictment and the Amended Crown Case Statement (see Obeid No 2 at [10]) which refer to Mr Obeid’s interactions with Mr Dunn and Mr Dunn’s interactions with Mr Scanlan. The State submitted, inter alia, that none of the documents in respect of which access was sought refer to the accused, Mr Dunn or Mr Scanlan, or any meeting they attended. Accordingly, the State submitted that the public interest in the disclosure of the documents was low.
	
	
	The difficulty with this submission is that it overlooks element (5) of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office, which requires proof beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s misconduct was serious and merited criminal punishment. The submission also overlooked Mr Oxenbould’s evidence that at some point the fate of the Circular Quay leases became bound up with the fate of the CPL. The former requires a normative assessment and it cannot be said that the boundaries of that assessment exclude a consideration of the causative impact of the alleged misconduct on the renewal of the Circular Quay leases (Obeid No 2 at [120]). The latter warrants some inquiry into the Cabinet process that led to the adoption of the CPL.
	
	
	The accused’s submissions suffered from the opposite limitation to the State’s in that he is completely familiar with the issues in the trial but, understandably, was unable to address the contents of the documents the subject of this application. His submissions noted that the Crown brief served on him included confidential Cabinet minutes, some Cabinet correspondence and Cabinet advice, and records of Cabinet decisions. He contended that the documents that are sought “are in the highest category of relevance to the real issues in dispute in the proceedings”, especially when the Crown proposes to call the former Minister who took the CLP to Cabinet, Mr Tripodi. He contended that the circumstances in which the CLP was developed, amended, submitted to the Minister, submitted to Cabinet and approved by Cabinet are relevant to a jury’s determination of each of the third to fifth elements of the offence set out in [16] above. Thus he submitted that, given the serious nature of the charge, the necessity to ensure a fair trial requires that he be granted access to the documents in question.
	
	
	It follows from the above that I accept the force of much that is submitted on behalf of the accused. However three matters should be noted. First, the documents the subject of this application do not concern the circumstances in which the CLP was developed, amended and submitted to the responsible Minister, but only the circumstances in which it was submitted to and approved by Cabinet. Second, as stated, at present I do not see that the fourth element of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office has any role to play. To date there has not been any attempt to identify any reasonable excuse or justification for Mr Obeid’s conduct. Third, I do not accept that every aspect of the development of the CLP is of significance to the prosecution case. Instead, what is significant is those aspects of the CLP that relate to the renewal of the Circular Quay leases without an open tender or a market-based expression of interest process.
	


Outcome


	
	Both parties stated that they were content for the Court to inspect the documents for the purpose of weighing up the competing interests. In Alister, Gibbs CJ stated that, in considering whether to inspect documents for the purpose of deciding whether they should be disclosed, “the Court must attach special weight to the fact that the documents may support the defence” and that, while a so-called “fishing expedition” would not be permitted, it “may be enough that it appears ‘on the cards’ that the documents will materially assist the defence” (at p 414). In this case, given the anticipated issues on retrial and that the subject of the documents is related to the very process of government that the accused is alleged to have corrupted, I was satisfied that inspection by the Court was appropriate. Having inspected the documents, I will address each in turn.

	This material consists of correspondence from Ministers to the Premier in the period November 2007 to February 2008. None of the authors of the letters nor its recipient are Crown witnesses. The letters do not refer to the accused or any Crown witness other than the basal fact that one of them is a Minister. They do not address any aspect of the CLP or any other government policy which has any relevance to the circumstances pertaining to the Circular Quay leases. The correspondence is of little utility, if any, to the defence case. The interests of justice do not outweigh the public interest in the maintenance of the secrecy of these documents. Access to these documents will be refused.
	


Pages 169 to 170 of PM-1


	
	This is a memorandum of advice dated 15 November 2007 from the Department of Premier and Cabinet concerning the CLP. The contents of the memo directly concern the abrupt change in the approach to lease renewals in the CLP that occurred in September 2007 (see [11]). The subject matter of the memorandum is of real significance to the issues in the prosecution. While it is doubtful that the accused would consider deploying it, in his case the public interest warrants his having access to it so that he might exercise care in questioning Crown witnesses including Mr Tripodi. The interests of justice and, in particular, the interest in the accused having access to this document outweighs the public interest in maintaining its secrecy. Access to this document will be granted.
	


Pages 178 to 180 of PM-1


	
	This is a letter dated 21 November 2007 from the then Minister Tripodi to the Premier. It addresses a particular consideration that weighs in favour of the adoption of the CLP. It could assist in any cross examination designed to show that Minister Tripodi’s apparent acceptance of the revised CLP was based on its merits and was completely unrelated to the accused’s intervention in the process for the renewal of the Circular Quay leases. The interests of justice and, in particular, the public interest in the accused having access to this document outweighs the public interest in maintaining its secrecy. Access to this document will be granted.
	


Proposed Orders


	
	At the hearing of this application, the parties, ICAC and the State requested the opportunity to be heard in relation to the appropriate orders necessary to give effect to the Court’s judgment. In any event, a delay between judgment and the entry of orders is appropriate. In Sankey, at p 43, Gibbs ACJ stated that no order for production of documents should be enforced “until the government concerned has had an opportunity to appeal against it, or test its correctness by some other process, if it wishes to do so”.
	
	
	Accordingly at this point I will simply indicate the orders I propose to make, but not make them, namely:
	



	
	Decline to grant the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Accused access to the documents listed in schedule 1.
	
	
	The documents listed in schedule 1 and the documents located behind Tabs 2 to 4 and 6 to 10 of exhibit PM-1 to the affidavit of Paul Miller affirmed 19 April 2016 be returned to the Independent Commission Against Corruption.
	
	
	The Accused and the Director of Public Prosecutions be granted access to the documents listed in Schedule 2.
	



	
	Instead, at this point, I will make the following orders:
	



	
	The parties, ICAC and the State of New South Wales confer in relation to the orders necessary to give effect to this judgment.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 10 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 this judgment not be published until further order.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The applicant was tried before Blackmore SC DCJ and a jury in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney. On 29 October 2013 he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to a single count on indictment as follows:

“Between about 26 January 2013 and 6 February 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did attempt to possess a substance, the substance having been unlawfully imported, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine and the quantity possessed being a commercial quantity.”


	
	The charge was brought pursuant to s 307.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code) which states:
	


“(1)   A person commits an offence if:

(a)   The person possesses a substance; and

(b)   the substance was unlawfully imported; and

(c)   the substance is a border controlled drug or border controlled plant; and

(d)   the quantity possessed is a commercial quantity.

Penalty: Imprisonment for life or 7,500 penalty units or both.

(2)   Absolute liability applies to paragraphs 1(b) and (d).

(3)   The fault element for paragraph (1)(c) is recklessness.

(4)   Subsection (1) does not apply if the person proves that he or she did

not know that the border controlled drug or border controlled plant was unlawfully imported.”


	
	It was alleged that the applicant was guilty of this charge on the basis of s 11.1 of the Code which provides that a person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.
	
	
	The applicant’s trial proceeded from 29 October 2013 to 12 November 2013. The issue at trial was duress. At the conclusion of the defence case after argument, his Honour ruled that he would not leave the issue of duress to the jury. Having no other defence, the applicant changed his plea to guilty.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction. The applicant submits that his Honour applied the incorrect test when determining whether to leave duress to the jury. He submits that had the correct test been applied, duress should have been left for the jury’s determination.
	
	
	On 17 December 2013 his Honour heard sentencing submissions. On 14 February 2014 his Honour sentenced the applicant to 8 years and 4 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months. The sentence commenced on 6 February 2013, the date of the applicant’s arrest. The applicant will be eligible for parole on 5 April 2017 and his sentence expires on 5 June 2021.
	
	
	The applicant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. The applicant submits that his Honour erred by failing to take duress into account in any respect when sentencing him.
	


The Crown case


	
	The Crown case was largely unchallenged. In late January 2013 two boxes containing paint tins were delivered to Australia from Iran by DHL couriers. The addressee was “Mr Schoening”. On 30 January 2013 a customs officer examined the contents of the boxes at the DHL “Customs Control Bond Area”. Each box contained four paint buckets. In the corner of one of the boxes was a crystal like powder which tested positive for methamphetamine.
	
	
	On 31 January 2013 the boxes were transferred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). While with the AFP the contents of the paint buckets were tested and found to contain 8.75kgs of pure methamphetamine with a wholesale value of $2.5 million and a “street value” of $8 million. The contents of the buckets were replaced with an inert substance comprising flour, sugar, methylated spirits and silicone, then resealed and placed in their original packaging.
	
	
	AFP officers made inquiries about the addressee of the boxes, Mr Schoening. On 5 February 2013 a search warrant was executed at Mr Schoening’s premises. Mr Schoening was present at the execution of that warrant. He was spoken to and the AFP determined that he was an innocent recipient of the boxes, having agreed to take delivery of them for a friend “Faraz”, without knowing their true contents. Mr Schoening intended to pass the paint buckets onto a person who it transpired was the applicant.
	
	
	On 3 February 2013 the applicant, an Iranian born German national who was studying medicine in London, flew into Australia on a temporary visa. He hired a car and rented a two bedroom apartment in Clovelly. The apartment in Clovelly had been organised in advance by the applicant’s co-offender, Reza Afrasiabi. Under the guidance of AFP officers, Mr Schoening made arrangements with the applicant to deliver the boxes to him. On 6 February 2013 in accordance with those arrangements, Mr Schoening met the applicant at the Nobbys Beach car-park in Newcastle and gave him the two boxes. After the applicant collected the boxes, he drove to Big W in Newcastle, purchased four plastic buckets and two pairs of gloves, and then drove back to the Clovelly apartment.
	
	
	On 6 February 2013 AFP officers entered the Clovelly apartment pursuant to a search warrant. The applicant was alone in the unit. There was clear plastic sheeting secured with masking tape covering the carpet of the master bedroom in the unit and eight paint buckets were on top of the plastic sheeting. In the bedroom was a screwdriver and a plastic bin with filter paper at the top secured with pegs. The bathroom was covered in plastic sheeting. AFP officers located two SIM cards, an iPhone, a Nokia phone, $2,550 in cash, a German passport belonging to the applicant and other documents.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested and taken to AFP headquarters in Sydney. In the car journey AFP officers discussed with the applicant the possibility of his participation in a controlled operation to determine who the drugs “were going through”. During this conversation the applicant informed the officers he had family in Iran. He was asked whether “these people” could get to his family and replied “No. It’s not like that.” At AFP headquarters the applicant participated in a recorded conversation with AFP officers about his willingness to assist police by taking part in a controlled operation. He was asked “And do you agree that we discussed a number of issues, including the safety and welfare of your family in Iran?” and responded “Yes”.
	
	
	The applicant called his friend, Hani, who did not answer but called him back. This call was on speaker phone. AFP officers heard the applicant tell Hani to tell his sister that he had been arrested. The applicant agreed to participate in a controlled operation and made calls to persons overseas purportedly involved in the import operation. The calls were made on loud speaker and monitored by AFP officers but not recorded. As the calls were in Farsi, AFP officers relied on the applicant to report the contents of the call. The calls were stopped when it became apparent that the recipients were aware of law enforcement involvement.
	
	
	The applicant was charged and remanded in custody. On 9 February 2013 AFP officers spoke to the applicant about whether he would provide an induced statement. During that meeting the applicant told officers that the only reason he was in Australia was because of threats to his family. The applicant agreed to provide an induced statement. Ultimately, it was not provided because AFP determined it would have no purpose. Evidence was adduced of the applicant’s communications with Mori, one of the organisers of the applicant’s participation in the import. AFP officers found a Viber message on the applicant’s phone, between the applicant and Mori, from 29 and 31 January 2013 organising accommodation, a visa and how many sheets of filter paper to take.
	
	
	Evidence of a number of intercepted and translated telephone calls between the applicant and others was also adduced. During some of these calls the applicant was given directions about how to proceed in Australia, in relation to the contents of the boxes. On 11 February 2013 the applicant’s co-offender, Mr Afrasiabi was arrested at Sydney Airport attempting to leave Australia. Mr Afrasiabi was described by AFP officers as “the shore party for the collection”.
	


Defence case


	
	The applicant did not materially challenge the Crown case. He contended that he did the acts alleged because he was acting under duress. The applicant gave evidence. He was born in September 1990 in Germany where his father was working as a gynaecologist. By 1997 the family, including the applicant, had moved back to Iran where the applicant attended school. When he was aged 17 the applicant was sent to London to complete his schooling so as to avoid compulsory military service in Iran. After gaining his A Levels he commenced tertiary studies in medicine in London in 2009.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he had never been charged with a criminal offence. He was also asked “Have you ever had any involvement with drugs at all?” and answered “Not at all”. However, this answer was later qualified. He had used illicit drugs previously but had not been involved in their supply, importation or manufacture. The applicant explained that when he initially answered the question about his involvement with drugs he “understood it as a question of “have you ever dealt with – have you ever dealt with drugs, supplied, distributed, manufactured, trafficked anything to do with that kind of stuff, not the recreational use of drugs”.
	
	
	The applicant obtained student finance from Germany and the UK to fund his medical degree. He sourced an income from the rent he received from a property he owned in Germany and money sent by his father from Iran to his sister and himself in London.
	
	
	On 19 December 2012 the applicant flew from London to Iran to spend the Christmas/New Year period in Tehran. A few days after he arrived, he got a call from a friend inviting him to a Christmas party that evening at an apartment. The applicant attended the party where he met a man named “Ashkan” who asked the applicant about his studies, his citizenship and travelling overseas. The applicant and Ashkan exchanged phone numbers. The next day the applicant received a call from Ashkan asking him to go out that evening and the applicant agreed. After driving around and getting some dinner, the applicant and his friend, Rusbai, Ashkan and his friend, Farshid, went to an apartment in a wealthy area of Tehran.
	
	
	In the apartment was a small group of people. The applicant was introduced to the owner of the apartment who was a man aged between 30 and 35 named “Ali”. Ali told the applicant that he had a company in Tehran working with countries around the world and said he was expanding into Australia. He said that he needed someone to travel to Australia, meet one of his partners, receive something and bring it back. He offered the applicant $10,000 but the applicant told him he was not interested.
	
	
	The next day the applicant received a phone call from Farshid (the friend of Ashkan) referring to Ali’s previous offer and now offering the applicant $20,000 to do it. The applicant declined again and hung up. The applicant understood that his friend Rusbai had received an equivalent offer and had indicated to the applicant that he might take it up.
	
	
	On 4 January 2013 the applicant returned to London. When he returned he made contact with his friend Hani and told him about the offer he had received in Tehran. About a week after he returned, the applicant was in his car in London waiting for Hani to buy some cigarettes. He received a call from Farshid in Iran who said “Listen Docky, we have given you an offer here that is very generous and many people here would kill for or die for, but you don’t seem to appreciate that, nor do you seem to appreciate who we are …”. Farshid told the applicant that he knew where his father’s medical practice was located, where his mother did her shopping, where his sister went to school and what car picked her up every morning. He suggested that each of his mother, father and sister might come to some harm at the hands of criminals. Hani returned to the car during the telephone call. After the call ended, the applicant told Hani about the contents of the call.
	
	
	Two days later, the applicant received two DHL parcels. Each parcel contained 17 sheets of filter paper. One of the parcels contained 30ml of what appeared to be medication. The following day the applicant received a call from Ali in Iran. He asked whether the applicant had received the parcel. The applicant said that he had but pleaded that he did not want to have anything to do with it. Ali told the applicant that he was serious and that he must promise to do what he said. He also told the applicant that he should refer to him as “Mori” and should refer to Farshid as “Arash”.
	
	
	On 17 January 2013 the applicant received a call from Arash telling him to stay at home that evening. On the evening of the same date, there was a knock on the door of the applicant’s London unit and a man handed the applicant two packages wrapped in newspaper which contained £12,500. After the delivery, the applicant received another call from Arash asking him to send the money to Rusbai, the applicant’s friend, who was by that stage in Indonesia. On 21 January 2013 the applicant “wired” Rusbai two amounts: £3,300 and then £2,700. On 22 January 2013 the applicant received a further call from Arash instructing him to send £1,300 to Mr Schoening in Australia, which he did.
	
	
	Sometime in January, the applicant was contacted and told he should prepare to travel to Australia in early February. He booked a return plane ticket with the remainder of the money he had been delivered. He was told that an apartment had been booked for him and that he would be asked to meet one of the partners and receive something which he was to take to the apartment and leave there. The applicant sent an email to his medical school head attempting to give an explanation for his impending absences from lectures. His visa for Australia came through and he flew to Australia via Korea. When he arrived, he rented a car and bought a SIM card at the airport, then drove to the real estate agent’s office where he waited until he was able to pick up the keys for the Clovelly apartment.
	
	
	The applicant was aware that he was in Australia to pick up a parcel that was said to contain paint. However, he was suspicious that it somehow involved drugs. He made a number of calls after arriving in Australia to his friend Hani in London, to Rusbai in Indonesia and to Arash or Mori in Iran. On 4 February 2013 the applicant went sightseeing in Sydney. On 5 February 2013 he received instructions from Mori telling him that he was to take delivery of the parcel the next day.
	
	
	On 6 February 2013 the applicant got a new SIM card under the fake name of “Dev Patel”, again at the instruction of Mori. The applicant drove to Newcastle to meet with Mr Schoening. He received the boxes from Mr Schoening and then called Mori, who gave him instructions to buy a number of items. The applicant purchased some buckets from Big W in Newcastle, a spatula, tape and other buckets from Big W at Rockdale when he returned to Sydney.
	
	
	By 9.20pm on 6 February the applicant had returned to the Clovelly apartment. He called Mori for further instructions and was told to cover the bathroom in plastic, then attach filter paper to the buckets he had purchased and tip the paint from the boxes received from Mr Schoening into the buckets. He was in the process of doing this when police arrived.
	
	
	After he was arrested and was in the car travelling to the police station, the applicant said that he told AFP officers that he had been controlled by people in Iran and that his family was vulnerable and in danger. After he reached the police station, the applicant called his friend Hani to let him know that he had been arrested so that Hani could “warn” his sister and notify his parents.
	
	
	The applicant agreed to participate in a controlled operation to assist police to get further information about the people who were directing him. The applicant had a number of missed calls from Mori, so he returned these calls from the police station. The first call cut out and Mori called back. During the second call Mori told the applicant not to worry as “these are just paint samples” and then hung up. Mori called again and gave the applicant names and contacts to give the paint samples to but it was clear by that point that Mori was aware that police were involved. This was the last call between the applicant and Mori.
	
	
	On 9 February 2013 the applicant spoke with a solicitor who had been organised by his sister. He also spoke to his sister who called him from London. That same day the applicant saw AFP officers again and told them “It wasn’t stupidity or greed that brought me here, but my concern for the welfare of my family”.
	
	
	The applicant’s friend, Hani, gave evidence. He said that the applicant told him in January 2013 about the offers in Tehran to pay him to pick up a parcel. He explained that he was present for part of the call from Iran when the applicant’s family was threatened. Hani said that the applicant told him about the parcel he received in London containing the filter paper and the package of money. He discussed with the applicant his options and said that the applicant was prepared to do anything to ensure his family’s safety.
	
	
	The applicant’s sister, Jasmine, gave evidence. She confirmed the applicant’s evidence about his family and financial circumstances. She also said that when she spoke to him on 9 February 2013 he asked “Are mum and dad safe?”.
	
	
	The applicant’s ex-girlfriend, Mona Nademi, gave evidence. She spoke about a time in January 2013 when the applicant appeared distant and unresponsive. She said that he told her that he was scared and became quite emotional. He also told her that his family were not safe. He refused to provide Ms Nademi with any further detail.
	
	
	A document from the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department website titled the “Transparency International Corruption Deceptions Index 2012” was tendered in the applicant’s case. It showed that Iran was ranked 133 in the world (out of 176) in terms of perceived levels of corruption.
	


Proceedings in the District Court


	
	At the conclusion of the defence case, the primary judge considered whether he would leave the issue of duress to the jury. In doing so, his Honour relied heavily upon the decision of Berman SC DCJ in R v Tan Phuong Le (No 3) [2010] NSWDC 37. It should also be noted that his Honour was not referred to s 13.3 of the Code, nor was his Honour referred to The Queen v Khazaal [2012] HCA 26; 246 CLR 610. The submissions to his Honour relied primarily on Taiapa v The Queen [2009] HCA 53; 240 CLR 95 and Oblach v The Queen [2005] NSWCCA 440; 65 NSWLR 75.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that the onus of proving that an accused was not acting under duress remained on the Crown and that it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour also noted that an accused had an evidentiary onus before the issue would be left to the jury’s consideration. His Honour said:
	


“Unless it is reasonably possible that an accused was acting under duress the judge should not allow that defence to be put to the jury. Another way of expressing the same test is whether a properly instructed jury could accept that there is a reasonable possibility that an accused was acting under duress. If the answer is no then the issue of duress should not be left to the jury’s consideration.” (Judgment 2.2)


	
	His Honour summarised the applicant’s evidence of duress and that of his three witnesses. For the purposes of deciding whether duress should be left to the jury, his Honour said that he took that evidence at its highest and accepted all that the applicant had said in evidence in chief about the threats that had been made to him.
	
	
	His Honour referred to s 10.2 of the Code and noted that this contained an objective element. His Honour observed:
	


“The place of an objective test in defence of duress is the recognition of the circumstance that the defence operates to excuse misconduct. Duress does not operate because an accused's conduct was involuntary but it is a concession to him in frailty.” (Judgment 3.3)


	
	On that issue the primary judge relied upon the observation of Spigelman CJ at [57] in Oblach:
	


“57   … To introduce a focus on the “personal characteristics of (the) particular accused” (R v Conlon [1993] 69 A Crim R 92) or “the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be” (R v Hawes [1994] 35 NSWLR 294) is to reintroduce a subjective element which is inconsistent with the text of s10.2.”


	
	His Honour identified his task as follows:
	


“… I do not need to decide anything in relation to subs (2)(a) because, even taking the accused as he was at the time and assuming the truth of his evidence-in-chief, I am satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that a jury would find that there were reasonable grounds for the accused's beliefs, that there was no reasonable way that the threat could be rendered ineffective and that his conduct was a reasonable response to the threat. It is important to understand that when looking at s 10 the focus is on whether the threat could be rendered ineffective and, in particular, whether the accused reasonably believed that there was no reasonable way that the threat could be rendered ineffective. Thus consideration as to the nature of the accused's conduct, how serious it was and how illegal it was do not come into play. Those considerations will come into play very much with regard to subpara (2)(c).” (Judgment 5.5)


	
	His Honour then reviewed the factual circumstances, which have been set out above. Having done so, his Honour said:
	


“Taking the accused's evidence at its highest, supported as it is to an extent by the evidence of Hani, and also by his girlfriend, Mona, a jury could accept that a threat to the lives of the accused's parents and sister in Tehran had been made and that as a result he felt compelled to act on the threat by complying with the orders of Ali and Arash, but of course that is only one leg of the statutory test for duress, set out above.

The real issue was whether there was no reasonable way that the threat could be rendered ineffective and whether his conduct was in fact a reasonable response to the threat that was made. Reasonableness in this context is not designed to allow people to choose for themselves whether to obey the law.” (Judgment 10.4)


	
	His Honour reviewed the evidence of the applicant to the effect that there was no reasonable way that the threat to his family could be rendered ineffective. In relation to the applicant’s failure to warn his parents in Tehran, the primary judge observed that there was clear evidence that his parents were sufficiently wealthy to have bought air tickets to leave the country immediately, that they held German citizenship and owned houses in Germany. His sister owned a property in England. By way of comment, his Honour said:
	


“Clearly it would have been highly inconvenient to simply up and leave the country for a short period of time, but the alternative was that the accused would carry out a very serious crime. Further, the commission of the crime was going to take quite some period of time to complete.

When he had completed the task assigned there was no guarantee that his parents would be safe. All it would have proved is that he was an effective agent to use in such ventures. In other words by leaving them in harm's way he effectively left himself open for a similar approach to be made again. The only way to avoid any of those consequences was to advise the parents and his sister to move.” (Judgment 11.7)


	
	His Honour rejected the reasons put forward by the applicant for not telling his family of the threats and said:
	


“I do not accept the reasons provided by the accused could be found by a jury as a reasonable basis for not informing his family of the threat and leaving at least up to them to decide whether to leave or not. His father was not a child. He was a doctor who had trained in Germany and was now living in Tehran.

If the accused wanted to impress on his father the seriousness of the threat he had a number of further avenues potentially available for him.” (Judgment 12.6)


	
	The primary judge observed that the applicant could have approached the British police, Interpol or even the Australian police to assist in advising his family of the nature of the threat and its seriousness. His Honour took into account that the applicant knew next to nothing about the persons making the threat and therefore the likelihood of them implementing it. His Honour further observed that once the family were safe, other options could have been explored by the applicant to nullify the threat. His Honour took into account that not only did the applicant have available to him the British, German or Interpol police but he could also have reported the matter to the Australian police which would have been another obvious course to take. His Honour found:
	


“No jury could otherwise than conclude that this was a reasonable way to effectively nullify the threat without the accused carrying out the crime for which he is charged.” (Judgment 14.5)


	
	The primary judge observed that the safety of the applicant’s family in Iran did not materially change from the time that he arrived in Australia intent on carrying out the offence to when he was arrested and agreed to assist the police. When he entered that agreement with the police he did not know that the alleged threat would not be carried out. His Honour considered that to suggest that the police in Australia would not have been able to create a scenario that made it appear that the applicant had been arrested on the one hand whilst at the same time using him to assist them was fanciful. His Honour further noted that no cross-examination was undertaken of the police called in the case to suggest that they could not carry out such a task.
	
	
	His Honour’s final observation was that the offence was very serious and had the potential to affect thousands of people. In those circumstances, mere inconvenience would never be sufficient to make out duress.
	


The appeal – submissions and consideration


	
	In relation to his conviction, the applicant relied upon a single ground of appeal:
	


His Honour applied the wrong test or otherwise erred in determining that duress should not be left to the jury.


	
	Section 10.2 of the Code provides:
	


“(1)    A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence under duress.

(2)    A person carries out conduct under duress if and only if he or she reasonably believes that:

(a)    a threat has been made that will be carried out unless an offence is committed; and

(b)    there is no reasonable way that the threat can be rendered ineffective; and

(c)    the conduct is a reasonable response to the threat.

(3) This section does not apply if the threat is made by or on behalf of a person with whom the person under duress is voluntarily associating for the purpose of carrying out conduct of the kind actually carried out.”


	
	Section 13.3 of the Code provides:
	


“13.3(1) (1) Subject to section 13.4, a burden of proof that a law imposes on a defendant is an evidential burden only.

(2)    A defendant who wishes to deny criminal responsibility by relying on a provision of Part 2.3 (other than section 7.3) bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

(3)    A defendant who wishes to rely on any exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided by the law creating an offence bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter. The exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification need not accompany the description of the offence.

(4)    The defendant no longer bears the evidential burden in relation to a matter if evidence sufficient to discharge the burden is adduced by the prosecution or by the court.

(5)    The question whether an evidential burden has been discharged is one of law.

(6) In this Code:

evidential burden, in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist.”


	
	It was common ground that the words “reasonably believes” in s 10.2(2) of the Code require that the actual belief held by the person must be objectively justifiable, taking into account the objective circumstances of the person, but not their personal circumstances or the circumstances as they perceive them to be (Spigelman CJ and Hulme J in Oblach v R at [55] – [60] and [88] – [93]).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that when one applies s 13.3 of the Code the question is not [as his Honour specified] whether there is a reasonable possibility that a matter exists or whether there is a reasonable possibility that a jury could accept that a matter exists. Rather, it is the text of s 13.3, in particular s 13.3(6), which must be applied not the general law. (As already indicated, the reason why his Honour applied the test which he did is because he was not referred to s 13.3).
	
	
	The applicant emphasised the word “suggests” where appearing in s 13.3(6). He submitted that all that was necessary for him to do was to suggest the reasonable possibility of the existence of a relevant matter, i.e. duress. The applicant submitted that this sets out a low threshold whereby the defence need only adduce or point to evidence that places before the Court “for consideration” a particular defence. In that regard, the applicant relied upon the observation of the plurality (Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ) in The Queen v Khazaal where their Honours said:
	


“73   …The dispute was narrowly confined: was the evidential burden (as defined in s 13.3(6)) discharged in respect of the respondent's reliance on s 101.5(5) so as to require a direction from the trial judge in the terms proposed by the respondent?

74   It may be accepted that the respondent was right to contend that the operative words in s 13.3(6), ""adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility"" in relation to the relevant negative state of affairs in s 101.5(5) required no more than slender evidence. The prosecution did not disagree. It may also be accepted that, for the purposes of establishing whether the evidential burden (as defined in s 13.3(6)) has been discharged, the evidence may be taken at its most favourable to the accused.”


	
	The applicant submitted that in accordance with The Queen v Khazaal, s 13.3 merely requires consideration of whether the defendant is able to point to “no more than slender evidence” that suggests a reasonable possibility of each of the requirements of duress under s 10.2. He submitted that it also requires that evidence is taken at its most favourable to the accused. The applicant submitted that his Honour erred not only in failing to consider s 13.3 of the Code but in not considering The Queen v Khazaal which was decided after the decision of Berman DCJ in Le   .
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in deciding to remove the defence of duress from the jury, the primary judge made a number of evaluative judgments about the evidence. The applicant submitted that in so doing, his Honour went further than was required to determine whether he (the applicant) had discharged the evidential burden. The applicant submitted that the primary judge also failed to consider the evidence at its most favourable to him and took into account inferences to be drawn in favour of the prosecution.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that each of the following findings made by the primary judge disclosed such an error.
	



	
	The applicant should have told his family about the threat so that they could leave Iran as this was the only way to avoid the possibility that he would be asked to offend again. The applicant's reasons for not informing his family were not reasonable.
	
	
	The applicant could have approached police to help him advise his father about the seriousness of the threat. The applicant’s belief that police could not assist him was not reasonable.
	
	
	The circumstances in which the threats were said to have been made did not disclose any reason for the applicant to believe that the threats were “even real”.
	
	
	Organising for his family to leave Iran as an alternative to carrying out the offence “might have involved some temporary inconvenience or even long term inconvenience” but appeared to be a reasonable course.
	
	
	The applicant could have informed police in Australia of the threats and “to suggest that the police in Australia would not have been able to create a scenario that made it appear that the accused had been arrested on the one hand whilst at the same time using him to assist them is frankly fanciful”.
	



	
	The applicant submitted that it was sufficient that his Honour was able to identify evidence that suggested the existence of each of the limbs of duress. He was not required to proceed further and to assess whether the evidence was credible or reasonable or establish that there was a reasonable possibility that he was acting under duress. The evidence needed to be no more than “slender” as that term was used in The Queen v Khazaal.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that a trial judge should exercise caution before withdrawing a defence from a jury. On this issue the applicant relied upon Lindsay v R [2015] HCA 16; 319 ALR 207 in relation to the partial defence of provocation. French CJ (Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ agreeing) emphasised the need for caution before deciding to take the partial defence away from the jury, recognising that the particular defence is a concession to human frailty, involves both subjective and objective elements, and that “an assessment of the response of the ordinary person to the outrage which the provocative conduct might have engendered in the accused, will usually depend upon a range of possible findings” (at [28]). French CJ endorsed the need for restraint in such decisions “lest the court usurp the function of the jury” (at [39]).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the defence of duress even under the Code is not unlike the partial defence of provocation in that it also is a concession to human frailty involving subjective and objective elements where assessment of the ordinary person’s response to the threats will depend on a range of findings. The applicant submitted that the need for restraint in removing a defence from the jury’s consideration applies equally to duress.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s failure to apply the correct test in deciding whether to leave the defence of duress to the jury engaged s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) because it was a wrong decision on a question of law. The applicant submitted that if the correct test had been applied with the necessary restraint, his Honour should not have withdrawn the applicant’s defence of duress from the jury. He submitted that in withdrawing the defence, the applicant lost a real chance of an acquittal such that the Court would be persuaded that a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.
	


Consideration


	
	As earlier noted, the primary judge was not given the assistance to which he was entitled when considering this matter. His Honour should have been referred to s 13.3 of the Code and should have been referred to The Queen v Khazaal. The absence of that assistance gave rise to a risk that his Honour might err when applying s 10.2 of the Code.
	
	
	I have concluded that the submissions by the applicant in support of the ground of appeal should be accepted and that the appeal against conviction should be allowed.
	
	
	Some further elucidation of the meaning to be given to s 13.3(6) was provided by French CJ on this issue, although the Chief Justice was not part of the plurality in The Queen v Khazaal. On this issue, French CJ said:
	


“11   The reference to He Kaw Teh in the Explanatory Memorandum tends to suggest that the definition of ""evidential burden"" in s 13.3(6) was not intended to change the general law. The term ""reasonable possibility"" was used by this Court in Taiapa v The Queen in relation to the evidential burden on an accused to raise the defence of compulsion under s 31(1)(d) of the Criminal Code (Q). The Court referred to the ""evidential burden"" as requiring the accused to ""identify some basis in the evidence raising as a reasonable possibility the existence of reasonable grounds for his belief"". Nevertheless, it is the text of s 13.3(3), rather than the general law, that must be applied in determining whether an evidential burden imposed by the Code has been discharged.

12   A defendant bears the evidential burden, as defined, in relation to a defence under s 101.5(5). If that burden is discharged, the prosecution bears the legal burden of negativing the defence beyond reasonable doubt. The statutory collocation ""evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility"" is not readily amenable to translation into other terms. But, applying the ordinary meaning of the words of the definition, it is sufficient for the disposition of the Crown's appeal that s 13.3(3), read with s 13.3(6), requires evidence that is at least capable of supporting the inference that the matter to which the evidential burden applies ""exists or does not exist."" This approach reflects the general law position with respect to the evidential burden. If no such inference is able to be drawn from the evidence there is no logical basis for saying that the evidence suggests that inference as a reasonable possibility. Evidence which is merely consistent with or not inconsistent with such a possibility does not ""suggest"" it. The interaction of the ""evidence"" and the ""possibility"" in such a case may be like that of ships passing in the night. Importantly, as s 13.3(5) provides, the question whether an evidential burden has been discharged is one of law. In that respect also the Code and the general law coincide.”


	
	By not applying s 13.3 of the Code to the evidence of duress before him, his Honour applied too stringent a test. Moreover, by challenging in a number of respects the evidence of the applicant as to his process of reasoning, his Honour went beyond what was required by s 10.2 of the Code and trespassed in part, on the function to be performed by the jury. By setting out inferences favourable to the Crown, it could not be said that his Honour was treating the evidence at its most favourable to the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence taken at its most favourable to the applicant and corroborated in part by his friend Hani and his sister Jasmine, was sufficient to discharge his evidentiary burden in respect of the three limbs of duress in s 10.2(2) of the Code.
	
	
	There was no issue that the applicant had discharged the burden in relation to the first limb of duress – s 10.2(2)(a) and his Honour so found.
	
	
	In relation to the second limb – s 10.2(2)(b), the applicant provided an explanation for why he did not tell his family of the threat and why he had not contacted the authorities. The effect of his evidence was as follows. He thought about contacting the British police, but did not do so because he did not think that they would be able to do anything in Iran (T.288). He was concerned that if he told the British police and they were ineffective, it would put himself in jeopardy if he then decided to comply with the directions coming from Iran. He thought about contacting police in Iran but did not do so because of the risk that he would put himself in jeopardy and because of the inefficiency and systemic corruption which he perceived in that police force (T.289-90). He thought about telling his father about the threat but did not do so because of his father’s health problems and the risk that the stress of it would debilitate him further in circumstances where he doubted that his father could respond to the threats in any event (T.292). The applicant concluded that “The only way in which I could absolutely guarantee that no harm was going to come to my family is if I do as I am told” (T.292.7).
	
	
	In cross-examination he was asked about alternative ways of dealing with the threats and gave this evidence:
	


He did not mention the threats to his older sister because if he did, she would be certain to tell his parents.

He did not give his family the option to leave Iran because it would be asking too much of them and by raising the threats with his family, his father might wish to do something other than leave, such that the situation “could get a lot messier and a lot worse than it already is” (T.454).

He did not attend the Iranian Embassy or Consulate because they were closed in London at the time (T.457).

He could have attended the Germany Embassy to seek advice but “to what end” (T.457).

He could have spoken to German police about the threats when he went there on 30 January 2013 to deal with an unrelated court matter but did not do so for the same reasons that he did not approach the British police (T.458).

He did not speak to the Customs Officers in Australia because he was afraid that it would put the whole plan in jeopardy and anger the people in Iran making the threats (T.458).

He thought about contacting the Australian authorities after arriving in Australia but was worried about what would happen when he returned to the UK (T.458).


	
	This evidence discharged the slender evidentiary burden required of the applicant under s 13.3. All that s 13.3 of the Code required was evidence that suggested the reasonable possibility of the existence of duress as defined. The detailed evidence of the applicant was sufficient. It then became a matter for the jury to assess that evidence in the context of the overall Crown case and decide whether the Crown had negatived duress.
	
	
	In relation to the third limb of duress – s 10.2(2)(c), the applicant did not give evidence in chief that directly answered the question of whether he had a belief that assisting in the importation of drugs was a reasonable response to the threat to the lives of his family. However, there was a clear inference to that effect from his evidence that he believed that the threat was genuine and was concerned that if he did not do as he was told, the threat may come to fruition (T.288, T.294). The applicant appreciated that what he was being asked to do likely involved drugs (T.441). He gave evidence that he considered lawful ways of dealing with the threats and came to the conclusion that these would be ineffective and that he must comply “because of what was at stake” (T.487.31).
	
	
	On the basis of this evidence, there was an available inference that the applicant reasonably believed that assisting in the importation of drugs was a reasonable response to the threats of harm (including death) against his family. As recognised by French CJ in The Queen v Khazaal, evidence that is capable “of supporting the inference that the matter to which the evidential burden applies exists or does not exist” will be sufficient to discharge the burden (at [12]). That issue also should have been left to the jury.
	
	
	It is not necessary in these reasons to consider the effect of the applicant’s plea of guilty after his defence of duress was taken away from the jury. It was conceded by the Crown that the plea of guilty was brought about by the ruling that the issue of duress would not be left to the jury’s consideration. Further, it was common ground that duress was the predominant issue in the trial, if not the only real issue. In R v Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218 Street CJ held that where a plea of guilty was entered following a ruling by the trial judge admitting over objection, inadmissible and prejudicial evidence in the Crown case, it was the admission of that evidence with the consequential significance attaching to it in the accused’s mind, which was the predominating factor leading to the change of plea. Accordingly, Street CJ held that the plea of guilty must be regarded as tainted. The same principle applies here.
	


The proviso


	
	The Crown submits that, should the conviction appeal be made out, this is a proper case for the appeal to be dismissed upon the application of the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act because no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.
	
	
	On that issue, the Crown relied upon Giourtalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 216 where Bathurst CJ (Hidden and Button JJ agreeing) said (at [84] – [88]) that recent cases on the proviso had emphasised that it is a necessary but not always sufficient precondition for the operation of the proviso that the appellate court be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the guilt of the accused. If the court is not satisfied of that matter, it cannot conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred. In considering this matter, the Court is performing essentially the same function as when it decides whether a jury verdict should be set aside as unreasonable.
	
	
	Giourtalis v R held that there were no universally applicable criteria as to when it would be inappropriate for a court to apply the proviso, even though it was satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The primary question was whether there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that having regard to the primary judge’s acceptance that the applicant had satisfied the test under s 10.2(2)(a) of the Code the relevant evidence was that of the applicant bearing on the requirements of ss 10.2(2)(b) and (c) which was supported, to a limited extent, by his witnesses. The Crown submitted that if the primary judge erred as pleaded in the conviction ground of appeal, this Court would still be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred and dismiss the appeal. The Crown submitted that assuming such error, the primary judge’s statement of reasons for withdrawing duress from the jury’s consideration was consistent with the test in s 13.3 of the Code, complied with the requirements of s 10.2(2) and was supported by the authorities on the latter, particularly Oblach v The Queen.
	
	
	Guidance on the application of the proviso was provided by the High Court in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300. There the Court said:
	


“35   The fundamental task committed to the appellate court by the common form of criminal appeal statute is to decide the appeal. In so far as that task requires considering the proviso, it is not to be undertaken by attempting to predict what a jury (whether the jury at trial or some hypothetical future jury) would or might do. Rather, in applying the proviso, the task is to decide whether a ""substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"".

…

41   That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognising that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself.”


	
	Here, the issue of duress was incorrectly taken from the jury. The issue of duress was the primary, if not the only, question before the jury. The jury, unlike this Court, had the benefit of seeing and hearing the applicant and his witnesses give evidence on this question. Even though this Court may have reservations as to the veracity of some of that evidence, the Court has to take account of the “natural limitations” preventing it from reaching a final conclusion on that issue. The question of duress was a quintessential jury question which required the jury to make an assessment of the veracity and reliability of the applicant and his witnesses.
	
	
	It follows that on the facts of this case, a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred in that the very raison d'être for the trial was taken away from the jury. The applicant has not had a trial according to law. In those circumstances, the proviso should not be applied. The applicant is entitled to a new trial.
	


Sentence appeal


	
	In view of the conclusion which I have reached in relation to the conviction appeal, it is not appropriate for this Court to consider the appeal against sentence.
	


Conclusion


	
	The appeal against conviction is allowed.
	
	
	The applicant’s conviction for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug is quashed.
	
	
	There should be a re-trial on that count.

2769318,Riddell v R [2016] NSWCCA 70,"Judgment OF THE COURT

Conviction, sentence and appeal


	
	The Appellant was charged with conspiring to import into Australia a commercial quantity of MDMA in contravention of s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The indictment charged a conspiracy between 1 May 2002 and 26 April 2003. The pure weight of MDMA was 136.9 kilograms, over 250 times the commercial quantity.
	
	
	The Appellant stood trial before his Honour Judge Hosking and a jury. The first trial that took place between 4 July 2005 and 29 September 2005 resulted in the jury being unable to agree on a verdict.
	
	
	The retrial commenced on 14 September 2006, also before Hosking DCJ and a jury, and concluded on 31 January 2007. A jury, at that stage reduced to 11 because of the discharge of a juror, returned a verdict of guilty on 31 January 2007. Hosking DCJ sentenced the Appellant to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 19 years to commence 26 April 2003 (the date of his arrest) and expiring 25 April 2022.
	
	
	The Appellant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in respect of the conviction and the sentence on 20 August 2007. He subsequently filed four Notices of Application for Extension of Time to Appeal with the latest being on 22 February 2009 which extended the Notice of Intention to Appeal until 22 April 2009. On 7 November 2012 the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal in respect of conviction and sentence and a “Notice of application for extension of period within which notice of intention to appeal to apply for leave has effect” and Grounds of Appeal. By the time the Appellant filed the Notice of Appeal it was a little over three years and six months out of time.
	
	
	The Appellant, although represented at the trials, has acted for himself in respect of the appeal.
	
	
	This appeal was listed for hearing on 23 October 2015. On that day and in the circumstances described in this judgment the Applicant sought an adjournment of his appeal. After substantial argument the Court refused the application. The presiding judge, Adams J, stated that reasons would be provided in due course. After the refusal of the adjournment on 23 October 2015 argument on the appeal proceeded. After the Applicant was granted leave to rely on very lengthy written submissions, the appeal was adjourned part heard until 1 April 2016 to enable the Crown to file submissions in response. On the resumed hearing of the appeal on 1 April 2016 the Applicant ultimately withdrew his appeal against conviction and notice of appeal against sentence. This judgment constitutes the Court’s reasons for the refusal of the adjournment on 23 October 2015.
	
	
	The document headed “Grounds of Appeal” does not clearly articulate grounds of appeal. The document is discursive and repetitive. It contains 15 paragraphs which have been distilled by the Crown into 11 grounds as follows:
	


1.   Judicial bias (both actual and apprehended): specifically, that the trial judge's conduct of the retrial was not impartial due to knowledge his Honour gained from the e first trial ('the bias ground”).

2.   The Crown Prosecutor failed to discharge his duty, causing the trial to miscarry ('the conduct of the prosecutor ground”).

3.   The trial miscarried because the trial judge erroneously admitted evidence from outside the indictment period (fraudulent, fabricated and inadmissible opinion/perjury, which was calculated to mislead) and did so without notice ('the indictment period ground”).

4.   The trial miscarried because the trial judge admitted voice identification evidence in relation to telephone intercept material and visual identification evidence in relation to Francois into Evidence ('the identification evidence ground”).

5.   The trial miscarried because of the non-disclosure of information and documents required to be disclosed' pursuant to the rules of discovery, interrogatories and subpoenas, and related issues ('the non-disclosure ground”).

6.   The trial miscarried in relation to the evidence of the witness Small because the trial judge:

a)   granted leave to the Crown to move the evidence of Small (a Crown witness favourable to Riddell) from the end of the trial to the start;

b)   granted leave to the Crown to cross-examine Small;

c)   'despatched' (over objection) a s.165 warning in relation to Small's evidence; and

d)   admitted into evidence (over objection) a misleading summary of the Crown case, 'speciously employing Small's dislocation as the precondition';

(“the evidence of Small ground”)

7.   The trial miscarried because the trial judge:

a)   failed to discharge the jury after a 'deliberate, considered, carefully weighed, and baseless outburst by the trial judge' designed to mislead the jury and give rise to hostility in the court;

b)   dismissed a juror after the outburst; and

c)   failed to discharge the remaining jurors after the single juror was dismissed;

(“the discharge application ground”).

8.   To the extent not otherwise addressed, the trial miscarried because of numerous evidentiary rulings, discretions and directions, including:

a)   admission into Evidence of various documents;

b)   admission into evidence of TI and LD material;

c)   rulings on the ambit of cross-examination;

d)   rulings on recall of witnesses; and

e)   directions to jury;

(“the rulings, discretions and directions ground”).

9.   The trial miscarried because the trial judge delivered a 'wholly irregular, unbalanced, unfair, misleading, and prolix, summing up' ('the summing up ground):

10.   The trial judge's sentencing discretion miscarried (“the sentence ground”)

11.   The conviction was unsafe, unjust and unreasonable because of:

a)   the errors and aggregation of errors in other grounds; and

b)   the nature, quality and sufficiency of the evidence.


	
	We agree that the Crown’s distillation correctly identifies the matters raised in the document headed “Grounds of Appeal”.
	


Factual background


	
	On 15 April 2003, a shipping container landed at the port of Fremantle in Western Australia (destined for Sydney) on board the ship P&O Nedlloyd Adelaide Voyager 63 South. The container had been shipped from Port Klang in Malaysia on 9 April 2003 but originated in the Netherlands.
	
	
	Inside the container were 36 freezers, three of which were packed with approximately 171 kilograms of whitish powder containing a high percentage of MDMA (with a pure weight of 136.9 kilograms). The AFP estimated its street value at approximately $92 million. Federal Agent Brett Smith gave evidence that this sum was capable of being turned into approximately one and a half million ecstasy tablets at 25% purity.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the Appellant was the Australian principal in the conspiracy. Significant persons involved in the conspiracy were Johannes Francois, Wai Kwong Chen and a man known as De Jong, all of whom lived in The Netherlands. Other co-conspirators included Dano Milicic, Nicholas Pollis, Craig Small, Matthew Walsh, James Whatley, Jessica Somogyi and Mrs Cheng.
	
	
	Milicic, Pollis, Small, Walsh and Whatley were said to be subordinate to the Appellant. The Appellant’s role was at least equal to that of Francois, both of whom were near the top of the international conspiracy, with De Jong at the top of the hierarchy. Francois, a professional drug dealer in Europe, wanted to export drugs to Australia but did not want to come here himself. He met his co-conspirators on neutral territory such as in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Belgium.
	
	
	Cheng's role was more senior than Pollis', and was described on sentence as 'highly significant’. Pollis played a mid-range role within the syndicate, and attended and arranged meetings between Cheng and more junior members of the syndicate. Milicic's role was below that of Pollis but above that of Walsh in the group's hierarchy. Walsh's role was above that of Small, but below that of the others. Small played a junior role, confined to customs clearance.
	
	
	The Appellant recruited Pollis, who worked for him at his media event business in Surry Hills, Loop Domain Pty Ltd ('Loop Domain'). Pollis in turn recruited Milicic, Walsh, Whatley, Somogyi and Small, with the Appellant’s knowledge.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that the Appellant initially met with Francois and Cheng in Amsterdam in late 2001 and again in Malaysia in January 2002, where they had business discussions that did not relate to the importation of drugs. The Appellant had business experience in the fields of marketing, dotcom businesses, laser games arcades and the running of bars and in travel businesses, and had a legitimate interest in Cheng's computer business, IT Castle, and assisted Cheng with marketing advice.
	
	
	Subsequently, the Appellant met with Cheng and Francois in Hong Kong and with Cheng in Sydney on a number of occasions for the purposes of the conspiracy and spoke to both of them on the phone. The Appellant directly dealt with Francois and Cheng about the timing of the importation and matters related to its organisation including in what goods to conceal the drugs. For example, in late November 2002, the Appellant met with Cheng and Francois in Hong Kong to discuss importing the drugs in computer monitors and offering to sell them to an Australian company established by Walsh, Whatley (and possibly Milicic) called Muma International, to try to make it look like a legitimate business transaction
	
	
	The Appellant introduced Pollis to Cheng in mid-August 2002 for the purposes of the conspiracy, knowing that Pollis would introduce Cheng to Whatley. The Appellant was further aware that Whatley was subsequently replaced by Small in 2003 and that Small was introduced to Cheng by Pollis for the purposes of the conspiracy.
	
	
	The key steps in the conspiracy undertaken by the Appellant, on the Crown case, can be summarised as:
	


(a)   meeting with Francois and Cheng in Amsterdam in December 2002 before the conspiracy commenced, subsequently meeting with Cheng for the purposes of the conspiracy in Hong Kong and Sydney, and meeting with Cheng and Francois for the purposes of the conspiracy in Hong Kong and having phone conversations with each of Cheng and Francois for the purposes of the conspiracy at various times;

(b)   the recruitment of Pollis and through him, either directly or indirectly, the recruitment of Milicic, Walsh, Whatley, Somogyi and Small;

(c)   introducing Pollis to Cheng in mid-August 2002 for the purposes of the conspiracy knowing that Pollis would introduce Cheng to Whatley, his subsequent awareness of the replacement of Whatley by Small, and the introduction of Cheng to Small by Pollis for the purposes of the conspiracy;

(d)   direct dealings with Francois and with Cheng in relation to the timing of the importation and matters related to its organisation; and

(e)   acting as a conduit between Australian-based members of the conspiracy and Cheng, for example:

(i)   arranging meetings between Cheng, Pollis and Whatley on 18 August 2002 at the Mansions Hotel in Kings Cross and at the Centennial Hotel in Woollahra on 8 December 2002, and attending meetings with Cheng and Pollis but leaving before Whatley arrived, which on the Crown case was not a coincidence;

(ii)   arranging for Cheng to meet Whatley at the Clock Hotel in Surry Hills in October 2002 while Pollis was away in Melbourne;

(iii)   resolving the email problems between Likom (a company established by Cheng in Malaysia for the purposes of the conspiracy, which was offering to sell Muma International computer monitors at low prices) and Muma International, suggesting Cheng send through another email and a fax; a number of telephone intercepts recorded these coded exchanges between the Appellant and Cheng including calls C346, 351, 361, 372 and 374;

(iv)   making a payphone call to Cheng on Cheng's 'Ma Yu' covert phone (named after the woman who purchased the phone for Cheng in China Town) on 20 February 2003; and

(v)   phoning Cheng's girlfriend in Shenzhen on 25 April 2003, as arranged with Cheng, after the MDMA had arrived in Sydney to confirm that everything was okay with the shipment of the container; the Appellant and Cheng had met at the Loop Domain office the previous day and that the Appellant told him he thought the office was bugged so they agreed that the Appellant would contact Cheng through his girlfriend; however, unbeknownst to the Appellant, Cheng had been arrested on 24 April 2003 on his way to the airport to catch a flight out of Australia.


	
	The Appellant was arrested on 26 April 2003.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that the Appellant’s involvement in the conspiracy may have been motivated by financial gain. He was the managing director and principal shareholder of Loop Domain, into which he had invested substantial capital. The evidence demonstrated that the company was encountering serious financial difficulties in the months leading up to the importation.
	
	
	The evidence against the Appellant, on the Crown case, included both direct and circumstantial evidence. The direct evidence was that of the co-conspirators Pollis and Cheng, which was supported by the telephone intercept and surveillance evidence. The circumstantial evidence, which on the Crown case was sufficient in itself to prove the case against the Appellant, was primarily the contents of intercepted telephone calls.
	
	
	Cheng, Pollis, Walsh, Milicic and Small all pleaded guilty to their involvement in the conspiracy. Small was the first to enter a plea of guilty on 31 October 2003, followed by Pollis on 23 February 2004, Cheng on 14 February 2005, Walsh on 23 June 2005 and Milicic on 21 February 2006. Cheng, Pollis and Small all signed undertakings to provide evidence at their co-conspirators' trials, including the Appellant’s. Pollis, Small and Cheng were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for their parts in the conspiracy.
	
	
	Whatley had formerly worked for Ansett Airlines in freight forwarding and was relied on by the conspirators for his knowledge of Australian importation and Customs procedures and documentation. He was arrested on 31 October 2002 and agreed to assist police straight away. From that time until mid-February 2003 he was working as an informant for the AFP. He was not charged and was indemnified for his role by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. He was also indemnified by the New South Wales Attorney-General in relation to his local drug dealing.
	
	
	Walsh told Pollis on 1 February 2003 that he no longer worked with Whatley because of some kind of falling out between them but he had a replacement in Small. Small worked for a firm which contracted to a company called Maersk Logistics, an international company dealing in import logistics and freight forwarding.
	
	
	Somogyi was charged but the charges against her were discontinued.
	
	
	As the Crown understands it, Francois resides in the Netherlands and has not been apprehended or charged in relation to the matter.
	
	
	Whatley, Cheng, Pollis and Small each gave evidence at the Appellant’s trials. Cheng and Pollis's evidence directly implicated the Appellant, but Small's did not. Small had never met or spoken to the Appellant. Walsh and Whatley had never met the Appellant either but Whatley stated he had heard of the involvement of a person called 'Andy’ high up in the conspiracy, who the Crown alleged was the Appellant.
	


The adjournment application


	
	When the appeal was called on for hearing the Appellant appeared for himself. However, Mr Waterstreet of counsel, who with Mr Michael King of counsel had represented the Appellant at the trials, sought leave to appear as amicus curiae to assist the court any way he could, particularly because of his knowledge of what transpired at the trials. Leave was given to Mr Waterstreet but on a limited basis. The Court was of the view that care was necessary because acknowledgments or statements by Mr Waterstreet concerning events at the trial could not now bind the Appellant who had not instructed Mr Waterstreet at the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	At the outset of the hearing of the appeal the Appellant sought an adjournment. The Crown opposed the adjournment. Two bases were put forward by the Appellant.
	


(a)   First basis – lack of readiness


	
	The first basis was more particularly articulated in the 36 page document attached to a summons filed by the Appellant on 28 April 2015 (the filing of the summons is referred to below). The matter is identified in paragraph 5 and Part II paragraphs 53 to 58.
	
	
	The Appellant said that he need an adjournment to complete what he said was the necessary cross-referencing by him of the transcript in respect of the various grounds of appeal which he sought to put forward. He said that completion of this had not been possible for a variety of reasons. A great deal of the work that he had done some time ago was lost as a result of various moves he had experienced between prisons. That resulted in the loss of both hard copy documents that he had prepared and the loss of material on a laptop. The Appellant said that he had subsequently been rebuilding the material so that he was in an adequate position to argue his appeal.
	
	
	The Appellant said that he lodged his grounds of appeal in 2012 after Corrective Services removed trial and legal materials from his cell. His full analyses and transcript references were unavailable at the time of lodging the Grounds of Appeal because they had been destroyed when the security box housing his personal computer had been bolt cropped in 2008 and peripherals including a hard drive had gone missing. He said further that vital judgments, transcripts and exhibits remained unproduced and he noted that trial recordings had not been made available so that redacted transcripts could be reinstated to reflect the true record. He said that he had rebuilt the grounds (scil. submissions?) at a rate of nine hours per week from 2009 to 2012.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that he required six months unfettered PC access so that he could rebuild matters of fact and apply the law. He complained about the limited number of hours per week that he was able to access the material that he had and his computer to do what he called the rebuilding of the material. He submitted that all the necessary material had not been made available despite the multiple attempts by him to obtain it. He blamed Corrective Services for destroying his material and not giving him sufficient time with a computer to rebuild it.
	


(b)   Second basis – need for affidavits


	
	The second basis put forward was raised, apparently for the first time, at the hearing of the appeal. That was that the Appellant wished to obtain affidavits from Mr Waterstreet and Mr King about particular incidents at the trial that were not apparent from reading the transcript that was available.
	
	
	This matter was first raised by Mr Waterstreet and not the Appellant, but once the matter was raised the Appellant sought to rely upon it. It was raised only as a side wind when the question of whether Mr Waterstreet could appear for the Appellant as amicus was being discussed.
	
	
	The following exchange occurred:
	


ADAMS J: The question is whether we should give you leave to appear as amicus curiae. I must confess I find that that a little bit difficult. If you are going to make statements of fact, as counsel, they might be accepted by admissions or facts asserted by the appellant. But since you are not retained, they cannot have that status.

WATERSTREET: I hear your Honour, but could I interrupt and say that why I cannot be his advocate is because it may be required, and I accept it will be required, that I make an affidavit as to events in the last trial, the subject of his ultimate appeal.

…

ADAMS J: That is a somewhat different matter. Do I apprehend you to say that in the event of an adjournment, you would expect that Mr Riddell would wish to adduce, through you, evidence about matters as to which the transcript is silent?

WATERSTREET: Yes, and perhaps to other matters that the transcript adverts.

BEECH JONES J: Why has that not been done?

WATERSTREET: There has been no solicitor.

BEECH JONES J: Is there a solicitor now?

WATERSTREET: No.

DAVIES J: But there has not been any suggestion, as far as I can see, in Mr Riddell's file that he would be doing that, Mr Waterstreet. This is entirely new to me.

WATERSTREET: I think he has been, with due respect to Mr Riddell, advocating for me to do it, but I was reluctant, as it were, as a stranger to the proceedings without a solicitor or without the trappings of legal representation where it might be viewed as putting on an affidavit for a client that would not carry the proper imprimatur. My shyness in relation to that was not shyness in relation to the extent of the affidavit, but shyness as to the procedural--

ADAMS J: Are you saying that Mr Riddell asked you to make an affidavit as to these matters and you have hitherto declined to do so?

WATERSTREET: I have not declined to do so, but I have not got the transcript.

ADAMS J: Are you telling the court that Mr Riddell has requested you to make an affidavit of these matters, but you have so far not done so - this much you are saying?

WATERSTREET: Yes, this much I'm saying.

ADAMS J: And your explanation for that is that you felt some embarrassment because of the fact that he had no legal representation?

WATERSTREET: Plus I did not have the transcript and --

ADAMS J: He could have given you that.

DAVIES J: When did he ask you, Mr Waterstreet?

WATERSTREET: In recent months.

BEECH JONES J: When was the first time?

WATERSTREET: I have to say that that was a matter he was agitated about, but not the only matter. It, sort of, shaded into the side because of other matters and it was always my intention that when the time came, I would assist Mr Riddell as far as I could with an affidavit. There was also my junior, Mr King, in it and I think and I don't know if he was going to do the same but I would expect he would.

DAVIES J: But the request was only made by Mr Riddell a couple of months ago, is that right?

WATERSTREET: To be fair to Mr Riddell

ADAMS J: Just a moment. You were saying, Mr Waterstreet that this was not Mr Riddell's fault?

WATERSTREET: Yes, I think it is a matter that Mr Riddell has referred to and a friend of Mr Riddell from England, Mr Roberts, has requested from time to time that I assist Mr Riddell and I have been, but the matter of the affidavit was a matter referred to. I think there was a mention of it --

…

ADAMS J: I'm sorry, I am having some difficulty with the chronology. You said that several months ago Mr Riddell asked you to make an affidavit about matters which occurred in the trial, but which are not referred to in the transcript?

WATERSTREET: Yes.

ADAMS J: And that you, as I understand it, did not respond to him about that matter, or did you respond to him?

WATERSTREET: I said I would do it. Then the matter continued without that occurring

ADAMS J: So he didn't press you again?

WATERSTREET: I think he pressed me and I said I would do it.

ADAMS J: But you didn't do it?

WATERSTREET: I didn't do it until I felt I was in a position I could do it and, hence, my agitation with others to advocate for him so I could have an opportunity to give the affidavit that Mr Riddell wanted, as it were, in a semi regular fashion at least.

ADAMS J: You are informing us as amicus of what followed from you being asked to make an affidavit. Is that the limit of the role you seek to undertake?

WATERSTREET: Yes, subject to any other matter that I could be of assistance with to either Mr Riddell or to anyone else, or the Bench. I think Mr Riddell wants to argue his situation today.

ADAMS J: That is a different matter. We need to deal with your application first.

BEECH JONES J: You are just here to tell us that you are willing to provide an affidavit on a topic relevant to the ground of appeal?

WATERSTREET: Yes.


	
	Mr Waterstreet then outlined the three matters in respect of which evidence could be given by him and/or Mr King.
	
	
	The first matter was said to be prejudicial statements made by the Judge to the Appellant. It was described in this way by Mr Waterstreet:
	


WATERSTREET: The substance was that he pointed at Mr Riddell and said words to the effect, ""I know you, don't give me the evil eye. I know your type. I know what you're on about. Just stop looking at me like that"". And I'm hesitating but it was a bit longer than that but it was remarks directed at Mr Riddell suggesting he was giving him the eyeball, I think his Honour remarks, and the words ""evil eye"" and words similar to that in front of the jury, which were intended –


	
	Mr Waterstreet said that he thought this occurred in the first week of the trial and that he applied for a discharge of the jury but that was refused.
	
	
	The second matter concerned an interchange between the Trial Judge and Mr Waterstreet, not reported in the transcript, where the Trial Judge is supposed to have said to Mr Waterstreet about some proposition he was putting:
	


You can take that up to your friends in the Court of Criminal Appeal.


	
	The third matter concerned a communication between the Trial Judge and the Crown concerning a sick juror and the failure to communicate that to Mr Waterstreet.
	
	
	The Appellant raised a fourth matter requiring an affidavit from Mr Waterstreet as follows:
	


I also asked if they would write an affidavit about the missing deliberations because that is missing too and the words and then the words of the retrial when they said, ""guilty, we want my money because we've been here far too long and never want to sit on a jury ever again"".

The Appellant asserted that what the jury said, that is, the text of the jury notes themselves, was not transcribed.

The history of the appeal


	
	It is necessary to say something about the history of the appeal.
	
	
	The four Notices of Application for Extension of Time to Appeal and the filing of the Notice of Appeal some three years and six months out of time have already been noted. The following is a summary of directions hearings and call-overs before judges of the Court as well as the Registrar.

	Contrary to the orders of R A Hulme J made on 13 March 2015 the Appellant did not file a document not exceeding 20 typed pages in which submissions in support of the grounds of appeal were set out in a succinct summary fashion. Instead, on 28 April 2015 he filed a summons seeking leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of R A Hulme J. Apparently in support of that summons he filed a 36 page document entitled “Submissions in Support”. At one level this document appeared to be submissions in support of his summons to overturn the judgment of R A Hulme J. At another level the material in this document appeared to be submissions in support of his appeal.
	
	
	In addition, the Appellant filed three lever arch folders of documents which he told the Registrar at the Directions Hearing on 10 September 2015 were his notes.
	
	
	At that Directions Hearing the Appellant clarified that his submissions in support of the appeal were principally to be found in a ten page outline which appears to have been the document headed “Grounds of Appeal” filed on 7 November 2012 and which the Appellant entitled “Annex D1”. The Appellant also clarified that a document which he described as a 25 page summary, but which appears to have been the 36 pages attached to the summons that sought to appeal from the judgment of R A Hulme J, also summarised the grounds of appeal and constituted a submission.
	
	
	The Appellant informed the Registrar that his appeal was not ready and could not be heard on the date fixed. The Registrar told the Appellant that his appeal would be going ahead and that he would need to have his material in a state where he could assist the bench to understand what his arguments were. The Registrar confirmed the hearing date of the appeal.
	
	
	The Appellant thereafter filed a Notice of Motion on 17 September 2015 which sought to review the Registrar’s interlocutory orders made on 10 September 2015, sought to quash the orders made by R A Hulme J on 13 March 2015, sought an order adjourning the hearing of the appeal and sought leave to “add the following documents” to the submissions that he had already made in respect of the appeal – these documents were entitled by him as being Ex1, Ex2, Ex4 and Ex16. In the first instance they appear to be documents that the Appellant was relying on in an application being made to the High Court (quite what that application concerned was never made clear). Attached to that Notice of Motion was a document entitled “Submission in support of motion as filed with this court” consisting of 26 pages. Some but not all of the material was repetitive of material already filed.
	
	
	On 12 October 2015 the Crown filed its submissions. It was in these submissions that the grounds of appeal were said to constitute the 11 matters identified in those submissions to which reference has already been made.
	
	
	On the day before the appeal was to be heard the Appellant forwarded to the Court a number of documents as follows:
	


(1)   a ten page document consisting of 30 paragraphs;

(2)   a document entitled “The Applicant’s reply to the “the Crown Appeal Book’” consisting of 23 paragraphs and 15 pages;

(3)   a document entitled “Annex ‘Crown Appeal Book’” consisting of 11 pages;

(4)   a document entitled “Annex AB1 appeals bail application” consisting of 29 paragraphs and 11 pages.


	
	The first of these documents said that the Crown submissions were only delivered to the Appellant on 21 October 2015 which gave him five hours to respond. He said also that his hands had been affected by arthritis which meant that he had been reduced to typing the reply to the Crown’s submissions with two fingers. Nevertheless, the Appellant was able to produce the four extensive documents described.
	


Consideration

(b)   The need for affidavits


	
	Nowhere in the documents filed by the Appellant was reference made to the need to obtain affidavits from Mr Waterstreet and/or Mr King about events at the trial. In fact, in the submissions filed with the Notice of Motion on 17 September 2015 the Appellant referred in paragraphs 43 and 44 to what were described as histrionic outbursts during the trial and in footnote 46 (referred to in paragraph 44) the following appeared:
	


Other outbursts such as “Is this another point for your colleagues at the CCA Waterstreet” were edited from transcripts and recordings purportedly lost. Waterstreet has written affidavits confirming this. (emphasis added)


	
	That statement was untrue. As Mr Waterstreet informed the Court, he had been requested by the Appellant to provide an affidavit as to events at the last trial, and said that he would do it but did not do so.
	
	
	Nor did the Appellant raise the need for such affidavits at any of the Directions Hearings including the more recent ones before R A Hulme J and the Registrar.
	
	
	No explanation has been offered by the Appellant why he only made a request of Mr Waterstreet in the last few months to obtain this evidence. The appeal ground covering this matter (the bias ground) was contained in the Grounds of Appeal filed 7 November 2012.
	
	
	Of the three matters Mr Waterstreet identified as needing to be dealt with by an affidavit, the second ([39] above) is inconsequential. If it was said it was, at highest, part of a robust exchange between counsel and the Judge. It could not conceivably give rise to concern about bias.
	
	
	In relation to the first matter ([37] above) the Crown identified the full extent of the exchange which took place on 23 October 2006 being the 26th day of the trial (Appeal Book 6408):
	


HIS HONOUR: I allow the question.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. What I'm asking you is do you recall discussing chocolate with Pollis earlier--

HIS HONOUR: Mr Riddell, do not make gestures please from the dock—

WATERSTREET: Your Honour, I think he was talking to me.

HIS HONOUR: No well he was looking at me Mr Waterstreet. I don't want gestures from the dock, thank you. Go on Mr Crown.

…


	
	The examination of the witness continued. When that concluded for the day the following exchanges appear:
	


IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY

WATERSTREET: Your Honour, I want to get some instructions on the matter in which you admonished Mr Riddell.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, you get some instructions Mr Waterstreet.

WATERSTREET: The second matter is--

HIS HONOUR: Mr Waterstreet, let me make it quite plain, I am not going to tolerate your client laughing and making gestures after I make rulings. You can get whatever instructions you want Mr Waterstreet, but let's get it quite plain now.

WATERSTREET: Your Honour, I was party to looking at Mr Riddell at that time.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, well I looked at him with my own eyes too Mr Waterstreet, and I see quite a lot from up here. More than people often think.

WATERSTREET: No your Honour, I don't dispute that but I think your Honour was - without getting instructions - your Honour was premature in admonishing him in front of the jury.

HIS HONOUR: You may hold that view Mr Waterstreet, your client has been - I'll call it animated in the dock for some time. When it involves me, I'm not going to allow it. I've got a pair of eyes too Mr Waterstreet.

WATERSTREET: Anyway, I'll get instructions on that.

HIS HONOUR: You do that.

…


	
	On the following morning the following occurred in the absence of the jury:
	


WATERSTREET: … The second thing your Honour is your Honour's comments yesterday in front of the jury, your Honour I wanted to say—

HIS HONOUR: It wasn't a comment really Mr Waterstreet,but anyway go on.

WATERSTREET: Well rousing on Mr Riddell. Your Honour I just wanted to say in front of the jury that Mr Riddell would apologise to your Honour if your Honour took offence. He didn't mean anything and he was looking at me and then looked to your Honour without any intention at all. It was during chocolates [sic] your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Waterstreet the way it appeared to me was this, that your client throughout the last trial and in this trial has been particularly animated. He, when anyone gives any evidence that your client doesn't like, your client makes faces, laughs and grins at them and I thought, in fact I have little doubt of it, that the impression that your client was trying to convey to the jury yesterday, after I ruled perfectly properly in favour of the Crown asking a question in re-examination, was to try to convey to the jury that I was being unfair to him entirely contrary to the fact. That's the part I took will not put up with that in a court that I am running. If your client wants to say something to the jury through you then that's fine--

WATERSTREET: No.

HIS HONOUR: --you do it. But I'm not going to put up with that kind of behaviour. I want it to be quite plain.

WATERSTREET: Your Honour I won't - your Honour's comments are out there and on the transcript. Your Honour I just want to address what might be an adverse inference, certainly an adverse matter that the jury could by impression gather that Mr Riddell was in someway acting as your Honour has said. So that just to even the balance your Honour I want to say on his behalf that he apologies if your Honour took offence.

HIS HONOUR: That's fine. Although you may not always be able to see it Mr Waterstreet, the jury watches your client as juries watch all accused people. They see what's going on. Anyway it's entirely up to him, but I've made my point.


	
	When the jury was brought in Mr Waterstreet said this:
	


WATERSTREET: And secondly your Honour could I, on behalf of Mr Riddell apologise to your Honour if your Honour took offence at what my client was doing. He had no intention at all to offend your Honour and he was talking - he was looking at me and then glanced away your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Alright.


	
	On 25 October in the absence of the jury the following exchange took place:
	


WATERSTREET: Your Honour the second thing is your Honour I read the transcript where I on behalf of Mr Riddell apologised for whatever view your Honour took of what Mr Riddell did, your Honour what is left hanging is an impression that it is somehow connected with the trial. That Mr Riddell's actions which your Honour reprimanded him for in my view irrelevant to any matter the jury has to consider (sic). What's left in the air your Honour is a statement by your Honour which I'm asking for that whatever interchange took place it is irrelevant to the issues before the jury. A similar matter happened in trials from time to time and my submission a statement by the trial judge to the effect that from time to time people get emotional and do things that in the heat of the moment, not these words, but words along these lines, but we regret doing or words to that effect. What's left if your Honour doesn't give a direction that what took place including what your Honour said --

HIS HONOUR: There's nothing wrong with what I said Mr Waterstreet I was perfectly within my rights.

WATERSTREET: Views differ.

HIS HONOUR: Well they might, but my view is the one that counts Mr Waterstreet, here at least and my remarks were entirely justified. I'm not putting up with. that in my Court.

WATERSTREET: No, your Honour, but your Honour will I submit realise that that is irrelevant to the jury's task.

HIS HONOUR: Self-evidently Mr Waterstreet.

WATERSTREET: Yes, but not self-evident to the jury.

HIS HONOUR: What are you suggesting that I say to them?

WATERSTREET: You remove completely from your mind anything that I said or that I said Mr Riddell did and temper it with Mr Riddell's apology to your Honour if what he did your Honour thought might have been intention, he says it's not, but it is irrelevant to any issue before the Court and it's a difficult task to sit here, I'm talking about Mr Riddell, day after day and sometimes people get emotional.

HIS HONOUR: I'm certainly not going to say that. It wasn't a question of being emotional your client was trying to send messages to the jury denigrating my ruling that's what he was doing. I'm certainly not going to gloss over that with some fancy words Mr Waterstreet. I certainly will not do that.

WATERSTREET: My instructions, my observations, were that he was looking at me and then I thought your Honour said he was looking at you.

HIS HONOUR: He was and it was perfectly plain what he was doing Mr Waterstreet.


	
	When the jury came in his Honour said this amongst other things:
	


Two things I want to say to you before we begin. The first is this. The day before yesterday late in the afternoon with all that goes with late in the afternoon there was an exchange between Mr Riddell and I and I'm not going to go into that save to say this that that exchange had nothing to do with the matters that you are to determine in the trial, just put that entirely out of your

minds.


	
	The transcript demonstrates that Mr Waterstreet’s memory of the event was not entirely accurate as to what occurred and when in the trial it occurred, but we do not intend any criticism of him for that because the events happened a long time ago and there were in fact two trials involving the Appellant where Mr Waterstreet appeared.
	
	
	The significant point is that the transcript speaks for itself and no affidavit about the matter from Mr Waterstreet could take the matter any further. No discharge of the jury was sought and none of the missing judgments could relate to the matter.
	
	
	The third matter raised by Mr Waterstreet concerned a communication between the Trial Judge and Mr Saunders at the CDPP. The background was this. On Monday, 20 November 2006 being the 44th day of the trial the Court received a note that a juror was sick. The Trial Judge observed that it was the same juror who had been away on the previous Friday, and there had apparently been three other days when the same juror had been away. Prior to being called into Court the jury sent a note to the Judge which read:
	


If the jury member has been off now for the fourth time, can this member be dismissed and continue with 11 members?


	
	A Sheriff’s Officer was sent out to locate the juror. A report must have been made by the Sheriff’s Officer to the Judge late on the afternoon of 20 November. The information was that the juror had some sort of gastric illness and had been vomiting. The juror would not be in Tuesday, 21 November but would be in by Wednesday, 22 November.
	
	
	At the time this information was received the Judge’s Associate had left for the day. In those circumstances the Judge rang Mr Saunders at the CDPP to inform him of that fact and that the Court would convene at 10am on Tuesday, 21 November but the jurors would not be coming in.
	
	
	At 4:52pm Mr Saunders sent a facsimile to Mr Waterstreet and Mr King in these terms:
	


Dear Charles and Michael,

His Honour Judge Hosking phone (sic) me a short time ago, in the absence of his Associate who had gone home, and said that the sick juror has advised the Court that he will not be in tomorrow, but he will be in on Wednesday.

The Court will still convene tomorrow at 10am although the Jurors are not coming in. His Honour asked me to convey this information to you.

The Crown proposes to make an application tomorrow that the sick juror be discharged pursuant to the Jury Act. I understand that Mr Riddell will be in attendance tomorrow.

We refer to Wu v The Queen (1999) CLR 99 and Brownley v The Queen [2001] 207 CLR 278.


	
	The following day the Judge handed to counsel the statement from the Sheriff’s Officer regarding what he had ascertained about the juror. The Crown then made an application for the discharge of the juror. The following exchange then took place (AB 7367.8):
	


WATERSTREET: The information as of yesterday was contained in the note that Mr Saunders gave us, and perhaps we should tender a copy of that.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry which note is this Mr Waterstreet?

WATERSTREET: A note of an exchange Mr Saunders had with your Honour.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: We've got a copy. Your Honour spoke to Mr Saunders and he sent an email to our friends. [HIS HONOUR:] Well I had to speak to Mr Saunders Mr Waterstreet myself because my associate had to go for the afternoon, she ordinarily would have made the call, and I had to ring somebody to alert you both to the fact that this juror wouldn't be in today. That's the only reason I phoned Mr Saunders. Somebody had to be contacted.

WATERSTREET: I understand that.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Perhaps I should had (sic) a copy up and it could go with the court file.

WATERSTREET: Mr Saunders was kind enough to – just make sure it's the same one.

MFI #87 NOTE OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN HIS HONOUR AND MR

SAUNDERS

WATERSTREET: Your Honour that letter advises us that your Honour received information that the juror has advised that he will not be in tomorrow but will be in on Wednesday and then the rest of it proposes the application.


	
	Although the Appellant in his various written submissions makes allegations that the Judge inappropriately discussed other matters with Mr Saunders there is no evidence to justify those allegations. Again, the significant point in relation to the affidavit material is that there is nothing that Mr Waterstreet or Mr King could say in an affidavit that could add to the knowledge of what transpired as is disclosed in the transcript and MFI 87 being the note of the exchange between the Trial Judge and Mr Saunders.
	
	
	As to the final matter of jury notes when the verdict was returned, the transcript discloses clearly in what the Trial Judge said to the jury what had been contained in their jury notes. The Trial Judge said (AB 10398):
	


The first part of your note is, we have been advised that we will not be called for jury duty again in the next three years. Could you please put in an application to extend this due to the fact of the length of this trial.


	
	The Trial Judge then dealt with that and then said (AB 10399):
	


The next part of your note reads in this way, “due to stress that some members have been placed under”, hardly surprising, “could we please apply for one weeks’ additional pay to allow us personal time prior to resuming work.


	
	That transcript shows that the Trial Judge read the jury’s notes onto the record. It is difficult to see what an affidavit from Mr Waterstreet or Mr King could add to what is contained in the transcript in that regard. It is impossible to believe that their memory after more than eight years could be more accurate than the contemporaneous transcript.
	
	
	Accordingly, to the extent that the adjournment was sought to obtain affidavit evidence from the Appellant’s counsel at the trial, the application was refused.
	


(a) Lack of readiness


	
	Apart from the Appellant’s desire to obtain the affidavits, the adjournment was sought on the basis that there was missing material that the Appellant needed and that, with the material which he now had, he needed extra time, perhaps another six months, to get the material into the order that he wanted it. It was to present his written material at manageable length and to focus his submissions and to support them by transcript references. This, he said, involved his starting to read all of the material again.
	
	
	As far as missing material was concerned, it included parts of the transcript of the earlier trials which is not available as well as material in relation to the sentencing of the co-offenders. The missing material included the opening by the Crown and the first hour of the Crown’s closing address. There were also said to be three interlocutory judgments missing.
	
	
	The information from the Crown was that the missing parts of the opening and closing addresses were not transcribed at the time. Subsequent enquiries ascertained that the tapes no longer exist. As unfortunate as that may be, it is clear that there is no purpose served by delaying the hearing of the appeal because that material is not available. It never will be available.
	
	
	As far as the missing judgments were concerned, the Appellant was unable to provide information about the issues with which those three judgments are concerned. That being so, there is nothing to suggest that their unavailability has anything but a speculative effect on the outcome of the appeal.
	
	
	As far as the sentencing material is concerned, the Appellant submitted that he needed all of the material considered by the Sentencing Judges for the co-offenders. The Appellant said that he needed that for what amounted to a parity argument that he wished to put forward in relation to the sentencing.
	
	
	This involves a misunderstanding of what is involved in considering the issue of parity. Neither the Sentencing Judge nor this Court is concerned to examine any justification for the findings made by the judge who sentenced a co-offender. Those findings are accepted as providing the basis upon which the sentence was imposed. The Remarks on Sentence in respect of all the co-offenders are available. It will be neither necessary nor permissible to go behind that material.
	
	
	Finally, as to the unavailability and late provision of material to the Appellant, the position appears to be this. In the Appellant’s submissions in support of his Summons filed 28 April 2015 he says in footnote 78, relevant to paragraph 53:
	


At least today the applicant has almost doubled PC access, has secured 95% of trial materials, and has the guts to take an intransigent if not hackneyed system that cares not for individualised justice. The applicant had to wait until 2014 for 95% trial materials to be delivered to him after ten appearances in this court. (emphasis in original)

The Crown fairly acknowledged that on 8 July 2015 some further material, said to be the equivalent of one extra folder, was sent to the Appellant. It is apparent, therefore, that the absence of material from the trials cannot be regarded as any justification for the failure of the Appellant to be ready to proceed with his appeal.


	
	As to the Appellant’s submission that he needs further time to get his material into order and to cross-reference the transcript in the way he wishes, no appellant, whether unrepresented or not, can be given unlimited time to make the necessary preparation. Even accepting the difficulties that he has experienced whilst in custody in terms of access to the material and a computer, the Appellant has had ample time to prepare his appeal. If 95% of the material had been provided to him by 2014 he has had ten months, and maybe more, to prepare his submissions including any cross-referencing of the material he desired. The Appellant has displayed a remarkable ability to prepare and file detailed documents prepared by him, which include large numbers of references to case law, within confined periods of time.
	
	
	It is also apparent from the history recited earlier that the Appellant has devoted a considerable amount of time to preparing documents detailing complaints as to why he cannot prepare his appeal, chiefly that he needs more time, or documents concerned with interlocutory and other challenges to orders made, rather than utilising the time he is permitted by Corrective Services with his computer and material to prepare the appeal so that it would be ready on the day fixed for hearing. What is set out at [50] above is a good example of that.
	
	
	In paragraph 56 of the submissions filed in support of the Summons the Appellant said:
	


Today, just as matters stood in 2008, and just as matters stood in 2012, the applicant requires six months unfettered PC access in order he (sic) rebuild matters of fact and apply the law.


	
	Nothing in the extensive material filed by the Appellant to date suggests that giving him further time to assemble his material in the way that he says will be more manageable, provides any support for such an outcome. In our opinion, the Appellant has had ample time with the material that he has had, and for the period of time he has had it, to prepare for the hearing of the appeal. As R A Hulme J pointed out to him on 13 March 2015, when a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal is filed the applicant is in effect saying:
	


I am ready to have my appeal heard, I am ready to take a date for the hearing.


	
	For all of these reasons the adjournment was refused.

2769322,JB v R (No 2) [2016] NSWCCA 67,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Procedural background

JB cannot be named because he was a child at the relevant time (s 15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW)). He was found guilty by a jury on 10 September 2009 of the murder of Edward Spowart in the early hours of 21 April 2008. JB was unsuccessful in appealing against his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal (JB v R [2012] NSWCCA 12; 83 NSWLR 153). He was unsuccessful in seeking special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia (JB v The Queen [2013] HCA Trans 28).


	
	Application was then made on behalf of JB pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an inquiry into his conviction for murder. JB sought referral of the whole of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) pursuant to s 79(1)(b).
	
	
	The application pursuant to s 78 was based upon material discovered subsequent to the exhaustion of the avenues of appeal. It related to the evidence of an important prosecution witness in JB’s trial. The matter was referred to R A Hulme J for consideration on 13 November 2014. His Honour decided that there should be a referral and gave his reasons on 20 November 2014.
	
	
	The reasons for his Honour’s decision were relevantly as follows:
	


“7   There is no need to review in any detail the evidence in the trial or the manner in which the Crown and defence cases were put. It is sufficient to say that a significant aspect of the Crown case was the contention that the applicant made admissions at a police station following his arrest. The admissions were said to have been made to a support person, A107, who was present because the applicant was a vulnerable person because of his age (he was 15). The Crown relied upon other aspects arising from the evidence but its case was put to the jury on the basis that a verdict of guilty could be returned on the evidence of the alleged admission alone.

8   The Attorney General concedes that there should be a referral. The written submissions succinctly set out three broad issues revealed by the material:

“First, there was non-disclosure of material by the Crown Prosecutor and instructing solicitor from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) at the trial to the defence. It was not known to the applicant nor disclosed to his defence counsel during the trial that a prosecution witness at the applicant’s trial, A107, whose evidence as to admissions made to him by the applicant formed a central plank of the prosecution case, was at the time of the alleged admissions a registered police informer. This non-disclosure was in circumstances where the Crown case at trial was that A107 was acting as a support person for the then 15 year old applicant at the time the alleged admissions were made.

Although typed notes of the conference attended by A107, the Crown prosecutor and the ODPP instructing solicitor on 27 July 2009 were served on the applicant’s legal representatives and became Exhibit C on the voir dire concerning the admissibility of the admissions, these typed notes appear to have been edited as they did not include any reference to A107 stating that he was a police informer. (It is noted that this information was not known to prosecution counsel in the applicant’s appeal to the CCA, nor in his special leave application to the High Court, at the time of either of those proceedings.)

Secondly, there was non-disclosure of material by police. It was not known to the applicant nor his defence counsel, nor the ODPP, that was given an affidavit of assistance by a Chief Inspector of Police prior to the trial, which was tendered before Parramatta Local Court at A107’s sentence hearing for two offences against s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. That affidavit of assistance included a reference to the assistance provided in relation to the applicant’s matter. Furthermore, police officers gave evidence of their conversation with A107 during the trial without disclosing his true status as an informer.

Thirdly, the applicant’s solicitor had an undisclosed conflict of interest. It was not known to the applicant nor his defence counsel (including on appeal) that the applicant’s solicitor at the applicant’s trial, Robert Kaufmann, who had commenced to act for the applicant from the time that the applicant was charged, was already acting at that time for A107 in respect of the fraud offences. Mr Kaufmann continued to act for A107 until finalisation of A107’s sentence proceedings for the fraud offences at which the affidavit of assistance was tendered, even though he was acting for the applicant during the same period. He continued to act for the applicant for the duration of the applicant’s trial and the applicant’s appeal to the CCA.””


	
	The matter came before this Court for hearing on 24 March 2015. On that occasion, the Court quashed the conviction of JB and continued bail on the same conditions except that conditions 4 and 17 were deleted and condition 1 was varied to require him to report to the OIC at Mount Druitt each week on Mondays and Fridays between 6am and 8pm. On 16 September 2015 bail was made unconditional.
	
	
	Although the Court expressed a preliminary view that the real issue before it was whether a verdict of acquittal should be entered, or a retrial ordered, that issue was not dealt with except in general terms. The issues argued before the Court were whether the Commissioner of Police should produce to the parties certain material relating to A107 and whether the claim for legal professional privilege by the Crown in respect of redactions in documents produced by it could be maintained. Judgment and rulings on those issues were handed down on 10 July 2015 (JB v R [2015] NSWCCA 182).
	
	
	It should be noted that on 24 March and 10 July 2015 the Crown reiterated its position that it sought a retrial but that in any retrial no evidence would be adduced as to any admissions made by JB to A107.
	
	
	On 10 July 2015 the Court again expressed its preliminary view that the real issue before it was whether in those circumstances there was sufficient evidence available to the Crown which was capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that JB had murdered Edward Spowart. In accordance with that approach, the Court directed that the Crown provide a case statement which set out with particularity the evidence on which it would rely to establish its case against JB.
	
	
	The Crown complied with that direction and a document dated 30 July 2015 was filed and served. In fairness to the Crown, it should be noted that the Crown did not do so with any enthusiasm and qualified the contents of the document as follows:
	


“3   This Court stated that on the next occasion the matter was before the Court the actual grounds of appeal (and the disputes that exist within them) would not be considered by the Court nor would the fresh evidence or the examination of witnesses but rather the question of s 8(1) would be considered.

…

5   There may still be some difficulties with the approach directed by this Court to consider s 8(1) prior to the grounds of appeal, as it is likely that the appellant would have liked to rely on the fresh evidence to seek to undermine the evidence in the future trial and the respondent also would have liked to have led additional evidence to dispute such claims through the affidavits it seeks to read and to establish that it has not impacted on the cogency of the evidence in any future trial.”


	
	This Court heard submissions from the parties as to whether there was sufficient evidence to justify an order for a retrial pursuant to s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on 16 September 2015. This judgment relates to that issue.
	
	
	The murder of Mr Spowart occurred on 21 April 2008. JB was then aged 15 having been born in September 1992. JB was convicted of the murder of Mr Spowart on 10 September 2009 after a trial lasting approximately one month. Included on the indictment at trial was the charge that JB had attempted to murder Firoz Mohammed. The jury entered a verdict of acquittal in relation to the attempted murder charge. On 21 May 2010 JB was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years, commencing 22 April 2008 and expiring 21 April 2024, with a balance of term of 7 years expiring 21 April 2031. On 19 December 2013 JB was granted bail having been in custody for 6 years and 8 months.
	
	
	The position initially adopted by JB (written submissions of 20 February 2015) was that the concessions of the Crown did not relieve this Court “of its statutory duty to deal with the whole case” (Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at 131 [10]). He submitted that it was necessary for this Court to look at the whole case, including the fresh and new evidence, in order to discharge its obligation in that respect. He submitted that the issues raised by the case went beyond the concessions by the Crown and that the appeal raised important matters of principle regarding disclosure, the prosecutorial duty of fairness, the position of support persons for young people, the position of informers, the obligations of solicitors to their clients and the duty of legal practitioners to the court and to their clients where a potential conflict of interest arises (written submissions [15]).
	
	
	By 16 September 2015 the position of JB had changed, at least to the extent that he was prepared to argue and did argue the appeal on the more limited basis that there was insufficient evidence to justify an order for a retrial, pursuant to s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	While I accept that had I reached a different conclusion in relation to s 8(1) the further matters raised by JB in the appeal may well have been relevant to that issue, I have concluded that such an analysis is not required. This is because I have concluded that the evidence of the Crown, absent that of A107, is not capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that JB murdered Edward Spowart.
	


Crown case and factual background


	
	The following summary is based on the evidence at trial (absent the evidence of A107 upon which the Crown no longer relies), the Crown case statement of 30 July 2015 and the oral submissions of the Crown of 16 September 2015. Unavoidably it has been necessary to set out some of this material in considerable detail.
	
	
	The Crown case is that JB stabbed the deceased in the early hours of the morning of Monday, 21 April 2008, on a grassed verge on the northern side of Memorial Drive, Granville during an altercation between members of JB’s group and members of the deceased’s group. As occurred at the trial, to establish that case it would be necessary for the Crown to call evidence from members of both groups as eye witnesses to the affray.
	
	
	The Crown case against JB is that he became involved in an earlier incident with the deceased’s group in which there was a verbal and physical confrontation. This initial dispute resulted in JB and his friends fleeing from the deceased’s friends. It also resulted in JB becoming very upset, angry and wishing to exact some level of revenge on the deceased’s group. As at trial, the Crown would rely upon this as evidence of JB’s motive to arm himself and become involved in the later affray which led to the murder of the deceased.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that on this later occasion there was a violent confrontation between JB’s group (some of whom had by then armed themselves) and the deceased’s group. The Crown case which it submits is supported by CCTV material is that the deceased played no role in this latter confrontation. The deceased was on the opposite side of the road holding a plastic shopping bag when he was confronted by JB. It is the Crown case that the deceased tried to defend himself with the shopping bag but was stabbed by JB which caused his death. It is the Crown case that JB then fled with his friends and was later seen on CCTV cameras recreating the stabbing motion. It is the Crown case that JB admitted his involvement in the offence to one of his group, Ringo Madut (Ringo).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a central issue at trial would not be whether JB was part of the group involved in the affray but whether he was the person who did the stabbing. The Crown case is not based on any aspect of joint criminal enterprise but relies solely on establishing that JB was the person responsible for the stabbing. The Crown accepted that if it could not establish that it was JB who did the stabbing, then it is unable to establish its case.
	
	
	It is for that reason that the Crown directed its submissions in this Court to the available evidence that JB was the person who did the stabbing, rather than other parts of the Crown case about his involvement in the earlier incident. Except for the issue of whether JB possessed a knife when the earlier incident occurred, the Crown submitted that there was little dispute about JB’s involvement in the earlier incident or his presence at the later affray. The Crown accepted that JB’s specific involvement in the later affray was very much in dispute.
	
	
	There was no issue that in the early hours of 21 April 2008 a series of altercations took place between two groups of young men and youths on and in the vicinity of the Granville train station in western Sydney. Firoz Mohammed (Firoz), Stanley Marle (Marle), Emori Vunisa (Vunisa), Robert Bali (Bali) and the deceased comprised one group described as of “Islander appearance”. Deng Duang, Dut, JW, EC, Ringo and JB comprised the other group, described as of “Sudanese appearance”.
	
	
	Both groups had been drinking alcohol of varying amounts in the hours before the altercations. The altercations progressed from the train platform at the Granville station to the street. At the train station, JB asked Firoz for a cigarette and was refused. Ringo, JW and EC were present when this occurred. JB punched Firoz. Vunisa said that he (Vunisa) then hit the “little guy” to the ground. The Crown case is that the “little guy” was JB. It is the Crown case that JB was punched in the mouth by Vunisa during this exchange and suffered a split lip. JW also pushed someone and Ringo tried to punch someone. Ringo was also knocked to the ground during the scuffle.
	
	
	Members of the deceased’s group chased JB’s group. It was the Crown case that JB produced a knife and threatened Firoz with it during this chase. JB and EC were chased from the platform by Marle, Vunisa and Firoz. This constituted the initial confrontation/altercation. Much of the initial altercation was captured on CCTV, although importantly not the alleged occasion when JB was said to have produced a knife.
	
	
	At trial the evidence of Firoz was that two African men approached him, one was wearing a sort of black and gold jumper and the other was wearing a white football jumper. Both men were shorter than him and their build was slight or skinny. The one wearing the black and gold jumper came up to him and asked for a cigarette. When Firoz replied that he did not have a cigarette, this man punched him in the mouth. (Subsequently, as a result of questions from Latham J, Firoz said that it was the man wearing the white jumper who had hit him (T.129, 173).)
	
	
	Firoz said that Vunisa punched that man and that he and Vunisa chased those men from the railway station towards the street. Firoz said that about 20 metres away from the station the man who punched him, came around the corner towards him and took a knife from his pocket. The man held the knife out and came towards Firoz with a forward movement three or four times saying “I’m going to kill you”. When Firoz armed himself with an iron bar, this man then ran away towards Memorial Drive. He described the knife as 5 – 6 cms in length.
	
	
	Not long afterwards Firoz said that he, together with Vunisa, Marle, Bali and the deceased were walking down Memorial Drive in the direction of the Granville RSL when they were confronted by a big crowd of 15 – 20 people. It was necessary for them to walk down Memorial Drive in order to get to Firoz’s home. Firoz said that he recognised the man who had the knife as one of this group. He said that the group was armed with bricks, iron bars and sticks. A fight started and Firoz was moving backwards trying to defend himself. The other group ran away after about 10 minutes and it was then that he saw the deceased lying across Memorial Drive bleeding from the leg.
	
	
	Bali was part of the Islander group and had been with them all day. He gave evidence that two “African guys” asked Vunisa for a cigarette. One was wearing a red t-shirt and the other was wearing white basketball clothes. One was about 20 years old, skinny and a bit taller than Bali who was five foot ten inches tall. The other was about 16 or 17 and shorter.
	
	
	When Vunisa refused to give the shorter person a cigarette, he swore at Vunisa who pushed him. That person then took a knife from his pocket and held it outstretched. The knife had a black handle. It was about 20cm long. That person said “Fuck you, I’m going to kill you”. Bali said that he pushed that person away and went downstairs.
	
	
	Sometime later, he was part of the Islander group who decided to walk home past the RSL. When the group was behind the RSL, he saw about 20 black African looking guys coming towards them. They had a lot of iron bars and sticks. He recognised two or three of those persons from earlier in the night. They were saying “We’re going to kill you”. Bali and his friends walked backwards towards the station trying to defend themselves. The deceased had been the last of their group to leave the station before they went towards the RSL. At one point Bali recalled that Vunisa pointed out to him that the deceased had fallen down. By that time the African guys had run off. Bali saw that the deceased was bleeding from the leg and was also injured around the stomach or groin.
	
	
	It is reasonably clear from the evidence of Marle at trial that he was not involved in the initial confrontation. The evidence which he gave appears to be directed to the second altercation or affray.
	
	
	Marle said that he and some friends walked away from the station intending to walk home. When they were about 10 to 15 metres from the station he saw “Sudanese guys” with bricks, stones, a knife and iron poles about a metre away from him (T.109 – 110). He described the “guy with the knife” as a shorter bloke, who was skinny with short hair and was wearing a white or spotted white and black t-shirt (T.110). He described the knife as a “man-made knife, it wasn’t from the shop” and he thought the handle was black. He gave evidence that the man with the knife was screaming and swung the knife at him, very close. Marle believed there were more than 15 persons in the other group. After the confrontation when his group were walking away they noticed the deceased lying on the other side of the road. The last time Marle had seen the deceased was on the train platform. Marle identified the deceased on the CCTV footage available from the Granville railway station, as the person wearing a dark jacket and holding a bag (T.119).
	
	
	Vunisa gave evidence at the trial. He was present when the first altercation took place. He said that a “little guy”, who was about 17 years old and skinny, approached Firoz for a cigarette. He was wearing black short trousers, white sports shoes and a black jacket. An argument occurred between this person and Firoz when Firoz refused to give him a cigarette. Vunisa said that this person moved back but then came towards him and pulled out a knife from his pocket. Vunisa hit him in the shoulder area with his right hand but not with a full punch and the person fell to the ground. This person’s phone also fell out. Vunisa observed this person pick up the knife and the phone and run away. Vunisa chased him down the platform towards the Royal Hotel. Vunisa said that there was another person with him, who was aged about 18, with a red top. (T.179 – 180).
	
	
	Vunisa said that not long afterwards, about a five minutes’ walk from the station, the person with the knife and another person approached Firoz. Vunisa said each of these persons had a knife and they were jumping close to Firoz and himself. He said that a fight started and he and Bali defended themselves with a rubbish bin and a sign post. Vunisa said that fight lasted about five or six minutes before the two persons ran off (T.181 – 183).
	
	
	Vunisa gave evidence that later when he and his group were walking along Memorial Drive he saw about 10 or 15 “all black African Somalian” persons coming towards them with sticks, big bars and bricks and one of them said “we’re going to kill you”. He recognised the two little guys who had been at the train station. Vunisa and his friends were moving backwards as a group to defend themselves. He saw the deceased on the left side of the road holding his plastic bag with his Calvin Klein shoes inside. That was the last time he saw the deceased. He said that the deceased was trying to stop people hitting him by using a stick (T.186 – 187).. Later Vunisa saw that the deceased was crawling and trying to walk. His leg had been sliced and he was bleeding.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that JB and EC ran from the platform after the initial confrontation, down the street to the Granville RSL. They sought help from a security guard saying “help us, these men want to hurt us” (T.464). The security guard described the young person who came up to him as looking scared. It is the Crown case that JB and EC continued to run away from the islander group to the car-park where they were observed by independent witnesses who described “the smallest” as sounding “so upset” and angry, crying and screaming and trying to explain something to his friends. It is the Crown case that this was JB.
	
	
	It was the evidence of JW, EC and Ringo that JB was crying and complaining of a “busted lip” and that EC and Dut were trying to comfort him. It was the evidence of Dut that they were all scared at this stage. They armed themselves with sticks and bricks before attempting to return to Granville station.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that JB’s group then returned to the station armed for a confrontation. It was in this context that Marle said that he observed a knife and fought with the person holding the knife. It was the Crown case that there were only about five in the deceased’s group and that the fight restarted on top of a little bridge. JB at the time was on the other side of the road, closest to the railway line about five metres away from JW.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that JB was fighting with a person wearing a black leather jacket who was also carrying a plastic bag. It is the Crown case that it was JB who was fighting with the deceased. Evidence to this effect came from one of JB’s group, JW.
	
	
	At trial JW described JB as arguing with an older person which caused a fight. This resulted in JW, Ringo and others being chased by the persons with whom they had had the altercation. He said that they were pursued to the RSL car-park. JW said that JB was with that group and was crying and was arguing with Dut. JB was saying that he got a busted lip because Dut did not help him. JW said that he and Dut picked up long pieces of wood and armed themselves before returning to the Granville railway station.
	
	
	JW gave evidence that his group approached five of the other group, who did not appear to have anything in their hands, and a fight started again on the top of a little bridge. JW saw JB on the other side of the road closest to the railway line about five metres away. JW saw that JB was fighting a person in a black leather jacket who was carrying a plastic bag (T.413). He saw JB swinging his fists and that he hit the other bloke three or four times with hard blows. JW said that the other bloke was trying to fight back and was trying to hit JB with the plastic bag. JW observed Dut on that side of the road behind JB. JW thought that Dut was standing there and that Dut did not do anything. JW’s group then ran to the park because Dut yelled out to everyone to “run”.
	
	
	EC gave evidence at trial. He observed about five islanders at the railway station, one of whom was smoking and one of whom was on the phone. When JB asked one of them for a cigarette, an argument took place resulting in JB hitting the islander in the mouth. EC saw that man then get up and hit JB. Although a fight started, EC did not get involved. He confirmed that two of the islanders chased his group away from the railway station.
	
	
	EC said that one of his group said “let’s go back” which resulted in his group arming themselves and going back towards the railway station. EC’s group approached the islanders near a small bridge and a fight resulted which lasted about 20 minutes. EC said that during the fight he saw JB in the middle of the road, but he did not see JB doing anything. He heard Ringo say “run” and they ran back towards the RSL (T.468).
	
	
	EC gave evidence that he did not see anyone from the islander group hurt. He later observed Ringo “chuck a knife over the fence”. Ringo said “I’ve got to get rid of it”. The knife was silver, it had a 10 cm blade and the handle was black (T.469 – 470, 487).
	
	
	Ringo’s evidence was that he had been charged with murder in this matter but pleaded guilty to affray and was sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 1 year and 4 months, with an additional term of 1 year, having agreed to give evidence for the Crown.
	
	
	He gave evidence that when JB requested a cigarette at the railway station, an argument ensued resulting in JB punching one of the other group in the face. Ringo said that he (Ringo) was hit and fell. He said that as he tried to get up his camera and phone dropped to the ground. He subsequently went cautiously back and was able to retrieve his camera. At that time some of the other group were chasing JB and EC.
	
	
	Ringo said that when his group stopped running, JB said “what are we running for” and “we’re going straight back”. Deng and JW were armed with sticks. In the ensuing fight he observed that JB and Dut went across the road, but he could not see what they were doing. After a time the fight stopped and their group ran away.
	
	
	Ringo then gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. At some stage did you stop running and start walking?

A. Yes.

Q. When you were walking was there any talk about what had happened?

A. Yes [JB] said that he actually stabbed someone in the leg.

Q. Can you remember the words that he used?

A. Yes he said “I stabbed someone in the leg” but --

HER HONOUR: “I stabbed someone in the leg”.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Did you ask him anything about that or did he say anything more about?

A. No, I wasn’t interested of what everyone had said because I didn’t see him holding anything in his hand so I didn’t actually believe what he did.

Q. Did you then go to Auburn station?

A. Yes we did.

Q. When you were at Auburn station was there any talk about what happened?

A. He said again to the other guys that he stabbed someone in the leg.” (T.514.20)

The only person who gave evidence to this effect at trial was Ringo.


	
	In evidence Ringo identified on the CCTV footage from Auburn train station a part where he said that JB told the group that he had stabbed somebody in the leg. It is the Crown case that this CCTV footage clearly depicts JB making a stabbing motion with his hand while apparently talking to his friends.
	
	
	Ringo in a second police interview (21 May 2008) told the police of this admission by JB but said that he did not believe it to be true at the time. He made no admissions as to possessing or throwing away a knife in that interview, and no allegation to that effect was put to him by the police. It was accepted by the Crown that this issue would be explored and tested at a retrial.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that there were a number of bases on which the evidence of Ringo was likely to be challenged. There is an issue as to whether and if so, to what extent discussions occurred between A107 and Ringo before his arrest. A107 in evidence said that he did speak to Ringo and persuaded him to attend the Mt Druitt Police Station whereas at trial Ringo denied any such conversation.
	
	
	On 21 May 2008 Ringo was taken to the charge room at Parramatta Police Station and was interviewed by Detectives Fulham and Macdonald. While the contents of that statement are not available, it is tolerably clear from the trial transcript and the second interview between Ringo and police that during the first interview he denied involvement in the fight and otherwise declined to answer questions. He said nothing about any admission by JB. After the first interview had concluded, Detective Macdonald had a conversation with Ringo (not recorded) in which he told him that he was going to be charged with murder. At that point, Ringo asked to be re-interviewed.
	
	
	In the course of that second interview, the following question was asked by Detective Macdonald:
	


“Q.329 I’ve been told that after this incident that whilst you were on your way home that [JB] told the whole group that he actually stabbed one of the people, do you know anything about that?” (T.539)

Ringo replied “yes” and after a further exchange, Ringo said:

“A. He told everyone that he stabbed but I didn’t, I didn’t believe anything like that.”

At first Ringo told the police that JB did not say “where he stabbed him” but then he said “in the leg or something”. Subsequent to the interview Detective Macdonald told Ringo that he was not going to be charged with murder. Whether that admission was made by JB was a contested issue at trial and would be a contested issue in any re-trial.


	
	In a conference that Ringo had with the Crown prosecutor during the trial, Ringo was told “someone says you did [have a knife] and threw it over the fence”. Ringo told the Crown prosecutor “not true”. These conference notes were served on JB and were used in cross-examination. Nowhere in the conference notes is it recorded that Ringo was told the source of this evidence. (The Crown submitted that the conference notes would be tendered in a retrial to establish this issue.)
	
	
	At the trial the evidence came out differently in that Ringo said that the prosecutor told him that EC had claimed that he disposed of a knife. That is contrary to what is recorded in the conference notes.
	
	
	After EC made a statement on 3 August 2009, in which he said that Ringo had disposed of the knife, the Crown prosecutor asked NSW Police to obtain a statement from Ringo about this. When approached by NSW Police on this issue, Ringo refused to make a statement because he said that he did not know anything about the knife. It is the Crown case that from 5 August 2009 Ringo knew that there was an allegation that he disposed of a knife and that he was not given that information at the conference with the Crown during the trial. The Crown noted that evidence of this would be available in a retrial if JB sought to maintain that the Crown prosecutor inappropriately behaved with that witness.
	
	
	Dut gave evidence about the second confrontation when the fight occurred. He said that Ringo took two sticks from a real estate sign and gave one to him. Because Dut did not want to fight, Ringo gave the stick to Deng. Dut said that he then went away from the Clyde railway station to Auburn railway station. This occurred when the fighting was taking place.
	
	
	In his statement to NSW Police of 22 April 2008, Dut said that JB told him after the fight that he had stabbed someone in the leg. In its submissions to this Court, the Crown properly conceded that Dut did not give this evidence at trial and that it was unlikely that he would give such evidence in a retrial. The Crown accepted that if he did give such evidence in a retrial, its force would be significantly undermined by the fact that he made no reference to such an important issue in the trial.
	
	
	At trial the medical evidence was uncontroversial. Dr Langlois, who conducted the post mortem examination, gave evidence that the deceased died from loss of blood from wounds to the trunk and right thigh. There was a 3.5cm long wound to the abdomen likely to be from a single edged blade. There was a 4cm long wound to the back of the chest, likely to be from a single sided cutting implement such as a knife. There was a wound to the right thigh (which because of surgical intervention could not be measured). Most of the blood loss was from the thigh wound. While it was not possible for Dr Langlois to give definite evidence as to the length of the blade that caused each wound, he thought that the dimensions of the wounds suggested a blade of approximately 3.5 - 4 cm in width.
	
	
	JB did not give evidence at trial. In cross-examination of Crown witnesses on behalf of JB, the following evidence was elicited.
	
	
	Marle agreed that it was raining quite heavily on the night of 20-21 April 2008 and that the area around Memorial Drive was pretty poorly lit.
	
	
	Firoz conceded that he had been drinking all afternoon and evening and that by the time of the incident involving the knife near the railway station he was “really drunk” (T.157). He agreed that it was “very dark” in the area where the group of 15 people were and that once the fight started there, he did not see a knife.
	
	
	JW agreed that he could see JB’s fists while he was fighting and that he did not see any knife in his hand. He said that there were only six people in their group and that there were never 15 or 20 people.
	
	
	EC agreed that when JB was shown on the CCTV footage as indicating something with his hands, he was talking about the first confrontation which occurred at Granville Railway Station (not on Memorial Drive) and that JB was talking about how he punched the guy (i.e. at Granville Railway Station).
	
	
	By reference to the above material the Crown summarised its case against JB in a re-trial as follows:
	



	
	The stabbing of the deceased must have been done by one of JB’s group. Ringo, Dut, EC and JW would all deny under oath being responsible for the stabbing. By a process of elimination this would leave JB as the remaining member of his group and against whom there exists a substantial body of evidence.
	
	
	There was ample motive in that JB had been punched in the mouth in the initial altercation. After he ran away he was very upset and crying, he was the smallest and youngest of his group and had been drinking. JB wanted revenge and encouraged the others to return and confront the “Islander group”.
	
	
	There was evidence of JB being in possession of a knife in the original altercation (Firoz, Vunisa and Bali). This evidence is capable of showing a very proximate temporal connection between the possession of a knife by JB, his willingness to use it, and his continuing state of mind and aggression towards the deceased’s group.
	
	
	JW saw JB fighting with the deceased and although he did not see a knife, a jury would be entitled in all the circumstances to find that what JW in fact observed was JB stabbing the deceased. The credibility of JW on this issue would be a matter for a future jury. The evidence of JW as to the location of JB was in part confirmed by Ringo.
	
	
	Ringo received two admissions from JB, although they were not overheard by anyone else. The second of those admissions receives support from the CCTV which shows JB making a stabbing motion in the manner described by Ringo. A future jury would be entitled to regard the CCTV evidence as providing strong support for the evidence of Ringo Madut.
	
	
	The credibility of Ringo is a matter for a future jury. No-one gave any evidence of seeing Ringo using a knife at any time nor that he was on the same side of the road as the deceased. A future jury would be entitled to accept Ringo’s evidence of the two admissions and if either of the admissions were accepted by a future jury as having been made by JB, that jury would be entitled to find the offence proved.
	
	
	Although EC saw Ringo dispose of a knife after the incidents, at no time did EC or anyone else see Ringo Madut using a knife nor did EC see Ringo Madut on the side of the road where the deceased was.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there is nothing in the fresh evidence which significantly undermines the evidence of Ringo. In that regard, the Crown submitted that it might be necessary to make a decision as to the actions and credibility of the two police officers who dealt with Ringo (and therefore hear their evidence) before a decision on this issue could be made.
	



	
	In oral submissions in this Court, the Crown qualified what is set out in [64(3)] hereof. The Crown accepted that the evidence of Vunisa and Bali as to the production of a knife by JB in the first altercation could simply not be correct. The Crown noted that the incident involving JB either punching or pushing Firoz and what followed thereafter was fully recorded by CCTV. That CCTV film is quite inconsistent with anyone producing a knife at that time. The Crown accepted that this concession was made at trial.
	
	
	The Crown did not abandon the submission that JB had produced a knife during the course of the first altercation. It submitted that this was supported by the evidence of Firoz. It submitted that the CCTV footage showed that in the course of the first altercation it was JB and EC who became separated from their companions and that they alone ran down a particular ramp. That is consistent with the evidence of Firoz that he chased JB down a ramp.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the only persons he could have been chasing were JB and EC because they were the only ones who went down that particular ramp. The Crown submitted that this is clear from the trial transcript (T.130 – 131). The Crown submitted that the transcripts made it clear that Firoz had pursued two persons down a ramp and into the street when one of them (being the person who had punched him) pulled out a knife and threatened to kill him. The Crown accepted that this incident was not shown on CCTV because it occurred away from the station, down a ramp and some distance along a street. The Crown submitted that this was the basis for its submission at [64(3)] hereof.
	


Consideration


	
	The issue before the Court is whether a new trial should be ordered. The relevant provision is s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). That section provides:
	


“8(1)   On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.”


	
	The application of the section has been considered on a number of occasions as a result of which the following propositions are uncontroversial. A new trial should only be ordered where it would more adequately remedy the miscarriage of justice than any other order the Court could make. It is not the inevitable result of a successful appeal, and the Crown has the onus of showing the Court that a new trial is the most appropriate remedy (King v The Queen [1986] HCA 59; 161 CLR 423 at 426 and 433). The correct approach is that each case has to be considered on its own facts and all relevant considerations that apply to it. The accused should be accorded neither more nor less personal consideration than the overall justice of the case requires. This is in recognition of the public interest in the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice (The Queen v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at [49]).
	
	
	The Court has a wide discretion as to whether to order or refuse a new trial but where there is insufficient evidence at the original trial to warrant a conviction, or if the evidence available at any new trial would be insufficient, then there should be no order for a re-trial and the appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right (Gerakiteys v The Queen [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317 at 321; R v Taufahema at [52]).
	
	
	The relevant principles were comprehensively set out by McClellan CJ at CL in Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131; 224 A Crim R 22 where his Honour said:
	


“648   Whether there should be an order for a new trial under s 8(1) is a discretionary consideration. However, the discretion is only to be exercised if the court determines that the evidence presented at trial was sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction, for if it was not, an acquittal must follow as a matter of course: Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler [1984] HCA 48; 154 CLR 627 at 630; Gerakiteys v The Queen [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317 at 322 (Gibbs CJ), 331 (Deane J). For the reasons discussed under the unreasonable verdict ground of appeal, the evidence before the jury was sufficiently cogent to justify the applicant's conviction. It is therefore necessary, in view of the other successful grounds of appeal, to consider whether the applicant ought to be acquitted or retried.

649   The relevant principles were discussed in Reid v The Queen [1980] 1 AC 343 and Fowler: R v Anderson (1991) 53 A Crim R 421 at 453 (Gleeson CJ). The overriding consideration is whether the interests of justice require a new trial: Fowler at 630. Unless the interests of justice require the entry of a verdict of acquittal, an appellate court should ordinarily order a new trial of a charge where a conviction in respect of that charge has been set aside but there is evidence to support the charge: Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; 201 CLR 603 at [104]. The court determines where the interests of justice lie by considering various factors, including:

the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of offenders (R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at [49]; Anderson at 453; Reid at 349);

the seriousness of the alleged crimes (Anderson at 453; Reid at 350; Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209; 188 A Crim R 331 at [164] (Johnson J));

the strength of the Crown case (Anderson at 453);

the desirability, if possible, of having the guilt or innocence of the accused finally determined by a jury, which, according to the constitutional arrangements applicable in New South Wales, is the appropriate body to make such a decision (Taufahema at [51]; Anderson at 453; Reid at 350);

the length of time between the alleged offence and the new trial, and in particular whether the delay will occasion prejudice to the accused (Taufahema at [55]; Parker v The Queen [1997] HCA 15; 186 CLR 494 at 520 (Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ); Anderson at 453);

whether the grant of a new trial would impermissibly give the prosecution an opportunity to supplement or ""patch up"" a defective case or to present a case significantly different to that presented to the jury in the previous trial (R v Wilkes [1948] HCA 22; 77 CLR 511 at 518; King v The Queen [1986] HCA 59; 161 CLR 423 at 433 (Dawson J); Parker at 520 (Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ); Reid at 350; Fowler at 630; Anderson at 453; Taufahema at [59]);

the interests of the individual accused, and in particular whether it would be unduly oppressive to put the accused to the expense and worry of a further trial (Spies at [103]; Reid at 350);

whether a significant part of the sentence imposed upon conviction has already been served (Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; 173 CLR 572 at 590 (McHugh J));

the expense and length of a further trial (Reid at 350);

whether a successful appellant to the Court of Criminal Appeal has been released from custody (Taufahema at [55]; Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 302 (Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ); R v Wilton (1981) 28 SASR 362; A Crim R 5 at 367-68 (King CJ)); and

whether an acquittal would usurp the functions of the properly constituted prosecutorial authorities, which are entrusted with responsibilities and discretions to act in the public interest in the initiation and conduct of criminal prosecutions (R v Thomas (No 3) [2006] VSCA 300; (2006) 14 VR 512 at [27]).”


	
	In relation to those matters, it needs to be kept in mind that the charge of murder is the most serious crime known to the law. The Court must give appropriate weight to the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of persons accused of murder. As Spigelman CJ said in Justins v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 242; 204 A Crim R 315 at [12]: “the criminal involvement of one person in the death of another raises a serious issue of moral culpability that ought be determined”.
	
	
	There are, however, considerations which point in the other direction. The strength of the Crown case has undoubtedly been greatly diminished by the absence of the evidence of A107, which was pivotal to the conviction of JB at trial. The focus of the Crown case in any retrial would be quite different and would depend upon the evidence of Ringo and whether it was open to a jury to find that at any time on the night in question, JB was in possession of a knife. The exercise which the Court is required to carry out on that issue is in reality something of a predictive one. This was appreciated by Garling J in Gilham v R when his Honour said:
	


“686   An assessment must be made of the strength of the Crown case to be presented at any retrial. Such an assessment is made on the basis of all of the evidence which is now available, and not just the evidence which was before either of the two previous juries. …”


	
	It is also the case that eight years have passed since the events of 21 April 2008. This is of significance, given the age of the witnesses and the fact that all of them had been affected to varying degrees by the consumption of alcohol.
	


Evidence that JB was in possession of a knife


	
	By reference to the CCTV film taken at the Granville train station, it is possible to identify by their clothing each member of the “islander group” and each member of the “Sudanese group”. The islander group comprised five persons and the Sudanese group, six persons. The clothing worn by each member of the Sudanese group is quite distinctive. JB was wearing a dark top with light coloured shorts which extended below his knees. There appears to be a lighter patch or pocket on the left side of JB’s top. As was accepted by the Crown both at trial and before this Court, there was no evidence of anyone, in particular JB, producing a knife at the time of the initial altercation on the platform at the Granville station. This is despite JB being punched in the mouth by Vunisa. One might think that if he had a knife that was the occasion when he would be likely to produce it.
	
	
	The CCTV footage provides clear and independent evidence of what happened on the platform. Apart from his confrontation with Firoz and Vunisa at the beginning of the altercation, JB played no further part. On the contrary, he can be seen standing to the rear of his group while others, in particular Ringo and JW, are more actively involved. This can also be seen in a still colour photograph (ex E) taken from the CCTV footage. That footage and the still photograph show Bali in the process of striking Ringo, with Vunisa in support. JB’s actions at that stage appear to be inconsistent with the aggressive stance attributed to him in the Crown case theory.
	
	
	If one rejects the production of a knife during the first altercation covered by the CCTV cameras, the only evidence of a knife being produced by JB comes from Vunisa and Firoz. Vunisa says that he and Firoz pursued the person who had produced a knife on the platform and another person wearing a red top. Vunisa said that when he, Firoz and Bali were about five minutes away from the station, the “guy with the knife” and “the other guy” approached them. Vunisa said that each of them had a knife and that they were jumping close to him and Firoz. He and Firoz defended themselves with a rubbish bin and a signpost. Vunisa said that the fight continued for about six or seven minutes before the men ran off (T.181-183).
	
	
	Although Vunisa started by describing JB, his subsequent description of what occurred is more consistent with the altercation between he and Bali on one side, and Ringo and JW on the other, with Bali apparently preparing to throw a punch at Ringo (ex E). If that is the correct way to interpret Vunisa’s evidence, the two persons whom he says attacked Firoz and then himself with knives, one of whom had a red top, were Ringo and JW not JB and EC. There is also the rather enigmatic response by Vunisa at T.186.15 that “only last time I see the knife on the platform”. Finally, there is the evidence in cross-examination at T.231-232 where it is not clear whether the effect of Vunisa’s evidence is that there were three incidents where a knife was produced by someone from the Sudanese group or only two.
	
	
	There are a number of problems with Vunisa’s evidence. It is predicated on one of the persons who produced a knife being the same person whom he said produced a knife during the earlier altercation on the train platform. It is now accepted by the Crown that there was no knife produced on the platform. This places considerable doubt on his evidence of a second production of a knife. No other witness gave that evidence, i.e. that two of the Sudanese group produced knives causing Vunisa, Bali and Firoz to defend themselves. The only member of the Sudanese group to wear a red top was JW, whereas the CCTV footage makes it clear that it was JB and EC (who was wearing a blue and white top) who descended the same ramp and were pursued by Firoz. This evidence of Vunisa is contradicted by that of Firoz and EC and is inconsistent with that of Bali, although it has to be conceded that Bali’s evidence is quite confusing. Bali’s evidence is inconsistent with what Firoz said and is not supported by any other witness. Finally, Vunisa’s evidence under cross-examination at T.222 – 224 to the effect that the persons who produced knives to him and Firoz were wearing a white top and a red top is inconsistent with either person being JB. It is consistent with those persons being Ringo and JW.
	
	
	Vunisa’s evidence on this issue is most unlikely to be accepted in any retrial. If it is accepted, properly read, it does not implicate JB. It does implicate JW and Ringo.
	
	
	The only other direct evidence on this issue is that of Firoz Mohammed. His evidence was that he was approached by two African men, one of whom was wearing a “sort of black and gold jumper” and the other was wearing “a white football jumper” (T.126-127). The one wearing the black and gold jumper asked him for a cigarette and when he refused, that man punched him in the mouth. Subsequently, Firoz changed his evidence and identified the person who hit him as the man wearing the white jumper (T.147). He then chased both of those men. Firoz said that about 20 metres from the station, one of the men came around the corner towards him, took a knife from his pocket, made a forward movement towards him three or four times saying “I’m going to kill you”. He identified that person as the one who had punched him earlier. Firoz said that the other man was there as well but that he did not have a knife (T.130 – 132).
	
	
	There are a number of difficulties with that evidence. The only one of the “Sudanese” group to have a white top was Dut, whereas JB had a dark top and it could not be described as a “black and gold jumper”, nor as a white jumper. At most it had a light patch or pocket on the left side. EC who was with JB, was wearing a blue and white top which could not in any way be mistaken for a “white football jumper” or a “black and gold jumper”.
	
	
	Firoz was mistaken in his evidence as to the clothing worn by the person who struck him which is clearly shown on the CCTV footage. The importance of that error is that it carries over to the identification of the person whom he said produced a knife, i.e. the same person as the one who struck him. We know from the CCTV footage that JB in fact struck Firoz and that he and EC were pursued by him. There still, however, remains confusion in his evidence as to which of them produced a knife.
	
	
	The evidence of EC is inconsistent with that of Firoz. He agreed that he and JB were pursued by Firoz, but said nothing about any confrontation with Firoz or anyone else between the commencement of the pursuit and the time when he and JB joined the rest of their group. JW and Ringo say nothing of such a confrontation.
	
	
	There are other problems with the evidence of Firoz. In cross-examination he agreed that he had been drinking all afternoon and evening and that by the time of the incident on the platform of the railway station, he was “really drunk”. He and Vunisa gave evidence that on the occasion of the second altercation during which the deceased was stabbed, there were 15 – 20 in the “Sudanese” group when in fact there were only six (T.172-173).
	
	
	There is evidence from a security guard at the Granville RSL that when JB and EC sought his assistance, they looked “scared” and said “help us, these men want to hurt us”. This is inconsistent with an aggressive attack on Firoz accompanied by the production of a knife and threats to kill him.
	
	
	Because he was a member of the group who had lost one of their number, there was an obvious incentive on the part of Firoz to give evidence which would damage a member of the Sudanese group.
	
	
	These matters must place considerable doubt on the likely acceptance of this evidence by the jury in a retrial.
	
	
	There is a legal difficulty confronting the Crown’s reliance upon this evidence of Firoz in a retrial. It arises from the verdict of acquittal entered in respect of the attempted murder charge. In a retrial, JB would undoubtedly raise autrefois acquit in relation to the evidence of Firoz as to the production of a knife, the movement of the knife towards him and the verbal threat. The basic principle underlying autrefois acquit is that the prosecution should be precluded from re-asserting the guilt of an accused when that question has previously been determined against it. The principle extends to factual issues essential to the offence in respect of which an accused has been acquitted (The Queen v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; 213 CLR 635 at [35], [37], [40], [48], [86], [91] – [93]).
	
	
	It may be that in a retrial JB would be entirely successful in preventing any evidence of him producing a knife to Firoz and threatening him, both by action and words, coming before the jury. Because the issue under consideration by the Court is the application of s 8(1) with its predictive element, it is preferable to adopt a conservative approach and allow for the possibility that such evidence, at least in part, could be adduced before the jury.
	
	
	Given the incontrovertible nature of the verdict of acquittal on the attempted murder charge, I do not see how the Crown could adduce on a retrial evidence of the oral threats said to have been made by JB or of his alleged attempts to stab Firoz. They would appear to be essential aspects of the attempted murder charge. The mere production of a knife, without more, may not be picked up by the prohibition. Accordingly, I am prepared to accept that in a retrial Firoz would be able to give evidence that JB (or someone in the “Sudanese” group) produced a knife.
	
	
	Nevertheless, there are so many problems with the evidence of Firoz that I am unable to conclude that it would be open to a jury in a retrial to accept his evidence that one of the Sudanese group produced a knife and that this was the person who had punched him at the beginning of the first altercation.
	
	
	The only other direct evidence of anyone in the Sudanese group having a knife, comes from EC whose evidence is that he saw Ringo disposing of a knife following the second altercation. The words which EC said accompanied that action are consistent with Ringo having some connection with the stabbing of the deceased, i.e. “He said I’ve got to get rid of it” (T.469.47). There was no evidence adduced at the trial to indicate that EC had any motivation or reason for telling an untruth about Ringo. Although EC was a friend of JB’s, he had only known him for a few weeks. It is not known how long he had known Ringo.
	
	
	In response to that evidence, the Crown submitted that Ringo denied having a knife and disposing of it in the way described by EC. The Crown also submitted that there was no evidence of anyone seeing Ringo with a knife during either altercation (in that regard the same can be said of JB with the exception of the evidence of Firoz and Vunisa). It should also be noted that Ringo’s apparent possession of a knife was more proximate to the actual stabbing incident than was that asserted against JB. Ringo had a motive to retaliate against the Islander group in that in the first altercation he had been knocked to the ground, had lost his phone and camera and was only able to retrieve his camera. It was also EC’s evidence that it was Ringo in the second altercation who told the “Sudanese” group to “run” bringing it to an end (T.468). That is consistent with something having occurred which Ringo considered provided a good reason for the Sudanese group to rapidly leave the scene of the second altercation.
	
	
	It is true that JW identified Dut as the person who yelled out that the group should “run” (T.414, 446). Significantly, however, it was not suggested by any witness that JB said anything to that effect during, or at the conclusion of, the second altercation. Ringo denied that he had told the group to “run” and denied that anyone else had done so. He did, however, agree that the “Sudanese” group had run away from the site of the second altercation.
	
	
	Once the evidence of A107 is taken out of the picture, there is evidence that at least two, if not more of the Sudanese group, had knives. This places considerable doubt on the line of reasoning that a knife was used in the murder, JB was the only person with a knife and therefore there is a strong likelihood that he used it.
	


The admission to Ringo


	
	The high point of the Crown case against JB is the two admissions which he is said to have made to Ringo. The first of those is said to have occurred as the group was walking to Auburn railway station following the second altercation and the second at Auburn station in the presence of the whole group. Ringo sought to corroborate that evidence by reference to the CCTV footage which he said showed JB re-enacting what had happened between him and the deceased by making a stabbing motion with his right arm.
	
	
	When the whole of Ringo’s evidence on the subject is looked at, it provides some assistance for JB in that Ringo said that he did not believe JB because he did not see him holding anything in his hand. Although it is not entirely without doubt, this would seem to be a reference to the occasion of the second altercation and not when JB was said to have made the admission. This interpretation is confirmed by what Ringo said later in his evidence:
	


“Q. The first thing you saw was JB run across the road, you didn’t see anything in his hands, did you?

A. No.” (T.538.12)


	
	Despite the evidence of Ringo in chief (T.514) (see also [47] hereof) where he referred to two occasions when JB made an admission to him, i.e. when they were walking towards Auburn station and after they had arrived there, it is not clear whether he has always asserted that the admission was made on two occasions. In his police statement (T.539) Ringo referred to only one occasion. This appears to have been confirmed in cross-examination at T.544.49 where he said:
	


“Q. Mr Madut, JB never said anything to you about stabbing anyone, did he?

A. Yes, I heard him while I was talking.”


	
	The evidence of Ringo of the admission or admissions is weakened in a number of respects. There is evidence, which is capable of directly implicating him in the murder. This is the evidence of EC as to the disposal of the knife. There is the evidence of Vunisa and Bali which in its totality is more consistent with Ringo possessing a knife than JB. Ringo agreed to give evidence for the Crown and as a result, received a discount from his sentence. As a result, he had a direct interest in not only exculpating himself from any involvement in the killing but in implicating JB.
	
	
	The way in which Ringo came to give evidence concerning the admission/admissions is of importance. The “admission” first emerged in an interview with Detectives Fulham and MacDonald in response to a leading question from Detective MacDonald (second ERISP, Q.329). The second ERISP only took place after a halt in the first interview and a conversation with Detective MacDonald which took place during that break which was not recorded. The unrecorded conversation apparently involved a threat to charge Ringo with murder. That threat appears to have contributed to the second interview taking place. The record of interview refers to only one occasion when the admission was made by JB.
	
	
	The same issue arises from the way in which Ringo was asked to respond to the statement of EC that he disposed of a knife. In his evidence at trial (T.541) Ringo said that the Crown in conference identified EC as the source of that information and told him what EC had said. The notes of the Crown relating to that conference, which took place during the trial, do not refer to EC being identified as the source of that information. When Ringo gave evidence he was clearly aware that EC was the source of the allegation against him. It is difficult to see where this information could have come from unless from the Crown. This discrepancy was not resolved at the trial.
	
	
	There are two other complications in relation to the evidence of Ringo. The first is that JB’s solicitor at the trial, Mr Kaufmann was also Ringo’s solicitor and acted for him in relation to other (unrelated) charges which he was facing. There was also an issue as to what, if any, was the contact between A107 and Ringo before Ringo attended the police station. Ringo denied any contact whereas A107 gave evidence to the contrary.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon CCTV film from the Auburn railway station to corroborate Ringo’s evidence that when the Sudanese group arrived there, JB told them that he had stabbed someone in the leg and demonstrated to the group a stabbing motion with his arms. Ringo identified those gestures on the CCTV footage at trial.
	
	
	I have viewed that CCTV footage on numerous occasions at normal and slow speeds. My observations do not accord with Ringo’s description. What I have observed is JB pushing his right fist into his open left palm. I have no doubt as to the accuracy of my observation. The gesture is nothing like a stabbing motion. The gesture is fully consistent with the evidence of EC at trial, i.e. that JB was demonstrating how he had punched someone.
	
	
	In the trial EC was recalled for cross-examination and having been shown the relevant part of the CCTV footage, gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. Are you just watching that now?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember being here at Auburn?

A. Yes.

Q. When I say here, I mean there, what’s depicted there in that. It’s Ringo with JW, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. You see J and Deng and yourself?

A. Yes.

Q. So six there altogether, isn’t there?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you been shown this before?

A. Yeah, once at Kariong.

Q. Who showed it to you?

A. Detective MacDonald.

Q. Did he ask you about it?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he ask you about it?

A. He said what J was talking about here.

Q. He asked you what J was talking about?

A. Yeah.

Q. Do you recall what you said?

A. He was talking about the thing.

Q. About?

A. He was talking about the fight that happened.

Q. Which fight?

A. The one that happened on the top of the station.

Q. At the top of the station?

A. Yes.

Q. Which station?

A. Granville.” (T.618.19 – 619.30)


	
	Under re-examination by the Crown prosecutor, EC gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. My learned friend asked you some questions about what happened in that tape. You said J told you, said something about what had happened. What did he say?

A. About how he punched the guy.

Q. Sorry?

A. About how he punched the guy.

Q. What else did he say?

A. That’s it.

Q. You saw on the tape that he was indicating something with his hands? What was he saying when he was doing that?

A. How he punched the guy.

Q. How he punched the guy?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that all he said?

A. Yeah.” (T.621.39 – 622.8)


	
	To my observation, JB’s actions at the Auburn railway station, as recorded by the CCTV film, are consistent with him demonstrating a punch and quite inconsistent with a stabbing motion, such as is relied upon by the Crown. To my observation, the CCTV footage provides no corroboration for the evidence of Ringo to the effect that JB was telling the Sudanese group that he had stabbed someone in the leg during the recent altercation and was demonstrating how he did so by hand gestures. Finally, no-one in the Sudanese group gave evidence which corroborated Ringo on this issue.
	
	
	I have concluded that far from providing corroboration for the evidence of Ringo as to JB admitting that he had stabbed someone, the CCTV footage identified by Ringo raises a substantial doubt as to the reliability of his evidence. That, taken with the other aspects of Ringo’s evidence to which reference has been made, leads me to conclude that Ringo’s evidence of the admission or admissions is unlikely to be accepted by a jury in a retrial.
	


The interaction of JB and the deceased


	
	The last important part of the Crown case is that JB was the only person seen to be fighting with the deceased. The evidence on this issue comes from JW. He said that in the second altercation when the deceased was stabbed, he saw JB and Dut on the other side of the road, which was closest to the railway:
	


“Q. About how far away from you was he?

A. Probably five metres or something.

Q. What was he doing?

A. Was fighting.

Q. Who was he fighting with did you see?

A. Some guy with a black jacket.

Q. Some guy with a black jacket?

A. Yeah, a black leather jacket.

Q. Did you notice anything else about the guy with the black leather jacket?

A. Yes he had a plastic bag on him.

Q. And you say that you saw J with fighting with him. What did you see him doing?

A. He was swinging.

Q. Swinging what?

A. His fists.

Q. Did you see him hit the bloke?

A. Yeah.

Q. Whereabouts did you see him hit him?

A. I can’t remember but I seen him swinging, he’s hitting the bloke.

Q. Are you able to say how many times?

A. Probably three or four times.

Q. These swings that you saw, were they soft or hard?

A. They were hard.

Q. And the man with the black leather jacket and the plastic bag what was he doing?

A. He was trying to fight back too.

Q. When you say he was trying to fight back, what did you see him do?

A. He was trying to hit J with the plastic bag.

Q. Can you say how many times you saw him do that?

A. No, I don’t remember how many times.

Q. You say that there was J and the man with the plastic bag?

A. Yeah.

Q. Was anybody else over on that side of the road?

A. Yeah.

Q. Who else?

A. Dut.

Q. What was Dut doing?

A. Dut was behind J.

…

Q. What was he doing, was he just standing there, what was he doing?

A. I think he was standing there. I don’t think he did anything.

Q. What happened next?

A. We ran.

Q. Where did you go to?

A. We ran to the park.

Q. Do you know why it was that you went?

A. Yeah because Dut, Dut yelled out to everyone and goes “run”.

Q. He yelled out what?

A. He say “run”.

Q. Did everybody run?

A. Yeah.” (T.412.10 – 414.18)


	
	In cross-examination the evidence of JW was:
	


“Q. How did you come to be looking at the other side of the road, do you remember?

A. Because J was on this side.

Q. He was on the same side as you?

A. Yeah.

Q. You mean on the side where the RSL is?

A. Yeah and he kind of changed his place and went to the other side.

Q. He kind of changed place?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Dut go with him?

A. Yeah.

Q. He and Dut went to the other side of the road at the same time?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you say you saw J swing his fist 3 or 4 times and you said you are able to say that he hit him those times, you said that didn’t you?

A. Yeah.

Q. So the light was certainly good enough to see that?

A. Yeah.

Q. You could see J, in fact you could see his fists couldn’t you?

A. I could see him fighting someone.

Q. You say you could see J throwing punches, swinging punches, that’s right isn’t it?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you were able to see that he was using both fists?

A. Yeah.

Q. So he was using both fists to punch him, that’s right isn’t it?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you could see that his hands were closed into fists, that’s right isn’t it?

A. Yeah.

Q. That’s right isn’t it?

A. Yeah.

Q. You could see his hands were closed into fists?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you saw no knife in his hand, did you?

A. No.

Q. Then you say it was Dut that yelled out “run” was it?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you quite sure it wasn’t Ringo?

A. It was Dut.” (T.445.30 – 446.35)


	
	The only other evidence on this issue was that of EC:
	


“Q. What about Dut what was he doing?

A. Dut was in the middle of the road.

Q. Was he involved in the fighting?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you see him do?

A. He was swinging a stick too.

Q. Did you see where he got that stick from?

A. No.

Q. What about J where was he?

A. He was in the middle of the road.

Q. Did you see him do anything?

A. No.

Q. What was he doing, just standing there?

A. Yeah.

Q. Then what happened?

A. Then Ringo said run and then we ran.

Q. Who said run?

A. Ringo.

Q. When he said run what happened?

A. Then we all run.” (T.468.12)


	
	It was the Crown case that JW was mistaken and that JB was holding a knife and that when he appeared to be punching the deceased, he was in fact stabbing him. There is an obvious problem with that scenario. The evidence of JW is contrary to that proposition. In particular, the evidence of JW that JB was using his fists is inconsistent with the Crown’s scenario. Finally, the evidence of JW that JB was using both hands when attempting to strike the deceased is inconsistent with a person using a knife. One does not need to be particularly familiar with the stance adopted by a person using his fists and that of a person using a knife to understand that the position of the body and of the arms is very different.
	
	
	The evidence of EC and JW is of assistance on another issue. What it indicates (and this is confirmed by the evidence of the other witnesses from both groups) is that the evidence as to timing during these altercations is unreliable. What the evidence provides are brief windows of particular activities without any comprehensive sequential description of what occurred. This is particularly so in relation to the second altercation where observations cannot be checked by reference to CCTV footage. JW has JB fighting with the deceased before Dut said to “run”. EC has him in the middle of the road doing nothing when Ringo says to “run”. Both pieces of evidence may well be correct but be referring to different times during the second altercation. No-one saw the deceased fall.
	
	
	What is clear is that this evidence provides no support for the Crown case. The Crown case pre-supposes that JB had a knife, was using it and that this presumption can be used to interpret the evidence of JW. In fact, the evidence of JW goes no further than to place JB next to the deceased at some point during the second altercation. It is not capable either on its own, nor when taken with other evidence, of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that JB stabbed the deceased.
	
	
	It is also not without significance that Dut gave evidence that he did not go with the others when they went to again confront the Islander group. He said that he stayed where he was and that he made observations from some distance away. That, of course, is contrary to the evidence of JW, EC and Ringo who place him near to JB and in the case of JW and Ringo, on the other side of the road, i.e. on the same side as the deceased. While there is no evidence of Dut fighting with the deceased, on JW’s evidence he was close to the deceased and was the person who told the Sudanese group to “run”. There are a number of innocent explanations for why Dut may have told lies on this issue. Nevertheless, it adds another complication for the Crown case against JB.
	


Conclusion


	
	It is with that background that the principles relating to the application of s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 need to be considered (see [68] – [74] hereof). The question of whether a new trial should be ordered is a discretionary one. In deciding whether to exercise the discretion, the Court must decide whether the interests of justice require that a new trial be had.
	
	
	As a start point it needs to be kept in mind that the trial of JB miscarried because of failures on the part of the prosecuting authority. These consisted of an inadequate investigation of the position of A107 and an inadequate disclosure of that position to the defence. There was no conduct on the part of JB which contributed to the mistrial.
	
	
	The considerations which support an order for a new trial under s 8(1) primarily relate to the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of offenders and the seriousness of the offence with which JB was charged, i.e. murder. It is also desirable that the guilt or innocence of JB be finally determined by a jury. Other lesser but still important considerations are that a re-trial would not be particularly lengthy (probably about three weeks) and would not involve significant expense. Finally, there is the consideration of whether an acquittal would usurp the functions of the properly constituted prosecutorial authorities which are entrusted with the responsibility to act in the public interest in the initiation of criminal prosecution.
	
	
	The considerations militating against a re-trial are also important. One of those considerations is the strength of the Crown case. For the reasons set out above, I have concluded that the Crown case on a re-trial is not strong and is likely to result in an acquittal. The evidence that JB was in possession of a knife at any time is at best equivocal, and at worst unconvincing and contradictory. The alleged admission to Ringo depends upon the evidence of an interested person and to the extent that there is any objective evidence, it does not support such an admission being made. Finally, the interaction between JB and the deceased requires the rejection of clear evidence to the contrary and a degree of speculation before it could be of significant probative value in the Crown case.
	
	
	Almost eight years have passed since the offence occurred. The memories of the witnesses, many of whom were young, were adversely affected by liquor. Those memories were not particularly good at the time of trial and would have further deteriorated. JB was aged 15 at the time of the offence, has served 6 years and 8 months of a sentence with 16 year non-parole period and has been on bail since December 2013. In the circumstances, the anxiety and hardship associated with a re-trial would be substantial.
	
	
	While it cannot be said that a new trial would be run differently, the focus of the prosecution would be different. Without the evidence of A107, matters which were not stressed in the first trial would take on a new importance. It is in relation to those issues that the passage of time and memory problems become important. It is notorious that memories fade with the passage of time while the recollections of others may become entrenched. Although this presents a problem in many trials, it does not for that reason cease to be relevant as a discretionary consideration when considering whether an order for a retrial should be made in the interests of justice at this time.
	
	
	Of the matters enumerated above, the most important is the relative weakness of the Crown case without the evidence of A107. By reason of the combination of factors to which I have referred above but in particular my conclusion that the new Crown case would not be a strong one, I have concluded that in accordance with the broad discretion conferred by s 8(1), the interests of justice require that a verdict of acquittal be entered.
	
	
	After preparing the above reasons, I have had the opportunity of reading the judgments of Adams and McCallum JJ. While I appreciate her Honour’s reasoning, I am unable to agree with it. I do, however, agree with and respectfully adopt the additional reasons of Adams J.
	
	
	Although the “fresh and new” evidence was not placed before the Court by the Crown, its purport was clear. The applicant’s written submissions challenged not only what was left of the Crown case after the removal of the evidence of A107, but asserted that the two police officers in charge of the investigations were at all times aware that A107 was a registered police informer and that this had, in effect, infected most of what they had done in the preparation of the trial. The “fresh and new” evidence comprised statements/affidavits from those two police officers to contrary effect.
	
	
	I do not see how in those circumstances the “fresh and new” evidence could add to the Crown case likely to be presented on a re-trial. The “fresh and new” evidence was essentially defensive in nature and sought to deflect submissions by the applicant that the process whereby he had been convicted of murder was so flawed that not only could the conviction not stand, but that the Crown should not be given an opportunity to patch up its case. The approach which I adopted favoured the Crown because it had no regard to any challenge to the integrity of the investigating police officers and the part which they might have played in A107 giving the evidence which he did. It assumed that the evidence led by the Crown (except that of A107) had been appropriately collected and legitimately adduced at trial and further assumed that such evidence would be capable of being led by the Crown in any re-trial.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I adhere to the view which I expressed in the course of an exchange with counsel in the appeal, that when deciding whether pursuant to s 8(1), there should be a re-trial, there was no need to engage in an inquiry of the sort initially foreshadowed by the parties, i.e. the applicant adducing what evidence he had as to the conduct of the investigating police officers and the Crown responding with the evidence of those police officers and their attendance for cross-examination. I remain firmly of the view that such an exercise in the particular circumstances of this case, was otiose. At no time was it foreshadowed, either in the oral or written submissions, that any issue other than those to which I have referred, would be the subject of “fresh and new” evidence.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	


(1)   The appeal against conviction is allowed.

(2)   The conviction for the murder of Edward Spowart is quashed.

(3)   That a verdict of acquittal be entered in favour of JB.


	
	ADAMS J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and McCallum J. I have concluded that, for the reasons he has given, the orders should be as proposed by his Honour. I wish briefly to explain why, with respect, I do not agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	The starting point is the referral by R A Hulme J, following his Honour’s consideration of the appellant’s application under s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 1912 (NSW) (the Act) for an inquiry into his conviction, of “the whole case” to this Court under s 79(1)(b) “to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912”. The conviction depended to a significant degree upon evidence given by witness A107 of certain admissions allegedly made to him by the appellant. The evidence disclosed to the Inquiry necessarily led to the conclusion that the evidence of those alleged admissions was inadmissible. It followed that there was a miscarriage of justice and the conviction could not stand. As s 5(2) provides, if an appeal is allowed against conviction, it must be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered unless, in effect, it is appropriate to make an order for a new trial under s 8(1) of the Act. The relevant considerations have been set out by Hoeben CJ at CL and, as I understand it, his Honour’s summary of the position is not controversial. His Honour cited King v R [1986] HC 59; 161 CLR 423 at 426 per Murphy J as authority for the proposition that the onus is on the Crown to establish that a new trial is appropriate. Although it is true, as McCallum J points out, that his Honour dissented, this was as to the outcome. In R v RWB [2002] NSWCCA 504 at [10] R S Hulme J said (Hodgson JA and Hidden J agreeing) that the Crown bore the onus of showing that a new trial is the most appropriate remedy, also citing King (and see R v Taufahema [2007] 228 CLR 232 per Kirby J at [155]). So far as I am aware, this has been the approach consistently adopted by this Court.
	
	
	It cannot be doubted that, if the appellant had established that the verdict was unsafe or unreasonable having regard to the evidence, the appropriate order would be an acquittal and no order would be made for a new trial (though there might be exceptional cases in which this would not be the outcome). This approach is entirely consistent with that taken by this Court in conventional appeals under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. From the outset the appellant submitted (amongst other things) that the evidence remaining in the case (absent the impugned admissions) would render any guilty verdict unreasonable. The Crown accepted that, if in that situation it would have been unreasonable for the jury to convict, no order for a new trial should be made. It sought, by reference to the evidence helpfully and comprehensively analysed by the Chief Judge, to demonstrate that a verdict of guilty on that remaining evidence would not be unreasonable.
	
	
	McCallum J has referred to the “fresh and new evidence” relied on by the appellant to support his grounds of appeal. This evidence was mostly directed to establishing that there was such prosecutorial misconduct as to make it inappropriate to order a new trial even if the strength of the Crown case justified such a course. The Crown also tendered material dealing with this issue and aimed at deflecting, qualifying or refuting the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Since the evidence left in the case is insufficient to warrant a new trial, this issue is moot and it is unnecessary to consider the evidence on the point one way or the other. Some of the new material relied on by the appellant in respect of Madut was directed to undermining the cogency of his evidence. Whatever the possible significance of this evidence (which might be the subject of qualifying or contradicting evidence by the Crown as mentioned by Hoeben CJ at CL), it is clear that it does and could not strengthen Madut’s credibility, whilst the involvement of Mr Kaufman – as to which the evidence is not in dispute – adds a troubling feature. The Crown submitted that Madut’s evidence could be accepted by the jury. For the reasons given by Hoeben CJ at CL, I would also conclude that this is unlikely.
	
	
	Having regard to the determinative significance of the weakness of the Crown case, I am unable to agree that declining to consider the new evidence – whose import was made clear enough from the submissions of the parties – either denied the parties procedural fairness or inappropriately curtailed the Court’s duty to consider “the whole case” within the meaning of s 79(1)(b) of the Act. Nor, in my respectful view, does anything said in Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 suggest otherwise: the passage to which McCallum J refers concerns the approach (adopted by the court below) of treating any fresh or new evidence as if the appeal had been a conventional one and makes the point that the appellate court in cases such as the present is not inhibited by the considerations which apply when an appeal is brought on this ground. Declining to deal with issues which, in the particular circumstances, do not need to be dealt with because the ultimate question can be disposed of by resolving other issues is not disallowed. Thus, to take the appellant’s submission quoted by McCallum J, its purport was not to argue the general relevance of the additional evidence as to disclosure, the prosecutor’s duty, solicitor’s obligations and the like but only to the degree they are or might be relevant to the orders that ought to be ultimately made, having regard to the due administration of justice. Indeed, this was the only basis upon which the Court could consider them and, if the appeal can be resolved by taking another route, the Court is entitled to take it. For its part, the Crown made it abundantly clear that it wished to rely on evidence that would answer the indicated attack on police and prosecutorial conduct. If the considerable task of resolving the issues raised by this conflict can be avoided, because the question whether a new trial should be ordered is determinable by other considerations (here, principally the insufficient strength of the Crown case), then it does not inappropriately limit the issues raised by s 79(2) to take this course. The reference by Mr Game SC for the appellant to the “discretionary matters” to which McCallum J adverts, was, plainly enough, against the risk that the Court might not ultimately accept the argument that the Crown case was so weak that a new trial should not be ordered and the other matters militating against such an order needed to be placed in the scales. Counsel for the Crown, though continuing to press the admission of its additional material, did not argue that it could strengthen the Crown case but, as I have mentioned, was concerned to defend the foreshadowed attack.
	
	
	The alleged admissions made by A107 were, because of the evidence adduced in the Inquiry, inadmissible and their admission in the trial unarguably amounted to a miscarriage, necessarily entailing the quashing of the verdict.
	
	
	The question then became (the proviso not applying) whether, under s 8(1), an order for a new trial should be made. I agree that the terminology of this provision is somewhat odd in that it provides for the Court to make the order of its own notion or on the application of the appellant and gives the Crown no standing to make it. My limited researches have not explained why this should be so but I should think that the explanation is buried somewhere deep in the entrails of the complicated history of the jurisdiction to order new trials. A helpful or, at least, interesting discussion of the history is contained in the judgment of the plurality in Conway v R [2002] HCA 2; 209 CLR 203; 186 ALR 328; 76 ALJR 358. This is not the case in which to attempt resolution of the question. The issue was not raised and the parties made no submissions about it. So far as I am aware, as a matter of course the Court has consistently permitted the Crown to seek an order for a new trial where the conviction has been quashed. So far as the passage in Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA; (2001) 201 CLR 603 at [104] is concerned, certainly a new trial would not be ordered if the evidence did not demonstrate a prima facie case, but it is difficult to see how the interests of justice could justify a new trial (certainly, in the absence of cogent new evidence or in exceptional circumstances such as that which occurred in Taufahema) where the evidence proposed to be led by the prosecution is not capable of establishing the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. It is essentially for this reason that, where a verdict quashed because it is unsafe or unreasonable having regard to the evidence (under s 6(1) of the Act), an order for a new trial will not be made and acquittal will be entered. I do not read Spies as suggesting a different rule. Put otherwise, where a verdict of guilt is unsafe or unreasonable having regard to the evidence, it follows that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt, hence that the verdict ought to have been not guilty. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the prosecution will not be given a second bite at the cherry. As Hoeben CJ at CL points out (at [73]) the Court’s task is to some extent a predictive one, akin to considering whether a verdict would be (as distinct from was) unsafe or unreasonable. But the requirement of prediction is no bar to concluding that it would not be open to the jury to convict if a new trial were permitted. One of the matters that may be confidently predicted here is, as his Honour points out, the fact that memories (at the time of trial far from perfect) will not have been improved by the passage of eight years.
	
	
	Finally, I wish to take up the point made by McCallum J as to the significance of the decision of this Court which determined the appellant’s first appeal. The essential ground for holding that the alleged admissions to A107 were inadmissible depends on matters of fact unknown both at the trial and on the appeal. I am, with respect, unable to see how giving effect to the new evidence to quash the conviction undermines the reasoning of the previous Court in any relevant sense. Indeed, this very possibility is envisaged by the inquiry process. Furthermore, the consideration mentioned by McCallum J must apply as much to the quashing of the conviction, perhaps more so, as to the order for a new trial. Since quashing the conviction is, on all accounts, inevitable, I do not see how the question raised by her Honour militates against making that order.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in draft. I would respectfully take a different approach to the determination of this case. In particular, I am not persuaded that the Court can enter a verdict of acquittal by the process proposed.
	
	
	As the Chief Judge has explained, the case falls to be determined in the context of two important and proper concessions made by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the Crown. First, it was conceded that, in the circumstances described in the judgment given by R A Hulme J when his Honour referred the whole case to this Court, there had been a miscarriage of justice and the conviction accordingly had to be quashed. That order was made on the first day of hearing of the appeal, without opposition from the Crown and unanimously. In that circumstance, the Crown characterised the contest presented for this Court’s determination as being “whether there should be an order for a retrial, as the Crown will certainly submit, or whether there should be a verdict of acquittal, as the applicant may submit”.
	
	
	Secondly, for the purpose of that determination, the Crown conceded that the so-called support person, who was in fact a registered police informer (referred to in this appeal as A107) would not be called at any retrial.
	
	
	Notwithstanding those concessions, neither party invited the Court to take the present course of moving directly to consider the cogency of what remained of the evidence adduced at trial without proceeding to consider the fresh and new evidence relied upon by the applicant to support his grounds of appeal. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that each party resisted that course. The appellant had in his written submissions contended that the concession as to the conviction did not relieve this Court of its statutory duty to deal with the whole case, citing the decision of the High Court in Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at [10] per Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ.
	
	
	Specifically, the appellant submitted:
	


“It is particularly important in this case that the Court look earnestly to the whole case, including the fresh and new evidence, in order to discharge its obligation in this respect. The appellant’s submissions address matters that go beyond the concessions of the Attorney General. The application raises important matters of principle regarding disclosure, the prosecutorial duty of fairness, support persons for young people, informers, obligations of solicitors to their clients, conflict of interest and the duty of legal practitioners to the Court. These principles and the proper administration of justice are in turn relevant to the orders this Court may see fit to enter following review of the whole case.”


	
	For his part, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, who appeared in person for the Crown, also submitted that the fresh and new evidence should be considered before the Court could determine what further order should be made following upon the inevitable quashing of the conviction.
	
	
	The Court nonetheless proceeded to list the appeal for a further day of hearing for the limited purpose of pursuing the course it had directed. The fresh and new evidence relied upon to support the grounds of appeal has not been read and those grounds have not been considered. Instead, the Court determined to confine its consideration in the first instance to the record of the trial (as qualified by the concession that A107 would not be called at any new trial) and the “Crown Case Statement for the Future Trial” prepared at the Court’s direction.
	
	
	At the further hearing Mr Game SC, who appears with Ms Bashir SC for the applicant, presented a careful analysis of the issue raised by the Court and submitted that the Court could conclude at this point, before launching into an examination of the fresh and new evidence, that the case has “such transparent fragility that you would say this is far too weak a vessel to allow the Crown to put [the applicant] back on trial”. In so submitting, however, Mr Game also invoked “all the discretionary factors about the circumstances and the delay which this has incurred”. Those matters necessarily stray beyond a bare analysis of the cogency of the remaining evidence from the first trial.
	
	
	As the Chief Judge has noted, the Director of Public Prosecutions remained concerned, at the further hearing, as to the difficulties with the approach directed by the Court. Specifically, he noted that the Crown would have liked to lead additional evidence to dispute the applicant’s claims and to establish that those matters did not undermine the cogency of the evidence that would be available at any future trial.
	
	
	In those circumstances, with great respect to the Chief Judge, the course his Honour has proposed, while expedient, is not one I am persuaded I can adopt. Mr Game’s submissions as to the cogency of the remaining evidence from the first trial and the different analysis that can be put on that evidence when A107 is taken out of the picture were compelling, for the reasons carefully stated by the Chief Judge. Indeed, it may well be that the order his Honour has proposed (to enter a verdict of acquittal) reflects the just outcome in this case. My determination not to join in that order at this stage should not be taken as any endorsement of the cogency of the Crown case but rather as a reflection of doubt as to the authority of this Court to determine the case on the limited basis proposed, or at least the appropriateness of doing so in the face of the matters put by the parties in resisting that course.
	
	
	There may be a real question (which has not been explored) as to whether s 6(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) confers authority on this Court, without determining the whole of the case referred, to direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered (other than with the Crown’s consent) so as to constrain the Director of Public Prosecutions from presenting a further indictment.
	
	
	Ordinarily, the occasion for the entry of a verdict of acquittal or the exercise of the discretion to order a new trial arises after the determination of an appeal. The occurrence of such patent miscarriage of justice as to prompt the quashing of a conviction without opposition from the Crown is (fortunately) rare; no authority was drawn to our attention in which the question as to what should follow from that event has arisen in quite the way in which it arises in this case.
	
	
	The principles to be applied in determining whether to order a new trial were considered by this Court in Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [648]-[649] per McClellan CJ at CL; Fullerton and Garling JJ agreeing with the principles stated at [662] and [679] respectively. McClellan CJ at CL said (at [649]):
	


The overriding consideration is whether the interests of justice require a new trial: Fowler at 630. Unless the interests of justice require the entry of a verdict of acquittal, an appellate court should ordinarily order a new trial of a charge where a conviction in respect of that charge has been set aside but there is evidence to support the charge: Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; (2001) 201 CLR 603 at [104].


	
	There may be a degree of tension between the passage in Spies there cited by McClellan CJ at CL and the principles stated in King cited by the Chief Judge in the present case at [69] above. McClellan CJ at CL suggests that a new trial should ordinarily be ordered unless the interests of justice require otherwise; the principles cited by the Chief Judge suggest rather that a verdict of acquittal should be entered unless the Crown establishes otherwise. It should be acknowledged that the statement in King at 426 that the Crown has the onus of showing the Court that a new trial is the most appropriate remedy was made by Murphy J, who was in the minority in that case. The proposition stated by Murphy J may, however, be more consonant with the terms of the Act than the proposition stated in Spies. Section 6(2) appears to assume that a verdict of acquittal will ordinarily follow from the quashing of a conviction unless one of the “special provisions” of the Act is invoked.
	
	
	McClellan CJ at CL went on in Gilham to state a non-exhaustive list of the factors that may be considered in determining whether the interests of justice require a new trial, as follows:
	


the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of offenders (R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; (2007) 228 CLR 232 at [49]; Anderson at 453; Reid at 349);

the seriousness of the alleged crimes (Anderson at 453; Reid at 350; Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209; (2008) 188 A Crim R 331 at [164] (Johnson J));

the strength of the Crown case (Anderson at 453);

the desirability, if possible, of having the guilt or innocence of the accused finally determined by a jury, which, according to the constitutional arrangements applicable in New South Wales, is the appropriate body to make such a decision (Taufahema at [51]; Anderson at 453; Reid at 350);

the length of time between the alleged offence and the new trial, and in particular whether the delay will occasion prejudice to the accused (Taufahema at [55]; Parker v The Queen [1997] HCA 15; (1997) 186 CLR 494 at 520 (Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ); Anderson at 453);

whether the grant of a new trial would impermissibly give the prosecution an opportunity to supplement or ""patch up"" a defective case or to present a case significantly different to that presented to the jury in the previous trial (R v Wilkes [1948] HCA 22; (1948) 77 CLR 511 at 518; King v The Queen [1986] HCA 59; (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 433 (Dawson J); Parker at 520 (Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ); Reid at 350; Fowler at 630; Anderson at 453; Taufahema at [59]);

the interests of the individual accused, and in particular whether it would be unduly oppressive to put the accused to the expense and worry of a further trial (Spies at [103]; Reid at 350);

whether a significant part of the sentence imposed upon conviction has already been served (Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; (1992) 173 CLR 572 at 590 (McHugh J));

the expense and length of a further trial (Reid at 350);

whether a successful appellant to the Court of Criminal Appeal has been released from custody (Taufahema at [55]; Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 302 (Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ); R v Wilton (1981) 28 SASR 362; (1981) A Crim R 5 at 367-68 (King CJ)); and

whether an acquittal would usurp the functions of the properly constituted prosecutorial authorities, which are entrusted with responsibilities and discretions to act in the public interest in the initiation and conduct of criminal prosecutions (R v Thomas (No 3) [2006] VSCA 300; (2006) 14 VR 512 at [27]).


	
	However, Gilham was a case in which the Court had considered (and rejected) a ground of appeal that the verdict could not be supported by the evidence. Had the Court upheld that ground, an acquittal would have followed as a matter of course. Having unanimously rejected that ground (determining that the evidence presented at trial was sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction), the Court was divided as to whether to order a new trial. That was a determination which turned primarily on the consideration of new and fresh evidence relied upon in respect of the other grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The process adopted in the present case poses difficulties that did not exist in Gilham. Here, the task of assessing the cogency of the evidence is being undertaken not by reference to the record of a trial that has occurred but by reference to a prospective analysis of what a new trial would look like carving out part of that evidence. That is a difficult task for a court; it resembles (but cannot replicate) the Director’s function of determining whether to find a bill. The task is complicated by the fact that the “Crown Case Statement for the Future Trial” identifies issues not addressed at the first trial that would be additional evidence at any new trial. Of principal importance in that context is the question of Madut’s knowledge that there was an allegation against him that he had disposed of a knife. The assessment of that issue is inextricably linked with the issues sought to be raised by the appellant in the fresh and new evidence, which this Court has not considered. Accordingly, while there are obvious weaknesses in the evidence, I am not comfortable with a process that confines the Court’s attention primarily to an assessment of the strength of the Crown case in circumstances where other factors relevant to the determination whether to order a new trial have not been considered.
	
	
	The difficulty of the process this Court has adopted is further enhanced by the limited consideration that can be given to other discretionary factors relevant to the determination whether to order a new trial in circumstances where the Court has not embarked upon a hearing of the appeal proper. Section 8(1) requires the Court to consider whether, having regard to “all the circumstances”, the miscarriage of justice established “can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make”.
	
	
	There are interesting features of the power under s 8(1) the occasion for the consideration of which has not arisen in the way in which the hearing of this appeal has proceeded. Two aspects of the section in particular are intriguing. One is that the Court’s authority under the section is invoked “either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant”. The section does not expressly contemplate a contest on that issue on the application of the prosecutor. Secondly, the section is not, in terms, concerned with the dichotomy posed by the Crown in this appeal (new trial or acquittal). The authority conferred by the section is to “order a new trial in such manner as [the Court] thinks fit”. One possible analysis of the section is that it is directed not to the question of the adequacy or cogency of the evidence relied upon to sustain a further conviction but to the manner of any future trial (such as the persons or counts that can be included on any future indictment). Parliament may have contemplated that, such issues aside (and assuming the existence of evidence capable of supporting a verdict), the determination whether to call a successful appellant for trial again should rather be one for the Director of Public Prosecutions.
	
	
	None of those issues has been explored in the present appeal. It is accordingly not appropriate to expand upon them or to consider the authorities cited in Mr Game’s original submissions any further.
	
	
	A further concern I have about the course this appeal has taken is that, as noted on behalf of the applicant, the new and fresh evidence undermines the factual premise of this Court’s judgment in JB v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 12; 83 NSWLR 153. That decision presently stands as authority on the strength of which it would be sound advice to a young person in custody not to accept the assistance of an adult “support person” to assist the young person in his or her dealings with police. I do not think justice is served by having such an important issue governed by a decision the reasoning in support of which has transpired to be purely hypothetical.
	
	
	For those reasons, while I would respectfully accept that there is much force in the careful analysis set out in the judgment of the Chief Judge, I am not persuaded that the question whether this Court should make an order for a new trial can properly be determined against the Crown at this stage. I wish to record that I have reached this conclusion with a measure of reluctance because, as already indicated, I apprehend the orders proposed by the Chief Judge may well reflect the outcome that is ultimately just in this case.
	
	
	Since preparing these reasons I have had the opportunity to read the judgment of Adams J and the additional remarks of the Chief Judge. I remain unpersuaded that a conclusion can be reached as to whether the interests of justice require the entry of a verdict of acquittal by reference only to a prospective analysis of the proposed future Crown case and without regard to the evidence directed to other discretionary factors relevant to that determination.

2769323,Hart v Attorney-General for New South Wales [2016] NSWCCA 71,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	HARRISON J:      I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 22 August 2014 the Applicant was sentenced in respect of five counts of perverting the course of justice. A further five counts were taken into account on a Form 1 attached to count 5.
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of a non-parole period of one year ten months commencing 22 August 2014 and expiring 21 June 2016 with an additional term of 11 months expiring 21 May 2017. The indicative sentences were as follows:
	


Count 1:   One year three months

Count 2:   One year ten months

Count 3:   One year ten months

Count 4:   One year ten months

Count 5 and taking into account the matters on the Form 1:   Two years three months


	
	The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the following grounds:
	


1.   His Honour made a finding of fact that the appellant would have    benefited financially by committing the crimes. This was never relied    upon, raised by or asserted by the Crown and was not an available    inference to be drawn from the evidence.

2.   At the time of sentence the appellant and his legal representatives    were unaware that the ICAC had overstepped its defined boundaries    by investigating the appellant, a private citizen when no findings or    allegations of corruption had been made against a public official.    Therefore no 'Ellis' discount was applied by His Honour.

3.   His Honour failed to properly consider the health concerns of the    appellant.

4    No proper regard was had to principles of parity in sentencing to a like    matter of DPP v Paul.

5.   His Honour misapplied the principles in Pearce v The Queen in    reference to sentencing of multiple offences.

6.   His Honour erred in sentencing the appellant with a period on parole    and any term if applied should have been a fixed term only.


	
	At the hearing of the appeal the Applicant was given leave to add a further ground as follows:
	


7.   The discount of 10% for the guilty pleas was insufficient.

Facts of the offending


	
	The Sentencing Judge had before him a Statement of Agreed Facts. Although his Honour said that he would not set those facts out in full he did not describe the offences at all apart from saying:
	


They involve Mr Hart acting as a barrister on behalf of three separate clients. They involve him organising with his clients for false evidence to be presented

to a Local Court, and the presentation of material to the Court, knowing that material to be false.


	
	The following is a summary taken from the Statement of Agreed Facts.
	
	
	The Applicant was admitted to the bar on 19 December 1986. He held practising certificates for various periods but not continuously since 1 February 1989 both unconditionally and subject to restrictions. The Applicant cancelled his practising certificate on 1 October 2009.
	
	
	As noted, the offences related to acts taken on behalf of three of the Applicant’s clients.
	


Bradley Wheaton (Counts 1 and 2, Form 1(1))


	
	The Applicant was engaged in 2008 by Mr Wheaton to act for him in relation to an offence of driving with a prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood. The matter was to be heard at the Downing Centre Local Court. On 7 October 2008 the Applicant appeared for Mr Wheaton and entered a plea of guilty on behalf of his client. The matter was adjourned for sentence to 17 October 2008.
	
	
	Lawfully intercepted telephone calls recorded the Applicant telling Mr Wheaton that they had to get the matter away from the Downing Centre and transferred to Camden Local Court. In the course of those conversations the Applicant told Mr Wheaton he would get the matter transferred to Camden Court and said:
	


I've obviously got to check that the right bloke's at Camden. So leave that with me.


	
	On 17 October 2008 the Applicant appeared for Mr Wheaton at Downing Centre Local Court. He told the Magistrate that Mr Wheaton was working at Oakdale and he supplied to the Court an address at Stevens Street, Oakdale. On the basis of those statements he sought the transfer of the proceedings to Camden Local Court. The Magistrate at the Downing Centre transferred the proceedings for sentence to the Camden Local Court on 11 November 2008.
	
	
	At the time the Applicant made those representations to the Magistrate at the Downing Centre Local Court he knew them to be false. That constituted count (1) on the Form 1.
	
	
	On 20 October 2008, in a lawfully intercepted telephone conversation between the Applicant and Mr Wheaton, the Applicant told Mr Wheaton that he was living at an address in Oakdale and that is what he was to say if he was pulled over. That constituted count 1.
	
	
	On 25 November 2008 the Applicant appeared for Mr Wheaton at Camden Local Court at the sentencing hearing. The Applicant made submissions that Mr Wheaton resided at Stevens Street, Oakdale, that he had moved to the area due to work commitments and that he had a need for a licence because he lived at Oakdale. At the time he made those representations he knew them to be false and did so in order to ensure that Mr Wheaton would receive a more favourable result and/or a lesser penalty. That constituted Count 2.
	


Jessica Smith (Counts 4 and 5, Form 1 (3) to (5))


	
	In about March 2009 the Applicant was engaged by Ms Jessica Smith to act on her behalf in relation to driving with a prescribed concentration of alcohol in her blood.
	
	
	The matter was first listed at Sutherland Local Court on 19 March 2009. On that day the Applicant appeared and formally entered a plea of guilty on her behalf.
	
	
	He told the Court that Ms Smith was a special needs teacher who had been transferred to Wagga Wagga. He asked for the matter to be adjourned to the Local Court at Wagga Wagga for sentencing on 14 April 2009.
	
	
	At the time he made that representation to the Court he knew it to be false and he did so to have the matter transferred to a Court where he considered he could achieve a more favourable result for his client. That constituted count 4.
	
	
	In a lawfully intercepted telephone call between the Applicant and Ms Smith on 6 April 2009 the Applicant told Ms Smith that she should obtain references which indicated, contrary to the fact, that she had been transferred to Wagga Wagga. That constituted count (3) on the Form 1.
	
	
	On 14 April 2009 the Applicant telephoned a Police Prosecutor at Wagga Wagga Local Court, Sergeant Turner. He enquired of Sergeant Turner which Magistrate would hear the matter. He said that he, the Applicant, would not be in Wagga Wagga until after lunch that day, and he asked Sergeant Turner to mention the matter on his behalf before the Magistrate.
	
	
	About half an hour later on that morning he had a further conversation with Sergeant Turner where the Applicant was told that Magistrate Dare would be the only Magistrate sitting at the Local Court at Wagga Wagga in the week commencing 4 May 2009. The Applicant told Sergeant Turner that he wanted the matter adjourned because Ms Smith had a blood alcohol reading of .115 and the Applicant had some expectation that Magistrate Dare would give him an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The Applicant also told Sergeant Turner that Ms Smith had gone home to the Gold Coast on the weekend and could not get a flight which would enable her to get to Wagga Wagga for the hearing on 14 April 2009. Sergeant Turner agreed that he would mention the matter on behalf of the Applicant and seek to have the matter adjourned to 4 May 2009.
	
	
	The representation the Applicant made about Ms Smith was false to his knowledge. Between the two phone calls with Sergeant Turner that morning he had spoken to Ms Smith who told him that she was at the airport and her flight had been delayed until 9:30am. The Applicant told Ms Smith not to come to Wagga Wagga that day as his preferred Magistrate was off sick. That aspect of this matter constituted count (4) on the Form 1.
	
	
	Some six minutes after the second conversation with Sergeant Turner, the Applicant telephoned a secretary at a solicitors' firm in Wagga Wagga and dictated a letter addressed to the Presiding Magistrate at Wagga Wagga Local Court requesting that Ms Smith's matter to be adjourned until 4 May 2009. The letter contained the following statement:
	


Miss Smith contacted me yesterday to inform me that she was on the Sunshine Coast visiting her family for Easter and due to inclement weather is unable to be driven to Wagga Wagga today also.


	
	The statement was false to the knowledge of the Applicant. It was sent to the Local Court to ensure that Ms Smith would receive a more favourable result and/or a lesser penalty. That aspect of the matter constituted count (5) on Form 1.
	
	
	The matter came before the Wagga Wagga Local Court on 4 May 2009. The Applicant made the following statements to the Magistrate:
	


(a)   The matter had been transferred to the Wagga Wagga Local Court    because Ms Smith worked as a special education teacher in Wagga    Wagga from Tuesdays to Fridays;

(b)   Ms Smith travels from Sydney to Wagga Wagga on Tuesday mornings    and returns home on Friday night;

(c)   Ms Smith's job in Wagga Wagga was for three months;

(d)   The applicant had told Sutherland Local Court that his client could    appear at a sentence hearing that was listed on a Monday [4 May was    a Monday]:

(e)   The applicant had been informed by a member of staff at the    Sutherland Local Court that the Court did not list matters for sentence    on Mondays;

(f)   Ms Smith had been offered a full-time job in Wagga Wagga;

(g)   If Ms Smith regained her driver's licence she would be able to transfer    from Wollongong University to Charles Sturt University in Wagga    Wagga and do her honours starting in July 2009.


	
	Each of those statements was false to the Applicant’s knowledge. Subsequently the Applicant left a voicemail message for Ms Smith warning her that she should not speak about what had happened in Court that day. Those matters constituted count 5.
	


Todd Donohue (Count 3, Form 1 (2))


	
	On 14 June 2008 Todd Donohue was involved in a fight with a number of other men at Ulladulla. He was charged with affray and common assault.
	
	
	The Court Attendance Notice was returnable on 16 October 2008 at Milton Local Court. Todd Donohue’s address on the CAN was recorded as 163 Green Street, Ulladulla.
	
	
	The matter was adjourned on 10 October to 13 November 2008. Subsequently on that day the Applicant had a lawfully recorded telephone call with Mr Donohue’s father where the Applicant said he could fix things so that Todd Donohue would not get a conviction recorded against him.
	
	
	On 11 December 2008 the Applicant had a lawfully recorded telephone conversation with a Warren Peacock. The Applicant said he was transferring a matter for a plea down to Wagga Wagga and he needed an address. He asked Mr Peacock where he lived. Mr Peacock said it was Unit 5, 20 Travers Street, Wagga Wagga. The conversation concluded by the Applicant saying to Mr Peacock:
	


If you get letters you know they're from our, from my bloke.


	
	Thereafter on that day the Applicant appeared on behalf of Todd Donohue before the Magistrate in the Milton Local Court. The Applicant told the Court that the prosecutor had agreed to withdraw the assault charge, and on that basis he had instructions to enter a plea of guilty to the charge of affray.
	
	
	He made the further following submissions to the Court:
	


(a)   Todd Donohue worked for a company known as Fugen as a    bricklayer's labourer;

(b)   Todd Donohue had been transferred to Wagga Wagga in connection    with that employment due to a major work at Uranquinty for a duration    of three months;

(c)   Todd Donohue was residing at a flat at 6/20 Travers Street at Wagga    Wagga.


	
	Those statements were untrue to the Applicant’s knowledge. On the basis of those statements the matter was adjourned to Wagga Wagga Local Court for sentence on 12 January 2009. Those statements constituted count (2) on the Form 1.
	
	
	On 12 January 2009 the matter was mentioned before the Wagga Wagga Local Court. A solicitor, Anthony Paul, appeared on behalf of Todd Donohue and mentioned the matter on instructions from the Applicant. Mr Paul said on instructions from the Applicant that:
	


(a)   Todd Donohue had been working in Wagga Wagga for Fugen    holdings;

(b)   Todd Donohue had been residing at an address in Travers Street;

(c)   Todd Donohue had now moved back to Sydney;

(d)   The Applicant’s application was for the matter to be listed at    Sutherland Local Court for sentence.


	
	On the basis of those statements the matter was adjourned to Sutherland Local Court on 19 January 2009 for sentence. It was subsequently adjourned to 12 February 2009.
	
	
	On 12 February 2009 the Applicant appeared in Sutherland Local Court for Mr Donohue. During sentencing submissions he made the following statements:
	


(a)   Todd Donohue was employed as a bricklayer's labourer by Fugen    Industries;

(b)   Todd Donohue earned $1,000 net from his employment with Fugen    Industries;

(c)   Todd Donohue had been transferred to Wagga Wagga in the course    of his employment with Fugen Industries;

(d)   Todd Donohue was employed by Fugen Industries in a large project at    Caringbah;

(e)   Todd Donohue was enrolled at Gymea TAFE in a bricklaying course.


	
	All of those statements were made by the Applicant and were untrue to his knowledge. Those statements constituted Count 3.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Sentencing Judge had before him a report of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 1 March 2014. Dr Nielssen reported that the Applicant said he commenced drinking heavily when he joined the police force. He developed a high tolerance for alcohol and he could drink as much as a case of beer in a day and feel relatively unaffected. He told Dr Nielssen that he had numerous complications from alcohol use including uncontrolled gambling while affected by alcohol, the effect of alcohol on his professional judgment, being overweight, and three convictions for drink driving. He had stopped drinking altogether since starting AA meetings in 2009.
	
	
	In relation to the Applicant’s alcoholism the Sentencing Judge said that the Applicant:
	


… fell into the heavy drinking culture prevalent in parts of both the Police Force and the legal profession. This had a negative impact upon him. It is clear that by the turn of this century he was effectively an alcoholic. He was however still able to function and practice [sic] as a barrister. That said, the material before me indicates that prior to the commission of these offences his moral compass and his capacity to practice [sic] fully as a professional were being impacted on by his alcoholism and other related stressors.


	
	The Sentencing Judge also said:
	


I am prepared to accept that his alcoholism was a contributing factor in the commission of these offences. While recognising that may provide one reason for the commission of this offence [sic], I cannot, and do not, take it into account in significant mitigation of penalty. That crimes are committed by people addicted to any drug including alcohol, is not generally regarded as a mitigating factor.


	
	The Sentencing Judge also had a report from a dermatologist, Dr Robert Rosen. Dr Rosen said that he had diagnosed a malignant tumour in the Applicant known as a Merkel Cell Carcinoma in 2009. This is a skin cancer arising from a nerve in the skin. It is highly malignant and can spread throughout the body resulting in death. The overall five year survival rate is about 60%. Although the Applicant had remained free of this cancer for four years it can recur without warning at any stage.
	
	
	On 21 March 2011 the Court of Appeal ordered that the name of the Applicant be removed from the Roll of Legal Practitioners, declaring at the same time that he was guilty of professional misconduct and was not a fit and proper person to remain on the Roll.
	
	
	There were two bases for the application by the Bar Association. The first was the false statements made by the Applicant in the Wheaton and Smith matters (the subject of the present proceedings) and another matter where the Applicant made false statements to a local court (not the Todd Donohue matter). The second basis was because the Applicant engaged in legal practice and held himself out as a barrister although he did not have a current practising certificate on 21 October 2009.
	
	
	This was not the first time the Applicant had come to the attention of the NSW Bar Association. In 2006 he was found guilty of professional misconduct and unsatisfactory professional conduct arising out of tax offences in respect of which he had been convicted: New South Wales Bar Association v Hart [2006] NSWADT 97.
	
	
	On 30 September 2009 the Applicant was found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct in relation to a failure to provide a costs disclosure, a failure to make a disclosure in accordance with r 80 of the NSW Barristers’ Rules and a failure to return money to a client paid in advance when he had no claim on the funds concerned: The Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Hart [2009] NSWADT 252. He was ordered to pay a fine of $5,000 within three months, failing which his practising certificate would be cancelled.
	
	
	An order was also made in these terms:
	


4.   An order pursuant to section 562 (5) of the Legal Profession Act 2004    that for a period of 3 years from the date of these orders, any    practising certificate issued to John Peter Hart shall be endorsed with    the following conditions:

i)   to attend for treatment and counselling for alcohol dependency    on Dr John Roberts at the rate of not less than one    consultation every three months from the date of these orders,    provided that in the event that Dr Roberts is unable or unwilling    to continue consultations with him, then he is to consult with    another specialist practitioner approved by the Bar Council (in    either case the ""treating specialist"");

(ii)   John Peter Hart shall comply with any treatment (including    medication, any further attendances for treatment (including    but not limited to attendances at meeting of Alcoholics    Anonymous) and urine, blood and other testing) recommended    by the treating specialist;

(iii)   John Peter Hart shall arrange for the treating specialist to    provide a written report to the Bar Council every three months    reporting on:

   his attendance on the treating specialist;

   his compliance with any treatment recommended by    the treating specialist;

   his progress under treatment;

   any continuing treatment recommended.

(iv)   The first report of the treating specialist is due three months    after the date of these orders;

(v)   John Peter Hart shall meet the costs of the treating    specialist and any other required treatment or testing.


	
	The Applicant’s alcohol intake had brought him into contact with the criminal law prior to these events. On 26 October 1999 he was convicted of driving with a high range of alcohol in his blood. He was fined $750 and disqualified from driving for 12 months. An appeal to the District Court was dismissed. On 17 February 2000 he was convicted of driving with a high range of alcohol in his blood. He was fined $1,300 and was disqualified from driving for two years. An appeal to the District Court was dismissed.
	
	
	On 1 December 2000 he was convicted of driving while disqualified from holding a license. He was fined $1,000 and disqualified from driving for two years commencing at the conclusion of the prior disqualification period. It should be observed that driving while disqualified is an offence which involves a conscious and deliberate decision to flout the law: Tsakonas v R [2009] NSWCCA 258 at [39]. It is more serious where the offender is a legal practitioner.
	
	
	On 10 June 2008 the Applicant was convicted of driving with a low range of alcohol in his blood. In the light of his driving history he was dealt with mercifully with a s 10 bond for 12 months.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge had a number of references and testimonials for the Applicant including a very moving one from his wife who detailed a number of tragedies within the family that she believed may have contributed to his drinking problem.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge noted these references saying that it was relevant that the Applicant had the support of his family and professional friends. The Sentencing Judge said that some of the solicitors who had provided references were known to him professionally and they were people he respected. He said that they were able to see the good side of the Applicant but that they uniformly expressed their significant shock and disappointment at his slide into criminality. They recognised too late the significant alcohol problem he had.
	


Grounds of appeal

Ground 1:   Finding that the Applicant would have benefitted financially


	
	The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge drew a conclusion from the evidence that he would have benefitted financially from the crimes. The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge was not entitled to make that observation or comment nor rely on it for sentencing purposes when it was never relied on by the Crown and when there was no evidence about it.
	
	
	In fact, the Remarks on Sentence make no reference at all to any financial or other benefit received by the Applicant as a result of the statements made to the various courts.
	
	
	During the Sentencing hearing the following exchange occurred (T8-9):
	


MARR:      They're Local Court matters. In three Local Court matters and it appears that there was little or no real benefit except perhaps in the case of Ms Smith where she received a section 10 for a high range PCA.

HIS HONOUR:   I'm going to pull you up there Mr Marr. Mr Hart was a professional and your reputation for success is one of the things that attracts work and if you get good results you get work coming in. So it's not necessarily the benefit for his clients, some of the facts don't actually tell me what the actual results were and that's not really important to me how Mr Wheaton, Smith or Mr Donohue what they achieved but Mr Hart was paid for his services I presume but he was getting results for his client and he was doing so my misleading deliberately the Local Court of New South Wales. So there was a benefit and it was more than an intangible benefit. The case of Paul Judge Garling was utterly perplexed because there was no benefit to Mr Paul, he put his entire reputation on the line for simply achieving an adjournment which had no real effect or benefit to anyone but this is far more

than Mr Paul.


	
	His Honour makes no mention of that in his Remarks on Sentence. Statements by a sentencing judge during the course of argument are not ordinarily to be taken to represent a final and considered view: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [11]; R v Thompson [2005] NSWCCA 340; 156 A Crim R 467 at [32]; Hampton v R [2014] NSWCCA 131; 243 A Crim R 193 at [23].
	
	
	However, what his Honour said during argument is self-evidently true. The Applicant is likely to have been paid for appearing for each of the clients. But even if he was not, achieving good results for clients is likely to bring intangible benefits in terms of reputation which may be followed by new clients seeking the Applicant out. His Honour did not, in the exchange set out nor in his Remarks on Sentence, find that the offences were aggravated by that matter. No error is demonstrated.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2:   The Sentencing Judge did not give an Ellis discount


	
	The Applicant drew attention to the High Court’s decision in Independent Commission Against Corruption v Cunneen [2015] HCA 14; (2015) 89 ALJR 475 to submit that ICAC was not permitted to investigate private persons when no finding of corruption had been made against a public official. Accordingly, the investigation which led to the charging of the Applicant by the Director of Public Prosecutions was illegal. The Applicant pleaded guilty when, at the time, the Crown had no lawfully obtained evidence to rely on to charge him. The Applicant submitted that this was not known at the time of the sentence proceedings. The Applicant made reference to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	This submission contains a number of difficulties. First, the judgment in Cunneen was 15 April 2015, some 8 months after sentence was passed on the Applicant. At the time of the sentence no error was made because no basis was shown or could have been shown for an Ellis discount. This Court is a court of error.
	
	
	Secondly, it was only when the High Court decided Cunneen that the limitation on the powers of ICAC were identified. There was no impropriety in what led to the Applicant’s admissions and pleas.
	
	
	Thirdly, following from the High Court’s decision in Cunneen, the Independent Commission Against Corruption Amendment (Validation) Act 2015 (NSW) was enacted by the Parliament of NSW. The Act inserted Part 13 into Schedule 4 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW). Clauses 34 and 35 of that Schedule provide:
	


34 Interpretation

(1)   In this Part:

relevant conduct means conduct that would be corrupt conduct for the purposes of this Act if the reference in section 8 (2) to conduct that adversely affects, or could adversely affect, the exercise of official functions included conduct that adversely affects, or could adversely affect, the efficacy (but not the probity) of the exercise of official functions.

(2)   A reference in this Part to anything done or purporting to have been    done by the Commission includes a reference to:

(a)   anything done or purporting to have been done by an officer of    the Commission, and

(b)   any investigation, examination, inquiry, hearing, finding,    referral, recommendation or report conducted or made by the    Commission or an officer of the Commission, and

(c)   any order, direction, summons, notice or other requirement    made or issued by the Commission or an officer of the    Commission, and

(d)   the obtaining or receipt of anything by the Commission or an    officer of the Commission.

(3)   A reference in this Part to evidence given to the Commission includes    a reference to:

(a)   a statement of information, or a document or other thing,    produced in response to a notice by the Commission or an    officer of the Commission, and

(b)   an answer made, or a document or other thing produced, by a    person summoned to attend or appearing before the    Commission or an officer of the Commission at a compulsory    examination or public inquiry, and

(c)   any information, document or other thing otherwise obtained or    received by the Commission or an officer of the Commission.

35 Validation

(1)   Anything done or purporting to have been done by the Commission    before 15 April 2015 that would have been validly done if corrupt    conduct for the purposes of this Act included relevant conduct is taken    to have been, and always to have been, validly done.

(2)   The validation under subclause (1) extends to the validation of:

(a)   things done or purporting to have been done by any person or    body, and

(b)   legal proceedings and matters arising in or as a result of those    proceedings,

if their validity relies on the validity of a thing done or purporting to have been done by the Commission.

(3)   The validation under subclause (1) extends to the validation of things    on and from the date they were done or purported to have been done.

(4)   The Commission is authorised (and is taken always to have been    authorised) to exercise functions under this Act on or after 15 April    2015 to refer matters for investigation or other action to other persons    or bodies, or to communicate or provide evidence given to the    Commission to other persons or bodies, even if the matter arose or    the evidence was given to the Commission before 15 April 2015 and    its validity relies on the validation under subclause (1).

(5)   Subclause (4) applies even if any finding of corrupt conduct that    relates to the matter or evidence is declared a nullity or otherwise set    aside by a court.

(6)   However, a person is not (and was not) required to comply, on and    after 15 April 2015, with any order, direction, summons, notice or other    requirement made or issued by the Commission or an officer of the    Commission before 15 April 2015 if the validity of the order, direction,    summons, notice or other requirement relies on the validation under    subclause (1).


	
	In Duncan v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2015] HCA 32; (2015) 89 ALJR 835 the High Court held that clauses 34 and 35 were validly enacted. The result is that anything done by the Commission that led to the investigation and the subsequent admissions and plea of guilty by the Applicant is taken to be validly done.
	
	
	No error is shown on the part of the Sentencing Judge. I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 3:   Applicant’s health concerns


	
	The Applicant submitted that he has a grim diagnosis of malignant skin cancer. He submitted that the Sentencing Judge disregarded the Applicant's health concerns and did not factor them into the sentencing outcome.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge said this about the Applicant’s health and associated conditions:
	


The family history is set out in the reports and references, particularly those of his wife and Dr Nielssen. Dr Nielssen is of the view that he does have an alcohol abuse disorder, now in remission. He suggests that there may be some alcohol related brain injury. He also notes at present he has a depressive illness. This is, with great respect, entirely understandable given Mr Hart's predicament and his knowledge of what the likely outcome was going to be. Dr Nielssen says that alcohol was a contributing factor to the offending. There is also material before me that Mr Hart has been operated on and treated for a merkel cell carcinoma, a malignant skin/nerve tumour. The operation has been successful but he will require continuing and ongoing supervision because this life threatening condition could return at any moment.


	
	Elsewhere in his Remarks, the Sentencing Judge referred to the Applicant’s alcoholism. His Honour said:
	


I am prepared to accept that his alcoholism was a contributing factor in the commission of these offences.


	
	There is nothing to suggest that his Honour did not take those matters into account, having made specific reference to them.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 4:   Parity


	
	The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge did not properly consider for parity reasons the matter of Anthony Paul.
	
	
	Mr Paul was a solicitor in Wagga Wagga. He acted for a client who had been charged with driving with a mid-range concentration of alcohol in his blood. The client lived in Centennial Park in Sydney.
	
	
	The solicitor told his client that there were five different magistrates at the Downing Centre and it would not be known which magistrate the client would get to deal with his matter. He asked the client to send the paper work to him so that he could write to the Court to have the matter adjourned to Wagga Wagga where the matter would go before a good magistrate.
	
	
	Mr Paul wrote to the Downing Centre Local Court saying that his client was working on a contract in Wagga Wagga and asked for the matter to be adjourned to Wagga Wagga Local Court. That duly happened and Mr Paul’s client was given a s 10 bond without a conviction being recorded.
	
	
	Mr Paul was charged with perverting the course of justice. He was sentenced by Judge Garling on 2 August 2013. He was given a sentence of imprisonment of one year and four months but that sentence was suspended.
	
	
	In relation to that, the Applicant submitted that Mr Paul’s conduct was similar to the Applicant’s but concerned a single client rather than three. The Applicant submitted that the outcome of a suspended sentence was vastly different from the full time custodial sentence given to the Applicant.
	
	
	In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said this:
	


I have before me a decision of Judge Garling (exhibit 3) in an unrelated but similar matter which arose from the same police operation. I also have before me a wealth of authorities in relation to matters such as this. The sentencing practices of this Court, the Supreme Court, in particular the Court of Criminal Appeal, are useful guides to the exercise of my discretion in this matter. However, every case requires individual consideration as each offence has their own facts and circumstances, just as each offender presents differently (emphasis added)


	
	A ground of appeal that something is not properly regarded or considered is analogous to a ground of appeal that no sufficient weight was given to a particular matter. Consideration and weight are matters for the sentencing judge. In the light of the Sentencing Judge’s express reference to the matter of Paul, it cannot be said that he ignored the matter. However, it was just another case where the offender was charged with perverting the course of justice, albeit in a similar circumstance to the present.
	
	
	There were a number of differences between the Paul matter and the Applicant’s matter both objectively and subjectively. The Applicant was charged with five offences and five more on a Form 1. Mr Paul was charged with one offence. He had no criminal antecedents. He entered a plea at the first available opportunity and received a 25% discount. A large number of character references were tendered and taken into account. Judge Garling noted Mr Paul’s strong subjective case.
	
	
	The Applicant and Mr Paul were not co-offenders. Strictly speaking there is no issue of parity to be considered. Even if there were, it cannot be said that the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance over the difference in the sentences by reason of the differences in the offending and the subjective matters.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 5:   Misapplying Pearce v The Queen


	
	The Applicant submitted that the considerations of Pearce v The Queen were misapplied in the sense that his Honour “placed too much emphasis on the charges (sic) with the form one attached”. He submitted that the Crown case only ever relied upon three individuals, and what was alleged was a continuing course of action by the Applicant over a period of time.
	
	
	What was said by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 requires the Sentencing Judge first, to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and, subsequently, consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality.
	
	
	In the present case, the Sentencing Judge imposed an aggregate sentence under s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). This section was introduced to ameliorate the difficulties that had emerged with the obligations required of a sentencing judge by reason of the High Court’s decision in Pearce: R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [31].
	
	
	His Honour correctly provided the indicative sentences on each of the five counts and then imposed the aggregate sentence. In doing so, his Honour applied what was said in relation to Form 1 offences in A-G’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2001) 56 NSWLR 146. In relation to that his Honour said:
	


While I don't sentence for these Form 1 matters they do, so far as the sentence for Count 5 is concerned, mean that greater emphasis must be given to personal deterrence and retribution. They do mean that there is a need to increase, albeit modestly, the sentence imposed for that offence.


	
	What was contained on the Form 1 were five separate acts of criminality. Those acts have been identified when the facts were earlier summarised. When it is remembered that each of those five further offences carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, it cannot be said that there was too much emphasis placed on the Form 1 when the indicative sentence for count 5 was five months more than the indicative sentences for counts 2, 3 and 4. Further, in the light of the fact that the Sentencing Judge imposed an aggregate sentence, the complaint in relation to Pearce is misconceived.
	
	
	This ground should be rejected.
	


Ground 6:   Declining to set a fixed term


	
	The Applicant submitted that he was found by his Honour to be in no danger of re-offending. He submitted that he had no drug or continuing alcohol problems, nor did his offending involve violence. Despite those matters, the Applicant submitted that a lengthy parole period was imposed. That was said to be an error because his Honour should have imposed a fixed term if a full time custodial period was warranted.
	
	
	The Applicant’s written submissions did not make clear what the period of the fixed term should have been. This was clarified in his oral submissions so that what was put forward was a fixed term equal to the non-parole period.
	
	
	When it is remembered that the indicative sentence for count 5 was two years and three months, and the indicative sentences for counts 2, 3 and 4 (which indicative sentences may be taken as the total sentence for each count) was one year and ten months, it is difficult to see how his Honour could have imposed a fixed term sentence of one year and ten months only.
	
	
	Section 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) relevantly provides:
	


(1)   When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence or, in    the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, for offences    (other than an offence or offences set out in the Table to Division 1A    of this Part), a court may decline to set a non-parole period for the    offence or offences if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do    so:

(a)   because of the nature of the offence to which the sentence, or    of each of the offences to which an aggregate sentence    relates, or the antecedent character of the offender, or

(b)   because of any other penalty previously imposed on the    offender, or

(c)   for any other reason that the court considers sufficient.


	
	No submission was made at the sentence proceedings that a fixed term should be imposed although the Sentencing Judge made it clear that he would be imposing a full-time custodial sentence. The default position is that a non-parole period will be ordered. The court has a discretion not to set a non-parole period. In circumstances where the court was not asked to exercise that discretion a decision not to impose a fixed term cannot be seen as an error.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 7 – discount for pleas


	
	In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said this:
	


There was a plea of guilty in this matter. It came late. I am prepared to accept that it demonstrates some remorse and indicates positive prospects for the future. But so far as its utilitarian value is concerned, I could only reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence by 10 per cent.


	
	In his oral submissions, having raised for the first time a complaint about the extent of the discount given for the pleas, the Applicant said this:
	


Your Honour, you have to take into account the circumstances of the plea. I note that his Honour used the term on the first day of the trial. However, you will appreciate, in the week preceding, the trial ran, which the jury found me not guilty of.

…

On the Wednesday, prior to the trial commencing, the Crown, by way of email, indicated to us that, instead, all of the trials being jointly heard, they were going to separate the trial which ultimately ran and at the expiration of that these trials would be jointly heard. There was an agreement on the first, or certainly by Friday prior to the trial, awaiting Mr Sexton's approval in relation to what I ultimately put. On the Monday, effectively the trial that I had always indicated I was pleading not guilty to, commenced and, on that day, these matters, which I would suggest were technically for mention, I pleaded guilty to. On the first, the trial ran a week. So, these matters, even if they had run, would not have commenced on the following matter (scil Monday?).

In relation to the plea, I accept it's a late plea. However, it certainly wasn't as the jury were being handed their Bibles.


	
	In written submissions to the Sentencing Judge the Crown said this about the timing of the plea:
	


24.   The criminal proceedings were commenced on 12 September 2012    upon the filing of court attendance notices. The offender waived    committal. The offender was committed for trial to the District Court of    New South Wales on 4 April 2013.

25.   The proceedings were adjourned in the District Court on 26 April    2013, and 30 May 2013 on the application of the offender. On 30 May    2013, the offender informed Blanch CJ that he intended to plead not    guilty to all charges. The charges were listed for trial on 18 November    2013. On 1 November 2013, the proceedings were listed for mention    to confirm the trial date. On the first day of the trial (on 18 November    2013), the offender pleaded guilty to an amended indictment.

26.   The first indication to the court of the offender's intention to plead    guilty was on the first day of the trial. The first indication which the    offender gave to the prosecution of an intention to plead guilty was on    15 November 2013 (the Friday prior to the commencement of the    trial). By this stage, it had been necessary for the prosecution to    subpoena all witnesses, including making arrangements for witnesses    to travel to Sydney and for various witnesses to give evidence via    AVL. It is submitted that the Crown case against the offender was    overwhelming, consisting in large part of telephone intercepts and    court transcripts.


	
	At the sentence proceedings the Crown prosecutor said this:
	


There were Court Attendance Notices in the Local Court for these proceedings, ten matters, sorry 13 matters. Ten of them are before your Honour, five of them on indictment. There was a committal. Following the committal he was committed for trial and before the matter was listed for trial but after a number of adjournments he entered a plea. So there will be some debate about the extent of a utilitarian –

HIS HONOUR:   Right, so there has been some utilitarian value obviously, but it’s the extent of it.


	
	Shortly afterwards counsel for the Applicant said:
	


There was an offer to plead guilty on the Friday before the trial which was listed to commence on the Monday. The arraignment indictment contained 14 counts, three withdrawn, five placed on a Form 1 and he was found not guilty of one charge following the trial.


	
	It seems clear, therefore, that there was no offer to plead guilty until the Friday before the trial was due to start on the Monday. Further, as the facts make clear, the Crown had a very strong case against the Applicant.
	
	
	The amount of a discount for the utilitarian value of a plea is within the discretion of the Sentencing Judge. It cannot be properly contended that a discount of 10% in the circumstances was not an appropriate exercise of the Sentencing Judge’s discretion.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Extension of time


	
	The sentence was imposed on 22 August 2014. Apparently a Notice of Intention to Appeal had been filed on behalf of the Applicant within time. However, when no appeal was filed within the required time a Notice of Application for Extension of Time was not filed until 1 October 2015. The Notice of Appeal was filed on the same date. The Applicant’s explanation is that he missed the time for filing an application for extension because of being moved between prisons and the refusal of Legal Aid to act on any appeal. The Crown does not take issue with the appeal being out of time. Relevant to the determination of the interests of justice on an application to extend time is the prospect of success should the extension be granted: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [33].
	


Conclusion


	
	I would propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Extend time to the Applicant to file the Notice of Application for Leave    to Appeal to 1 October 2015.

(2)   Leave to appeal granted.

(3)   Appeal dismissed.

		02 May 2016",2016-05-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769326,Mallegowda v Sood (No. 4) [2016] NSWDC 88,"BACKGROUND


	
	These defamation proceedings are listed for a four-week trial to commence today, Monday 2 May 2016. The parties were represented until November 2015, but are now all self-represented litigants.
	
	
	The proceedings have an unfortunate procedural history of two vacated trial dates, removal to and from two Newcastle hearing lists and a series of combatively conducted applications, some of which is set out in my judgments in Mallegowda v Sood [2013] NSWDC 98, Mallegowda v Sood (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 216 and Mallegowda v Sood (No 3) [2015] NSWDC 14.
	
	
	In the week before this hearing, each of the defendants filed a Notice of Motion in the general list, returnable on 6 May 2016, seeking a series of orders which may be summarised in general terms as follows:
	



	
	Requests for documentary evidence (by way of subpoenae to third parties, subpoenae to give evidence to medical practitioners, an independent health assessment conducted by the court and notices to the plaintiff to produce) about the plaintiff’s health.
	
	
	Security for costs.
	
	
	Joinder of a third party, the Roads and Maritime Services.
	
	
	Referral of the plaintiff to the Supreme Court for contempt of court and restraining orders.
	
	
	Leave to tender the defendants’ witness statements without requiring the witnesses to be cross-examined or, if that order was refused, an adjournment.
	
	
	Requests for material produced in Supreme Court proceedings to be accepted into evidence in this court and to be probative of issues of truth, as well as orders for subpoenae to give evidence to be issued to the “Crown Solicitors” to give evidence of what occurred.
	


The nature of the applications


	
	I make the following preliminary observations. First, these proceedings were given this hearing date a year ago and no approach was made to the court to resolve any of these issues during that time, even though many of the orders sought are case management and pre-trial issues which should have been raised in the Defamation List in this court.
	
	
	The parties to these proceedings are aware of, both as self-represented litigants and when legally represented, case management procedures available in the Defamation List and the operation of District Court Civil Practice Note 6, which provides for applications to be brought in the Defamation List whether or not a trial date has been allocated. The failure to do so before the first day of the hearing is regrettable, as is the fact that they filed Notices of Motion in the general list which the court, having listed them for argument on 6 May 2016, had to bring forward and send to me. Court resources are an important component of proportionality issues under ss 56 – 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	Some of the applications made in these notices of motion (such as security for costs and material relating to the plaintiff’s health) have already been the subject of unsuccessful applications by the defendants: Mallegowda v Sood (No 2). In the course of that judgment, I explained the difference between the roles of a list judge making case management orders and the quite different role of the trial judge, citing Bidner v Queensland [2000] QCA 343. The defendants should not have brought these applications for a second time, let alone brought them before the trial judge.
	
	
	The applications for orders which relate to trial issues (principally concerning evidence of the plaintiff’s plea of guilty in the Supreme Court contempt of court proceedings) are misconceived and unnecessary. Much of this evidence is before the court, as set out in the affidavits filed in the application made in these proceedings which resulted in that plea of guilty. The fact that the plaintiff pleaded guilty is acknowledged by him openly. If there was a perceived problem in relation to the leading of any other evidence, the defendants should have contacted the Crown Solicitors to make a formal request for the documents (rather than asked the trial judge to do so) and/or to obtain the date allocated for the plaintiff’s sentencing the trial date. Any unresolved problems could have been dealt with by an application to vacate the hearing date being made last November (instead of on the first day of the trial). Alternatively, an application for any additional evidence to be led at a later date could be put forward at the end of the trial, if necessary.
	


The listing of these motions on the first day of the trial


	
	Having been notified by the registry of the Notices of Motion which were returnable on day 5 of the hearing in the General List, I arranged for these proceedings to be listed urgently in the Defamation List on Thursday 28 April 2016. I also learned of a third, unfiled, Notice of Motion which the defendants proposed to rely on.
	
	
	When the applications came before me in the Defamation List on 28 April 2016 for directions, the defendants informed me that they had filed the Notice of Motion in the General List because no trial judge had been allocated. I drew District Court Practice Note 6 to their attention, which provides that, in those circumstances, applications should be made to the Defamation List judge. I also told them that I had been appointed the trial judge.
	
	
	As it was not possible for me to deal with any of the applications in the 28 April 2016 Defamation List, I advised the parties that I would hear these motions on the first day of the hearing. Given the imminence of the trial date, I also drew their attention to Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v ANU [2009] HCA 27; 239 CLR 175 (”Aon”).
	


The orders sought in the notices of motion


	
	What both defendants seek is essentially the vacation of the hearing date. The applications they bring for the collection of evidence from third parties would take, they acknowledge, one to two weeks, although in practical terms they are seeking an adjournment until after the plaintiff’s sentencing for contempt of court.
	
	
	Although they are litigants in person, the parties must have a degree of familiarity with the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), if only because I set out the text of sections 56 and 58 in my judgment in Mallegowda v Sood at [45] – [46], in the course of a review of legislation and appellate authorities explaining the reluctance to vacate hearing dates in circumstances such as the present.
	
	
	The timing and content of the notices of motion filed by the defendants (and foreshadowed in the third, unfiled, notice of motion) demonstrate the difficulties courts and court resources face when litigants in person bring applications the effect of which would almost certainly be the vacating of the third hearing date for these proceedings. I consider that the fact that these parties are now unrepresented does not mean that they should be granted a greater level of indulgence than other litigants in relation to applications of this nature.
	
	
	The time constraints of a trial mean that the careful consideration and opportunities for reserving judgments which are possible in the Defamation List will not be available. This judgment is, correspondingly, a trial ruling judgment of a relatively brief nature.
	
	
	I shall next set out the text of the two motions which have been filed.
	


Notice of Motion – 2nd defendant


	
	This notice of motion seeks orders as follows:
	


1.That the Courts allow and accept issues which have already been determined in the matter with case number 14/288906 that is common in this matter.

2. That the Courts allow defendants to adduce evidence from materials produced in the matter between Prothonotary of Supreme Court NSW v Mr S H Mallegowda before in relation to case number 2014/168906 in this matter.

(a) That the leave of Court be provided for defendants to access all transcripts in relation to case number 2014/168906 either through Supreme Court Registry or via prothonotary of Supreme Court in this matter.

(b) That the Court provide orders for defendants to access material in the contempt matter against plaintiff in relation to case number 2014/168906 via Prothonotary of Supreme Court in that matter.

(c) That the leave of Court be granted to issue subpoena to Crown solicitors to give evidence and bring documents or things at this trial.

3. That court order an independent mental health assessment of Plaintiff to determine Plaintiff’s mental health to participate in this trial as a plaintiff and/or a self-represented litigant.

(a) That the mental health assessment order to include time period when the first and second attacking emails were sent against the first defendant and date ie. from January 2012 till date.

(b) That the Court Order for independent mental health expert/s to be provided access to complete mental health records of Plaintiff not excluding blood test reports of the Plaintiff and mood diaries maintained for the plaintiff by plaintiff’s wife/ partner for the purposes of a mental health assessment as outlined in Item 1 above.

(c) That leave of the Court be granted for second defendant to subpoena treating doctors Dr Rita Singh and Dr Cyriac Matthew to give evidence on Plaintiff’s mental health

(d) That access to Plaintiff’s mood diaries maintained by Plaintiff’s wife/ partner be provided to defendant’s for the period of 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2013 as submitted to Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of NSW in relation to case number 2014/168906.

(e) That the plaintiff’s mental health records for the period 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2013 be made available to the defendants via a subpoena to Hunter New England Area Health, or through the Prothonotary of Supreme Court in the case number 2014/168906 if the Prothonotary of Supreme Court hold such records as mentioned above.

(f) That the defendants be provided with information on medication, medication dosages being administered and blood test reports of Plaintiff from 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2013.

4. That the Courts consider a contempt of court referral to the Supreme Court against the Plaintiff for threatening a witness for the defendants.

5.That the Court make orders to prevent the plaintiff from making complaints/s and/or lodge proceedings against witnesses in this matter to government authorities, public offices or any workplaces of witnesses without the leave of the Court.

6. That the Court allow defendants use affidavits prepared by their former solicitors be allowed without their physical presence in Court.

6(a) If the above is disallowed by the Court, then the Court Order appropriate adjournments as needed to allow for appearance of all persons who have provided affidavits in this matter.

7. That the plaintiff provide security of costs to continue with this trial being $200,000.

8. That the plaintiff pay defendants costs of filing costs of filing this motion and travel costs forthwith.

9. Such other Orders that the Court deems fit.


	
	Each of the orders sought raises significant problems not only because of the lateness of the applications but also by reason of the nature of relief sought.
	


Request to rely on exhibits and evidence from other proceedings


	
	This application is made by both defendants and I propose to deal with their submissions on it together.
	
	
	It is unclear to me how many of the documents sought from the Supreme Court proceedings are documents obtained under subpoena or as the result of a specific order of the court. In Hearne v Street [2008] HCA 36 per Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ at [96] noted the restrictions on the use of such documents:
	


""[96] Where one party to litigation is compelled, either by reason of a rule of court, or by reason of a specific order of the court, or otherwise, to disclose documents or information, the party obtaining the disclosure cannot, without the leave of the court, use it for any purpose other than that for which it was given unless it is received into evidence. The types of material disclosed to which this principle applies include documents inspected after discovery, answers to interrogatories, documents produced on subpoena, documents produced for the purposes of taxation of costs, documents produced pursuant to a direction from an arbitrator, documents seized pursuant to an Anton Piller order, witness statements served pursuant to a judicial direction and affidavits.""


	
	This requirement attaches both to documents produced by a party and a third party in proceedings: P and W v Manny [2010] ACTSC 50 at [24] per Gray J. This prohibition extends to any use or disclosure other than for the purpose of the proceedings in which the documents were obtained. Any wider use is collateral and consequently improper, unless authorised by prior leave, which must be granted by that court, and not by the court in which the documents are sought to be tendered: Bell Group Ltd (in liq) v Westpac Banking Corporation (1998) 166 ALR 699 at 705-706.
	
	
	The procedure for obtaining leave to use a document obtained either under a subpoena or obtained on discovery is one which has been employed in defamation proceedings, such as P and W v Manny [2010] ACTSC 50.
	
	
	As to the claim for relief in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the admissibility of any relevant material from Supreme Court proceedings 2014/168906 must be considered item by item, and in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The provenance of those documents is also relevant, for the reasons set out above. Some documentation (for example, a record of an order confirming that the plaintiff had pleaded guilty) should not be a difficulty. However, a “blanket” order of the kind proposed by the defendants is completely inappropriate.
	
	
	In addition to these problems, it emerged, from the second defendant’s submissions to me, that both defendants had sought advice from their solicitors in November 2015 about obtaining these documents. Inquiries were made of the Crown Solicitor, and the second defendant told me that the Crown Solicitors office had told him “we couldn’t access the evidence as the matter is not completed”. The plaintiff told the court that his sentencing is adjourned until 20 December 2016 but JusticeLink currently has this listed as 10 June 2016.
	
	
	The first defendant asked that, if I were not prepared to order the Crown Solicitors’ Office to provide these documents, he should have leave to subpoena Jillian Caldwell to bring these documents to court and to give evidence as to what occurred. He told me he had not notified her of any such application, nor had he prepared a subpoena.
	
	
	Under no circumstances would I grant leave to issue a subpoena in this form, which appears to be designed to avoid an application to the Supreme Court and the current refusal of the Crown Solicitors to supply the documents in question.
	
	
	The defendants’ next application was for the hearing of these proceedings to be adjourned “for just a little bit of time”, which was then clarified to be an adjournment until after the sentencing. Alternatively, the second defendant submitted that I should ask the Supreme Court to bring the sentencing forward.
	
	
	These proceedings have already been adjourned once in 2014 due to the unreadiness of the parties, and again in 2015 when the proceedings were first not reached and then adjourned from the May Newcastle sittings to be given a hearing date in Sydney. Although well aware of the facilities of the Defamation List for hearing arguments pending the hearing, the defendants elected to wait until a few days before the hearing date to file notices of motion, with the result that the current trial date for these proceedings (namely today) is imperilled. Even if sentencing takes place in June rather than December, this court has no more facilities for a four-week hearing later in 2016.
	
	
	The second defendant’s applications for use of the Supreme Court documents and issuing of subpoenae are refused, as is his application for an adjournment of the hearing. I have made similar orders in relation to the first defendant.
	


The case management orders sought


	
	As to the remaining applications for orders, I make the following general observations:
	



	
	Both defendants’ previous applications for the court to order a medical examination of the plaintiff were rejected by me in Mallegowda v Sood (No 3). The only additional material supplied is evidence that the plaintiff suffers from bipolar disorder and has been prescribed medication. I refuse this application for the same reasons as those set out in my earlier judgment at [37] – [40].
	
	
	The circumstances in which medical practitioners may be called to give evidence under subpoena are set out in the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”). This late and misguided application for leave to subpoena the two named medical practitioners as witnesses is totally at variance with the careful structure of UCPR rules designed to ensure proper preparation and service of medical evidence and I refuse this application.
	
	
	The claim in paragraph 4 of “contempt of court” and of “complaints” in paragraph 5 are put in the most general terms. There is no need at this late stage for the court to make any orders of the kind sought in paragraphs 4 and 5. If any specific instance comes to the defendants’ attention during the trial, it should be the subject of evidence in proper form.
	
	
	The application for an undertaking in paragraph 5 was withdrawn.
	
	
	Only in the specific circumstances outlined in the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act would a witness statement be permitted to be tendered without any requirement for cross-examination. Nor would an adjournment of the hearing be granted so that such a witness could be cross-examined. Where witness availability is a problem, the parties may consider applications such as for the witness with availability problems to give evidence by telephone.
	
	
	The plaintiff has agreed that the witnesses the subject of this application (who are solicitors) may be cross-examined by telephone and that is how I propose to permit them to give evidence. Other witnesses who wish to give evidence in this fashion may make similar applications.
	
	
	The remaining application is for security for costs. I have already refused the defendants’ previous applications for special costs orders and security for costs: Mallegowda v Sood (No 3) at [42] – [48]. The only new circumstance is that the trial date has arrived. If anything, the fact that the trial has commenced is a further bar to the granting of such relief.
	



	
	For these reasons, I dismiss the second plaintiff’s notice of motion.
	


Notice of Motion – 1ST defendant


	
	Apart from paragraphs 1 and 2, the first defendant seeks similar orders:
	


1.That the Court make Orders to allow Cross Claimant/ First defendant for Joinder of Road and Maritime Services NSW (RMS) as an additional defendant.

2. That leave of Court is granted to the first defendant to amend his cross claim to include RMS as a Joinder defendant party.

3. That the Courts allow and accept issues which have already been determined in the matter with case number 14/288906 that is common in this matter.

4. That [the] court order an independent mental health assessment of Plaintiff to determine Plaintiff’s mental health to participate in this trial as a plaintiff and/or a self-represented litigant.

(a) That the mental health assessment order to include time period when the first and second attacking emails were sent against the first defendant and date ie. From January 2012 till date.

5. That the Courts allow defendants to adduce evidence from materials produced in the matter between Prothonotary of Supreme Court NSW v Mr S H Mallegowda before in relation to case number 2014/168906 in this matter.

(a) That the leave of Court be provided for defendants to access all transcripts in relation to case number 2014/168906 either through Supreme Court Registry or via prothonotary of Supreme Court in this matter.

(b) That the Court provide orders for defendants to access material in the contempt matter against plaintiff in relation to case number 2014/168906 via Prothonotary of Supreme Court in that matter.

(c) That the leave of Court be granted to issue subpoena to Crown solicitors to give evidence and bring documents or things at this trial.

6. That the Courts consider a contempt of court referral to the Supreme Court against the Plaintiff for threatening a witness for the defendants.

7.That the Court make orders to prevent the plaintiff from making complaints/s and/or lodge proceedings against witnesses in this matter to government authorities, public offices or any workplaces of witnesses without the leave of the Court.

8. That the Court allow defendants use affidavits prepared by their former solicitors be allowed without their physical presence in Court.

(a) If the above is disallowed by the Court, then the Court Order appropriate adjournments as needed to allow for appearance of all persons who have provided affidavits in this matter.

9 That the plaintiff pay defendants costs of filing costs of filing this motion and travel costs forthwith.

10 Such other Orders that the Court deems fit.


	
	As to paragraphs 1 and 2, the first defendant does not offer any explanation for seeking to join the Roads and Maritime Services as an additional defendant, although such an explanation would be a pre-requisite (Aon at [98] – [102]). He told me, when he appeared before me on 28 April 2016, that this organisation had not even been informed of this application being made. The limitation period for defamation claims having expired, any cause of action against the Roads and Maritime services would need to be identified with some specificity in a carefully drafted pleading before I would even consider such an application. I note that this application has now been withdrawn.
	
	
	As to paragraph 5, the tender of material produced and relied upon in the Supreme Court would have to be dealt with in accordance with provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), noting the limitations for reliance upon documents produced in other proceedings as set out by the High Court of Australia in Hearne v Street.
	
	
	The other applications brought by the first defendant are essentially the same as those sought by the second defendant, and are dismissed for the same reasons.
	


Notice of Motion – 1ST AND 2ND defendant


	
	An unfiled notice of motion seeks orders effectively the same as those set out in the two filed motions brought by the first and second defendants:
	


1 That court order an independent mental health assessment of Plaintiff to determine Plaintiff’s mental health to participate in this trial as a plaintiff and/or a self-represented litigant.

That the mental health assessment order to include time period when the first and second attacking emails were sent against the first defendant and date ie. From August 2012 till date.

2 The Court Order that independent expert/s be provided access to the full mental health records of plaintiff not excluding mood diaries maintained for plaintiff by plaintiff’s wife/ partner for the purposes of the mental health assessment as outlined in item 1 above.

3 The honourable Court make orders to adduce evidence produced in the matter between Prothonotary of Supreme Court NSW vs Mr S H Mallegowda before in relation to case number 2014/168906 in this matter.

4 The honourable Court grant leave to subpoena Plaintiff’s treating doctors, a Dr Rita Singh and Dr Cyriac Matthew, to give evidence on plaintiff’s mental health.

5 That access to Plaintiff’s mood diaries maintained by plaintiff’s wife/ partner be provided to the defendants for the time period 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2013 as submitted to Prothonotary of the Supreme Court NSW in relation to case number 2014/168906.

6 That the plaintiff’s mental health records for the duration 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2013 be made accessible to the defendants via a subpoena to Hunter New England Health or through Crown Solicitors in the case number 14/168906 of they do hold mental health records of the plaintiff.,

7 That the defendants be provided with information on medication and medication dosages being administered to Plaintiff from 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2013.

8 That the honourable court provide orders for defendants be able to access transcripts of the contempt matter against the plaintiff in relation to case number 2014/168906 either through Supreme Court Registry or via Crown Solicitors in that matter.

9 That the honourable Court provide orders for defendants to be able to access evidence used in the contempt matter against Plaintiff in relation to case number 2014/168906 via Crown Solicitors in that matter.

10 That the plaintiff provide security of costs to continue with this trial being $200,000.

11 That the plaintiff pay defendants costs of filing this motion and travel cost forthwith.

12 Such other orders that the Court sees fit.


	
	The parties told me in the course of argument that they no longer seek these orders.
	


Costs and other orders


	
	As this is a trial which is proceeding, and I propose to consider any application to permit the defendants to make an application to lead additional evidence about the plaintiff’s conviction at the end of the hearing (should this be necessary), I propose to reserve the issue of costs.
	


Orders


	
	Defendants’ Notices of Motion returnable 6 May 2016 dismissed.
	
	
	Costs reserved.

		27 May 2016",2016-05-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769327,Ford v R [2016] NSWCCA 69,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The application for an extension of the time within which to appeal should be refused, for the reasons given by McCallum J.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: Bruce Ford seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to nine counts of sexual offending against five children. The sentencing judge took a further 44 offences into account on six Forms 1, as allowed under s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Procedure Act”). The judge assessed the totality of the offending to be “arguably in the worst category” and considered that, at the very least, it fell within the high range of sexual offending against children.
	
	
	The applicant was aged 44 years at the time he was sentenced. He had entered early pleas of guilty to all charges and was allowed a discount of 25%. He was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 21 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years.
	


Extension of time


	
	The application for leave to appeal was not filed within the time allowed under the Criminal Appeal Rules. The applicant was sentenced on 13 April 2012. The notice of appeal was filed on 23 November 2015. The appeal is accordingly well out of time.
	
	
	The applicant’s current solicitor received instructions to act on an appeal on 10 March 2015, almost 3 years after the applicant was sentenced. The explanation for the applicant’s delay in approaching Legal Aid for assistance in pursuing an appeal was inadequately proved. The applicant’s current solicitor deposed to a conversation with the applicant in which the applicant explained his reason for not appealing at the time he was sentenced by reference to a conversation with his former solicitor. The applicant asserts the former solicitor told him he should “cop” the sentence imposed, otherwise the Director of Public Prosecutions would “probably hit [him] with further charges”. The former solicitor should have been approached to give his account of that conversation.
	
	
	Leaving aside the matter of proof, it is doubtful whether the conversation affords an acceptable explanation for delaying the appeal process. However, having regard to the lengthy sentences imposed, I have concluded that the appropriate course is to determine the application for an extension of time according to the merits of the appeal.
	


Background


	
	The offences were committed within a family structure that defies traditional labels. A man and a woman to whom I will refer as X and Y respectively had four children under the age of 13. X and Y describe themselves as “nudists”. That appears to have been a cynical euphemism within what was in fact a community of paedophiles. X and Y were arrested after police discovered videos depicting each of them and the applicant all engaging in various sex acts with X and Y’s two eldest children, to whom I will refer as A (a boy aged 12) and B (a girl aged 11). In information gathered by police, the applicant is described variously as X’s boyfriend, Y’s boyfriend and the boyfriend of B (the girl aged 11). Shortly before Y was arrested she had ended her relationship with X to commence a “more exclusive” relationship with the applicant, taking the children with her. According to what she told police the girl, B, had come to regard the applicant as a member of her family.
	
	
	Police investigating these matters seized many images and videos depicting child sex abuse. They also recovered numerous “chat logs” (recordings of conversations conducted over the internet in real time). The majority of the chat logs discussed sex and child sex abuse.
	
	
	The analysis by police of the chat logs revealed a paedophile network extending throughout Australia and overseas. The applicant, X and Y were at the “hub” of the network, creating websites for the sharing of child pornography produced by members of the group abusing their own children.
	
	
	The investigation of the offences uncovered by the chat logs extended to a number of overseas countries. A number of offenders were arrested in the United Kingdom, including one particular couple in Hampshire with whom X, Y and the applicant had many chat sessions encouraging each other’s abuse of children and exchanging videos of their abuse of their own children.
	


Ground 3 – alleged appearance of bias


	
	The applicant relies on three grounds of appeal. Ground 3 alleged apprehension of bias and should be considered first. [1]  It is convenient to describe the nature of the offending (to the extent necessary) in that context. The particulars of all charges and the sentences imposed are summarised in a helpful schedule provided by the Crown, a copy of which is appended to this judgment.
	
	
	Ground 3 is:
	


“the sentencing judge has expressed personal views in relation to the offending of the applicant which give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias affecting the sentencing of the applicant”.


	
	For reasons that were not well explained, the applicant sought leave at the hearing of the appeal to amend this ground by replacing the word “apprehension” with the word “appearance”. Indeed, the amendment suggests a misunderstanding of established principle. The question in a case of alleged prejudgment is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. [2] 
	
	
	X, Y and the applicant were all sentenced by the same judge within a period of about a week. The judge sentenced X on 5 April 2012. He had pleaded guilty to 9 counts of child sexual abuse. He also had offences taken into account on a number of Forms 1, but far fewer than the applicant; X had 9 further offences whereas the applicant had 44, including a number of very serious offences. The approach in each case appears to have been to include on the indictment a representative set of offences in respect of each victim, placing all other offences relating to that same victim on a Form 1 relating to a corresponding count on the indictment.
	
	
	In accordance with the practice in this State, the sentencing judgments were read aloud. In sentencing X, the judge summarised the facts relating to him. In doing so, he included a considerable amount of detail, while also noting “the full facts are set out in the twenty-two page agreed statement of facts”.
	
	
	A week later the same judge sentenced Y. She had pleaded guilty to 8 counts of child sexual abuse. There was a degree of overlap between the facts relied upon against her and the facts against X. The judge again referred to the fact that there was a twenty-two page agreed statement of facts, which he summarised in considerable detail.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced the following day, on 13 April 2012. For a third time, the judge discharged his solemn duty to state his reasons aloud, again including a careful recitation of the facts. The judge said that the judgment in respect of the applicant should be read in conjunction with those relating to X and Y, specifically noting that the two earlier judgments had been prepared in advance whereas the judgment against the applicant was being given ex tempore (albeit using some of the previously prepared material).
	
	
	On this third occasion of reciting in detail the facts of this shocking episode of child sexual abuse by a mother, a father and their mutual boyfriend, the judge said:
	


There is further detail in the agreed statement of facts which I will not go to but obviously which is [on] the public record and available should anyone wish to, although one would really wonder why you would have a look at the material. The less said about it the better I would think.


	
	Later in the same judgment his Honour said:
	


After sentencing three of these people it is more and more difficult not to use inflammatory language when describing the conduct and perhaps given that this is the third such occasion on which I have had to refer to these matters I think the less I say about it the better. Anyone who reads the facts will have a clear and unequivocal understanding of the level of sexual depravity that has been exhibited by this man.


	
	Omitting the last sentence, those are the remarks relied upon by the applicant to support the claim of apprehended bias founded on the contention that the judge allowed his “personal views” to intrude into his reasons for sentence. The applicant submits “the impression is left that the distaste expressed by the sentencing judge has influenced him in his assessment of the criminality of the applicant relative to the co-offenders and relative to the needs for deterrence.”
	
	
	An aspect of the applicant’s complaint under this ground is the contention that, although the three statements of facts form part of the public record, they are not “readily available”. The suggestion appears to be that, in order adequately to explain the sentences imposed, the judge was obliged to recite the agreed facts in full within the body of the judgment. The principle of open justice imposes no such requirement. The agreed facts recorded a degree of sexual depravity which it was neither necessary nor appropriate to visit upon the listening public. The factual detail of the chat logs is particularly insidious, describing acts and desires which any decent person would find extremely disturbing. In my view the degree of distillation and censorship of the facts exercised by his Honour was entirely appropriate. No further detail was required to explain the sentences imposed.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the judge’s remarks were apt to convey the view that the process of reading the agreed statement of facts in full would be distasteful and was to be discouraged. If that entailed an unguarded expression of personal distaste it could not, in the circumstances of this case, be taken to disclose prejudice or personal bias inconsistent with the impartial exercise of the sentencing discretion. A sentencing judge is required to give clear expression to his or her assessment of the nature of the offending. In cases of extreme depravity, the judge is entitled to hold and express the view that the offender’s conduct is extremely depraved. If the facts underlying that conclusion are so awful that it is fitting to protect the public from their detail, that may be said too.
	
	
	As identified in the Sentencing Procedure Act, s 3A, one of the purposes for which a court imposes a sentence on an offender is “to denounce the conduct of the offender”. [3]  A further purpose is “to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.” [4]  It is true that one part of the Court’s role is to translate a community interest in retribution into an appropriate sentence imposed according to law. However, as the applicant’s own submissions recognise, the function of the Court in sentencing an offender is not merely to impose the sentence, but to provide a public expression of the reasons for the sentence. There is some irony in the applicant’s complaint that the judge spared the public a full account of the offending, but instead, and in order to explain that course, denounced it in emotive language.
	
	
	The role played by denunciation of criminal conduct as part of the sentencing process was carefully examined by the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal in Inkson v The Queen. [5]  No doubt it would be wrong for a trial judge to express views in sentencing which could inflame prejudice or encourage vindictive behaviour on the part of the victim or other members of the community towards the offender. None of that occurred in the present case. Nevertheless, as explained by Crawford J in Inkson, “the sentencing judge was required to identify, assess and weigh the outrage and revulsion that an informed and responsible public would have in response to the applicant’s crime”. [6]  It is a legitimate, if not a necessary, part of the sentencing process to identify and record those matters in the judgment on sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Inkson provided an example of how such a response might be recorded, Underwood J stating: [7] 
	


“The criminal conduct constituting the commission of the crime was of the very worst kind.… Leaving [the victim] propped up against the wall, unconscious and bleeding to return to the party, demonstrated a depraved, callous disregard for the welfare of a human being seldom encountered in a civilised society. Ordinary right thinking members of the community would be outraged and revulsed by the applicant’s criminal conduct and demand that it be denounced.”


	
	That is the case here. However, there was another misconception underlying this ground. The applicant’s submissions focused on the manner in which it was contended that the sentencing judge had “allowed his personal views or emotional feelings to impact on the objectivity of his sentencing.” The submissions further asserted that an impression was created “that the distaste expressed by the sentencing judge has influenced him in his assessment of the criminality of the applicant relative to the co-offenders and relative to the needs for deterrence.”
	
	
	There are different forms of bias, but the only one relevant in this case is pre-judgment. Nothing was relied on prior to the delivery of judgment as demonstrating any such error. The proposed ground was really an allegation that the judge had been diverted from the proper exercise of his judicial function by his personal feelings. Those were either entirely impermissible influences or, perhaps, indulged to an excessive extent. (The submissions suggested that the former approach was preferred, namely absolute impermissibility.)
	
	
	There is no doubt that a sentence will be set aside if the sentencing judge has relied upon extraneous considerations. In Inkson, the sentence was set aside because the sentencing judge had taken into account community outrage that the offender had not been charged with murder, although his victim had died. However, no such error occurred in the present case.
	
	
	Although it is correct to submit that a sentencing judge must maintain a degree of detachment in order to judge the moral culpability of an offender whose liberty is at stake, that does not mean that the judge is to be drained of any legitimate emotional response. The discussion of the process of sentencing set out above explains why such impersonal and absolute detachment is not required.
	
	
	What follows will demonstrate why there was no rational foundation for the submission that the sentencing judge in this case had allowed his feelings to overwhelm impartial judgment.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to 9 counts of sexual offending. Counts 1 to 4 related to X and Y’s son, A. Count 1 was an offence of aggravated sexual assault without consent contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for that offence is 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The charge was based on an image seized from the couple in Hampshire depicting the applicant sitting on a chair with an erection while X (A’s father) and A (aged 12) each performed oral sex on him at the same time. In sentencing the applicant for count 1, the judge took into account 11 further offences on a Form 1. The judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. Having regard to the number and nature of the offences on the Form 1 (described below), that was a lenient sentence.
	
	
	Count 2 and the Form 1 offences for Count 1 were based on three continuous videos made by X, Y and the applicant. The videos were located on both the applicant’s computer and the mother’s. The images were also live streamed to the man in Hampshire. The videos run for about twenty minutes each and depict a series of sexual acts between X, Y, the applicant and the boy, A.
	
	
	The statement of facts includes a description of their contents, scene by sordid scene. It is not necessary to recite the full detail. The description reveals that, by the age of 12, A had become so sexualised by his parents and the applicant that the various sex acts they performed on each other and watched each other perform had become almost banal. The videos show A being penetrated anally with a variety of sex aids, referred to by the offenders as “butt plugs”. At one point he is encouraged to penetrate his own anus with a vibrator. The applicant chastises him for “fucking around” (as if it were a skill the boy should have mastered by now) and threatens to go back to the butt plug. In the meantime the adults engage in all imaginable kinds of sexual activity with each other which the boy is prevailed upon to watch, join or film. At one point the applicant forces deeper anal penetration with a sex aid over the boy’s complaint, telling him to “get used to it”. The applicant variously abuses and threatens the boy (“do you want the butt plug back in?”, “you know how we play with whips and restraints. If you don’t keep it in there I will seriously hurt you”).
	
	
	Count 2 on the indictment was an offence of aggravated sexual assault in company contrary to s 61JA(1) of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty of life imprisonment; standard non-parole period of 15 years). The charge was based on one of the acts of anal penetration of the boy with the butt plug. The circumstance of aggravation was that the offence was committed by the applicant in company with the boy’s mother and father. The sentence imposed was imprisonment for 10 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.
	
	
	Count 3 was based on a separate video seized from the applicant. It depicts the boy naked, shackled and gagged with a rubber ball with leather straps running past his anus and around his neck. His father pushes him, forcing him to move around in the restraints. The applicant calls him a “gimp”; the applicant and the boy’s father are heard laughing. The charge was aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2), carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years and a standard non-parole period of 8 years. Four further offences were taken into account on a Form 1 including an act of indecency entailing filming the boy’s father place lizards on the boy’s penis. The judge imposed a sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	Count 4 was an aggravated offence of inciting an act of indecency contrary to s 61O(2A) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years (with no standard non-parole period). The charge was based on another video in which the applicant lay naked in a bath while the father filmed him. The video films them prevailing upon the boy to strip naked, straddle the bath and urinate on the applicant while the applicant masturbates. The judge imposed a sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years for that offence.
	
	
	In my view the sentences imposed in respect of the offences against the boy were lenient. The proposition that they have the appearance of bias on the strength of the judge’s personal “distaste” for the nature of the offending is risible.
	
	
	Count 5 was an offence of grooming a child under the age of 16 for unlawful sexual activity contrary to s 66EB(3) of the Crimes Act. That offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The offence was disclosed by the chat logs obtained by police. The child (to whom I will refer to as C) was the mother’s 15 year old nephew, who was staying at the household during the school holidays. During that time, X often walked around naked with the applicant and smoked cannabis. X showed C adult pornography on the computer. One night the applicant visited and brought amphetamine with him, which was offered to C (C declined). C witnessed A, X and the applicant naked talking to someone over the webcam. He saw X give half a Viagra tablet to A, following which A showed his erection to those following the webcam. The sentence imposed was a term of imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months. That was the only offence relating to the boy C.
	
	
	Counts 6 and 7 related to X and Y’s daughter, B, who was aged 11 at the time of the offences. Each was a charge of aggravated sexual assault on a person under 16 contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. Three further offences were taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of count 6. The offences were based on video footage of the girl B sitting next to her cousin C on the couch. The applicant and X perform cunnilingus on the girl (count 6). She then performs fellatio on each of them (count 7 in the case of the applicant). Other material obtained in the chat logs reveals that those events were live-streamed to the couple in Hampshire. For count 6, the judge imposed a term of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. For count 7, his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	Counts 8 and 9 relate to the two children of the couple in Hampshire and are based on chat room conversations between the applicant and the father of those children. On each count, 10 further offences were taken into account on separate Forms 1. Count 8 was an offence of inciting an offence of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10, contrary to s 80G and 66A(2) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. Four of the 10 further offences taken into account on the relevant Form 1 were also charges of incitement to the man in Hampshire to have intercourse with that child, a girl aged four years.
	
	
	The count on the indictment was based on an exchange in which the applicant encouraged the man in Hampshire to use a particular kind of vibrator (“the same thing I first got for [B]”) for use on the four year old girl. The man in Hampshire invites the applicant to watch the event over the webcam. Police recovered video footage of the girl being penetrated with a sex aid answering the description provided by the applicant to the man in Hampshire in the earlier conversation.
	
	
	The sentence imposed for that offence was a term of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	Count 9 relates to the other child of the couple in Hampshire, a boy aged 11 at the time of the offences. The offence was based on the applicant’s incitement of the boy to fellate his father (the man in Hampshire) while the applicant watched via webcam. As with the three videos discussed above in respect of count 2, a striking feature of the chat room conversations is the extent to which their discussion of acts of the grossest depravity became banal. The two men exchange suggested techniques for grooming young children for sexual abuse as if they were tradesmen discussing the finer techniques of their trade. It is little wonder the judge chose not to descend to the detail of those offences. Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the judge imposed a sentence for count 9 of imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	There is no merit in ground 3. Even the limited summary of the facts set out above confirms that his Honour expressed himself in relatively moderate language in the circumstances. The judgment aptly distilled the nature of the offending and the measure of denunciation it should attract.
	


Ground 1 - protection of the community


	
	Ground 1 is:
	


The sentencing judge erred in applying Veen No 2 in sentencing the applicant.


	
	The applicant has a prior conviction for assault with an act of indecency and three prior convictions for acts of indecency with aggravation. The offences related to three girls to whom he was then in the role of stepfather. The aggravated acts of indecency were representative charges; they related to specific occasions on which the applicant had masturbated to the point of ejaculation in the two younger girls’ bedroom. They said he had often done that. The applicant himself told police he had done it “probably more than 50 times”.
	
	
	The indecent assault related to the older daughter who was aged 17 at the time of the offence. The applicant’s account was that she was masturbating in the lounge room, which he took as an invitation. He said he watched her for a while (evidently unbeknownst to the girl) and then placed his penis against her mouth. When his penis touched her mouth, the girl jumped up and ran away. She did not wish to make a statement to police; the charge was based on the applicant’s admission to her mother.
	
	
	In order to explain the judge’s treatment of the prior convictions, it is necessary to refer to his judgment sentencing Y. In that judgment, the judge listed a series of aggravating factors which he had taken into account in accordance with s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. However, Y had no prior criminal convictions; in her case, that was a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate sentencing in accordance with s 21A(3) of the Act.
	
	
	In dealing with aggravating and mitigating factors in the case of the applicant, the judge said:
	


I confirm what I said in my remarks on sentence for [Y] in terms of the s 21A aggravating factors. In addition to those I accept that his prior criminal history because of the type of offending is in fact an aggravating factor under s 21A but it is aggravating in a Veen sense, that is, it is relevant to my assessment of the need for personal deterrence and punishment and also it is relevant to my consideration as to his prospects of rehabilitation.


	
	The applicant takes the reference to “Veen” to be a reference to Veen v The Queen (No 2), [8]  which is probably the case.
	
	
	It is also relevant to consider what the judge said later in his judgment as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation:
	


In relation to the question of whether he has good prospects of rehabilitation and/or is likely to reoffend I note that on that issue or those topics I reached a positive conclusion for [Y] but that I was unable to reach such a positive conclusion for [X]. Having regard to all of the material that has been placed before me, which is relevant to this topic, I would indeed, as I said in relation to [X], need to be prescient in order to determine what his prospects of rehabilitation are and/or what the likelihood of reoffending is. It may be that the parole board would have to address that issue after he has served his sentence but at that point in time they ought to be in a far better position than I am at present. My conclusion is that I cannot positively conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation nor can I positively conclude that he is unlikely to reoffend. I do not conclude the opposite of that position. I simply indicate I am unable to reach a positive conclusion so far as he is concerned on those points.


	
	The applicant submitted that the decision of the High Court in Veen (No 2) “involves considering the protection of the community in sentencing in this context rather than specific deterrence”. He submitted that, in the present case, “no case was made out that a sentence was required with a view to ‘the protection of society’”. It was submitted that there was no psychiatric evidence to indicate that the applicant would continue to reoffend if released or be a danger to society “once punished”.
	
	
	The submissions reveal misconception both as to the law and as to the import of the judge’s remarks.
	
	
	The misconception as to the principles stated in Veen (No 2) is that, according to the applicant’s argument, the decision is confined in its application to the issue of the need to protect the community against the risk of recidivism. The premise of the argument appears to be that, except where a need to protect society against a risk of recidivism is established, Veen (No 2) holds that the sentencing court cannot have regard to prior convictions. That is wrong. The judgment of the majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) deals comprehensively with the principles relating to the proper consideration of prior criminal convictions. The Crown relied in particular on the following passage from the majority judgment (at 477, [14]).
	


There are two subsidiary principles which should be mentioned. The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences: Director of Public Prosecutions v. Ottewell (1970) AC 642, at p 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner's claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community's understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties.


	
	That passage confirms that it is permissible, in accordance with Veen (No 2), to have regard to an offender’s prior criminal convictions in determining whether there is a need to impose “condign punishment to deter the offender” (specific deterrence). There is no justification for reading down the reasoning in the way contended for by the applicant, but if there were there would be a lively issue as to whether such an approach could stand with s 21A(2)(d) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
	
	
	The misconception as to the judge’s remarks is that, contrary to the premise of the applicant’s submissions in support of this ground, it is clear that the judge did not ultimately conclude that the applicant’s total sentence should be longer so as to protect society from a risk of recidivism. His Honour specifically said that he was unable to reach a conclusion one way or the other as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Even if that is wrong, the applicant’s further submission that no case was made out for a need for protection of society must be rejected. A report before the Court from a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Jonathan Adams, provided ample support for such a finding. Dr Adams said:
	


Given the severity of his paraphilic sexual fantasies and urges in my opinion a pharmacological treatment strategy might well be warranted. Mr Ford will require long term close monitoring of his mood and paraphilic sexual fantasies, urges and behaviours. It is noteworthy that Mr Ford acknowledged the pathological basis of his paraphilic sexual fantasies and expressed his wish to engage in appropriate treatment.


	
	The fact that the judge felt unable to reach a conclusion as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation reflected the unpredictability of important factors relevant to that assessment, such as the applicant’s ongoing willingness to undertake treatment, the potential unavailability of appropriate treatment and the inherent uncertainty of recovery in this field. The point is that, in my view, it would have been open to the judge to make a finding that a longer sentence was required for the protection of society, so long as the total sentence remained proportionate to the offending.
	
	
	In my view, ground 1 is without merit.
	


Ground 2 - disparity


	
	Ground 2 is:
	


The sentencing judge erred in imposing the same effective sentence on [X], the father of a victim, as he did on the applicant, giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.


	
	As already noted, the same judge sentenced X, Y and the applicant. His Honour gave careful consideration to the principle of parity. His Honour concluded, looking at all of the material in respect of each offender, that X and the applicant were “on about the same level” for “different reasons”. His Honour noted that there were slight differences in terms of the physical acts that each undertook and slight differences in terms of their involvement with the chat rooms which were not such as to warrant any difference in the total effective sentences.
	
	
	The judge specifically acknowledged that X was involved in an enormous breach of trust because he was the father of two of the victims and had allowed the applicant to come into his family, affording him the opportunity to do the things he had done to those victims. On the other hand, as noted by the judge, X had no prior criminal history whereas the applicant had prior convictions for sexual interference with children for which he received sentences of imprisonment.
	
	
	Further, as noted by the Crown in her submissions in this Court, X was not charged in relation to any of the offending in Hampshire involving the two children there. There was very serious offending on the part of the applicant involving the four-year-old child including five offences carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
	
	
	An important further consideration in respect of this ground is that, at the proceedings on sentence, counsel then appearing on behalf of the applicant submitted that the effective sentence imposed on X “would appropriately be imposed in this case”, adding “in my respectful submission that would give rise to no justified sense of grievance on the part of either offender”. If that was the view of the applicant’s own counsel at the time, it is difficult to see how any sense of grievance later experienced could be justifiable.
	
	
	More importantly, as submitted by the Crown, it has frequently been emphasised that an appeal to this Court is not an occasion for reformulation of the case put below: Zreika v R. [9] 
	
	
	In my view, there is no merit in ground 2.
	


Conclusions


	
	I consider that the judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the offending, to the extent that his Honour stopped short of characterising the totality of the offending as being in the worst category, was conservative in favour of the applicant. The offences entailed an unfathomable degree of cruelty and depravity. Two of the counts on the indictment and four of the offences listed on the Forms 1 carried maximum penalties of imprisonment for life.
	
	
	In any event, each of the proposed grounds of appeal being either misconceived or simply without merit, in my view it would be contrary to the interests of justice to allow the proposed application for leave to appeal to proceed. The order I propose is that the application for an extension of the time within which to bring the appeal be refused.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with McCallum J.

		02 May 2016",2016-05-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769330,R v Turnbull (No. 10) [2016] NSWSC 782,"Judgment

 


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of cross-examination of Arthur Snook, a senior officer with the Office of Environment and Heritage, questions have been asked by senior counsel for the Accused by reference to conversations which apparently took place by telephone, on the morning of 10 December 2013, between Mr Snook and Mr Sylvester Joseph, the solicitor for the Accused.
	
	
	The conversations relate to the situation where Mr Turner, the deceased, was at the front gate of a property owned by the Turnbull family, having spoken to Scott Kennett and having indicated a desire to enter the property. According to the evidence of Mr Snook in cross-examination, there was then some communication from Grant Turnbull by text indicating he did not consent to Mr Turner entering the property. Thereafter, there was a further telephone conversation between Mr Joseph and Mr Snook. In the course of this conversation, a number of things were said.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused has sought to cross-examine by putting directly to Mr Snook what was allegedly said by Mr Joseph in the course of the conversation. This includes statements such as “It looks like our client and Mr Turner do not like each other”, and a little later, Mr Joseph saying words to the effect that what was happening was “bordering on harassment”.
	
	
	At that point, the Crown objected upon a number of bases.
	
	
	It is submitted, on behalf of the Accused, that this is evidence which relates to the conduct of Mr Turner in the months prior to the tragic events of 29 July 2014. It is said that it goes to the conduct of Mr Turner as an officer of the Office of Environment and Heritage in his investigations of the Accused and other members of the Turnbull family.
	
	
	The conversations, of course, do not involve the Accused - they are conversations between his solicitor and Mr Snook.
	
	
	The principal difficulty with these conversations, it seems to me, is that what is sought to be elicited are comments made by Mr Joseph (then and still the solicitor for the Accused) including opinions with the use of the word ""harassment"". The state of mind of Mr Joseph is entirely irrelevant to this trial (at least on my present view). To seek to adduce evidence of comments made by him containing conclusions, opinions or observations of that type, in my view, is impermissible.
	
	
	There may be a basis upon which questions can be asked of Mr Snook which do not invite, in effect, a ball-by-ball recitation of entire conversations, including comments volunteered by Mr Joseph on these topics. As I understand it, the objection is not taken to the line of questioning - it relates to the adducing of evidence of comments of that sort being made.
	
	
	I propose to disallow the evidence that Mr Joseph made a comment with respect to the events being “bordering on harassment”, and I will disallow any further evidence of opinions of that sort.
	
	
	It will be a matter for counsel to determine if there are ways, consistent with my ruling, to adduce evidence from Mr Snook on these issues, but I will not allow the effective recital of entire conversations, in particular when they have comment or opinion expressed in that way.
	
	
	In making this ruling, I do not consider that it is appropriate to allow this evidence as being (in some way) admissible, but not as evidence of truth of the fact. Comments of this sort are simply inadmissible, in my view, and should not be led in the presence of the jury.
	
	
	There is some broad analogy with the subject matter of my judgment, R v Turnbull (No. 9) [2016] NSWSC 781. Comments in the letter then tendered and rejected included opinions of Mr Joseph which may have gone to his state of mind, but not that of the Accused.
	
	
	In any event, the ruling which I have made on the present objection is as indicated. I will direct the jury to disregard the last comment involving the use of the word ""harassment"".

		20 June 2016",2016-05-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769332,Kang v Immigration News Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 74,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation for a newsletter published on 19 February 2015 which is set out in an annexure to the judgment. The matter complained of is set out as a schedule to this judgment. The imputations pleaded as arising are:
	



	
	The plaintiff had engaged in fraud (lines 2-3 and the matter as a whole).
	
	
	The plaintiff had engaged in misleading conduct (lines 2-5 and the matter as a whole).
	
	
	The plaintiff had deceived hundreds of innocent job seekers by extracting from them millions of dollars (lines 36-38 and the matter as a whole).
	
	
	The plaintiff, the principal of a company providing migration assistance, was responsible for the refusal of about 800 visa applications (lines 43-44 and the matter as a whole).
	
	
	The plaintiff had benefited to an amount of about $8 million as a result of his deceptions (lines 47-48 and the matter as a whole).
	



	
	The defendants filed a Notice of Appearance and a defence pleading that the proceedings were commenced outside the limitation period.
	
	
	At the first return date of 24 March 2016, both the plaintiff and the second defendant were present in court. Mr Konrad, who appeared for himself and as the representative of the second defendant, foreshadowed an application under ss 61 and 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (“UCPR”) Pt 12 r 12.7 for summary dismissal of the proceedings, on the basis of the manifest defects in the statement of claim (see the list below). He sought a special fixture for summary dismissal as he resides overseas and would have to return to Australia to represent himself and the first defendant.
	
	
	Mr Kang, who was present in court with his solicitor and actively participated in the making of the directions, also sought a hearing for his application for interim preservation of documents.
	
	
	The orders I made were as follows:
	



	
	List the matter for argument on Thursday 28 April 2016 at 9:00 am, noting the parties have foreshadowed the following issues for determination:
	



	
	Limitation issues;
	
	
	Stay of proceedings pursuant to s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and Part 12 UCPR;
	
	
	Application pursuant to s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (noting there were proceedings in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal); and
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application for interim preservation of documents.
	



	
	Parties to exchange and to provide to the court written submissions by Thursday 21 April 2016, noting the parties must comply with Civil Practice Note 6.
	
	
	Note the appearance of Ms Tannous from MacKellars Lawyers is for today only and she is excused from having to file a Notice of Appearance, but any solicitor appearing for Mr Kang in the future must file a Notice of Appearance.
	



	
	The plaintiff clearly understood, from own request for orders for orders for interim preservation, that these issues were listed for argument. The date of 28 April 2016 was specially selected to suit the convenience of Mr Konrad, who lives overseas and who would be obliged to travel to Australia for the argument.
	
	
	The defendants punctually filed their written submissions by the due date, complete with copies of the Supreme Court judgments relied upon in relation to the s 23 issue and extracts from relevant cases in relation to the other issues.
	
	
	The plaintiff not only failed to comply with the timetable by filing any submissions, but sent the following response (which I set out without grammatical corrections) to the defendants’ email serving their written submissions:
	


“Hi Karl

Thanks a lot, and we are planning to next week sue you and writer in relation to another set of articles you have recently published about my trial by DFT next week.

Could you please let me know writer’s name, young girl sitting whole days at Court and distorted whole stories?

Regards,

Ed.” [Exhibit B]


	
	Mr Konrad contacted my associate to see if the court had received any submissions on behalf of the plaintiff. My associate made inquiries directly to Mr Kang, as no Notice of Appearance was filed. No submissions were received in reply from Mr Kang or from anyone on his behalf.
	


The hearing on 28 April 2016


	
	Mr Goldsmith appeared for Mr Kang on 28 April 2016. He apologised to the court for failure to comply with the direction to file a Notice of Appearance, as he had effectively only received instructions that morning. Leave was granted to file a Notice of Appearance.
	
	
	Mr Goldsmith told the court that his instructions, sent shortly after midnight the night before and read by him at 7 am, were to apply for an adjournment of all the applications listed for hearing on behalf of the defendants. He had “no instructions whatever” about the plaintiff’s proposed application for interim preservation of material.
	
	
	Mr Goldsmith agreed that the statement of claim in its current form could not stand, and that major redrafting would be required. He conceded the following errors:
	



	
	The claim is out of time on its face, in that it was commenced more than a year after the date of the matter complained of, 19 February 2015. Even if the publication is electronically available (a matter about which there is some doubt), the claim would have to be repleaded to exclude material outside the limitation period.
	
	
	The particulars of publication, which state that the matter complained of is accessible on a website at www.australiavisa.com, is acknowledged to be incorrect. The matter complained of was emailed to members on a subscription list on 19 February 2016, and is not available on the Internet. This means that the particulars of publication must be completely repleaded.
	
	
	If the claim is electronically accessible, particulars of downloading must be provided, as otherwise there is no cause of action: Bleyer v Google Inc [2014] NSWSC 897 at [16]. There are currently no particulars of downloading at all.
	
	
	The particulars of who published the matter complained of, as set out in the statement of claim, are incorrect. Paragraphs one to three of the statement of claim refer to the “fourth and fifth defendants”, when there are in fact only two defendants.
	
	
	The matter complained of is unhelpfully described as “the third matter complained of”. However, this is a minor problem. The real difficulty for the plaintiff is that not only were proceedings commenced against the first defendant in the Supreme Court of New South Wales for a series of publications which appear to include this same publication, but those proceedings were struck out and dismissed by McCallum J in a show cause application: Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWSC 893; [2015] NSWCA 375. A further problem arose after I heard argument in this matter and reserved my decision. Mr Goldsmith, who had originally conceded that these proceedings formed part of the Supreme Court claim against Mr Konrad, and that an application for leave under s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) was required, withdrew that concession by email after the hearing, stating that the plaintiff was never given leave to file the statement of claim containing this matter complained of, because the proceedings in the Supreme Court which included this proposed amendment were instead struck out.
	
	
	There are other errors of form, such as the inadequately pleaded claim for “loss and damage to [the plaintiff’s] reputation” in paragraph 7 and the unhelpfully framed assertion that “the third matter complained of was of and concerning the plaintiff”, pleaded separately to the paragraph containing the imputations.
	



	
	Mr Goldsmith was aware the defendants were seeking summary dismissal of the proceedings. His preliminary application was, however, for an adjournment.
	


The plaintiff’s reasons for seeking an adjournment


	
	Mr Goldsmith gave four reasons for seeking an adjournment:
	



	
	He needed to find out from the plaintiff where the plaintiff had obtained the matter complained of, so that he could determine whether it was electronically readable or merely a one-off email.
	
	
	He needed to replead the whole of the statement of claim, and in particular consider the limitation period (a submission very similar to (a) above).
	
	
	He needed to advise his client to make an application under s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	He had only just received instructions shortly after midnight and was not in a position to answer the defendants’ arguments.
	



	
	Mr Konrad submitted in reply:
	



	
	Whether or not Mr Goldsmith had read them, he had certainly received the defendants’ written submissions on the due date of 21 April, because the plaintiff had included Mr Goldsmith’s email address in reply.
	
	
	Mr Goldsmith had acted for Mr Kang in the Supreme Court, where Mr Konrad as well as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had been a defendant. The claim against Mr Konrad was based on a series of issues of newsletters, of which the matter complained of was one. That meant that Mr Goldsmith not only should be familiar with the content and format of the newsletter, but that he had had this matter complained of in his possession for over a year.
	
	
	The limitation and s 23 issues were essentially acknowledged by Mr Goldsmith, and the only issue on which he needed to prepare was the application for summary dismissal or stay under s 61 or s 67. As that application relied heavily on the plaintiff’s proceedings against the ABC in the Supreme Court, in which Mr Goldsmith appeared for the plaintiff, these were principles and facts that Mr Goldsmith was well prepared for.
	



	
	Both parties also addressed me on the general principles relevant to adjournment of arguments. Mr Goldsmith submitted that the failure to comply related to only one set of orders, and that any prejudice to the defendants (noting these would essentially be Mr Konrad’s costs of coming to Australia) could compensate for any delay or inconvenience arising from the adjournment of the defendants’ applications. Mr Konrad submitted that the plaintiff had failed to comply with every single order that I had made on 24 March 2016, and that this failure should be seen against a background of similar conduct in the Supreme Court of New South Wales sufficiently serious to warrant the dismissal of his claim.
	
	
	As to the appropriateness of a costs order as compensation, in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australia National University [2009] HCA 27 (“Aon”) the Court warned that, where a party sought an adjournment, leave to amend or both, compensation in the form of costs is often not a sufficient solution:
	


“96. An important aspect of the approach taken by the plurality in J L Holdings was that it proceeded upon an assumption that a party should be permitted to amend to raise an arguable issue subject to the payment of costs occasioned by the amendment. So stated it suggests that a party has something approaching a right to an amendment. That is not the case. The ""right"" spoken of in Cropper v Smith needs to be understood in the context of that case and the Rule, which required amendment to permit the determination of a matter already in issue. It is more accurate to say that parties have the right to invoke the jurisdiction and the powers of the court in order to seek a resolution of their dispute. Subject to any rights to amend without leave given to the parties by the rules of court, the question of further amendment of a party's claim is dependent upon the exercise of the court's discretionary power.”


	
	Nor should the compensating of a party be sufficient, as the interests of the court should also be taken into account. The achievement of a just but timely and cost-effective resolution of a dispute has a flow-on effect upon the court and other litigants. In Sali v SPC Ltd [1993] HCA 47 Toohey and Gaudron JJ explained that case management reflected:
	


“[t]he view that the conduct of litigation is not merely a matter for the parties but is also one for the court and the need to avoid disruptions in the court's lists with consequent inconvenience to the court and prejudice to the interests of other litigants waiting to be heard ...”


	
	Finally, there is no explanation offered for the lateness of the application (cf Aon at [98] – [102]). Mr Goldsmith stated that “I cannot give any explanation to Your Honour as to why these orders were not complied with. He had no instructions about whether the plaintiff proposed to proceed with the application for interim orders.
	
	
	Individually, each of these problems would be troubling, and in total they are “very concerning” (to use McCallum J’s word in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at [25]) in terms of the likelihood that the plaintiff can conduct this litigation in an efficient manner. Taken as a whole, they paint a picture of a plaintiff who is just as likely to be unready on the next occasion as he is on this occasion.
	
	
	In those circumstances, no adjournment of this specially fixed argument should be granted, and I note these as my reasons for making that order and permitting the defendants to proceed with their applications.
	


Application for dismissal of proceedings under s 61 and 67 and UCPR Pt 12 r 12.7


	
	Mr Konrad relied upon the general statements of principle set out in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWSC 893, where McCallum J stated her reasons for dismissing Mr Kang’s earlier proceedings against both the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (“ABC”) and Mr Kang as follows:
	


“[22] The response required in the case of a “reluctant gladiator” referred to by Young AJ in Bi v Mourad must, a fortiori, be the response required in the case of a gladiator who has been less than frank both in seeking directions from the Court and in his explanation for his subsequent failure to comply with those very directions.

[23] Mr Goldsmith appears to have acted promptly at first to seek to have the proceedings relisted but, even then, the amended statement of claim was not served for a further month; was served only on one defendant and was served the day before the proceedings were in Court for the show cause hearing.

[24] The events I have recited are very concerning and give me no confidence that Mr Kang has any intention of complying with the duty imposed upon him by s 56. His affidavit sets out his determination “moving forward” to adhere to directions of the Court but there is no basis for accepting that assurance.

[25] In my view, the dictates of justice require that the proceedings now be dismissed.”


	
	These observations were accepted as correct in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWCA 375.
	
	
	Mr Goldsmith’s submissions were that the delay was extremely short, and related to only one order, which meant that no court would consider striking out the whole claim. He submitted that the delays in this case fell far short of the delays in his client’s Supreme Court case against the ABC and Mr Konrad.
	
	
	Is this correct? A comparison of the facts in this case to the plaintiff’s defamation claims against Mr Konrad and the ABC in the Supreme Court demonstrate the following:
	



	
	Late commencement of proceedings: In the Supreme Court, the plaintiff commenced proceedings against Mr Konrad and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on the last day of the limitation period for at least one of the publications. In these proceedings, Mr Goldsmith acknowledges that proceedings were commenced after the limitation period had expired and that the claim would have to be amended to remove the part which was now time-barred.
	
	
	Length of delay: Mr Goldsmith submitted that the period of delay and failure to comply was longer in the Supreme Court, in that the plaintiff was unready on what appear to have been three occasions before the proceedings were struck out, while there has only been one failure to comply in this court. However, analysis of the directions hearings in the Supreme Court reveals that the proceedings were stood over on the first return date because the claim had not been served and on the second date because the plaintiff failed to appear. The period of delay, in those circumstances, is only superficially more in the Supreme Court.
	
	
	Seriousness of non-compliance Mr Goldsmith submitted that the conduct of the proceedings in the Supreme Court was much more serious, in that there were failures to serve, a failure by the plaintiff on one occasion to appear, a failure to provide amended pleadings and a generally unacceptable level of conduct of litigation. Mr Konrad submits, however, that the delay in these proceedings is much more serious, in that the plaintiff failed to comply with every order I made (even in relation to the filing of a Notice of Address for the solicitors), came to a specially fixed hearing seeking an adjournment at the last minute, provided a hopelessly drafted and time-barred statement of claim, and sent an abusive reply to the defendants when served with their submissions.
	



	
	Taking the above into account, I am satisfied that the delay by the plaintiff in these proceedings is at least comparable to his delay in the Supreme Court proceedings.
	
	
	One aspect of the delay, however, puts this application into a special category, namely that the plaintiff had already suffered the loss of other claims against Mr Konrad by reason of delay, yet displays exactly the same disregard of his obligations to the defendants and to the court in these proceedings. In other words, McCallum J’s lack of confidence in the plaintiff complying with the obligations placed on him by s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) is entirely justified.
	
	
	In Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at [18], Basten JA noted the discussion of the relevant principles to apply in a series of recent judgments of that court, and in particular Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 334. His Honour also noted (at [17]) that the dismissal of proceedings is a remedy of last resort and an extreme measure. I expressly recognise this consideration and respectfully adopt the approach to these issues taken by the Court of Appeal.
	
	
	What puts this case into the category of proceedings which should be struck out are, in my view, the circumstances in which the plaintiff has shown the same disregard for the defendants and for this court that he showed to the Supreme Court. This point was made very simply, but powerfully, by Mr Konrad, when he opened his submissions by referring to the need for there to be “respect for the court” as well as for opponents. He submitted that the whole of the plaintiff’s conduct was in contravention not only of court rules (even such simple requirements as filing a Notice of Appearance) but of the rules of politeness for dealing with opponents in litigation. That rule was broken when the plaintiff responded to the defendants’ written submissions, not with their own submissions, but with the plaintiff’s angry threat of further litigation (an email which Mr Konrad pointed out was also sent by the plaintiff to Mr Goldsmith, whether Mr Goldsmith was retained or not).
	
	
	These observations, coming from a member of the community rather than a legal representative, are all the more commanding of attention, as well as being a timely reminder of the role that courts play in our community in providing dispute resolution which is “just, cheap and quick”.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, on the exceptional facts in these proceedings, the very high test for the dismissal of proceedings is made out. Accordingly, the proceedings are dismissed with a special costs order to reflect the fact that the defendants, who are litigants in person, are entitled only to disbursements of a limited nature.
	


Application for leave under s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)


	
	Section 23 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides:
	


“If a person has brought defamation proceedings for damages (whether in this jurisdiction or elsewhere) against any person in relation to the publication of any matter, the person cannot bring further defamation proceedings for damages against the same defendant in relation to the same or any other publication of the same or like matter, except with the leave of the court in which the further proceedings are to be brought.”


	
	There is no doubt that the present proceedings relate to “the same publication of the same matter”, namely the tenth matter complained of in the Supreme Court “Amended Statement of Claim” which is attached to the defendants’ written submissions (Exhibit A). The question is whether, on the revised facts as asserted by Mr Goldsmith, the plaintiff’s failed application before McCallum J to amend the statement of claim and sue on these proceedings amounts to having “brought” proceedings against the defendants.
	
	
	In Carey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2010) 77 NSWLR 136, McCallum J noted the acknowledgement of senior counsel for the plaintiff that the commencement of proceedings which were never served amounted to proceedings having been “brought”. However, that is a very different fact scenario to the present, if Mr Goldsmith’s contention that the application to amend was refused without the claim actually ever being filed.
	
	
	What was the status of Mr Konrad and his company in the proceedings commenced by Mr Kang against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation? An analysis of McCallum J’s judgment shows:
	



	
	Mr Konrad was both the second defendant (at [1]) and the respondent to the appeal in the Court of Appeal, and I note confirmation of this from the contents of the original statement of claim as set out in Exhibit A. Immigration News was not, however, a defendant.
	
	
	Mr Konrad was present on the two relevant occasions when the Supreme Court orders were made and he was given a copy of the amended statement of claim by Ms Chou, a solicitor employed by Mr Goldsmith. McCallum J adds (at [9]):
	


“At the time of handing that document to him, according to Mr Konrad’s uncontested affidavit, she said, “We didn't provide you with a copy as we didn't expect you to be here today.” In any event Mr Konrad was, in due course, afforded an opportunity to consider that document, since the show cause hearing did not proceed until a later date.”


	
	The version of the amended statement of claim provided by Mr Konrad includes the matter complained of in these proceedings as the tenth matter complained of in those proceedings.
	



	
	Analysis of the Court of Appeal’s summary of the facts confirms that “an amended statement of claim was served on the first respondent the day before the directions hearing on 10 April 2015” and that “a copy was given to the second respondent, Mr Konrad” (at [5]). I note that Mr Konrad attaches page 326 of the White Book in support of his claim that this was the amended statement of claim filed by the plaintiff.
	
	
	Proceeding on the facts as claimed by Mr Goldsmith, namely that a claim on this publication was proposed but not permitted, is that sufficient for the court to regard the claim as being “brought”?
	
	
	The answer, in my view, lies in the entitlement to costs of a party who appears in such an application. If a party has an entitlement to a costs order in relation to a claim before the court, on the basis that the non-party is the “effective litigant” Knight v F P Special Assets Ltd (1992) 174 CLR 178 at 188), then that claim may be taken to have been “brought”. Mr Konrad was already a party to the proceedings, and he was fighting against the addition of the claim the subject of these proceedings being “brought” against him.
	
	
	The situation of the first defendant is considerably more difficult, in that while it is a joint tortfeasor, it was not a party to the proceedings “brought” in the Supreme Court. I was not addressed on this issue by either party.
	
	
	Those findings are made on the basis of the facts being as stated by Mr Goldsmith. If the fact scenario is as claimed by Mr Konrad, namely that the statement of claim he attaches to his submissions was in fact filed, then there can be no doubt that leave would be required under s 23, as Mr Goldsmith conceded, at least in relation to himself.
	
	
	The purpose of s 23, Mr Konrad submitted, was to prevent abuse of process, and the exercise of discretion to grant leave under s 23 should be viewed in this regard. He urged me to approach the exercise of that discretion in the same way as McCallum J had done in Carey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, although conceding that the factors to take into account where proceedings were already commenced were not argued before the Court of Appeal (at [47] per Beazley JA) and that her Honour’s view that leave could not be granted nunc pro tunc had been rejected on appeal.
	
	
	The circumstances in which Mr Goldsmith effectively conceded this point before me but after argument was concluded changed his position makes my position in determining the matter difficult, particularly since the defendants are self-represented, and may not have appreciated the significance of his change of position.
	
	
	As I am of the view that the proceedings should be dismissed for other reasons, I shall simply note that, if the circumstances in which the matter complained of in these proceedings came before the Supreme Court as proceedings “brought” in that court and an application under s 23 would have to be brought, I would not grant leave under s 23 Defamation Act 2005. My reasons for refusing leave would take into account the hopelessness of the pleading of the statement of claim, the obvious limitation problems and the plaintiff’s unacceptable conduct of these proceedings to date. I would have to hear submissions in relation to the first defendant before coming to any conclusion as to its entitlement to rely upon failure to seek leave under s 23.
	


Limitation issues


	
	Mr Goldsmith concedes that the statement of claim is self-evidently out of time, but argues that it is capable of amendment. He pointed to several features of the printed copy of the newsletter which appeared to suggest it was electronically searchable (such as the reference to archives which can be searched), and he may be correct, but in the absence of evidence I decline to speculate.
	
	
	The issue of whether this is an electronic publication capable of being downloaded and searched is thus not possible to determine given the inadequacy of the pleading and absence of evidence. That is an unsatisfactory position where the defendants have filed a defence reliant upon the limitation provisions, and bring an application for dismissal on the basis that the claim is time-barred, where the plaintiff has failed to comply with a timetable to file evidence in reply. A party who conducts proceedings in this way may be confined to the limitations of the case so presented: Nau v Kemp (2010) 77 NSWLR 687 at [7].
	
	
	In its present form, the pleading is liable to be struck out because there is no evidence of publication within the limitation period. It is not simply that the claim is out of time on its face, but because there is no evidence of downloading. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the proceedings are time-barred and should be struck out.
	


Orders


	
	Statement of claim struck out and dismissed.
	
	
	Plaintiff pays such of the defendants’ costs and disbursements as they are entitled to as litigants in person.

EDDIE KANG ARRESTED

Eddie Kang was arrested today on Fraud charges under the Crimes Act and Misleading Conduct under Australian Consumer Law. He has been bailed to appear in court on the 20th March. View the news of this on Channel 7.

As readers of IMMIGRATIONews know it has been a long time coming for any action to be taken against Kang.

The Department of Fair Trading has done what the Department of Immigration could not and what the NSW Police thought was all too hard to tackle.

The Principle Investigator at Fair Trading and has been working on gathering evidence to charge Kang for a number of months. We understand that he has put off taking annual leave until the task force had secured Kang's arrest.

Congratulations to Fair Trading for making something happen where many of Kang's victims had given up hope Eddie Kang would ever be stopped.

KANG the ILLUSIONIST



IMMIGRATIONews have been investigating Kang now for nearly 2 years. It wasn't until we sent someone to Singapore to visit the office of Singapore Oil, one of Kang's companies, that we discovered it was just a rented postal address. From that moment on we knew what type of person Kang was. He is a master of illusion, setting up impressive web sites of large companies that don't really exist, except on paper. He has allegedly used this skill to trick hundreds of innocent job seekers out of millions of dollars.

I have had numerous meeting with the Immigration Department and NSW Police on what they planned to do about Eddie Kang.

The NSW Police gave up and left it to the DIBP to do something about him but in the end they failed.

Seven News has informed me that Kang is associated with around 800 visa refusals. That must be some kind of record. Initially the DIBP told me the number was 200. It goes to show he has been busy in the last 18 months.

I calculated based on this number that would mean the DIBP has pocketed an estimated 8 Million dollars from Kang's organised doomed applications. Knowing they would refuse any application associated with Kang, the DIBP were happy to take the money anyway.

DIBP going [sic] to return all of that money to visa applicants Kang allegedly defrauded?

As Kang goes to court next month no doubt more information will come to light regarding the manner in which he operated.

		13 May 2016",2016-05-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769342,Application by Darush Majid pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2016] NSWSC 561,"DECISION


	
	This is an application made pursuant to Part 7 Division 3 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (a ""Part 7 application"") for an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon Darush Majid (""the applicant"").
	
	
	What is sought is a referral of the whole of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal in order for it to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Such a course is authorised by s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act but, pursuant to s 79(2), only ""if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"". This extends to a ""doubt or question"" as to the sentence passed: Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; 85 NSWLR 783 at 791-792 [28]-[32].
	
	
	The applicant was found by a jury to be guilty of three offences against the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He was sentenced in the District Court by Puckeridge QC DCJ on 18 December 2008 to a total of 14 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months. He appealed and was resentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 11 June 2010: Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 to a total of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months.
	
	
	The offences and the original sentences were as follows:
	


Count 1 - Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (s 61J(1) - maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years; standard non-parole period of 10 years).

12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 13 April 2008.

Count 2 - Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (s 61J(1)).

14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years commencing 13 October 2008.

Count 3 - Detain for advantage (s 86(1)(b) - maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years).

8 years with no non-parole period commencing 13 October 2008.


	
	The total effective sentence was 14 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months from 13 April 2008.
	


Sentencing in the District Court


	
	The sentencing remarks of Puckeridge QC DCJ may be summarised:
	


His Honour noted some procedural history; the offences; and the evidence relating to each of the offences. (ROS 1-5)

His Honour referred to some procedural aspects of the sentencing proceedings. (ROS 5)

His Honour summarised some evidence by and about the applicant. (ROS 6-10).

His Honour referred to matters relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. (ROS 10-11). These were:

The nature of the sexual penetration.

The applicant was in a position of authority.

The victim was in a vulnerable position.

Substantial emotional harm was inflicted.

His Honour referred to some subjective mitigating features. (ROS 11- 12) These were:

Remorse the applicant ""has now expressed"". He now ""accepts responsibility for his actions and for the wrong which he has committed on the victim"".

The applicant's background and events which had occurred in his past life as well as ""the evidence and history which he gave to [the author of a psychological report].

The offence in count 1 was opportunistic; it did not have the same calculation and planning as the events with which counts 2 and 3 were concerned. (ROS 12)

The offences in counts 1 and 2 carried a standard non-parole period of 10 years. Submissions were made as to their relative seriousness. Having regard to the matters previously addressed and with the absence of planning, the offence in count 1 ""does not fall within the mid-range but [is] not significantly below it"". An appropriate sentence would be 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. (ROS 12) His Honour proceeded to say:

""I have taken into account the background of the offender and taken into account the effect of what he observed and saw in the turmoil in Afghanistan and the effect of what occurred when a bomb went off in the vicinity of his home. Having taken that into account, I do not consider that there should be any further discount in respect of that non-parole period of 9 years."" (ROS 12-13)

The offence in count 2 was of a more calculated nature. ""I consider that in the circumstances of that offence a standard non-parole period should apply. The sentence in relation to that offence will be a period of imprisonment of fourteen years with a non-parole period of ten."" (ROS 13)

Taken into account in relation to the offence in count 3 were the vulnerable position of the victim and the purpose of the detention being to obtain an advantage by way of sexual gratification. A period of imprisonment for 8 years is appropriate. Having regard to the non-parole periods for counts 1 and 2, no non-parole period for the count 3 offence was imposed. (ROS 13)

The sentences for count 2 and 3 would be concurrent, but accumulated upon the sentence for count 1. (ROS 13)

After a discussion about backdating, his Honour proceeded to formally pronounce the sentences. The sentences for counts 2 and 3 were specified to commence 6 months after the commencement of the sentence for count 1. (ROS 13-14)


	
	The Crown Prosecutor raised with his Honour the fact that he had not made a finding of special circumstances in connection with his imposition of a parole period on count 2 that exceeded one-third of the non-parole period: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In the discussion which ensued it is clear that his Honour had intended to impose a total effective sentence of 14 years for all of the offences, whereby the non-parole period would be 10 years 6 months, precisely three-quarters of the total term. The Crown Prosecutor took it as an indication that special circumstances were found on the basis of accumulation of sentences. However, the effect of the individual sentences was that the total effective sentence was one of 14 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months.
	


The appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	There were five grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to express the sentences in accordance with s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in that, when sentencing for Count 2, his Honour set a total sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years, contrary to s.44(2), and with no finding of “special circumstances” for the extension of the total sentence by approximately eight months.

Ground 2 - his Honour gave insufficient weight to the fact that the Applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at the time of, prior to and after the commission of these offences.

Ground 3 - his Honour gave insufficient weight to the Applicant’s expression of contrition and remorse.

Ground 4 - his Honour gave insufficient weight to the fact that the Applicant would be serving his sentence in protective custody.

Ground 5 - the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.


	
	Ground 1 was upheld. It is appropriate to set out in full what was said about it by Johnson J (with whom Simpson J (as her Honour then was) and McCallum J agreed):
	


""[31] The Applicant was sentenced for two offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, each of which carried a standard non-parole period of 10 years. For Count 1, a term of imprisonment of 12 years was imposed with a non-parole period of nine years. With respect to the second count, the sentencing Judge determined to fix a term of imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. The sentence for the second count was partially accumulated, with a direction that it commence six months after the commencement of the sentence for the first count.

[32] With respect to the first count, his Honour found that the offence did not fall within the mid-range but was not significantly below it (ROS12.7). With respect to the second count, his Honour found that it was one to which the standard non-parole period of 10 years should apply (ROS13.2). Accordingly, the sentencing Judge found that the second count lay within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.

Submissions 

[33] Mr Dawe QC, for the Applicant, submits that the sentence imposed for the second count did not comply with the requirements of s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was submitted that no finding of “special circumstances” was made so that, if his Honour intended to fix a non-parole period of 10 years on the second count, to comply with s.44(2), the balance of term ought to have been three years and four months and not four years.

[34] The Crown acknowledged that a mathematical error appeared to have resulted in the manner complained of. Although his Honour appeared to have failed to comply strictly with the requirements of s.44, the Crown submitted that it did not follow that the error would necessarily require the intervention of this Court: Itaoui v R [1005] NSWCCA 415; 158 A Crim R 233 at 237-238 [17]-[18]. In any event, the Crown submitted that any adjustment should affect the head sentence only and not the non-parole period with respect to the second count.

Decision

[35] The problem identified under this ground arises from the sentencing Judge’s non-compliance with s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Court is first required by s.44(1) to set a non-parole period for the sentence with the balance of term to be calculated by reference to s.44(2) of the Act. If his Honour had followed the section, then the balance of term would flow from the formula in s.44(2) given the absence of a finding of “special circumstances”. This formula would have seen a balance of term of three years and four months.

[36] From a discussion which ensued between the sentencing Judge and the Crown after sentences were pronounced, it seems clear that his Honour was looking at the total picture, and not the precise sentence being passed on the second count. However, no finding of “special circumstances” had been made. His Honour did not purport to apply the practice recognised in Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [35]-[36].

[37] In the circumstances of the present case, error has been demonstrated in the calculation of the head sentence on the second count. This is not a mere technical error flowing from the announcement of sentence in a form which did not comply with s.44. To give effect to s.44 and the sentencing Judge’s intention, the sentence to be fixed for Count 2 ought to have comprised a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of three years and four months. I will return to this issue after considering the other grounds of appeal.""


	
	Ground 2 (insufficient weight to post-traumatic stress disorder) was rejected on the basis that ""it is difficult to see how the applicant's condition could have warranted greater weight on sentence in the circumstances of this case"": Johnson J at [42].
	
	
	Ground 3 (insufficient weight to expressions of contrition and remorse) was rejected on the basis that ""no error has been demonstrated in the way in which the sentencing judge had regard to the very late expression of contrition and remorse by the applicant"": Johnson J at [51].
	
	
	Ground 4 (insufficient weight to protective custody) was rejected, essentially on the basis of there being a lack of evidence of the circumstances pertaining to the applicant's experience in protective custody: Johnson J at [56]-[59].
	
	
	Ground 5 (manifest excess) was rejected because it had not been demonstrated that the sentences were unreasonable or plainly unjust (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]). It is useful to note the reasoning in the judgment of Johnson J:
	


""[63] The Applicant, then aged 25 years, committed separate and serious sexual assault offences upon a 15-year old girl. Having regard to the employment relationship between the Applicant and the victim, the offences constituted a breach of trust on the part of the Applicant. The Applicant used force and penile/vaginal intercourse took place on both occasions. The standard non-parole period had direct application to this case as the Applicant was convicted after trial. The sentencing Judge assessed the first sexual assault offence as not falling within the mid-range but not being significantly below it, and the second sexual assault offence was assessed as lying within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, so as to attract application of the standard non-parole period. These assessments with respect to objective seriousness were not challenged in any ground of appeal.

[64] The second offence involved a repeated sexual assault offence against the victim committed about a month after the first offence. Both were serious offences involving the taking of the victim to an isolated place so that the Applicant could use her, without her consent, for his own sexual purposes.

[65] The Applicant’s criminal history revealed a range of offences for which non-custodial sentences had been passed. It may be inferred that the Applicant’s troubled and traumatic childhood in Afghanistan had been taken into account in his favour on sentence on more than one occasion. However, by December 2006, the Applicant had been living in Australia for 13 years and had been raised and educated here and was in gainful employment.

[66] The application and operation of the standard non-parole period provisions to the sentencing of the Applicant assist an understanding of the length of the sentences imposed. It has not been demonstrated that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust."" (Emphasis added)


	
	The success of Ground 1 of the appeal necessitated the Court resentencing the applicant. The judgment of Johnson J dealt with that issue as follows:
	


""[68] No error has been demonstrated by reference to any of the grounds of appeal, apart from the error referred to in the first ground of appeal. This Court should intervene only to the extent necessary to correct the error found under the first ground of appeal. In light of the findings of the sentencing Judge, I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in the form of a balance of term of three years and four months instead of four years. However, I am satisfied that no lesser non-parole period than one of imprisonment for 10 years is warranted with respect to the second count.

[69] I propose the following orders:

(a) leave to appeal against sentence granted;

(b) sentence of imprisonment on the second count is quashed and, in its place, the Applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 13 October 2008 and expiring on 12 October 2018 with a balance of term of three years and four months commencing on 13 October 2018 and expiring on 12 February 2022;

(c) appeal dismissed with respect to sentences imposed on Counts 1 and 3.

[70] The earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole remains 12 October 2018."" (Emphasis added)


	
	In summary, it is apparent that the Court of Criminal Appeal resentenced on the basis confined to correcting an obviously unintended mathematical error by the primary judge. No other error by the sentencing judge had been established. The Court did not engage in a complete re-exercise of the sentencing discretion. It is also at least arguable that both the primary judge and the Court considered that the prescribed standard non-parole period for the offence in counts 1 and 2 had determinative significance once the relative level of objective seriousness of the offence in those counts had been assessed. A two-staged approach to the assessment of sentence is also arguably evident, at least in the judgment of the primary judge perhaps implicitly endorsed by the Court.
	
	
	In the foregoing I have couched my language guardedly (""arguable"") because it is not my function to make a determination of whether error occurred. My function is to determine whether there ""appears"" to be a doubt or question as to the sentence.
	


Muldrock v The Queen


	
	Subsequent to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment, on 5 October 2011 the High Court gave judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. It held that previous authority in the Court of Criminal Appeal for the manner in which sentencing is to proceed for an offence for which there is prescribed a standard non-parole period (R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168) was wrongly decided. It was held, inter alia, that it was wrong to give the standard non-parole period determinative significance; to adopt a two-staged approach to sentencing; and to take into account subjective circumstances in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.
	


First Part 7 Application


	
	The applicant subsequently made his first Part 7 application based upon an assertion that there had been ""Muldrock-error"" both at first instance and in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The application was determined by Bellew J on 3 June 2014: Application by Darush Majid pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 709. His Honour's reasons for refusing the application were as follows:
	


""[20] In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded at [25] that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being framed in mandatory terms which required the court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range. The Court also concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period and held that the correct approach was to identify all relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.

[21] Further (at [28]) the Court specifically rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which is longer or shorter than that prescribed.

[22] In arriving at these conclusions, the court held that the decision in Way (supra) was incorrect.

[23] In my view, there is nothing within the remarks of the sentencing judge in the present case which would indicate that he gave primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole period, or that he engaged in a two-stage approach to sentencing. As I have outlined, his Honour spent some considerable time identifying the entirety of the aggravating and mitigating factors before arriving at what he considered to be an appropriate sentence. Indeed, his Honour (at ROS 17) expressly noted that he had balanced all of the matters to which he had previously referred in arriving at a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence.

[24] In support of the submission that error was demonstrated in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the applicant placed some considerable reliance upon the decision in Achurch (No 2) (supra). In particular, the applicant drew attention to the fact that in that case, an observation as to the direct applicability of the standard non-parole period had also been made at the time of the sentence being imposed. It was submitted, in effect, that because the Court of Criminal Appeal had found error in that case, the same conclusion should be reached in the case of the applicant.

[25] I am unable to accept that submission. It reflects an approach which disregards those authorities which make it clear that when determining whether or not there has been a Muldrock-type error, the entirety of the judgment in question must be considered. An approach which has, as its focus, an isolated passage or statement is an erroneous one (see for example Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265).

[26] In my view, when the judgment of Johnson J is read as a whole it becomes evident that the entirety of the circumstances were taken into account in reaching the conclusion that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were not manifestly excessive. There is nothing in the Court's judgment which would indicate that the standard non-parole period was used in a determinative (and thus impermissible) way, or that a two-stage process of sentencing was undertaken.

Conclusion

[27] For the reasons set out above I am not persuaded that there was any Muldrock-type error, either when the applicant was sentenced or when he was subsequently dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal.

[28] Accordingly I do not entertain any doubt or question as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance in the applicant's case.""

Kentwell v The Queen


	
	Subsequent to Bellew J's determination, on 9 October 2014 the High Court gave judgment in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601. It held (in part):
	


""[42] … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

[43] After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.""

Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales


	
	On 31 July 2015 the Court of Appeal gave judgment in Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 221. It made clear that the issue for a judge determining (administratively) a Part 7 application was concerned with whether there ""appears"" to be a doubt or question on a relevant matter; not whether there is in fact such a doubt or question: see Beazley P and Leeming JA at [16].
	


The present application


	
	The present Part 7 Application was made after the decision in Kentwell v The Queen whereas the determination of the first Part 7 Application was made before it. ""Kentwell error"" is now relied upon as part of the basis upon which it is said there appears to be a doubt or question as to the applicant's sentence. For this reason it is appropriate for the application to be considered and determined, notwithstanding there has been a previous application (see s 79(3)(a)(ii)).
	
	
	The application was filed on 27 January 2016. A copy was sent to the Attorney General and to the Crown Solicitor's Office the following day. Submissions on behalf of the Attorney General were filed on 3 March 2016. A copy of the latter was provided to the applicant's solicitor. Further written submissions in support of the application were filed on 23 March 2016.
	


Applicant's submissions


	
	Written submissions in support of the application made plain from the beginning that its basis is that ""there is the appearance of a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the applicant's case. The applicant may have been erroneously sentenced in two respects, first contrary to Kentwell v The Queen … and second, in accordance with sentencing principles held by the High Court to be incorrect in Muldrock v The Queen”.
	
	
	The submissions by counsel for the Attorney General concede Kentwell-error but dispute Muldrock-error. No specific submissions were made in relation to the latter in the light of the former. However, it was also said that “it would be open to the judge considering this application to form the subjective view that it ‘appears’ to him or her that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the applicant’s case, namely whether his sentence was infected by Muldrock error.
	


Asserted error in the determination of the first Part 7 application


	
	Having regard to the view I have formed it is unnecessary to review all of the submissions that were made on the applicant’s behalf (which were extensive). One matter that does warrant comment is the assertion (at [10]-[11] of the submissions) that Bellew J, in determining the first Part 7 application, applied a test that was contrary to what was subsequently held in Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales by saying that he was “not persuaded that there was any Muldrock-type error”.
	
	
	I do not accept that criticism as valid. As I read his Honour’s reasons, he was saying that he did not perceive any error; in other words, it did not “appear” to him that there was any such error. Moreover, his Honour was not considering the matter in the absence of some later elucidation of the legislation. The legislation is clear in its terms in that s 79(2) explicitly states that the question is one of whether “it appears there is a doubt or question”.
	
	
	As the determination of the present application does not turn on the correctness or otherwise of the determination by Bellew J of the first application there is no need to say anything more about it.
	


Asserted Kentwell-error in the Court of Criminal Appeal’s resentencing


	
	It was submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in adopting an approach to resentencing that was confined to the identified error. The submissions quoted the passage from Kentwell v The Queen at [42]-[43] that I have earlier set out.
	
	
	The submissions also cited the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in Liles v R (Cth) [2014] NSWCCA 289 in which his Honour said (at [55]):
	


“As was made clear in Kentwell v R the re-exercise of the sentence discretion by the court does not simply involve an adoption of findings already made by the sentencing judge. It involves a genuine re-exercise of the discretion which extends to all matters relevant to sentencing …”.


	
	It was argued that because the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the primary judge’s error was not “a mere technical error” it did not fall within the category of errors that do not vitiate the sentencing discretion envisaged in Kentwell v The Queen at [42]. Accordingly, it was contended, it became the duty of the Court to completely exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. As illustrative of the asserted failure of the Court to do this, reference was made to there having been an affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor read at the hearing of the appeal which contained material relating to the applicant’s good conduct in custody since sentencing. No reference was made to this in the Court’s judgment.
	
	
	In my view there is a very real question about whether the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen was speaking about the approach to resentencing in every possible situation in which the sentencing discretion of the primary judge is found to have been vitiated. The case before it, and the case of Liles v R (Cth) to which the applicant referred (and Youssef v R [2014] NSWCCA 285 to which the Attorney General referred), were concerned with errors that had a potential impact upon the entire sentence. There are cases in which the only error for which an appellant contends, or the only error upheld on appeal, concerns some discrete component of the sentence that could have no bearing upon the entire sentence.
	
	
	I have written in draft in a judgment presently reserved before the Court of Criminal Appeal the following “observations” which I am prepared to adopt for present purposes to illustrate the point just made:
	


""Observations about what Kentwell v The Queen requires

The plurality judgment in Kentwell v The Queen includes (at [40]-[42]) a discussion of the differing views expressed by the members of this Court in Baxter v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284. It held that the analysis of Spigelman CJ should be accepted. The judgment continued with the following explanation (in [42]):

""When a judge acts upon a wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration [House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505], the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing [s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Act""] and the factors that the Sentencing Act [s 21A] and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be 'warranted in law'. A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not 'warranted in law' unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence.""

Importantly for present purposes, the judgment immediately continues:

""This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.""

An example was then provided of a sentence being affected by ""legal error"" by specifying the non-parole and parole periods in a sequence that is contrary to that mandated by the legislation. Such an error, without more, ""does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion"". This indicates to me that it was not held that any error in sentencing requires a fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion. Arguably, it was held that only an error that potentially had an effect on the sentencing outcome that invokes that requirement. Put another way, it is what has been held to have been affected by House v The King error that should be the subject of the ""fresh exercise"".

Some errors potentially affect the entire sentencing outcome. The error in Kentwell v The Queen was of that type and it is understandable that in such a case the entire sentencing discretion must be re-exercised. But some errors only affect a discrete component of the outcome: for example, the commencement date of the sentence; the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period; or the extent of the discount for a plea of guilty or assistance to authorities. If an error of that limited type is all that is the subject of complaint on appeal, or is the only error in respect of which an appellant is successful in establishing, it seems illogical that the Court is nevertheless required to re-determine the sentence in its entirety.

In the present case the only error found in the sentencing of the applicant was a failure to give appropriate effect to the finding of special circumstances. No error in the assessment of the overall sentence has been found. In these circumstances it can be said that there has been no House v The King error that is held to have vitiated the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion in the assessment of the overall term of the sentence. In such circumstances, why then should this Court do more than exercise afresh the sentencing discretion in so far as it concerns the setting of the non-parole component? Kentwell v The Queen is silent on this point as it was concerned with error that affected the entire sentence rather than a discrete component of it.

There are even more stark examples that come to mind where, in my view, it would be illogical for this Court to engage in a fresh exercise of the entire sentencing discretion. Say, for example, the sole complaint on appeal was that a judge failed to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody by backdating the sentence. Or, perhaps the judge, contrary to s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), post-dated the commencement of a sentence because the offender was serving an existing sentence but for which the non-parole period had expired.

Examples of this Court's application of Kentwell v The Queen

The approach this Court has taken thus far when responding to an error that affected only a component of a sentence sometimes has been to re-exercise the entire sentencing discretion afresh because it has been understood that Kentwell v The Queen requires it to do so.

In MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 the only ground of appeal was concerned with a sentence that failed to give effect to a finding of special circumstances because of a mathematical error. Gleeson JA (Johnson and Hall JJ agreeing) engaged in a thorough analysis of all factors bearing upon the total term of the sentence as well as the non-parole period before determining to impose the same overall term but with a reduced non-parole period.

The Court also expressed itself as having to re-exercise the sentencing discretion in other cases where the identified error was confined to the non-parole component: Hutchen v R [2015] NSWCCA 101 at [44] (Hoeben CJ at CL, Adams and McCallum JJ agreeing) (the head sentence was maintained but the non-parole period reduced) and Wakeling v R [2016] NSWCCA 33 at [58]) (the applicant conceded that no variation of the head sentence was required so the focus was upon the non-parole period).

In Arsiotis v R [2015] NSWCCA 275 the sentencing judge was found to have made a mathematical error in calculating the reduction of the sentence on account of the offender's plea of guilty. (The judge allowed a 25 per cent discount but reduced a 24 month sentence to 20 instead of 18 months.) This was the sole ground of appeal. But rather than merely correcting the error the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ agreeing, at [8]) considered it ""necessary for this Court to independently exercise its sentencing discretion"". In the result, the same starting point was adopted but an 18 month term of imprisonment was imposed with a proportional reduction in the recognisance release order.

In Marrow v R [2015] NSWCCA 282 the only error was that the sentencing judge allowed a 20 per cent reduction for an early plea of guilty which was held to have warranted a 25 per cent reduction. There was a complete re-exercise of the sentencing discretion in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen which resulted in a lower starting point being adopted and hence a lesser effective sentence being imposed.

In Alpha v R [2015] NSWCCA 225, with the agreement of Leeming JA and Price J, I expressed doubt about whether a complete re-exercise of the sentencing discretion was required where the sole issue was a mathematical error in reducing a sentence on account of an offender's plea of guilty and assistance to authorities:

""[53] The submissions for the Crown pointed out that where an arithmetical error is the sole basis of this Court's intervention in a sentencing appeal such intervention has been confined to simple correction. Burns v R [2008] NSWCCA 260 at [34], [37] and Young v R [2007] NSWCCA 114 at [26]-[28] were provided as examples. However, the Crown submitted that after Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 it seems necessary for the Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. I am not sure that this will always be necessary; it seems to me that it would depend upon the nature of the error. However, in the present case I am prepared to carry out the task.

A more confined approach was taken in O'Connell v R [2016] NSWCCA 43. The sole complaint was that a finding of special circumstances was not reflected in the total effective sentence where individual sentences had been partially accumulated. The Crown contended that there was no principled basis for special circumstances to have been found. Fullerton J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) said (at [29]):

""Since the appeal is limited to the question whether the sentencing judge erred in failing to adjust the non-parole period in accordance with his conclusion that special circumstances warranted such an adjustment pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is not necessary for this Court to consider whether the non-parole period and the additional term, taken together, were affected by an error of law. The only question for this Court was the propriety of the proportion of the sentence constituted by the non-parole period. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court, in accordance with the principles in Kentwell v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 96, to independently consider the application of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to the applicant’s sentence and, in substance, if a lesser non-parole period should have been imposed, quash the sentence and pass the appropriately adjusted sentence.""

Similarly, in Carroll v R [2015] NSWCCA 219 the only error identified was concerned with the application of the totality principle in sentencing for multiple offences. The Court (McCallum J; Hoeben CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) stated (at [40]) that “in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37, it is necessary to re-sentence the applicant”. However, that exercise was confined to re-determining the degree of concurrence/accumulation of the sentences and followed a concession by Mr Game SC on behalf of the appellant that “it would not be inconsistent with the principles stated in Kentwell to preserve the terms of sentence determined by the sentencing judge”. There is nothing to indicate that the concession was based upon what Kentwell v The Queen requires and I suspect it was a practical one based upon the facts of the particular case.

Daniels v R [2016] NSWCCA 35 involved a sentencing judge purporting to make a parole order with conditions in the context of imposing a sentence of 4 years 6 months when the making of a parole order and imposing conditions is only permitted in the case of sentences not exceeding 3 years (per ss 50 and 51 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). A question was raised as to whether the error should nonetheless be characterised as a sentencing error invoking the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and thereby requiring the Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen.

Fullerton J (Hoeben CJ at CL and RS Hulme AJ agreeing) referred to the passage of the plurality judgment in Kentwell v The Queen at [42] that I have quoted above. She then said (at [28]-[29]):

""In my view, the error in the sentencing exercise the subject of the second ground of appeal is an example of an error of the kind to which the High Court in Kentwell was referring. ['That is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.'] After setting aside the parole condition (it being of no legal effect being made beyond power), the sentencing judge's appointment of a non-parole period of 3 years as the minimum period the applicant is to spend in custody is unaffected. …

I do not regard the error in imposing a parole condition as part of the sentencing order as vitiating the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion in this case. I would order that the parole condition be set aside but I would not move to re-sentence the applicant.""

RS Hulme AJ added (at [61]):

""Furthermore, while fully conscious of the decision of the High Court in Kentwell v R to which Fullerton J has referred, I am satisfied that in no way was any other aspect of the sentence affected adversely to the Applicant by his Honour's unauthorised imposition of a parole condition.""

Viewed broadly, the approach taken in Daniels v R is consistent with confining the fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion to where an error has had potential impact upon the actual sentence imposed. In that case, the error was regarded as having had no potential impact at all.

Conclusion 

The purpose of my engaging in this analysis is to make the general observation that there is, in my view, a persuasive argument in favour of this Court regarding Kentwell v The Queen as requiring a fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion in relation to the whole sentence when the sentencing discretion in relation to the whole of it is vitiated by error. Where there is error that does not entail vitiation of the entire sentencing discretion, but is an error that only affects a discrete component of the sentence that could have no potential bearing on the whole, the discretion should be re-exercised but only in relation to that particular component. ""


	
	As indicated there, the point has not been the subject of any considered decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. So, for the purposes of this application, it has to be said that there “appears” to be question or doubt as to whether the Court of Criminal Appeal, in determining the applicant’s appeal in 2010, proceeded to resentence in a fashion that was contrary to what was subsequently held by Kentwell v The Queen to be necessary.
	


Asserted Muldrock-error


	
	With great respect to Bellew J, I am satisfied that there appears to have been “Muldrock-error” in the approach by the primary judge to sentencing. It is evident from the following passage that he gave the standard non-parole period determinative significance.
	


“It had been put on behalf of the offender that the offence on 7 December 2006 (count 1) was not in the mid range of objective seriousness. The offence subject of the first count and the offence the subject of the second count carries a standard non-parole period of ten years. It is in relation to that standard non-parole period that the court was addressed as to whether the offence fell in the mid range of seriousness or not. I accept in relation to the offence on 7 December 2006, balancing those matters which I have previously considered and with the absence of calculated planning by the offender, that it does not fall within the mid range but not significantly below it. The offender took advantage of a young person and ought to have known better. I would consider that the appropriate sentence in relation to the first count would be a period of imprisonment of twelve years and a non-parole period of nine years.

I have taken into account the background of the offender and taken into account the effect of what he observed and saw in the turmoil in Afghanistan and the effect of what occurred when a bomb went off in the vicinity of his home. Having taken that into account, I do not consider that there should be any further discount in respect of that non-parole period of nine years.

In respect of the second count which as I have stated is of a more calculated nature I consider that in the circumstances of that offence a standard non parole period should apply. The sentence in relation to that offence will be period of imprisonment of fourteen years with a non parole period of ten years.”


	
	His Honour’s reasoning indicates that he may have considered that unless there was some reason not to impose the standard non-parole period for an offence which he implicitly found was within the middle of the range of objective seriousness he had to impose a sentence with a non-parole period the same as the prescribed standard.
	
	
	It is also apparent that his Honour may have adopted a two-staged approach by having first determined the objective seriousness of the offence in count 1 as “not significantly below” the middle of the range and the offence in count 2 as being within the middle of the range. The non-parole periods then imposed fell into place in accordance with such findings by reference to the prescribed standard.
	
	
	It was also argued for the applicant that his Honour also took into account subjective matters in his assessment of the objective seriousness. I do not accept that this appears to be the case. The submission was based upon his Honour’s statement within the passage quoted above: “balancing those matters which I have previously considered”. It was argued that the matters “previously considered” included subjective matters. I do not consider that submission has been made good. The matters he previously considered included objective matters relevant to the offending and I take his Honour as having them in mind.
	
	
	There was no reassessment of the sentence pursuant to the correct approach identified in Muldrock by the Court of Criminal Appeal when moving to the question posed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. It is implicit that the Court saw nothing wrong with the approach adopted by the primary judge. That is understandable as it was consistent with the prevailing (but erroneous) understanding of the law. Accordingly, the possibility of Muldrock-error in the original sentencing exercise appears to have permeated the resentencing exercise.
	
	
	For these reasons I am of the view that there appears to have been Muldrock-error in the sentencing of the applicant by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	The applicant’s submissions, as I have said, were extensive. They raised a considerable number of other points to which I have not referred because to do so is unnecessary. It is sufficient for me to state my conclusions as follows:
	


It appears that there may have been errors in sentencing that are contrary to the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen and Kentwell v The Queen.

It therefore appears there is a doubt or question as to the sentence passed upon the applicant by the District Court and subsequently by the Court of Criminal Appeal.


	
	I refer the whole of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

2769348,Brown v R [2016] NSWCCA 76,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: Adam Campbell Brown was found guilty by a jury after a six week trial in mid-2014 of four drug supply offences as well as a proceeds of crime offence.

	Mr Brown (""the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal against the convictions on the sole ground that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. Leave to appeal is necessary: s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). (A further ground of appeal was proposed but was abandoned during the course of the hearing.)
	
	
	Details of the offences are as follows:
	


Count 1: Between 13 April and 17 August 2012 at Ballina, Lennox Head, Suffolk Park and Newrybar, supply 1039 grams of the drug commonly known as ecstasy in an amount which is not less than the large commercial quantity: s 25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).

Count 2: On 17 August 2012 at Suffolk Park, possess $4909.25 knowing that it was the proceeds of crime: s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900  (NSW).

Count 3: On 17 August 2012 at Newrybar, supply 41.66 grams of ecstasy: s 25(1)/s 29 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act.

Count 4: On 17 August 2012 at Newrybar, supply 43.8 grams of cocaine: s 25(1)/s 29 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act.

Count 5: On 17 August 2012 at Newrybar, supply 9.44 grams of methydioxypyrovalerone, an analogue of methcathinone: s 25(1)/s 29 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act.

Overview of Crown case


	
	Police began an investigation into the suspected supply of the drug known as ecstasy by a person who I will refer to by the pseudonym ""Charlie"" in the Byron Bay and Ballina areas. Charlie lived in the area and had known the applicant for about eight years.
	
	
	Charlie supplied undercover police operatives with ecstasy on ten occasions between 13 April and 17 August 2012. The Crown alleged that Charlie received his supplies from the applicant. These alleged supplies from the applicant to Charlie formed the basis of the offence alleged in count 1.
	
	
	Count 2 alleged that money found by the police in the applicant’s car at the time of his arrest on 17 August 2012 was the proceeds of other drug dealings.
	
	
	Counts 3, 4 and 5 involved the applicant's possession, deemed to be for the purpose of supply by s 29 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, based upon the finding of the three nominated prohibited drugs in the applicant’s bedroom in his home at Midgen Flat Road, Newrybar on 17 August 2012.
	
	
	The police investigation of Charlie involved the use of three undercover operatives, known as Felicity, Hayley and Claire (not their real names). The police obtained warrants to lawfully intercept the mobile phones used by Charlie and subsequently the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant did not have any direct contact with any of the undercover officers. The money that was used by them to purchase the drugs from Charlie was recorded and photocopied. None of the recorded bank notes were located by police in the possession of the applicant. In fact there was no forensic evidence to connect the applicant to any of the drugs supplied by Charlie to the officers.
	
	
	The principal witness in the Crown case was Charlie. He had earlier pleaded guilty and had been sentenced for an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of ecstasy (1039.49 grams) and a further offence of supplying ecstasy (17.7 grams). He received a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. He received a discount on the sentence that otherwise would have been imposed of 25 per cent for his early pleas of guilty and 20 per cent for his assistance to authorities.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence to support Charlie’s evidence that the applicant was his supplier in relation to the last four transactions with the undercover officers. It also relied upon drugs and other paraphernalia that were found when the applicant was arrested on 17 August 2012 to establish that the applicant had a tendency to engage in the business of selling prohibited drugs. Arguably unnecessarily, the trial judge directed the jury that they needed to be satisfied of both the foundational evidence and the alleged tendency beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Count 1


	
	Charlie gave evidence that the drugs he supplied to the undercover officers were obtained on credit from the applicant. He said that the price per capsule was determined in his negotiations with the applicant and, at least in part, based upon what the purchaser was prepared to pay. Charlie's profit was the differential between the two.
	


Supply of 2 capsules of ecstasy on 13 April 2012


	
	The undercover officers Felicity and Hayley first met Charlie at a hotel in Ballina where Charlie was working. Felicity engaged Charlie in conversation which ultimately led to him supplying her 2 capsules of ecstasy at a price of $25 each. Later that night she asked Charlie about obtaining more capsules the next day and he agreed. He gave her his mobile telephone number and asked her to call after 10am the next day.
	


Supply of 6 capsules of ecstasy on 14 April 2012


	
	When they spoke the next day, Charlie told Felicity to meet him at a general store in Ballina. Felicity and Hayley met him there and they walked together to his home. Felicity purchased 6 capsules of ecstasy and paid Charlie $150.
	


Supply of 10 capsules of ecstasy on 27 April 2012


	
	On 27 April Felicity and Hayley attended a meeting that had been previously arranged by telephone. Felicity purchased 10 tables of ecstasy and paid Charlie $250.
	


Supply of 50 capsules of ecstasy on 28 April 2012


	
	At another meeting arranged by telephone Felicity purchased 50 capsules from Charlie and paid him $1100.
	


Supply of 100 capsules of ecstasy on 30 May 2012


	
	Felicity made an arrangement with Charlie to purchase 100 capsules. She attended a meeting with him on 30 May 2012 where she purchased them for a price of $2200.
	


Supply of 200 capsules of ecstasy on 21 June 2012


	
	On this occasion Felicity met with Charlie and purchased 200 capsules of ecstasy for $4400.
	


Supply of 400 capsules of ecstasy on 29 June 2012


	
	On this occasion Felicity met with Charlie at a café in Ballina and introduced him to another officer known as Claire. Charlie was asked if he could supply 500 but he said he only had 400. There was a dispute about the accuracy of the transcript of the recorded conversation between the officers and Charlie. (All such conversations were recorded.) On any view, however, Charlie spoke of needing to obtain the further 100 capsules from a source. A short time after that conversation, Charlie sent a text to the applicant enquiring, “U home?” The applicant replied by text indicating that he was in Coolangatta but would contact Charlie later with a view to meeting up.
	
	
	About 20 minutes later Charlie walked with the officers from the café to his car where he supplied them with 400 capsules and was paid $6200.
	


Supply of 600 capsules of ecstasy on 25 July 2012


	
	On 15 July 2012 Claire sent Charlie a text asking if they could “catch up”. Charlie sent a text to the applicant asking when he would be back. (The applicant was in Thredbo.) The applicant replied to the effect that he would be back on the 24th. Charlie then informed Claire that he (Charlie) was away and would be back on the 24th. He said in his evidence that he did not want her contacting him if he could not supply her.
	
	
	Claire contacted Charlie on the 23rd with a text suggesting a meeting for lunch the following day. That evening the applicant sent a text to Charlie saying that he would be back on Wednesday (25th). The following day Charlie sent a text to the applicant asking if he would be back on the morning of the Wednesday. The applicant replied in the affirmative. Charlie gave evidence that he wanted to know when the applicant was returning so, “he could get restocked”. The applicant then sent a text to Claire to the effect that he would see her at lunchtime the following day.
	
	
	On the morning of 25 July Charlie sent a text to the applicant asking if he was home. The applicant replied a short time later with a text:
	


“I can come your way bro:) couple hours:)”


	
	About an hour and a half later Charlie sent a text asking the applicant if he was “far off”. The applicant replied almost immediately to the effect that he was in Lennox Head and could be there in half an hour, “or can meet you here if your in a rush”. Charlie replied: “Cool ill pop up now”. Subsequent texts were to the effect that they would meet at the bakery in Lennox Head.
	
	
	Police performing surveillance work saw the applicant meet with Charlie at the Lennox Head bakery just before midday. They were seen to enter the applicant’s car and drive to a nearby location and park. Charlie got out and went to his own car, retrieved a backpack and returned to the applicant’s car. A short time later Charlie got out and they each drove away. Charlie gave evidence that he met the applicant in order to “restock” or “get ecstasy”.
	
	
	At 12.14pm, Charlie sent Claire a text and she replied immediately to the effect that they would meet for lunch soon afterwards. The meeting took place at a café in Ballina. The ensuing conversation included asking Charlie whether he would obtain 2000 capsules. The recorded conversation indicated that Charlie had misunderstood how many capsules were sought. When he understood that 2000 were being sought he said, “He is going to pop around in 15 - 20 minutes to mine”. (Emphasis added)
	
	
	At 1.46pm, Charlie sent a text to the applicant asking if he was in Ballina. The applicant replied a short time later, “Yep. You home”. A minute later Charlie and the two undercover officers got up from the table. Charlie then sent a text to the applicant: “In 5 mins”. Charlie and the officers then returned to their cars. The officers drove up next to Charlie’s car. He got into their car with his backpack. He then supplied 600 capsules. Claire then obtained a bag from the boot of her car and returned and gave $8400 to Charlie. She asked him whether he wanted to count it and he replied, “I am going to give it to old matey now pretty much”. She asked whether, “he will have it”. He replied, “I’ve told him I will be home in 2 mins”. At 2.06pm, Charlie left the undercover officer’s car and returned to his own and drove away.
	
	
	The applicant sent a text to Charlie at 2.16pm saying “5 mins”. Charlie replied immediately, ""Cool"". At 2.22pm the applicant was seen to park outside Charlie’s home. Charlie was next seen at 2.29pm driving away and he met up with the two undercover officers at 2.32pm. The recorded conversation included the following:
	


“Charlie:   I spoke to him then, he has basically has to go and get it, but realistically over splendour, it’s not worth his while. He said look, throw another $2.00 on it and you can get it before splendour or otherwise wait until after splendour. Well that’s pretty much his way, his making 50 cents. It’s not worth his while when he can be making $8.00 on them or $9.00

Claire:   Well if he sells to us then he doesn’t have to worry about them.

Charlie:   That’s right they will be sold before splendour.

Claire:   So how much you think?

Charlie:   Well, oh, and it’s going to be tomorrow.

Claire:   Ok what time?

Charlie:   Umm, basically I will just message him now, so.

Felicity:   I was going to use the calculator.

Claire:   Didn’t say you could get them for $13.50?

Charlie:   Well $15.50 then.

Claire:   We got the last ones at $15.50.

Charlie:   Its just splendour. He likes sell them at $20.00 and at the moment they are going like hot cakes.

Claire:   What are people getting them at, batch of 100’s or 1000’s?

Charlie:   100’s whatever.

Claire:   What time tomorrow can you get them?

Charlie:   I wouldn’t know. He is organising it.

Claire:   Alright.

Charlie:   I am sorry darling; I tried my best and like at the moment its like trying to ask for a special a Christmas. Like usually, I totally respect that and I think it’s beautiful. I really respect that. But his like, your kidding mate, I am not going to make 50 cents when I can make $9.00. It’s not practicable for his business. And the fact is that if he sells out all of his stocks and gets $1000 when he can make $20,000.00, like it’s not practicable for him. Can I message you tomorrow?”


	
	Charlie was seen to get out of the undercover officer’s car at 2.41pm, returned to his own vehicle and drive away. At 2.46pm he sent a text to the applicant:
	


“Can u popova 2moz with those splender tickets. Morning sometime, working in the arvo.”

The applicant replied almost immediately:

“I’ll get back to ya”.


	
	The reference to “Splendour” was a reference to the annual Splendour in the Grass music festival held at Byron Bay.
	


Supply of 1400 capsules of ecstasy on 26 July 2012


	
	On the morning of 26 July 2012, Charlie sent a text to the applicant asking how he went “getting those tickets”. The applicant replied:
	


“Good:) can it meet you this arvo?”


	
	Claire rang Charlie in between those two texts. He told her that he was “just waiting to find out about those tickets … I’m pretty sure as soon as um, he finds out whether he can get them or not, he’ll ah, pass on the info and we can go grab them”. Claire pressed him as to timing, indicating that she was thinking about whether she needed to change her flight. He replied, “give us five and I’ll call you back in five minutes and I’ll let you know”. Charlie rang her back almost immediately and said, “I just tried him then and couldn’t get through”. He indicated that he would let her know as soon as he knew.
	
	
	In response to the applicant’s text asking Charlie if they could meet that afternoon there were further texts exchanged between the applicant and Charlie in relation to meeting up.
	
	
	At 11.27am Claire sent a text informing Charlie that she had changed her flight until later that afternoon and that she was hopeful for “the tickets”. He replied by telling her that the “wheels seem 2 be in motion”. (Charlie gave evidence that references to tickets were code for ecstasy tablets.)
	
	
	At 11.59 the applicant sent a text to Charlie:
	


“Meet at suffo:) say 12.45”


	
	Charlie then rang undercover officer Claire and tentatively arranged to meet her later, saying, “as soon as I’ve definitely got the tickets for splendour or whatever for us”.
	
	
	Charlie was seen to drive to his home in Ballina and then at 12.16pm to drive away. At 12.36pm he arrived at Suffolk Park. He bought something to eat at the bakery and appeared to wait there. At 12.57pm a male riding a motor cycle entered the Suffolk Park Hotel car park and stopped next to Charlie’s car. The rider passed a black canvas bag to Charlie through the car’s window and then pointed north. The motor cyclist and Charlie drove out of the car park. The motor cycle travelled away at high speed and police lost visual contact. Charlie drove home.
	
	
	There was an issue in the trial as to whether the motor cyclist was the applicant. It was Charlie’s evidence that he was. The registered owner of the motor cycle was a friend of the applicant and lived at Suffolk Park. The owner was overseas at the time but had left the applicant with a key to his house. Although the applicant had ridden the bike on other occasions the owner had not given him permission to ride it during the period he was away. The key that the applicant had to the house was linked to the garage.
	
	
	Supporting Charlie’s evidence that the rider of the motor cycle was the applicant was the fact that Charlie sent a text to the applicant at 12.44pm after he had been seen to arrive at Suffolk Park which simply read, “Here”. The applicant replied three minutes later, “sorry 10 mins”. Charlie replied immediately, “cool”. In an exchange of text messages later that afternoon between the applicant and Charlie in which they again arranged to meet at Suffolk Park, the applicant referred to ""where you parked before"". Further, in telephone conversation with a female at 4.08pm that day the applicant said, “I was, I was around today. I took the bike for a good ride”. In my view it was well open to the jury to accept Charlie’s evidence that the motorcyclist was the applicant.
	
	
	Charlie gave evidence that he thought the meeting near the bakery at Suffolk Park on this occasion when he said the applicant arrived on the motor cycle was for the purpose of him giving the applicant some money. There appears to have been an element of doubt in his mind however. When he was asked what happened he replied, “well, if it’s the time we were talking about that I can remember … I got the money out of the bag and took it over to him and gave it to him and he’s put it in the front part of the carrier of his motor bike”. He also said that the Suffolk Park bakery had been used to meet with the applicant “maybe three times”. It is possible that he was confused with another meeting, perhaps one that occurred later on the same day (see below at [42]).
	
	
	At 1.23pm Charlie sent a text to undercover officer Claire asking, “U far off?” She replied to the effect that she would be there in 30 minutes at the most and she would “go to our spot”. At 1.58pm, Charlie drove to the car park near the Ballina Art Gallery and met with undercover officers Felicity and Claire. He entered their car with a backpack. They paid him $24,600 and he supplied 1400 capsules. He left them and drove away at 2.16pm.
	
	
	Later that afternoon, the applicant and Charlie met at Suffolk Park after arranging to do so via phone contact. The meeting was observed by police. Charlie’s evidence was that he delivered to the applicant the money he had received from the undercover officers and there was a discussion about further supplies.
	


Supply of 1400 ecstasy capsules on Friday 17 August 2012


	
	On Sunday 12 August 2012 the applicant sent a text to Charlie asking how he had been. Charlie replied asking the applicant how his holiday was. The applicant replied the following morning (Monday 13th):
	


“Great man. Pop up to the farm if u want. Show u some photos”

Charlie gave evidence that the applicant had been away on a holiday, in “Samoa or something like that”.


	
	At 9.27 that morning Charlie sent a text to undercover officer Claire:
	


“U back from your holiday? Keen 4 a coffee?”

Charlie explained in his evidence that he was telling Claire that they could meet up again because the applicant was home and he could access some more capsules.


	
	At 10.12am the applicant rang Charlie who said he was at work and would finish around 2.00 or 3.00pm and suggested that he should “come and catch up and pick up some photos and shit”. A short time later, undercover officer Claire replied to Charlie’s earlier text. She said she would be up on Friday (17th) and proposed catching up with him “for a coffee and cake … will confirm numbers tomoz for you”.
	
	
	At 3.12pm Charlie sent a text to the applicant:
	


“Catching up with my friend on friday. I’ll pop up and see your holiday snaps afta that. Is that ok?”


	
	The following day (Tuesday 14th) at 10.51am undercover officer Claire sent Charlie a text:
	


“:-) :-) (same as last big one) midday ??? Coffee?”

In a supplementary text she indicated “Friday”. Texts sent later that day involved agreement to meet at 10.30. Charlie said that he had had a conversation with undercover officer Claire in which he had told her just to text a smiley face if she wanted 1000 capsules or two smiley faces if she wanted 2000.


	
	Charlie sent a message at 9.12am Thursday 16 August to the applicant asking if he was home. The applicant replied that he was going surfing but would be free later. Charlie asked him to send a message when he had returned and he would then “pop up”. At 1.31pm over two text messages the applicant informed Charlie that he was home if Charlie wanted to come up. Charlie replied that he would. At 1.45pm he sent a text to the applicant indicating he was “leaving now”. At 2.10pm Charlie’s car was seen by police entering the driveway of the applicant’s home at Midgen Flat Road Newrybar. It was seen to leave at 2.44pm.
	
	
	Charlie said that at the meeting at the applicant’s home on 16 August there was some conversation at the house and then they moved to some tennis courts away from the house. He said that the applicant said he could only get 1400 again but might be able to do the other 600 later on.
	
	
	Charlie’s evidence concerning his claim of having acquired 1400 capsules from the applicant on this occasion was at times unclear and in some respects inconsistent. Nevertheless he maintained that he did obtain 1400 capsules at a meeting with the applicant near some tennis courts at a place called Broken Head hall.
	
	
	At 8.16am on Friday 17 August, undercover officer Claire sent a text asking Charlie if he was still able to meet at 10.30. At 8.35am the applicant sent a text to Charlie saying that he would not be able to catch up with him until the following afternoon. At 9.25am, Charlie replied to Claire, ""Yep"".
	
	
	Undercover officers Claire and Felicity met Charlie at a café in Ballina at about 10.40am. At 11.11am they left the café and walked to their respective cars. Charlie was seen opening the front nearside passenger door of his car and then seen to walk to the officer’s car and get in. In a recorded conversation he told officers that he had 1400 capsules and that that was all he could get. He explained, “like I tried to organise another 6 for you but, he said not till this afternoon”.
	
	
	Charlie was challenged in cross-examination about his assertion to the officers that “he” said “not till this afternoon” when the earlier text message he had received from the applicant had referred to the following afternoon. He denied that he told the officers that because he had another supplier other than the applicant. He explained that he would have kept trying with the applicant and “hopefully he would get back to me”.
	
	
	At 11.15am, undercover officer Claire got out of the car and went to the rear where she removed a bag containing $31,000 of pre-recorded currency. Police moved in and arrested Charlie at this point.
	


Counts 2 to 5


	
	At 11.22am police arrested the applicant at the Suffolk Park shopping centre. His car was searched. Two envelopes containing cash were found as well as the applicant’s wallet. The total amount of money located was $4909.25 (the subject of the proceeds of crime offence in count 2). Written on one of the envelopes was “4,000” and “took 198 caps”.
	
	
	A search warrant was executed at the applicant’s home at Midgen Flat Road Newrybar later on the day of his arrest. The various items found during the course of the search were the foundation for the Crown’s contention that the applicant had a tendency to engage in the business of selling prohibited drugs. It is only necessary to review the evidence briefly.
	
	
	A document with handwriting was located in the dining room. It was an agreed fact that it bore the fingerprints of the applicant. The document comprised a list of names with numbers against them. It was the Crown’s case that this was a debtor’s or creditor’s list. (It was referred to as “a tick list”.) Charlie’s (real) first name appeared on the list with the number “4300” next to it.
	
	
	Cocaine was located in three plastic bags in the main bedroom of the home which appeared to be occupied by the applicant (Count 4). Tablets containing ecstasy in six lots were found elsewhere in that bedroom (Count 3). In a box found under the bed there were a number of small plastic bags containing a variety of pills, a larger plastic bag containing a quantity of empty gelatine capsules and a large number of empty resealable bags. In one plastic bag in the same box a quantity of the structural analogue of methcathinone were also found (Count 5). A set of digital scales was located in a kitchen cupboard.
	


An event at Grafton Correctional Centre


	
	After their arrest the applicant and Charlie were taken to Grafton Correctional Centre. Charlie gave evidence that after about five days they managed to get a cell together. One evening after they had been locked in they laid out their charge and facts sheets and discussed the cases against them. Various notes were written onto the documents; they were made by Charlie aside from the applicant writing the word “February”.
	
	
	Charlie gave evidence that the applicant raised the idea of saying that a person named “Richie” had supplied Charlie with the drugs. Richie was a person who had recently died. Charlie said that he did not know Richie well; he had only met him in passing.
	
	
	Another part of the proposed story was that Charlie would say that he had been keeping the money to give to Richie when he had returned from being away in Los Angeles. But the applicant’s suggestion was for Charlie to say that his house got broken into during the Splendour in the Grass weekend and the money was stolen.
	
	
	Records from Grafton Correctional Centre showed that the applicant and Charlie did not share a cell at all. When confronted with this information Charlie remained insistent that they did share a cell for one night. There was evidence from a correctional officer that they would have had about five hours per day out of their cells where they could have freely associated.
	


Unreasonable verdict principles


	
	The principles concerning the determination of a ground of appeal that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, are well known. In short, the question is whether, upon independently assessing the evidence, this Court is of the view that it was open to the jury (in the sense explained by the High Court) to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493; Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 56; 191 CLR 439; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	The jury in the present case had the undoubted advantage of seeing and hearing the principal Crown witness give evidence over an extended period of time. His evidence was given over seven sitting days. The significance of this is incorporated in the summary of principles to be applied in the determination of a ground of appeal against conviction asserting that a verdict is unreasonable or unsupportable that McCallum J provided in Glover v R; Stuart v R [2015] NSWCCA 285:
	


""[98] It is well-established that, in determining such a ground, this Court must make an 'independent assessment of the evidence'. The existence of that function has long been recognised: Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 at 516.1 per Barwick CJ; Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521 at 534 per Gibbs CJ and Mason J; Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 463, 473, 478. It is clear that it is a function which must be discharged carefully, with a view to assessing the 'probative value' of the evidence (Morris at 463 per Mason CJ) both as to its sufficiency and its quality (at 473 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ).

[99] It is important to bear in mind the purpose for which that function is performed, which is to determine whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused: Chamberlain at 534.3; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] per Hayne J (citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492 to 493). One of the issues considered in the joint judgment in M was whether, in stating the test in such terms, it was necessary to qualify the statement of Barwick CJ in Ratten that the same task could equally be expressed by reference to a doubt entertained by the appellate court itself. The majority in M did not think the difference mattered. It was in that context that the majority said, famously (at 494), 'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.'

[100] That quote and the remarks that follow it are frequently cited in this Court as a seminal statement of principle governing appeals of this kind. There is no vice in doing so, provided the passage is read in context. The assertion as to what will be the position 'in most cases' was not itself a statement of principle. It was the explanation for the view stated in the previous sentence that it is 'possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick CJ and of the qualification suggested'. The 'qualification' was explained in the preceding paragraph:

'To ask only whether the court has a doubt may place insufficient emphasis upon the fact that the jury, having seen and heard the evidence given, was in a position to evaluate that evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.'

[101] If there is no difference between Barwick CJ in Ratten and Chamberlain, I prefer the formulation approved in Chamberlain, that is, whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt or, as it was put by Hayne J in Libke at [113] (emphasis in original):

'the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.'

[102] My reason for preferring that formulation is that it is more accurate, since it acknowledges the function of the jury as the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence (a point reiterated in an earlier passage in M at 493.8). In an appeal, the Crown does not have to discharge an onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt for a second time; this Court is entrusted with the function of undertaking an independent assessment of the evidence for a different purpose. Submissions invoking the frequently quoted-passage from M sometimes appear to suggest otherwise.""

Submissions for the applicant


	
	Written submissions prepared by senior counsel for the applicant (not Mr Hughes SC who appeared at the hearing) reminded the Court of the uncontroversial point that Charlie was a witness who was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the charges against the applicant. As such, the trial judge was requested to, and did, give a warning that his evidence may be unreliable: s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	The written submissions made a number of points about the evidence that was said to contradict the evidence of Charlie. They also pointed to a number of ways in which there was an asserted absence of supporting evidence.
	
	
	Charlie's evidence about a conversation with the applicant when they were locked-in together in a cell at Grafton Correction Centre was contradicted by the prison records which showed that they had never shared a cell together. This was confirmed by the oral evidence of a correctional officer.
	
	
	Another point of contradiction was that Charlie claimed in a statement made on 31 August 2012 to have received drugs from the applicant at Broken Head hall on 17 August 2012. Based upon surveillance of the applicant and Charlie, Detective Sergeant Ewing agreed in cross-examination that this was incorrect.
	
	
	In relation to there being an absence of supporting evidence, the written submissions referred to the fact that the applicant was not present at any of the transactions between Charlie and the undercover officers. He was in communication with a number of people, not just the applicant, in between such transactions.
	
	
	The submissions also referred to the lack of positive identification that the motorcyclist who met the applicant at Suffolk Park on 26 July 2012 was the applicant. I have considered this (above at **[37]-[39]**). There was ample proof for the jury to conclude that this person was the applicant.
	
	
	The drugs found at the applicant's home on 17 August 2012 did not bear the applicant's fingerprints and they were not tested for DNA. (There was evidence of the fingerprints of others found on the drug bags but this had the potential to raise something prejudicial and so counsel for the applicant deliberately chose to avoid having it placed before the jury.)
	
	
	A further point made in the written submissions was that none of the recorded money used by the undercover officers to pay Charlie for the drugs they received was found in the applicant's possession. That of course must be considered in light of the fact that the last time the officers handed over money was some three weeks before the applicant's arrest and the search of his car and house.
	
	
	The written submissions referred to the evidence of the applicant apparently having multiple wallets: one found nearby in the shopping centre where he was arrested; another in his car and another in the bedroom of his home. It seems to be implied that there might be doubt as to whether the wallet found in the bedroom was in fact his but the point was not further developed in either written or oral submissions.
	
	
	Other points made in the written submissions were that aside from the $4909 the subject of the charge in count 2 there was no evidence of the applicant being found in possession of the proceeds of crime. Another point concerned the inconclusiveness of some surveillance evidence.
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence of Charlie ranged over 10 transactions with the undercover officers in a period of 4 months. He was also involved in supplying drugs to other people. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that his recall of the detail of individual transactions with the person he said was his supplier and the people who were his buyers would be incomplete or on some occasions wrong.
	
	
	The critical aspect of Charlie's evidence was his assertion that the applicant was his supplier. There was a strong case that he was correct in this respect.
	
	
	Aside from Charlie's evidence, the combined effect of the telephone contact between him and the applicant coinciding with Charlie's negotiations and meetings with the undercover officers in relation to the final four transactions (see above at **[19]-[54]**) more than cogently supported the inference that the applicant was Charlie's supplier. Charlie's evidence simply confirmed what was otherwise open to the jury to accept.
	
	
	There was no evidence independent of Charlie in relation to the first six transactions. But if it was open to the jury to accept the correctness of his evidence in relation to the latter four because it was so strongly supported, it was equally open for them to accept as credible his evidence in relation to the earlier six.
	
	
	The two points of contradiction raised in the submissions (see above at **[67]-[68]**) were available to be considered by the jury. In relation to the Grafton gaol matter, the trial judge reminded the jury of submission of counsel who was then appearing for the applicant. His Honour also said that ""there was certainly opportunity for the two of them to have sat together in a cell""; ""it may be that [Charlie] was wrong about them having shared a cell overnight, but that his evidence is otherwise truthful""; ""or it may be, as [trial counsel] submitted to you, that he was lying"".
	
	
	Charlie's error in relation to meeting the applicant on 17 August was a similarly valid point for the jury to consider. But there was uncontroverted evidence by police conducting surveillance that he did go to the applicant's home the previous day.
	
	
	In the light of the strong support for Charlie's evidence on critical matters, these points, either alone or in combination with everything else, are not ones that must have caused the jury to have a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I consider the various absence of evidence points raised in the submissions in the same way. A potentially strong point in favour of the applicant was that his fingerprints were not found on any of the bags of drugs located by police on 17 August 2012. But against it is that the drugs were found in his own bedroom and there was also the ""tick list"" on which his fingerprints were found.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have considered all that has been put in both written and oral submissions on behalf of the applicant. The point that cannot be avoided is that there was a considerable body of independent, uncontroverted and objective evidence that supported the veracity of Charlie's evidence that the applicant was his drug supplier.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to establish that it was not open to the jury to return verdicts of guilty on each of the five counts in the indictment.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal against conviction granted.

2.   Appeal dismissed.


	
	GARLING J: I have read, and taken account of, the whole of the evidence placed before the Court on this application. Having done so, and having considered the submissions of both the applicant and the Crown, I am of the view that it was open to the jury to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of each of the offences on the Indictment.
	
	
	In particular, the jury had the considerable advantage of seeing and hearing the principal Crown witness over many days. Whilst criticisms of the evidence of this witness can properly be made which would have lead me to having a doubt about the credibility of the witness, any such doubt was one capable of resolution by the jury because of its advantageous position.
	
	
	I agree with the analysis of R A Hulme J of the effect of the evidence at the trial.
	
	
	I agree with the orders which R A Hulme J proposes.
	
	
	WILSON J: I also agree with the analysis and conclusions of R A Hulme J. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes.

2769349,Tsai Yu v R [2016] NSWCCA 73,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Garling J.
	
	
	GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales by her Honour Judge Hock on 1 May 2015.
	
	
	The applicant, Mr Tsai Yu, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the offence of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border control drug contrary to ss 11.1 and 307.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Criminal Code). He was committed for sentence to the District Court. In the District Court he adhered to his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for life, or a fine of $1,275,000, or both. No standard non-parole period applies.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge imposed a total sentence of 9 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months commencing on 11 June 2014, being the date upon which the applicant was arrested and bail was refused.
	


Facts


	
	A Statement of Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge. A brief summary of those facts is as follows.
	
	
	On 29 March 2014, a person using the name of Chung Chieh Hsaio entered into a rental agreement commencing 29 March 2014 and ending 29 June 2014, for the property at 5 Johnston Road Eastwood NSW.
	
	
	On 31 May 2014, a consignment arrived in Sydney via sea cargo from China. It was described as containing five “Torque Testers”, with a gross weight of 688kg. The consignee details identified the co-offender, Mr Hsiao Chen Lin, as the consignee, with an address at “5 Johnston Rd Eastwood 2122 AU”.
	
	
	On 2 June 2014, Australian Customs and Border Protection Officers examined the consignment. The officers drilled a small hole in the base of one of the Torque Testers, revealing a crystalline substance. Testing of the substance returned a positive result for methamphetamine.
	
	
	On 3 June 2014, the Australian Federal Police (“the AFP”) made enquiries with the freight forwarder, who provided a mobile telephone number for the co-offender.
	
	
	On 5 June 2014, the applicant and the co-offender arrived in Sydney on a China Airlines flight from Taiwan. That same day, the freight forwarder received a phone call from the co-offender, who confirmed 5 Johnston Road Eastwood NSW as the address for delivery of the consignment. Also that same day, the co-offender booked himself and the applicant into accommodation at the Meriton Serviced Apartments in Zetland NSW.
	
	
	On 6 June 2014, the freight forwarder received a phone call from the co‑offender to confirm the date for delivery of the consignment. The freight forwarder told the co-offender that he would deliver the consignment on 11 June 2014. The freight forwarder advised the AFP of this phone call.
	
	
	On 10 June 2014, in intercepted telephone conversations between the co‑offender and an unknown female, it was confirmed that the consignment would be delivered to 5 Johnston Street Eastwood NSW on 11 June 2014, at around 10:00 or 10:30am. The co-offender was also informed that the consignment would be delivered by a truck with two drivers who would call in advance of delivery.
	
	
	At 10:01am on 11 June 2014, an AFP officer purporting to be a delivery driver called the co-offender and informed him that he would arrive at the Eastwood address in approximately 15 minutes. At about 10:05 am, AFP officers observed the applicant walking towards the property and talking on his mobile phone. The officers also observed the co-offender talking on his mobile phone in a station wagon parked at the top of Johnston Road.
	
	
	At 10:08, 10:09 and 10:17am, the co-offender called the applicant to provide instructions on how to take delivery of the consignment. Among other things, he told the applicant to “find a spot” in the premises at 5 Johnston Road to store the drugs, to “lock the door” before leaving the property, and to “bring back the keys” to the co-offender.
	
	
	At 10:17am, the officers attended the address, whereupon the applicant signed the delivery sheet in the co-offender’s name and wrote the co‑offender’s contact number. The applicant was then arrested. The co‑offender was arrested shortly thereafter.
	
	
	Between 9 July 2014 and 11 July 2014, AFP forensic officers deconstructed the consignment and found that it contained 10.67kg of pure methamphetamine, with an estimated street value of $11.95M and wholesale value of $3.43M.
	


Proceedings on Sentence


	
	Sentence proceedings were held on 23 April 2014 before her Honour Judge Hock for both the applicant and his co-offender, Mr Lin.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence through an interpreter. He told the sentencing Judge that he was a citizen of Taiwan and lived in Taipei prior to travelling to Australia. He said that he was 24 years old, having been born in 1990. He was single. He gave a history of his family background, including his education and work.
	
	
	He said that he met Mr Lin in a nightclub in January 2013. He was asked to give an account as to why he became involved in the offence. He said:
	


“Because at that time I need money. I was lacking of money and also I have, I had a debt from my friends, I am owing my friends some money.”


	
	He went on to explain that his need for money arose because he had been gambling by playing cards, and had lost. He had borrowed money from a “loan shark” and needed to repay it. He told the Court that he knew that he was to be involved in dealings with a drug but he did not know the quantity.
	
	
	He told the Court that he borrowed about $3,000 and anticipated that his participation in the events giving rise to the offence would result in having sufficient monetary reward to repay the debt.
	
	
	He was asked about how his involvement in the offence had commenced. He said that there was a conversation with his co-accused, Mr Lin, to the following effect:
	


“Mr Lin said ‘I have a case for you to do’, means a matter, a thing ‘ask you to do’. Said ‘if you want to repay the money you only needed to do once fix doing this matter for once’. And then I ask ‘what’s the matter’, he told me this was a case about to sign, means a receipt, this drug, this kind of thing. ‘I need you to do it’. And then I asked a few questions but he stopped talking the details and said ‘you just need to go to Australia and over there you just listen to my order, means what I said to you’.”


	
	Mr Tsai then gave an account of what happened after he arrived in Australia. This account was not materially different from the agreed facts.
	
	
	The co-accused, Mr Lin, then gave evidence and submissions were taken. Earlier in the proceedings, a number of documents were tendered in respect of each of the offenders.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	A little over a week after the sentence proceedings, on 1 May 2015, Hock DCJ sentenced the applicant and the co-offender, Mr Lin.
	
	
	Her Honour, in careful and detailed Remarks on Sentence, first addressed the nature of the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty and in particular noted that the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for life.
	
	
	Her Honour then set out the Agreed Facts as summarised above. She described the offence in the following terms, which the applicant accepts as appropriate:
	


“The offence is extremely serious and was clearly the result of careful and sophisticated planning. Two important factors when considering the appropriate penalty for each offender are the quantity of the drug and the part each played. The methamphetamine had a pure weight of 10.673kg, the threshold for the commercial quantity is 0.75kg. The quantity is therefore more than 14 times the threshold, a very substantial quantity with an estimate value as I have already set out.”


	
	Her Honour also noted that the quantity of the unlawfully imported drugs had a street value of $11.95M or a wholesale value of $3.43M.
	
	
	Her Honour then went on to consider the role that the applicant and his co‑offender, Mr Lin, each played in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	She accepted that the applicant was subordinate to Mr Lin, and played a lesser role. She noted, however, that he travelled to Australia solely to take delivery of the drugs by signing for them on 11 June 2014, and then his job was to ensure that the drugs were secured in the premises. The applicant correctly points out in his submissions to this Court that securing the drugs in the premises consisted of locking the premises and returning the key to his co‑offender, Mr Lin.
	
	
	Her Honour then recited the personal history and background of the applicant, and described him in this way:
	


“The offender presented as a relatively immature young man who would be easily preyed on by a more forceful personality such as Mr Lin displayed. This is consistent with his minor role compared to his co-offender. The offender has expressed his remorse. On the basis of his evidence and Exhibit C, the confidential exhibit, I accept that he is genuine. In my view, he is unlikely to re-offend.”


	
	Her Honour noted that both of the offenders would be isolated in custody because English was not their first language, and they would be unlikely to have visits from family or friends. Her Honour, however, noted that such a factor ought to be given little weight. This remark accords with authority.
	
	
	With respect to the applicant, her Honour noted the following:
	


“Mr Tsai provided assistance which was of limited value. I have reduced his sentence by 30% for the plea and his assistance. The plea indicates an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.”

Her Honour reduced Mr Lin’s sentence by 25% to reflect his early plea of guilty.


	
	Her Honour then proceeded to impose the sentence. The applicant, as I have earlier noted, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 9 years with a non‑parole period of 5 years and 6 months.
	
	
	Mr Lin, the co-accused, was sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	On 13 November 2015, the applicant lodged a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal.
	
	
	Two grounds of appeal were nominated:
	



	
	The sentence fixed in the District Court does not adequately reflect the different levels of criminality in the offender Lin and the appellant Tsai Yu.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on Tsai Yu is manifestly excessive.
	



	
	At the start of the hearing of the application, Ground 2 was abandoned by counsel for the applicant.
	


Applicant’s Submissions


	
	In his submissions, the applicant did not contend that the learned sentencing Judge failed to take into account any relevant fact or that, in describing the applicant’s subjective circumstances, the objective criminality involved in the offence, and the role which he played, her Honour fell into error. The applicant accepted that the sentencing Judge had, in her Remarks on Sentence, demonstrated a careful consideration of all of the relevant factors, and that she had addressed the need to impose differential sentences on the applicant and his co-offender, and in fact did so.
	
	
	The applicant submitted, however, that the following factors considered together warranted a much greater differential between the sentences than that which the learned sentencing Judge actually imposed:
	



	
	the discrepancy in age and maturity of the applicant, who was 24 years old at the time of the offence, and his co-offender, who was 32 years old and considerably more mature;
	
	
	the significant difference in the roles which each of them played in the offence; and
	
	
	the relatively favourable subjective circumstances of the applicant.
	



	
	In particular, counsel for the applicant drew attention to her Honour’s remark that the applicant was relatively immature and would have been easily preyed upon by a more forceful personality such as that displayed by his co-offender.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentences which were imposed properly reflected the similarities and differences between the applicant and the co‑offender. The Crown drew attention to the obligation of this Court to have regard to the “… qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.” : Green v The Queen, Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [32] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the learned sentencing Judge’s Remarks on Sentence demonstrated careful attention to the similarities and differences between the applicant and co-offender, and that it was apparent from her Honour’s remarks that she had appropriately distinguished between them.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the learned sentencing Judge was in the best position to assess the relative criminality between the applicant and his co‑offender and to distinguish the circumstances relevant to each of them. The Crown noted that the sentencing Judge was in the best position to form an impression of both the applicant and the co-offender, both of whom gave evidence before her.
	
	
	Ultimately, the Crown submitted that the discrepancy between the sentences was an appropriate one and not one which gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
	


Discernment


	
	Where, as here, an applicant contends that the disparity between the sentence which he and his co-offender received has given rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, the norm expressed in the phrase “equality before the law” falls for consideration. As French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said in Green at [28]:
	


“Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is ‘a reflection of the notion of equal justice’ and ‘is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice’. It finds expression in the ‘parity principle’ which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of ‘equal justice’, which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances.” (footnotes omitted)


	
	The parity principle recognises that equal justice requires that, as between the co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to a “justifiable sense of grievance”: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610 per Gibbs CJ, at 613 per Mason J, and at 623 per Dawson J; Postiglione v The Queen (1996) 189 CLR 295 at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ.
	
	
	As Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed in Postiglione at 301-302:
	


“Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.”


	
	The phrase “justifiable sense of grievance”, which appears in the judgment of the Chief Justice in Lowe, is assessed by reference to objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the subjective feelings of the person complaining of disparity: see Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
	
	
	A differential in the sentences imposed on co-offenders for the same offence may be justified by differences between the co-offenders “… such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise” : see Lowe at 609 per Gibbs CJ, Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
	
	
	Consideration of whether error has been demonstrated can, in this application, commence with a consideration of the notional total sentences imposed on each of the applicant and co-offender. That is because her Honour correctly applied a different discount to each sentence before arriving at the ultimate difference in the notional total sentences of about 22 months.
	
	
	The effect of the applicant’s submission is that this differential cannot be regarded as objectively justified because of the significant difference in age, maturity, subjective circumstances and the role played by each in the offence. It is not to the point that another sentencing Judge may have imposed sentences with a greater differential, or with a lesser one. What the applicant must show is that his sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust, and that it does not reflect the norm of equal justice.
	
	
	In Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398, Howie J (with whom Sully and Latham JJ agreed) remarked, with reference to a ground of appeal based on parity, this at [28]:
	


“28   That leaves a consideration of the issue of parity between the applicant and the co-offenders. This is a ground where there are considerable obstacles placed before the applicant in circumstances where the sentencing judge is fully aware of sentences imposed upon co-offenders, the reasons for those sentences, and in the remarks indicates why the judge is departing from the sentences imposed upon the others. Those obstacles became even greater where, as here, the difference is a result of legitimate fact finding on the part of the second judge.”


	
	In Lam v R; Lam v R [2015] NSWCCA 87, this Court considered an appeal based on the parity principle but in circumstances where, as here, a single sentencing Judge had dealt with all of the co-offenders. Schmidt J (with whom Meagher JA and Bellew J agreed) described the task confronting an appellant in these terms:
	


“12   As discussed in Tatana v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [28], an offender faces considerable obstacles, when a sentencing judge is fully aware of sentences imposed upon co-offenders, the reasons for those sentences, and explains why the sentences imposed upon them, are departed from. Here the differences in the sentences imposed on the three offenders were the result of legitimate fact finding by the one sentencing judge and the exercise of discretions in relation to the utilitarian discount and the finding of special circumstances in each case. As discussed in R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209 at [17] – [19], different findings in relation to such discounts cannot readily give rise to a conclusion that disparity has resulted.”


	
	Her Honour’s careful Remarks on Sentence do not reveal any error. She applied the parity principle by taking into account differences between the applicant and his co-offender in the areas of age, maturity, subjective circumstances and the role each played in the offence. There is simply, in my opinion, no room for legitimate criticism of her Honour’s Remarks or the result she reached.
	
	
	The difference between the sentences imposed on the applicant and his co-offender was well within the discretionary range open to the learned sentencing Judge. The difference is justified by the legitimate fact finding and assessment of the Judge. Accordingly, no justifiable sense of grievance has been established.
	
	
	It follows that if leave were granted, the appeal would be dismissed.
	
	
	As this is not an appeal which raises a matter of principle, but simply contends that the discretion reposed in the sentencing Judge has been exercised in a way which must be taken to be demonstrative of error, and the applicant has been unable to demonstrate such error, the appropriate course is for this Court to refuse leave to appeal.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following order:
	


Application for leave to appeal dismissed.


	
	WILSON J: I agree with Garling J.

2769354,Casey v R [2016] NSWCCA 77,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Terrence Trevor Casey, seeks leave to appeal against his conviction on 20 February 2014, following a Judge-alone trial before Mahony SC DCJ at Wagga Wagga District Court, upon a charge of robbery with wounding under s.96 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	His Honour sentenced the Applicant on 15 August 2014 to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing 26 October 2013 and expiring 25 January 2016, with a balance of term of two years and three months commencing on 26 January 2016 and expiring on 25 April 2018.
	
	
	The Applicant seeks to challenge his conviction only. No application for leave to appeal is brought with respect to sentence.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	In Grounds of Appeal filed on 17 September 2015, the Applicant identified the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the verdict was unreasonable or otherwise unsupportable having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	Ground 2 - the trial Judge failed to properly apply the law as to assessing the reliability, as opposed to credibility, of a witness.
	
	
	Ground 3 - a significant part of the trial Judge’s reasoning toward a finding of guilt was based on propositions that were not put to the witness - that witness should have had an opportunity to respond to such matters.
	



	
	As the grounds extend beyond grounds which involve a question of law alone, leave to appeal against conviction is required: s.5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	


The Trial


	
	The indictment alleged that the Applicant, on 16 June 2008 at Griffith, did rob Zahid Bashir of a jacket, a wallet and cash, the property of Mr Bashir, and that immediately before the robbery, he used corporal violence upon Mr Bashir thereby wounding him.
	
	
	The Applicant applied to be tried by a Judge alone, a course to which the Crown consented: ss.132(1) and (2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that on 16 June 2008, the Applicant, in company with his brother, Chad Casey, and another male, robbed and wounded Mr Bashir.
	
	
	The Crown case at trial was largely a documentary one. The only witness called by the Crown to give oral evidence was the Applicant’s brother, Chad Casey. The Applicant did not give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	The Crown case against the Applicant was based upon the evidence of Chad Casey who gave an account to police, implicating the Applicant in the commission of the crime. Chad Casey later recanted this version and stated that the Applicant was not involved in the crime.
	
	
	The Crown said that Chad Casey’s initial account to the police was the truth. It was the Applicant’s case that Chad Casey had lied to the police when he implicated the Applicant.
	


The Reasons of the Trial Judge


	
	Given the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to set out parts of the trial Judge’s reasons for convicting the Applicant.
	
	
	His Honour set out the terms of the charge and adverted to the fact that both the Applicant and the Crown consented to the trial proceeding as a Judge-alone trial. Thereafter, his Honour set out the elements of the offence and directed himself concerning onus and standard of proof.
	
	
	The trial Judge recited the unchallenged account of Mr Bashir (trial judgment, 20 February 2014 at [6]-[9]):
	


“6   The Crown bundle exhibit A included two statements from the victim, Zahid Bashir. On Monday 15 June 2008 he finished work at 10.20pm and at about 11.10pm he was walking along Banna Avenue in Griffith on his way to a friend’s house. Three males, on the other side of Banna Avenue, standing near the front of the old Police station, yelled out to him and he kept walking. Mr Bashir gave the following description of the three men:

‘5.    One was about five eleven, he was wearing a whitish/creamy coloured jersey and pants, he had black hair and light brown skin, like a Samonen (sic) and he had a clean face with no hair on his face. The second male was about six foot tall wearing a black jumper with a collar, black pants like jeans and a bucket hat. He had white skin but I’m not sure what coloured hair. The third male was shorter than the first male and he was wearing a light coloured hooded jumper. I saw that they were walking towards the old Police station from the direction of the post office. I did not know any of the males.’

7   The men ran across the road towards Mr Bashir and asked him what his name was. He kept walking and turned into Banna Lane. The men ran across to him and surrounded him. One of them punched him twice, following which Mr Bashir hit him on the left side of the face with his right hand. He then felt a hit to the back of his head and thinks he got knocked out. When he woke he was lying on the ground and did not have his jumper and shirt on any more. His statement read:

‘The males were all standing around me and kicking me in my ribs. I jumped up and realised that my mouth and nose were bleeding. I thought my mouth was cut open and my teeth were missing. I started swinging punches and kicking out. They spread out a bit away from me and then I ran to my friend’s house.’

8   An ambulance was called and Police attended. Mr Bashir was taken to hospital by ambulance. It was when he was in the ambulance that he realised that his wallet was missing.

9   In a second statement made one week later on 27 June 2008, Mr Bashir gave a more detailed description of the men who he saw on Banna Avenue. The street lighting was on and he could see them well. His statement read:

‘7.    The first man, who had light brown skin, looked like he was aged in his early 20’s. He had a medium build.

8.    The second man who was wearing the bucket hat, also looked like he was aged in his early 20’s. He was skinny and clean shaven.

9.    At the time, I was wearing a black, short-sleeved shirt. Over the top of the shirt, I was wearing a camouflaged coloured zip up jacket. I was wearing long pants. When the three men surrounded me, it was close to where Banna Lane meets Ulong Street. The men started hitting me. I was hit in the head, I fell to the ground and I was knocked out for a short time. When I woke up the three men were all standing over me and I felt them kicking me to the ribs. I managed to get to my feet. When I stood up, I could feel blood dripping from my face. I couldn’t really hold my head up because my face was hurting.

10. I tried to walk away towards Mohammed’s place. As I walked away, the three men were still grabbing at me. I felt hands feeling around the pockets of my pants. I felt someone remove my wallet from my pants pocket’.”


	
	His Honour turned to other documentary evidence adduced in the Crown case and then referred to the evidence of the principal Crown witness, Chad Casey (trial judgment, 20 February 2014 at [13]-[30]):
	


“13   The Crown called Chad Casey to give oral evidence. He is the brother of the accused and had been charged with the same offence. He had entered a plea of guilty to the offence on 25 March 2009 at the Griffith Local Court and had adhered to that plea when the matter came on for sentencing before Judge Charteris in June 2009.

14   On 11 November 2008 Chad Casey had undergone an ERISP interview at Wagga Wagga Police station in which he had made certain admissions (exhibit B). Prior to being dealt with by the Court on 3 February 2009, on the application of his solicitor, he made what is known as an induced statement to the Police, providing further details of the offence (exhibits C & D). In both his original interview and in the induced statement, he implicated his brother, Terrence Casey, as being a co-offender. The details of that will appear below.

15   Chad Casey gave an undertaking to give evidence at his sentence hearing in accordance with his induced statement. He therefore obtained the benefit of a 35% discount on sentence, made up of a 25% utilitarian discount for his early plea of guilty, plus a 10% discount for the assistance that he had provided to the authorities. The sentencing Judge indicated that he would otherwise sentence him to 5 years imprisonment, but with the 35% discount, that became 3 years and 3 months. The sentencing Judge then further reduced the sentence by 6 months on the basis of Chad Casey’s promise to give evidence in line with his undertaking to assist in the future. He was therefore convicted to a term of imprisonment totalling 2 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 15 months. He served that sentence from 5 March 2009 until his release on 4 June 2010.

16   In his ERISP interview on 11 November 2008, when asked what he could tell the Police about the incident on 16 June 2008, he answered 

‘It was me and me brother and me mate.’ (Q 19)

17   When asked his brother’s name he said ‘Terrence Casey’ (Q25). He identified the other person as someone named Tim who was a big Fijian bloke. When asked what they did when they observed the victim walk down Banna Lane, he said:

‘We were walking after him. He was, I was in front, Terry was behind and Tim was back at the road, and Terrence ran past me and grabbed the …’ (Q 62)

18   When asked what then happened he gave the following answer:

‘Well, the, Terry started hittin’ him and, I didn’t hit him, I was holding the, these beers, beer bottles in my hand. Tim ran up and started hitting him and I don’t know, they just kept saying, give us, take your jacket off. Tim was saying ‘take your jacket off’ to that bloke and he took his jacket off and then Tim ran off. Then I took off and then Terry stayed, and he was doing something and I yelled out to Terry said let’s go, and we took off.’ (Q 71)

19   He told Police that his brother Terry was in Queensland.

20   On 3 February 2009, when asked what he could tell about the incident on 16 June 2008, he gave the following answer:

‘Well, just me and Terrence Casey and Carl Paula, I think his name is, Paula, we were just up the main street of Griffith and we’ve seen the Indian, like I think he was Indian, his background I think, walking and the boys asked him for a cigarette and he didn’t have any so we followed him down to where the back of the alley is, behind Dick Smith and my brother Terrence ran past me and I asked, I grabbed the bloke and he was saying something and then, yeah, Terrence hit him and then they started fighting. I think the bloke was just defending himself or not, or something, I don’t know but Terrence just kept hitting him and Carl was behind me, then when we got up to where the bloke was, the boys just kept, just kept hitting him.’ (Q 9).

21   He identified himself, Terrence and Carl as all following the victim down the alley (Q 44). He repeated that Terrence ran past him and grabbed the bloke and then hit him in the face and just kept hitting him (Q 50-68). He then described Terrence chasing the victim into a house in the alley (Q 90). He and Terrence just then left, they ran to the shops and then they saw Carl at Willows Park (Q 103-104). He further stated that Terrence cut his right hand on a smashed beer bottle (Q 112-116).

22   When asked in chief of his recollection of the events on 16 June 2008, Chad Casey had little recollection of that evening. He was shown the transcript of his ERISP interview on 11 November 2008. He gave evidence that it was him and two Fijians who had been drinking on that night. Their names were Carl and Timothy. It was the two Fijians who first spoke to the victim in their own language and following the incident, they went their separate ways.

23   An application was then made by the Crown pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 and leave was given to the Crown to cross examine the witness Chad Casey. That evidence established that Chad and Terrence Casey had been working together ‘every now and again’ as contract house painters.

24   When questioned about his ERISP interview on 11 November 2008, Chad Casey gave evidence that some of his answers were lies. He was questioned about the matters referred to above in which he had implicated his brother Terrence and stated they were lies. He agreed that he had spoken to Police prior to his Court appearance in March 2009 and the DVD of that interview was played. It became exhibit C, and the transcript was tendered as an aide memoire (exhibit D). The matters referred to above were put to Chad Casey as implicating his brother Terrence, together with some additional matters. He understood that the purpose of the second interview with Police was to give them a fuller version which had to be the truth and that by giving that evidence it was to be used against the other two offenders, one of whom was his brother Terrence. He agreed that he had given an undertaking to give evidence in accordance with that statement. When asked whether he was telling the truth during that second interview, his answer was ‘No’. It was put to him that he had identified his brother Terrence in the two interviews as being a co-offender and that he had been telling the truth then, to which he answered ‘No’.

25   Chad Casey was then cross-examined by Counsel for the accused. He admitted that he was not at all times an honest person and that he had been dishonest about what happened on 16 June 2008. He had an extensive criminal record with a history of violence and dishonesty. 

26   He was cross-examined about a number of prior offences including charges laid in August 2008 of uttering counterfeit money. He identified the person referred to by him in his first ERISP interview as Tim as being one Civiaro Paulo. The name that he gave to Police of Carl Paulo was not the truth. He agreed with Counsel that he did not like to give people up to the authorities.

27   Moreover, he agreed that on 16 June 2008 Terrence Casey had not been with him. He had not seen Terrence that night and in fact had not seen him in the previous weeks.

28   He gave further evidence that he had had a girlfriend by the name of Skye Connors for a number of years. He had learnt that that person was going out with his brother Terrence and that had made him ‘a bit angry’. For that reason he falsely implicated Terrence in the offence of 16 June 2008.

29   He agreed that he had given the second induced statement following receiving legal advice that he may get a lighter sentence. He was at that time not long out of gaol for previous offences and understood that he may be leniently treated by way of a discount off his sentence by assisting the authorities. He knew at the time that he made it that the statement was not true.

30   It re-examination Chad Casey said that he heard about Skye Connors seeing his brother Terrence while he was in gaol. It was after the offence but he was not sure how long after the offence. It was probably months after and was before his first ERISP interview with the Police on 11 November 2008.”


	
	His Honour summarised the submissions on behalf of the Crown (at [31]-[32]) and the Applicant (at [33]-[38]).
	
	
	The trial Judge then outlined a number of directions and warnings for the purpose of s.133(2) and (3) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. These directions and warnings included:
	



	
	an unreliability warning with respect to the evidence of Chad Casey under s.165(1)(b) and (d) Evidence Act 1995 (at [40]);
	
	
	a direction in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 concerning the need for great care in scrutinising the evidence of Chad Casey (at [41]-[42]);
	
	
	an associated direction that the Court must be satisfied that the evidence of Chad Casey was both honest and reliable, with his evidence to be examined very carefully in order for the Court to be satisfied that it could safely act upon that evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial (at [43]);
	
	
	a direction that, as the Crown relied solely upon the evidence of Chad Casey, the Court must acquit the Applicant if it was unable to accept any part of the evidence of Chad Casey beyond reasonable doubt (at [44]);
	
	
	a direction that the Court should have regard to the demeanour of Chad Casey in the witness box, but that the Court must be careful about drawing conclusions from demeanour alone (Cawthray v R [2013] NSWCCA 105 at [52]) (at [46]).
	



	
	In moving to the Court’s decision, his Honour expressed satisfaction to the criminal standard with respect to the elements of the offences and the account of Mr Bashir concerning the commission of the offence (at [47]-[48]).
	
	
	The trial Judge then turned to the question as to whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was one of the three offenders. As this reasoning is under challenge on the appeal, it is appropriate to set it out in full (trial judgment, 20 February 2014 at [49]-[54]):
	


“49   The real issue in the trial is whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was one of the three offenders. It is clear that the description given by Mr Bashir of the three men is not evidence that could establish the identity of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. For that the Crown relies on the evidence of Chad Casey. His evidence, in terms of his ERISP interview and induced statement, and his oral evidence in the trial are set out above. It is clear that in both his ERISP interview and his induced statement he clearly identified his brother Terrence Casey, the accused, as one of the three offenders and described his role in the offence in some detail, consistently in both the interviews. He did so in his ERISP without any inducement. In the second statement on 3 February 2009, there was a real inducement, namely, that he could obtain a further discount on his sentence for providing assistance to the authorities and by undertaking to give evidence in accordance with that statement. However, in his evidence he denied telling the truth during that second interview and denied that his brother Terrence was a co-offender in the offence. In cross-examination by counsel for the accused he gave evidence that Terrence Casey was not with him on the night, and the reason he had falsely implicated the accused in the offence was that whilst he had been in prison (i.e. some time during the period 6 September 2008 and 5 March 2009) he had learnt that his former girlfriend was going out with his brother Terrence and that that had made him ‘a bit angry’.

50   I am mindful that the accused has the presumption of innocence in his favour and has not given evidence. The accused is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove his guilt. The right to silence and the presumption of innocence mean that the accused’s election not to call evidence cannot be used against him. His election not to offer any explanation constitutes no admission by the accused and no such inference must be drawn from that fact. Nor must such an election be used to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the Crown.

51   The question whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt therefore must be determined as to whether or not I accept the version of events given by Chad Casey in his ERISP interview and his induced statement, or whether I accept his sworn evidence before me that he lied in those interviews when implicating his brother Terrence and that his motive for doing so was that he was angry that Terrence Casey had taken up with his ex-girlfriend. If I accept the latter, then I must acquit Terrence Casey of the charge on the indictment.

52   I do not accept the sworn evidence given by Chad Casey in which he recanted those parts of exhibits B and C in which he implicated Terrence in the offence. My reasons for not accepting that evidence are follows:

(1)   The version of events which Chad Casey gave in both exhibit B and Exhibit C are largely consistent, notwithstanding that there was more detail provided by him in his induced statement. His motive for giving that statement was clear, namely, to obtain a reduced sentence for himself.

(2)   At the time of giving his ERISP interview he knew that Terrence Casey was outside the jurisdiction and told Police that he was in Queensland.

(3)   The description given by the victim Mr Bashir in his statement to Police on 20 June 2008 identified only one of the three offenders as being ‘like a Samoan’. This is consistent with both exhibit B and C in that in each statement Chad Casey described only one man of Fijian heritage, albeit he provided no less than three different names for that person. That makes it inherently unlikely that his evidence in Court that there were two Fijians present was the truth.

(4)   Mr Bashir also described two of the assailants as being men in their 20’s.

(5)   The differences in description of the co-offenders as set out in the schedule relied on by Counsel for the accused which highlighted the differences between the various descriptions given by the victim Mr Bashir and Mr Chad Casey, are not determinative of the identity of the co-offenders. The fact that the victim gave indefinite descriptions as to the colour of the clothing worn by each assailant is of little weight given the circumstances in which he was attacked and robbed.

(6)   I had the opportunity of observing Chad Casey give evidence in the trial. His demeanour in the witness box, particularly when being cross-examined on the content of his ERISP interview and induced statement, was unimpressive. 

(7)   Counsel for the accused submitted that Chad Casey was a proven liar and the Court would not accept anything he said. I do not accept that submission as the two parts of his evidence were diametrically opposed. Either he was truthful in his ERISP interview and induced statement, or in his sworn evidence on the issue of Terrence Casey’s involvement in the offences. This is the type of decision juries often have to make when assessing the evidence of witnesses.

(8)   The versions given by Chad Casey in exhibits B and C consistently implicated his brother Terrence. He had a motive to do so, namely to assist the Police and thereby gain a greater discount to his sentence. He understood the consequences of him doing so. 

(9)   His explanation for recanting that evidence was implausible. It was inherently unlikely that he had given the Police on two occasions such consistent versions implicating Terrence Casey because he was ‘a bit angry’ with his brother for going with his ex-girlfriend. To accept the accused’s Counsel’s submission that none of his evidence could be accepted, it would apply equally to his evidence about his brother being with the ex-girlfriend. I find it inherently unlikely that that was truthful.

(10)   Moreover, there could be a number of reasons that would give Chad Casey a motive to exculpate his brother from the charge before the Court. They clearly have an ongoing relationship. They work together from time to time, although Chad Casey minimised that when asked about it. A motive of keeping his brother out of gaol would be sufficient for him to lie to the Court, in recanting his previous statements.

53   I therefore find that, on the basis of the content of the exhibits B and C referred to above, Terrence Casey was one of the three assailants and co offenders.

54   I therefore find that the Crown has proved each of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.”

Approach to Appeal Against Conviction from Trial by Judge Alone


	
	Before moving to consider the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to make some observations concerning the nature of a conviction appeal from a Judge-alone trial.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal assert errors on the part of the trial Judge in aspects of his reasoning process (Grounds 2 and 3) and a contention that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence (Ground 1).
	
	
	The nature of a conviction appeal under ss.5 and 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from a verdict at a Judge-alone trial has been considered recently by the High Court of Australia in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 89 ALJR 776 and in the subsequent decision of this Court in RP v R [2015] NSWCCA 215. In Filippou v The Queen, French CJ. Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ referred (at 781[8]) to the three limbs in s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912:
	


“Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides in effect that the Court of Criminal Appeal shall allow an appeal against conviction if:

(1)    the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence; or

(2)    where the judgment of the court of trial is wrong by reason of wrong decision of a question of law; or

(3)    for any other ground there has been a miscarriage of justice,

provided that the Court may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.”


	
	With respect to the first limb under s.6(1), the plurality said in Filippou v The Queen at 781 [11]-[12]:
	


“[11]    Beginning with the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it is clear from the terms of s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act that the effect of the latter provision is to equate a judge’s finding of guilt to a jury’s finding of guilt ‘for all purposes’. It follows from the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of s 133(1) that, for the purposes of an appeal against conviction under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act, a judge’s finding of guilt is to be treated as if it were the same as a jury’s finding of guilt.

[12]    Authority makes plain that a jury’s finding of guilt is not to be disturbed unless it appears that there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the evidence is all the one way, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or unless there has been a misdirection leading to a miscarriage of justice. It follows perforce of s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act that, in the case of an appeal against a judge’s finding of guilt, the finding is not to be disturbed under the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act unless there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or the evidence was all the one way, or the judge has so misdirected himself or herself on a matter of law as to result in a miscarriage of justice. It is, however, to be borne steadily in mind that, as with a jury’s verdict, so also with the judgment and verdict of a judge alone, in most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which the judge ought to have experienced. To adopt and adapt the language of M v R [[1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494]:

It is only where a [judge’s] advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. … If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the [judge], there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.”


	
	The second limb of s.6(1) was addressed by their Honours at 781-782 [13]:
	


“Turning to the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it will be seen that to some extent it overlaps the first. A ‘wrong decision of any question of law’ includes misdirections on matters of substantive law as well as misdirections on matters of adjectival law. And, as with the first limb, the question under the second limb will be whether the error constitutes a miscarriage of justice in the sense of a departure from trial according to law.”


	
	Their Honours said with respect to the third limb at 782 [14]:
	


“The third limb covers cases where, by reason of irregularity or otherwise, an accused has not received a trial according to law or has not received a fair trial.”


	
	The plurality returned to the task of this Court under s.5 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 at 787 [48]:
	


“As was earlier explained, an appeal from judge alone under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act is not an appeal by way of rehearing. Having identified error, the task for the Court of Criminal Appeal is to determine whether the error is productive of a miscarriage of justice.”


	
	Their Honours addressed the topic of warnings and directions in a Judge-alone trial at 788 [52]:
	


“Subject to statute, judges are required to give juries particular warnings such as a Longman warning, a Domican warning, an accomplice warning or a Pollitt warning, for the purpose of alerting juries to particular difficulties with particular classes of evidence with which they are unlikely to be familiar. Perforce of s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, the same applies to trial by judge alone. As was explained in Fleming, the obligation under s 133(3) ‘to take [a] warning into account’ requires that the particular warning be included in the judge’s reasons for judgment. But it is different in the case of directions other than warnings. Apart from warnings of the kind referred to in s 133(3), judges are required to give juries certain ineluctable directions as to matters such as the functions of the judge and jury, the burden and standard of proof, what constitutes evidence, the drawing of inferences from direct evidence, the care to be exercised in drawing inferences and, if an inference forms an essential step in the jury’s process of reasoning to guilt, the need to be satisfied of that inference beyond reasonable doubt. Such directions are principles of law within the meaning of s 133(2) and therefore, in the case of trial by judge alone, must be applied. But it is sufficient if a judge’s reasons show either expressly or by implication that they have been so applied.”


	
	In RP v R, Davies J said (with the concurrence of myself), in the context of a conviction appeal from a Judge-alone trial (at [48]):
	


“For a verdict to be unreasonable it is not enough that review of the evidence demonstrates that it was possible for the tribunal of fact to reach a different conclusion: Lazaris v R [2014] NSWCCA 163 at [65]. As Hayne J said (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing) in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113]:

But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard,

or as the joint judgment said in Filippou at [56],

[T]he question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was not whether it was ‘satisfied that the judge’s account was correct’ but whether her Honour’s findings as to the sequence of events were not reasonably open.”


	
	Davies J observed in RP v R at [52]:
	


“The significant difference between a trial with a jury and a judge alone trial is that the judge is obliged to make findings of fact and to identify the principles of law applied by the judge: s 133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The reasoning the judge has employed to reach the relevant findings is exposed to examination and analysis in the way an inscrutable jury verdict cannot be. The reasoning will identify what matters have been considered by the judge in making any finding. That enables this Court to determine at least whether there is no or insufficient evidence to support a finding or that the evidence was all one way or has misdirected himself or herself on a matter of law.”

Ground 2 - Suggested Failure in Assessing Reliability of Crown Witness


	
	It is appropriate to consider firstly the second ground of appeal which challenges part of the reasoning process of the trial Judge.
	


Submissions of the Parties


	
	Mr Ozen, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that the trial Judge had erred in concentrating upon the credibility of Chad Casey and not reliability. It was submitted further that the trial Judge had erred in posing what were described as “binary choices” (at [51], [52](7) of the trial judgment (see [19] above) in identifying the need for a choice between the two parts of Chad Casey’s evidence which “were diametrically opposed”.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the concentration upon issues of credibility of the witness did not comply with the requirements of the law to assess issues of reliability as well: Douglass v The Queen [2012] HCA 34; 86 ALJR 1086 at 1096 [46]-[48]; Cawthray v R at [53]-[55]; Murray v The Queen [2002] HCA 26; 211 CLR 193 at 201-202 [23], 212-213 [57].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the trial Judge had acknowledged the need to consider the questions of credibility and reliability with respect to the evidence of Chad Casey and that his Honour did consider both aspects in his reasons. The Crown submitted that there was no dispute that there had been a robbery committed upon Mr Bashir in this case, nor was there any dispute that Chad Casey was one of the robbers. Neither Mr Bashir’s account, nor the account of Chad Casey to the police, asserted the presence of more than three persons at the scene of the crime. Accordingly, the Crown submitted there was little opportunity for Chad Casey to confuse whether the Applicant (his own brother) had been involved or the role that he had played.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that what had been said in Douglass v The Queen and Cawthray v R related to the importance of an assessment of the reliability (as well as credibility) of a young child witness in a sexual assault case and that the circumstances of those cases were far removed from the present case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this was, in truth, a trial where the credibility of Chad Casey was the principal consideration as to the two different accounts he had given to police. It was submitted that the trial Judge had addressed the real issue which concerned the honesty of the account of Chad Casey.
	


Decision


	
	The trial Judge was well aware of the need to consider both the credibility and reliability of Chad Casey and the accounts which he had given. In identifying the differing accounts of Chad Casey, his Honour did not erroneously set up “binary choices” as asserted by the Applicant.
	
	
	There was no issue at this trial that Mr Bashir had been robbed by three men. Chad Casey admitted that he was one of the assailants. The real issue in contention was whether Chad Casey was truthful in asserting in two interviews with the police that one of the other assailants was his brother, the Applicant.
	
	
	His Honour directed himself that it was necessary for the Court to be satisfied that the incriminating version of Chad Casey was both honest and reliable (trial judgment, 20 February 2014 at [43] at [17](c) above). The focus of his Honour’s reasons was the honesty or credibility of Chad Casey’s accounts to the police, which placed the Applicant as one of the offenders against Mr Bashir. There was no scope here for mistaken identity, or confusion or mistake on any other identifiable basis. It could hardly be suggested that he would mistakenly place his own brother as a person involved criminally in this offence.
	
	
	There is no controversy with respect to the statements of principle contained in cases such as Murray v The Queen, Douglass v The Queen and Cawthray v R. However, what was said in those cases, in a very different context, has limited application to the resolution of the real issue in dispute in this trial.
	
	
	No error has been demonstrated by the Applicant in this regard. I would reject the second ground of appeal.
	


Ground 3 - Complaint About Suggested Failures to Put Propositions to the Witness, Chad Casey

Submissions of Parties


	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that the trial Judge’s reasoning (trial judgment, 20 February 2014 at [52](9)-(10)) (at [19] above) involved components which should have been put to Chad Casey in questioning by the Crown at trial, but which were not. In particular, it was submitted that it should have been put to Chad Casey that he was lying because of the nature of the ongoing relationship with his brother which, if put, would have given the witness an opportunity to discuss the nature of the ongoing relationship. Further it was submitted that it should have been put to Chad Casey that he was lying because of his concern about the possible consequences if he adhered to his versions in the record of interview. It was said that Chad Casey should also have been challenged concerning his “ex-girlfriend” explanation, so that he could respond to a contrary proposition on that topic. It was submitted that these matters should not have formed part of his Honour’s judgment as they had not been put to the witness.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no error had occurred on the part of the trial Judge in this respect. There had been cross-examination by the Crown of Chad Casey concerning the relationship he had with the Applicant at the time of the trial. Likewise, it was submitted that there was cross-examination as to the truthfulness of the account given by Chad Casey in his recorded interview with police. It was submitted that no error had been demonstrated.
	


Decision


	
	By way of the third ground of appeal, the Applicant asserts that there has been unfairness in the trial arising from an alleged breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67. It is commonly accepted that this rule of practice is based upon the goal of achieving fairness in the conduct of litigation: RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209 at 223 [93]. The nature of the rule, and its application to criminal as well as civil proceedings, were considered by this Court in Khamis v R [2010] NSWCCA 179; 203 A Crim R 121 at 128-130 [29]-[35].
	
	
	In considering whether any unfairness has occurred in the context of this trial, it is appropriate to have regard to the course of evidence of Chad Casey. As noted by the trial Judge (at [23] of the trial judgment set out at [15] above), the examination-in-chief of Chad Casey reached the point where the Crown was granted leave to cross-examine him under s.38 Evidence Act 1995. It was put clearly to Chad Casey by the Crown that his first and second accounts given to police were truthful, where he said that the Applicant was one of the three persons involved in the commission of the offence against Mr Bashir (transcript, 13 February 2014, page 22; AB248).
	
	
	It must be kept in mind that the matter referred to by the trial Judge (at [52](9) at [19] above) related to Chad Casey’s account, given under cross-examination by counsel for the Applicant, as to why he (the witness) had changed his story from one implicating his brother to one which exculpated him. It was open to the trial Judge to find that the account given by Chad Casey in this respect was implausible and inherently unlikely. It was not necessary for a question to be put to Chad Casey along those lines before the trial Judge could make a finding which clearly arose from the Crown case that these aspects of his evidence were untrue. The rule in Browne v Dunn does not require formulaic propositions to be put.
	
	
	With respect to the matters raised by the trial Judge (at [52](10) at [19] above) as to reasons why Chad Casey may wish to exculpate his brother from the charge before the Court, there was cross-examination by the Crown concerning contact between the two brothers prior to the trial (transcript, 13 February 2014, pages 10-12; AB236-238).
	
	
	After cross-examination by counsel for the Applicant, the Crown re-examined Chad Casey on aspects concerning the ex-girlfriend issue (transcript, 13 February 2014, pages 31-32; AB257-258).
	
	
	In the circumstances of this trial, there could have been no doubt concerning the parts of Chad Casey’s evidence which the Crown submitted were truthful and those which were not. The explanations advanced by Chad Casey as to why his account changed from one which inculpated his brother to one which exculpated him, were matters for the trial Judge to assess in making findings of fact and reaching a verdict at the trial.
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated that any unfairness occurred in this case, let alone circumstances which were productive of a miscarriage of justice. I would reject the third ground of appeal.
	


Ground 1 - The Unreasonable Verdict Ground

Submissions of the Parties


	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable and was not supported by the evidence.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that there was inconsistency in the accounts given by Chad Casey such that it was not open to the trial Judge to find the Applicant guilty.
	
	
	Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the verdict of guilty in this case was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. He submitted that it was not open to the trial Judge, on the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was one of the assailants in the offence committed against Mr Bashir.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that it was not open to the trial Judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the first account given by Chad Casey to police was reliable and credible so as to support the verdict. Counsel for the Applicant relied upon submissions made in support of the first ground of appeal.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to the trial Judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Applicant. His Honour saw Chad Casey give evidence and had regard to all the evidence in reaching the level of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt disclosed in the trial judgment.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to the trial Judge to convict the Applicant. The trial Judge had regard to all of the evidence, which included the police interviews with Chad Casey (including a video-recorded interview) which implicated the Applicant. Chad Casey was cross-examined by the Crown under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 which allowed his account to be tested. It was open to the trial Judge to accept the truth of what he said in the first and second interviews with police.
	
	
	The Crown repeated submissions made in the context of the first ground of appeal. It was submitted that this case, in reality, was one where the credibility of Chad Casey was in question. He had nominated his brother as one of the three offenders in his initial interviews with police and there was no role for mistake which may bear upon reliability in this case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the verdict of guilty was not unreasonable and was supported by the evidence.
	


Decision


	
	I have had regard to the entirety of the evidence for the purpose of considering this ground of appeal. I bear in mind, as well, that the trial Judge has the advantage over this Court in that he had an opportunity to observe Chad Casey give evidence. That said, the trial Judge appropriately kept in mind that the role of demeanour in fact finding should be kept in proper perspective (see [17](e) above).
	
	
	His Honour had the advantage, as well, of seeing the video-recorded interview of Chad Casey on the occasion when he gave answers implicating the Applicant.
	
	
	The reasoning of the trial Judge is not attended by error. The question then arising for consideration is whether the verdict of guilty was not open to the trial Judge in the sense explained in Filippou v The Queen and RP v R (see [22]-[23], [28]-[29] above).
	
	
	The role of the s.38 cross-examination of Chad Casey was important in this trial. What occurred here constitutes an illustration of what Heydon JA (Dunford and Buddin JJ agreeing) described in R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; 54 NSWLR 474 at 486 [66]:
	


“One purpose of a s 38 examination must be to enable counsel calling the witness to demonstrate that the evidence in chief which led to the s 38 order is false. Another must be to enable counsel to demonstrate that any prior statement inconsistent with it is true. That latter purpose is assisted by s 60, which permits a prior inconsistent statement to be considered as evidence of what is represented, not merely as a matter affecting credibility. But s 60 by itself is not wholly effectual unless the questioner is able to interrogate with a view to demonstrating the truth of the prior inconsistent statement. There would be little point in permitting s 38 examinations otherwise and no point in the existence of s 38(3). The purposes described can be assisted by obtaining concessions from the witness about matters tending to indicate the falsity of the impugned evidence. One of these is the lateness with which the impugned story is advanced. Another is the inherent improbability of the impugned story. These purposes must also be capable of being assisted by the eliciting of evidence tending to show the truthfulness of prior statements inconsistent with the impugned evidence, such as the fact that they were made under conditions conducive to accurate recollection and expression and conducive to sincerity.”


	
	As Ipp JA (Bell J agreeing) observed in R v Parkes [2003] NSWCCA 12; 147 A Crim R 450 at 464 [83], the use of s.38 permits a truer picture of the situation to emerge, and that is the very purpose underlying the section.
	
	
	In the present trial, his Honour was satisfied that Chad Casey’s first and second accounts to police were true. Further, his Honour considered that Chad Casey’s proffered reasons for changing his account were implausible, a finding which was open on all the evidence.
	
	
	Having considered all the evidence, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the verdict of guilty was not open to the trial Judge. This was a case where Chad Casey’s first and second accounts implicated both himself and his brother in a credible fashion. The features of Chad Casey’s evidence which strained credulity were those where he sought to explain away why he had given the early accounts which implicated both himself and his brother. The findings of the trial Judge with respect to the implausibility of Chad Casey’s evidence in this respect were well open on the evidence.
	
	
	It has not been demonstrated that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence. I would reject the first ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	appeal against conviction dismissed.
	



	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Johnson J’s conclusions as to each of the three grounds of appeal advanced by the Applicant. I also add that having myself considered the evidence, I consider that the trial Judge's conclusions were open and that his Honour was not bound to have entertained a doubt about the Applicant’s guilt of the offence charged.
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with the analysis and conclusions of Johnson J, and with the orders his Honour proposes.

2769356,Williams v R [2016] NSWCCA 68,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: Michael Williams seeks leave to appeal against the severity of an aggregate sentence imposed by Bennett DCJ on 7 November 2014. The offences with which Mr Williams was charged were as follows:
	


Count 1: Larceny of alcohol valued at $241,050 on 25 April 2012 contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 5 years imprisonment.

Count 2: Supply not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, being 432.99g between 26 July 2012 and 7 September 2012 contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment and/or $385,000. This offence carries a standard non-parole period of ten years.

Form 1: Destroy property by means of fire, being a motor vehicle in company on 11 July 2012 contrary to s 195(1A)(b) of the Crimes Act, This offence carries a maximum penalty of 11 years imprisonment. It was to be taken into account upon sentence for Count 2.

Count 3: Supply not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, being 453g on or about 19 September 2012 contrary to s 25(2) of the Act.


	
	Mr Williams pleaded guilty to counts 1 and 2 and to the offence on the Form 1. He was found guilty and convicted by his Honour on count 3 following a judge alone trial on 20 May 2014. Mr Williams was sentenced by his Honour on 22 May 2014 for these offences to an aggregate sentence of 5 years imprisonment to date from 20 March 2014 and to expire on 19 March 2018 with an additional term of 3 years and 6 months to expire on 19 September 2021.
	
	
	Mr Williams appeals to this Court against the severity of the sentence on a number of grounds as follows:
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the offence of [offer to] supply not less than the commercial quantity was an offence that fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness.

Ground 2: His Honour erred in failing to assess or properly assess the objective gravity of the offence of supply not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in placing significant weight upon offences alleged to have been committed by the offender whilst in custody.

Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing properly to apply the principle of totality by commencing the aggregate sentence at the expiry of the fixed terms being served at the time.

Ground 5: His Honour erred in finding that as a result of the psychological report submitted by the appellant on sentence that [sic] there was a need to attribute a significant weight to the protection of the community to meet the risk that the offender poses.

Ground 6: The sentences [sic] imposed are manifestly excessive.

Ground 7: His Honour erred in imposing a sentence that infringed the principle of parity.

Background


	
	Mr Williams’ pleas of guilty were the subject of agreed facts. They were relevantly as follows.
	
	
	A registered police source met Mr Williams approximately ten years ago when he was involved in the trotting industry. Shortly afterwards the source went back to his employment as an interstate truck driver. In late 2011 the police source met up again with Mr Williams through a mutual connection with Little Athletics. The police source was using speed to help him stay awake. During that meeting they discussed the use of speed (methylamphetamine).
	
	
	On 24 April 2012, the police source picked up a load of 34 pallets of mixed alcohol belonging to Woolworths Pty Ltd from a depot in Laverton, Victoria. He later reported the truck as stolen. In May 2012, police became aware that the police source had been involved in the theft of the truck and he was interviewed. He was subsequently given an inducement and provided police with a version of events that disclosed his drug relationship with Mr Williams.
	
	
	On 5 July 2012, police commenced intercepting Mr Williams’ telephone.
	
	
	On 17 July 2012, a controlled operation was approved. This involved the police source approaching Mr Williams to purchase methylamphetamine. During the course of the operation Mr Williams regularly changed his mobile phone number.
	


First Supply – 26 July 2012


	
	On about 23 July 2012, the police source contacted Mr Williams and they arranged to meet. On 26 July 2012, they met and the police source asked to purchase two ounces of methylamphetamine. Police then intercepted calls from Mr Williams arranging the source of the drugs to be supplied. The police source was provided with $2,500 and he went to the arranged meeting point at a lookout on Remembrance Drive at Razorback. Mr Williams got out of his car and handed him an envelope in return for the $2,500. He noticed that there was another male in the driver’s seat of the car. The envelope was later provided to police and found to contain 55.3 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 10.5 percent. The following day the police commenced intercepting the telephone number that Mr Williams was using to contact the police source.
	


Second Supply – 2 August 2012


	
	On 1 August 2012, the police source arranged to purchase two ounces of methylamphetamine from Mr Williams. Police then intercepted calls from him arranging the source of the drugs to be supplied. The following day the police source contacted Mr Williams and arranged another meeting at the same location. He was once again provided with $2,500 by police and went to the arranged meeting place. The police source was fitted with a listening device. At about 1.40pm he received a call from Mr Williams who told him to move up the road. The police source moved his car to the substation on Mount Hercules Road. Mr Williams was standing outside a bronze coloured car. He gave the police source a newspaper with a brown paper bag inside it in return for the money. The conversation was recorded and during the conversation Mr Williams offered some advice about selling the drugs. The Crown case is that the car was being driven by Mr Williams’ co-accused.
	
	
	The bag provided by Mr Williams was then given to police and its contents were analysed and found to be 55.29 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 11.5 percent.
	


Third Supply – 6 August 2012


	
	On 6 August 2012 the police source contacted Mr Williams and arranged to purchase four ounces of methylamphetamine. Police then intercepted calls from Mr Williams arranging the source of the drugs to be supplied. A meeting was initially set for the same place in Razorback. The following day the police source was provided with $5,000 by the police. He was fitted with a listening device. Mr Williams contacted him and said he needed 40 minutes. At around 1pm the meeting place was changed to the Cobbitty shops. When the police source arrived there he saw Mr Williams’ co-accused who had just got out of Mr Williams’ car. The police source recognised the car from the last occasion when it had been parked in the car park with Mr Williams standing beside it. The conversation between the two was recorded. Mr Williams provided the police source with 110.1 grams of methylamphetamine, which was in the glove box of the car, in return for the $5,000. The police source provided the drugs to police which were analysed and found to have a purity of 8.5 percent.
	


Fourth Supply – 24 August 2012


	
	On 20 August 2012, the police source contacted Mr Williams and requested a further four ounces of methylamphetamine. Police then intercepted calls from Mr Williams arranging the source of the drugs to be supplied. The initial meeting arranged for 21 August 2012 was postponed to 24 August 2012. The supply was confirmed the following day. On 24 August 2012 police provided the police source with $5,000 and fitted him with a listening device. On this occasion the meeting took place in the Razorback area. The police source travelled to the phone tower on Old Hercules Road. Mr Williams contacted him and told him to follow him in a silver Toyota Hilux. The vehicle stopped on the side of the road and the police source pulled in behind him. Mr Williams provided him with 104.4 grams of methylamphetamine which was later analysed by the police and found to be of 8.5 percent purity. The conversation between the two was recorded. It is the Crown case that the co-accused drove Mr Williams to the meeting.
	


Fifth Supply – 6 September 2012


	
	On 3 September 2012 the police source contacted Mr Williams and arranged the purchase of four ounces of methylamphetamine for 6 September 2012. Police then intercepted calls from Mr Williams arranging the source of the drugs to be supplied. On that day he was provided with $5,000 by police and fitted with a listening device. The police source travelled to the phone tower in Razorback and waited. On this occasion he saw Mr Williams’ vehicle drive past the meeting point and then return. Mr Williams got out of the vehicle from the passenger’s side and supplied the police source with 108.2 grams of methylamphetamine which was later analysed and found to have a purity of 10 percent. The police source gave Mr Williams the $5,000. The conversation was recorded on a listening device.
	
	
	Police intercepted Mr Williams’ telephone calls for at least ten weeks from 5 July 2012 until his arrest on 20 September 2012. During that time there was no evidence of any drug supply other than that which was the subject of the controlled operation.
	
	
	On 11 September 2013, at Campbelltown Local Court Mr Williams pleaded guilty to these offences.
	


Destroy property in company using fire


	
	Throughout June and July 2012, Mr Williams’ de facto partner Natasha Skopin was not residing at their family home at Razorback. She was living with her cousin Rebecca Lambey and her partner Tyson Akosfalui in Bold Street, Cabramatta.
	
	
	On 10 July 2012, Mr Williams was involved in a domestic related incident with Ms Skopin. That incident commenced at Donalds Range Road, Razorback. As a result of the incident Mr Williams contacted several of Ms Skopin’s relatives and friends and warned each of them not to assist her in any way by conveying her to work or their children to school. Mr Williams made direct threats to these people, one of whom was Tyson Akosfalui, indicating that if they went against his wishes he would burn that person’s car.
	
	
	On 11 July 2012, Mr Williams discovered that Ms Skopin had used a motor vehicle that belonged to Mr Akosfalui to drive her children to school and herself to work. Mr Williams contacted Mr Akosfalui and reminded him he had been told not to lend the vehicle to Ms Skopin and that he should expect it to be damaged.
	
	
	On the evening of 11 July 2012 Ms Skopin, Mr Akosfalui and Rebecca Lambey were all at home asleep. Ms Skopin was awoken by a rock hitting her window. There was a loud banging on the front door. The three went outside and found that Mr Akosfalui’s car was on fire. It was parked outside the front of the premises. A neighbour assisted to contain the fire. The fire brigade arrived and extinguished it. They established an accelerant had been used to start the fire. A clear plastic bottle with the remnants of petrol was located on the back seat of the vehicle. A detached spray nozzle was also located. The rear passenger window had been broken.
	
	
	The vehicle was damaged beyond repair. The vehicle was insured. Mr Akosfalui had to pay his excess.
	


Offer to supply


	
	The facts found by his Honour with respect to the offence of which Mr Williams was found guilty by his Honour in the judge alone trial were summarised in his remarks on sentence in these terms:
	


“On 14 September 2012 at 9.20am the registered source telephoned the offender. The offender referred to the source earning money as a driver and the source said, ‘Oh, well I’ll earn a fucking quid for you if you can fucking do it for me’. The offender said ‘What?’ The source said, ‘I need a pound by next Thursday, man’. The offender said, ‘Uh, I’ll ring you back. I’ll ring you back’. The source said, ‘All right then, mate’.

On 17 September 2012 at 3.36pm, three days later the offender called the source, who misrepresented that he was on his way to Brisbane. The initial exchange in this call concerned the source’s attempting to earn money. The source then went on to describe how he was entering a hospital on the following Monday for surgery to his shoulders. There was a discussion about that and how he would be out of action for about a month in the course of which the source said, ‘Yeah, that’s why I sort of planned on getting that big one up to old mate, because he knows I’m going to be out of action for a month’.

The offender asked questions about ‘old mate’ and how the source knew him. The source represented, ‘and yeah, yeah, no, he’s fucking, no, he’s good’. I found the source v.to be representing the person’s bona fides in the context of these transactions.

There was reference to a lot of money there all the time and ‘old mate’, a truckie who did runs up north to North Queensland. The offender said, ‘yeah. All right, well then when are you back down? I’ll speak to you, when are you back down?’ The source said he would be down tomorrow night. The offender said, ‘Oh right, give us a buzz anyway. I’ll give you a buzz and I’ll catch up to you and have a chat’.

On 19 September 2012 at 9.25am the offender sent a text message to the source ‘at work, finish 3.30’. At 9.28am the source responded, ‘okay bud, got twenty grand in cash, talk later today’. At 2.07pm the same day the offender communicated with a man identified as Craig Mears, represented on the transcript as Wally. After some banter the offender said, ‘All right. Listen, listen, how do, listen, do you trust this cunt or not?’ Mears said, ‘what, what one?’ The offender said, ‘the other bloke’. Mears said, ‘Paxter’. The offender said, ‘what?’ Mears said, ‘Pakky?’ The offender said, ‘talking about the other’. Mears then said, ‘Oh, nah, nah, yeah, nah nah, oh yeah I don’t know ..(unintelligible).. All the time, I don’t know, man, you, you used to be good like that ..(pause).. Well he hasn’t done nothing, he hasn’t done nothing. What, he’s upping it again?’

The offender said, ‘fucking oath’. Mears said, ‘it’s, if it’s cash, fuck. We’ll just drive past’. The offender laughed and Mears said, ‘we’ll just drive past and see if he’s got anyone there.’ The offender said, ‘all right, well I’ll see you anyway, ten, keep your phone on fuck you, see you’, and Mears said, ‘see you’.

At 3.45pm on 19 September 2012 the offender texted to the source ‘what time u leaving?’ At 4.12pm the offender called the source. They discussed where the source was and that he would not be in until late that night. Then the source said, ‘in the morning’. The offender said, ‘all right, let me, let me speak to you tonight anyway all right’. The source said, ‘So, yeah, so roughly’. The offender said, ‘yeah. I’ll come I’ll speak to you tonight anyway, just a bit after all right.’ After further exchanges they terminated the call.

Thereafter there was a text message from the source to the offender in the following terms, ‘hey mate I’m on a tight ship in the morning, can I meet U on the hill around 8.30/9 mate, I have to be back in Brisbane tomorrow night’. Then at 6.24pm the offender responded with the letter ‘k’.

The Crown case was that the agreement was entered at that point in the exchanges when the accused agreed and presented to the source that he agreed to supply the one pound or 453 grams of methylamphetamine. At 6.40pm the offender texted the source, ‘8.30 bud, b there’. In response, at 6.43pm, the source wrote, ‘no worries champ c u there’. On 20 September 2012 at 8.21am there was a text from the source, ‘be there in 15 to 20 champ’. Between 8.30am and 8.42am the text was repeated. Then at 8.45am the source texted, ‘just coming up the hill, mate’ in response to which the offender texted, ‘how far’. At 8.55am the source texted, ‘I’m here, bud’. The offender then texted, ‘I’m stuck, can u meet me where you use 2 park trailers.’ It was common ground that this was a reference to Smeaton Grange where the source parked his trailers in the course of his work as a truck driver. There followed texts as to how long before they would meet.

The police Air Wing was deployed to take part in the surveillance leading to the arrest of the offender.”

The indicative sentences


	
	In a detailed and carefully worded judgment, his Honour set out the indicative sentences referable to the individual substantive offences. Even though Mr Williams does not, and cannot, appeal against these indications, they inform to some extent the sentence that is the subject of this appeal. Those sentences were as follows:

Grounds 1 and 2


	
	Even though these grounds deal with different offences, they are all referable to a single aggregate sentence. It is therefore convenient to consider them together.
	
	
	In the case of the offer to supply charge, Mr Williams complains that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the police employed what he described as an agent provocateur. In this context there was no evidence that Mr Williams was supplying any other person with drugs during the period of the controlled operation. The drugs in question did not by definition find their way into the community as they were never supplied in fact. Mr Williams contended that it was significant that there was no evidence that he attempted to source the drugs to complete the arrangement.
	
	
	With respect to the supply count, Mr Williams submitted that his Honour failed to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. He maintained that his Honour also erred in giving what Mr Williams described as “substantial weight” to the Form 1 offence and by taking into account the objective seriousness of the domestic violence offences in assessing the gravity of that offence. He also relied upon the agent provocateur submission referred to earlier and the contention that his Honour failed to accord sufficient significance to the fact that the drugs did not find their way into the community.
	
	
	A difficulty with the way in which Mr Williams seeks to assail his Honour’s conclusions is that these several arguments are directed at the indicative sentences rather than the aggregate sentence actually imposed. Even if indicative sentences might be considered individually to be excessive, none is separately amenable to challenge on appeal and this Court should not be concerned with separate analysis of the indications. The correct approach is to consider the sentence that has been imposed in order to determine whether the aggregate sentence appropriately reflects the total criminality of all of the offences being considered: see JM v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39].
	
	
	The burden of Mr Williams’ submissions is a complaint that in varying respects his Honour “failed to give sufficient weight” to a number of factors such as the use of an agent provocateur, that the supply was only to an undercover policeman, that the drugs did not end up in the community, that the offence was only an offer to supply and the fact that there was no evidence that the drugs were actually sourced. Properly understood, these are submissions that acknowledge that his Honour correctly considered these matters but maintain dissatisfaction with the outcome. That is insufficient to demonstrate error in a classically discretionary exercise. Mr Williams does not contend that his Honour fell into error in the House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 54 CLR 499 sense, as the oft cited passage from that case at 504-5 eloquently reveals:
	


“But the judgment complained of, namely, sentence to a term of imprisonment, depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion by the court imposing it. The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred. Unlike courts of criminal appeal, this court has not been given a special or particular power to review sentences imposed upon convicted persons. Its authority to do so belongs to it only in virtue of its general appellate power. But even with respect to the particular jurisdiction conferred on courts of criminal appeal, limitations upon the manner in which it will be exercised have been formulated. Lord Alverstone L.C.J. said that it must appear that the judge imposing the sentence had proceeded upon wrong principles or given undue weight to some of the facts (R. v. Sidlow). Lord Reading L.C.J. said the court will not interfere because its members would have given a less sentence, but only if the sentence appealed from is manifestly wrong (R. v. Wolff). Lord Hewart L.C.J. has said that the court only interferes on matters of principle and on the ground of substantial miscarriage of justice (R. v. Dunbar). See, further, Skinner v. The King and Whittaker v. The King.”


	
	It is implicit at least in Mr Williams’ complaints that his Honour in fact considered the matters in question and afforded them some weight in his deliberations. It is insufficient for Mr Williams merely to say in this Court that a more favourable result would have been preferred.
	
	
	Mr Williams also complains that his Honour failed to consider or assess the objective seriousness of the offence. It is instructive in this context to recall what was said by Spigelman CJ in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]:
	


“[37] Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour…”


	
	Simpson J reinforced this sentiment in the same case at [46] as follows;
	


“[46] The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King …The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.”


	
	More recently, in Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150, the Crown complained that the trial judge had failed to determine the objective criminality of the offence. Hoeben CJ at CL said this at [56]:
	


“[56] While it is true that his Honour did not in terms assess the objective gravity of the offending, he did specifically refer to the factors which bore upon its objective seriousness. His Honour took account of the amount involved, the role of the appellant, the nature of the conduct and the period over which it took place. While it may have been preferable for his Honour to have made a specific assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, he did implicitly do so. I am satisfied that the factors to which his Honour referred were relevant and important and were given proper weight in the sentencing process. While his Honour may not have expressly determined the objective criminality of the offences, he clearly took that into account.”


	
	In my opinion it has not been demonstrated that in some relevant sense his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried. Mr Williams has not demonstrated that his Honour’s approach to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence was flawed. It is apparent that his Honour considered the offences to be of similar seriousness, having regard to the indicative sentences. The sentence for Count 2 reflected a discount of 25 percent and also took into account the Form 1. The indicative sentence of 8 years before the discount is therefore similar to the indicative sentence of 7 years without a discount on Count 3.
	
	
	Mr Williams also contends that his Honour’s assessment of the malicious damage offence was too harsh. However, that offence was a serious offence, as the agreed facts and his Honour’s analysis of them reveal. It carried a maximum sentence of 11 years if dealt with separately and involved the destruction of a motor vehicle. The conversations that record Mr Williams’ attitude to this offence do not demonstrate contrition or remorse. The destruction of the vehicle was also intentional, rather than merely reckless.
	
	
	Nor was there any error in the way in which his Honour approached the domestic violence offences in assessing the objective seriousness of the Form 1 offence. The offences were intimately connected and explained Mr Williams’ motivation to destroy the motor vehicle. It is not correct in my view to contend that his Honour was impermissibly distracted by the Form 1 offence.
	
	
	Finally, the fact that the drugs were never disseminated in the community is a matter of only minor significance. Mr Williams had the intention to supply and in doing so he knew and believed that the drugs would be likely ultimately to enter the community. The fortuitous circumstance that they did not was not something for which Mr Williams can claim credit and is therefore not something that assists him greatly on sentence. Mr Williams’ moral culpability is not greatly reduced as a result: see R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186; (2011) 216 A Crim R 152 at [88]–[100].
	


Ground 3


	
	This ground once again suffers from the difficulties that it merely asserts an unspecified attribution of significant weight to something that did not warrant it in the first place, in the context of an aggregate sentence in the second place. The portion of his Honour’s remarks on sentence that have attracted Mr Williams’ particular attention are as follows:
	


“In addition, according to the custodial record, in May 2013 there was an allegation of fighting; later in that same month, an allegation of intimidation and then in November 2013 another allegation of fighting. This impacts upon the assessment of his prospects for rehabilitation. I would note though that I know little more of those matters than appears in the custodial record and the weight that they deserve is limited.”


	
	Counsel appearing for Mr Williams objected to the relevance or use of Corrective Services records said to evidence a custodial offence. Mr Williams was not convicted of any offence. He submitted in this Court that as there had been no testing of the allegations in a judicial context, not only were these matters deserving of limited weight, they were entitled to be given no weight at all.
	
	
	However, the material emphasised by Mr Williams fails to take account of what his Honour said concerning another offence as follows:
	


“The Crown pointed to offences whilst in custody. These include the possession of the phone in custody for which he was sentenced to three months imprisonment.”


	
	In my opinion it is reasonable for Mr Williams to raise a concern that he might have been sentenced upon the basis of matters that had not been proved and of which scant details were available for consideration by his Honour in any event. On the other hand, I would be very slow to conclude that a judge with the considerable experience of his Honour would have given any weight at all to matters that were unproven and not particularised. The mobile phone offence fell into a different category and yet must also be taken to be qualified by the words “those matters” which his Honour noted deserved to be given limited weight. Doing the best I can it seems to me that his Honour was at pains to record the Crown submission whilst simultaneously discounting the significance of the matters that had been raised. To the extent that his Honour did not go into detail about them, I consider that it is simply not possible to assess how, if at all, the custodial disciplinary matters affected his sentencing discretion. They appear to me in any event to be de minimus, so that if error were demonstrated, I would not consider that any lesser sentence was warranted.
	


Ground 4


	
	His Honour’s remarks on sentence contain the following reference:
	


“The offender has been in custody without bail following his arrest on 20 September 2012, and in the care of the Department of Corrective Services since 21 September 2012; from 20 September 2012 he served concurrent imprisonment, extending to 6 months in respect of offences arising in the domestic violence incidents against his former partner to which I referred. The custody referable to the present matters commenced on 20 March 2013; his sentence today shall commence on that date.”


	
	Mr Williams complains that his Honour failed to consider or to apply the principle of totality when imposing a sentence that was wholly accumulated on his existing sentence. The critical proposition underpinning this complaint would appear to be that the totality principle applies even where an offender is serving an existing sentence and is subsequently sentenced by a second court for additional offences.
	
	
	In response to this submission the Crown drew attention to the well-known remarks of this Court in Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 188 A Crim R 41 at [27] as follows:
	


“[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.”


	
	In my opinion, Mr Williams’ existing sentence for the domestic violence offences is concerned with an entirely separate and discrete act of criminality. The only vaguely related aspect of the sentence complained of is that it took account of an element of retribution that was associated with the malicious damage incident on the Form 1. I can see no arguable or necessary relationship between the events giving rise to these sentences that reliably informs a consideration of the totality principle. It was not incumbent upon his Honour in this case to take account of Mr Williams’ existing incarceration as a necessary influence affecting the aggregate sentence he calculated with respect to a series of unrelated and serious drug supply and larceny charges. This is not a case in which the exercise of prosecutorial discretion could be said to have unfairly increased or multiplied the offences, and thereby the potential penalty, where on an alternative view a single charge or fewer charges could instead have been preferred.
	


Ground 5


	
	His Honour’s remarks on sentence that attract consideration of this ground of appeal are as follows:
	


“If the assessment is valid as some, if not the, explanation for the offender’s behaviour across the range of the offences with which I am concerned, there is a need to attribute significant weight to the protection of the community to meet the risk that the offender poses.”


	
	Mr Williams contended that there was no proper basis for his Honour to place additional weight on protection of the community, particularly as his Honour did not find a causal link between the offending behaviour and the diagnosed condition. However, the comment upon which Mr Williams relies needs to be taken and understood in the context of his Honour’s remarks at the time. They are as follows:
	


“The psychologist saw the offender in gaol in June 2014. He was stable, though became depressed when speaking of his mother and sometimes disassociated, requiring questions to be repeated, but exhibited no indication of psychosis. He complained of insomnia, disrupted sleep, nightmares, flashbacks, forgetfulness, lack of motivation and concentration, loss of interest, loss of libido and disinterest [sic] in food. He spoke of changing moods, anger, disassociation, irritability and isolationism.

Tests were administered…

The interpretation offered on these results and clinical assessment leads to the opinion that the offender suffers post-traumatic stress disorder, the psychologist drawing upon his 25 years’ experience observing people so afflicted, notwithstanding the invalidity of the personality assessment identified. Further testing, according to the psychologist, would be required for a definitive answer. Continued treatment is recommended with suggestions as to the appropriate options.

It is not said how long the psychologist spent with the offender … Apart from his time with the offender, the psychologist had a statement of agreed facts, his criminal record and was aware of the charges as one count of supply prohibited drug, larceny and damage property by fire.

There is no discussion of the facts to which he was given access, or correlation between the misconduct there described and the assessment he made. If the assessment is valid as some, if not the, explanation for the offender’s behaviour across the range of the offences with which I am concerned, there is a need to attribute significant weight to the protection of the community to meet the risk that the offender poses. At the same time I have some difficulty attributing significant weight to what the psychologist suggests in light of the evidence of the communications from the offender in the course of the controlled operation, and the steps proposed and taken in counter surveillance to ensure the bona fides of the registered source in the last transaction, the offender’s central role in the theft of the liquor from Woolworths, and the exchanges with the victim of the offence of damage to the motor vehicle by fire.

My circumspection is compounded by the offender’s decision not to give evidence in the sentence proceedings so that I might assess the validity of the representations attributed to him by the psychologist.”


	
	Having regard to these comments by his Honour, the Crown contended that he did not attribute significant weight to the need to protect the community as a result of the psychologist’s report but, on the contrary, was dismissive of the report as it failed to analyse the offending conduct.
	
	
	In my opinion Mr Williams’ complaint is ill-founded. It misunderstands what his Honour was saying. The passage in question commences with the words “If the assessment is valid”. His Honour did not accept that it was valid. I consider that his Honour was making it plain that those who rely upon reports such as the psychologist’s report tendered on Mr Williams’ behalf, must be ready to accept the favourable opinions and conclusions along with the unfavourable ones. His Honour was to my mind hinting at the presence of unfavourable aspects of the report that, if accepted, would sound against Mr Williams. His Honour did not proceed to accept the unfavourable opinion or to act upon it.
	


Ground 6


	
	Mr Williams contended that his Honour’s aggregate sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. If this submission is based upon the suggestion that his Honour misapplied some relevant sentencing principle, it is neither identified by Mr Williams nor evident to me. Mr Williams does repeat his contention that his Honour mischaracterised the level of objective seriousness of the offending, so as to warrant a lesser head sentence and non-parole period. I have already concluded that his Honour made no mistake in that respect.
	
	
	Nor do I consider that the submission has any other general merit. The offences were individually serious, the maximum penalties were considerable and the agreed facts, including material contained on the intercepted telephone material, did not conspire to paint Mr Williams in a favourable light. One of the offences went to trial. The Form 1 offence was a serious example of its type, even having regard to the limited use to which it could be put. The larceny was a substantial offence and the quantity of drugs concerned in the supply and offer to supply offences was in combination a large amount. I can see no basis for the contention that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


Ground 7


	
	Mr Williams contends that he has a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence is compared to that imposed upon his co-offender Mark Andrew Dunston. Mr Dunston was sentenced by his Honour at Parramatta on 18 February 2016 to an aggregate sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years for the following offences:
	



	
	Knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, not less than the commercial quantity (267.59g of methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.
	
	
	Supply prohibited drug (17g methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.
	
	
	Supply a prohibited drug, not less than the commercial quantity (350.62g amphetamine) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.
	
	
	Deal with property suspected proceeds of crime ($9,500) contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	Mr Dunston was charged as a co-offender with Mr Williams in relation to the supplies on 2 August 2012, 24 August 2012 and 6 September 2012. Mr Dunston committed the offences numbered 2, 3 and 4 above whilst on bail for the offence numbered 1 above.
	
	
	Mr Williams reasoned as follows. Mr Dunston had previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the ongoing supply of a prohibited drug and unlawful possession of a pistol. Mr Williams had never served a full-time period of imprisonment prior to his arrest on the matters for which he was sentenced. That submission would appear however to overlook the sentence of 6 months imprisonment previously imposed upon Mr Williams arising out of the domestic violence incidents with his former partner, which expired on 19 March 2013.
	
	
	Next, the offences committed by Mr Williams were committed in the course of one series of criminal conduct with the registered police source. Mr Dunston was arrested for his involvement in those offences and was then apprehended and charged with further offences.
	
	
	Mr Dunston was also convicted of dealing with the proceeds of crime. Mr Williams submitted that this was consistent with the large quantity of drugs detected in his possession for the purpose of supply.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that Mr Dunston acted in a warehousing capacity. Drugs were kept at his premises.
	
	
	In the course of sentencing Mr Dunston his Honour specifically, and I consider very helpfully, referred to the fact that he had previously sentenced Mr Williams, and his Honour provided a summary of some of the comparable characteristics of the two sets of offending. It is instructive to record his Honour’s remarks in that respect:
	


“The offence of knowingly take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is as a result of events in April 2012. I have some knowledge of the circumstances leading to this arrest and prosecution because I was the Judge presiding in a trial by Judge in the matter of the R v Michael John Williams, reference 2012/00293870. I found Williams guilty and on 7 November 2014 I imposed sentence. He was charged with the supply of the prohibited drug in a quantity exceeding that with which the offender in this case is concerned although arising generally from the same facts and circumstances. Williams was found guilty of the supply of 453 grams of methylamphetamine upon an undertaking he had given to a registered source acting in conjunction with police officers in a controlled operation whereby he agreed to supply that drug.

He was found guilty. I indicated in the sentence for that matter of seven years including a non-parole period of three years and six months.

He pleaded guilty to a series of transactions which were rolled up into one charge contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act all of which preceded the charge that went to trial. The total weight of the drug actually supplied in those transactions was 432.99 grams. There was an additional offence to be taken into account, one of damaging property, as I recall setting fire to a motor vehicle. He was allowed a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty, and I indicated a sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years.

There was an additional offence upon which sentence was to be imposed, one of larceny, upon the theft of $241,056.74 worth of alcohol. With a discount of 15% for the utility of a plea of guilty to that charge the indicated sentence was one of three years.

Aggregating those sentences I imposed a sentence of eight years and six months with a non-parole period of five years.

For the purposes of the sentencing of this offender it is relevant to bear in mind the sentence imposed in respect of the first offence of which Williams was found guilty and the context in which it was committed, including the earlier transactions rolled up into the one charge to which he pleaded guilty.

Although considerations of parity must be brought to account it must be borne in mind that Williams was charged with supply, and the amount concerned was much greater than that with which this offender is charged.”


	
	Without intending to do any disservice to the helpful submissions upon which Mr Williams relies in support of this ground of appeal, his Honour’s analysis is itself sufficient to demonstrate why this ground is without merit. Mr Williams was at pains to emphasise the comparative aspects of the drug charges. However, Mr Williams was also involved in a considerable theft, a much larger quantity of drugs and a significant matter to be taken into account on a Form 1. These are matters that underscore the dissimilarities between Mr Williams and Mr Dunston. This is not a case of the imposition of significantly different sentences for what is clearly or at least arguably similar offending. I am not satisfied that Mr Williams can be said to have any grounds for a justifiable sense of grievance at the sentence imposed upon him in the circumstances.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	It follows that Mr Williams has been unsuccessful in this appeal. I would propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Harrison J.

		04 May 2016",2016-05-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769358,R v Turnbull (No. 14) [2016] NSWSC 786,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: At the conclusion of the cross-examination of Ivan Maas (a Crown witness), the Crown has made application, in the absence of the jury, for leave to cross-examine Mr Maas under s.38 Evidence Act 1995. Mr Maas was and remains a farm worker employed by the Accused’s family.
	
	
	The application relates to a number of specified topics:
	



	
	firstly, a discussion in February 2012 on the occasion of Mr Maas meeting Mr Turner for the first time;
	
	
	secondly, the circumstances surrounding the service of a stop-work order (MFI35) on Mr Maas and the evidence of Mr Maas about a conversation with Mr Turner in that context;
	
	
	thirdly, the evidence of Mr Maas concerning a message left for Mr Turner (Exhibit 11) and events surrounding that event;
	
	
	fourthly, conversations between Mr Maas and the Accused concerning the Land and Environment Court cases; and,
	
	
	fifthly, Mr Maas' evidence concerning the work of the Accused in the weeks and months prior to 29 July 2014.
	



	
	The Crown relies upon s.38(1)(a), contending that the evidence given by Mr Maas is unfavourable to the Crown.
	
	
	The application for leave is opposed on behalf of the Accused.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind that the word ""unfavourable"" in s.38(1)(a) does not mean adverse - it means not favourable to the party making the application. Likewise, it is important to bear in mind that s.38 is not confined to the situation where a party calling a witness is confronted unexpectedly by evidence that is unfavourable.    For the purpose of this judgment, I have had regard to the summary of principles with respect to s.38 set out in my judgment in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005 at [9]-[17].
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind, as well, the requirements of s.192 Evidence Act 1995 as to the factors bearing upon a grant of leave of this type if leave was to be allowed.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence of Mr Maas, on each of the topics which I have specified, is unfavourable to the Crown.
	
	
	It is submitted on behalf of the Accused that the Crown was, in general terms, on notice of these matters because a tendency notice served for the Accused in March 2016 identified Mr Maas and others as persons who would give evidence, with some summary of the evidence of Mr Maas. That application was the subject of a ruling made by me in which I declined to allow tendency evidence to be adduced: R v Turnbull (No. 5) [2016] NSWSC 439. However, for present purposes, the submission for the Accused is that the Crown has been on notice that this was coming.
	
	
	I do not consider that this aspect dilutes the Crown's primary application in any real way. Mr Maas has only given the evidence today. As I have said, s.38 is not confined to unexpected circumstances.
	
	
	It has been said that the interests of justice, the public interest and the administration of justice may be served by the testing of evidence of a witness by way of a s.38 examination, and that the grant of leave may permit a truer picture of the situation to be presented to the jury than would have been the case if the Crown had been refused leave - see R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) at [14] and the cases referred to therein.
	
	
	It has been submitted on behalf of the Accused that, if this grant of leave was allowed, then there would also be a potential cascading effect where the Crown would be allowed to cross-examine, the defence would have the capacity to cross-examine and the Crown perhaps to make another s.38 application. Considerations of that sort, of course, are relevant under s.192 of the Act. The starting point, however, is that it is the Court which will control the process.
	
	
	I accept, noting s.38(4), that questioning under s.38 is to take place before other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the Court otherwise directs. That is not what has happened in this case. The Crown is seeking leave under s.38 at the commencement of re-examination. Having regard to s.38(4), and to ensure fairness, if there are matters on which the Accused seeks leave to further cross-examine Mr Maas in light of the Crown's cross-examination, I would be minded to allow it.
	
	
	However, there will not be any ongoing process. This will be a focused process addressing particular topics, and I will monitor closely what occurs to ensure that undue time is not taken up by the process.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I do grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Mr Maas on the topics which have been specified earlier in this judgment.

2769359,R v Turnbull (No. 13) [2016] NSWSC 785,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown intends to call in its case Thomas Benjiman Donoghue, a Certified Practising Valuer. The statement of Mr Donoghue dated 15 March 2016 is MFI34.
	
	
	Objection is taken on behalf of the Accused to the admissibility of evidence of Mr Donoghue. In essence, Mr Donoghue gives opinions as to valuations of “Colorado” and “Strathdoon” at three periods - mid-2011, July 2014 and March 2016, by reference to factors including the level of cultivation and the level of timbered grazing.
	
	
	The opinions expressed reveal a significant increase in the value of each property as between mid-2011 and the latter dates.
	
	
	The Crown submits that this evidence goes to the value of the properties and the relationship between the value of the properties and the degree of clearing which may be undertaken. It is said that this is relevant to issues in the trial, as to what was in the mind of the Accused at relevant times, at least as one factor.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that the evidence is irrelevant.
	
	
	I was informed that evidence was to be led on behalf of the Accused as to the purchase prices for both properties. It was accepted by senior counsel for the Accused during the course of submissions that the more cleared the land is (and thus its increased capacity for farming), the more valuable the land would be.
	
	
	In that sense, it does not seem that there is a real dispute that the process of clearing, put simply, increases the value of the land.
	
	
	It does seem to me that evidence of valuation by Mr Donoghue is relevant to issues in the trial. What is in the mind of the Accused at different times is at the centre of the issues in this trial - what led him, in the end, to shoot dead Mr Turner on 29 July 2014.
	
	
	The Accused himself, according to the evidence of Mr Strange, was said to advert to some financial aspects on 29 July 2014. Beyond that, however, it does seem to me that the evidence is relevant. I propose to admit it.
	
	
	That said, whether it is admitted through the evidence of Mr Donoghue or in some other way, bearing in mind that there may be limited controversy, I do not presently pause to consider further. However, the evidence of Mr Donoghue will be admitted as evidence in the Crown case.

2769360,R v Turnbull (No. 12) [2016] NSWSC 784,"Judgment

 


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown proposes to call, as a witness in the trial, Phillip Spark. Mr Spark was and remains a consultant ecologist employed in the northwest region of New South Wales.
	
	
	Objection is taken on behalf of the Accused to the relevance of the evidence proposed to be adduced from Mr Spark. I have received a statement dated 21 April 2016 of Mr Spark (MFI33).
	
	
	The proposed evidence of Mr Spark relates to observations made on Monday 4 August 2014 when he travelled to the property “Colorado”, accompanied by a journalist and a cameraman. They were making a documentary on land clearing. He states that during the morning he made observations from the public road. With video footage being taken, he saw a heavy bulldozer machine with a blade on the front pushing out unburnt timber into piles of timber. He could not identify the vegetation he saw being pushed, though, it was ""near"" (although he does not say how near) to some existing standing vegetation which he could identify as being ""Brigalow"" which is an endangered ecological community.
	
	
	The events about which Mr Spark would give evidence occurred a number of days after the tragic events on 29 July 2014.
	
	
	As the evidence reveals, the Accused was arrested and charged with murder following the events on 29 July 2014. He was in custody as at 4 August 2014.
	
	
	The Crown submits that Mr Spark's evidence bears upon, in effect, a continuation of events which were happening on and prior to 29 July 2014, being the use of bulldozers to push unburnt timber into piles. The Crown submits that this is relevant, as it bears upon action which was being taken as a response to the litigation before the Land and Environment Court with respect to remediation orders.
	
	
	There is already evidence from persons who were working on “Colorado”, or associated properties, on 29 July 2014. There is no issue that bulldozing of unburnt material was occurring and indeed that it was being set alight.
	
	
	I cannot see, at this stage, how the evidence of Mr Spark takes it any further. He is not asserting that what was being bulldozed was in fact native vegetation within the meaning of the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	As the events about which he would give evidence occurred after the Accused was in custody, that is a further difficulty in seeing its relevance to the issues in this trial.
	
	
	If something happens in this trial that renders this subject matter relevant, then the admissibility of Mr Spark's evidence may be reconsidered. But, for the moment, I am not satisfied that the proposed evidence of Mr Spark is relevant and admissible and I decline to allow it.

2769361,R v Turnbull (No. 11) [2016] NSWSC 783,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown proposes to call, as a witness, Murray Malcolm Fisher. Objection has been foreshadowed on behalf of the Accused to the giving of any evidence by Mr Fisher.
	
	
	I have been provided with a statement of Mr Fisher (MFI32). Mr Fisher is an officer of the Commonwealth Department of the Environment. His foreshadowed evidence relates to events in August 2012 when he attended “Strathdoon” in company with other officers. There was no officer of the Office and Environment and Heritage (“OEH”) present.
	
	
	Put shortly, there was a conversation between the Commonwealth officers and the Accused about issues of clearing on properties, clearly from the perspective of Commonwealth legislation. There was no reference to the Native Vegetation Act 2003, and understandably so, seeing that these were Commonwealth officers.
	
	
	It is alleged that during the course of this conversation about steps which landowners would need to take to get approvals with respect to conservation issues, the Accused said words to the effect, ""I'm an old man now. I can do what I like. What are they going to do to me?"".
	
	
	It is alleged that the Accused said a little later:
	


“This land is too good for sheep or cattle. It is the last property in this area with black soil and it needs a crop in it and that's what we plan to do."" 


	
	There is reference, as well, to other observations made.
	
	
	The Crown submits that this is relevant to issues in the trial. It is said that it relates to the approach of the Accused to regulatory officers dealing with issues of land clearing, whether State or Commonwealth, with the comments attributed to him by Mr Fisher bearing upon that topic.
	
	
	It is submitted on behalf of the Accused that the events in question were nearly two years prior to the events of 29 July 2014. It is submitted, as well, that these are Commonwealth officers and not State officers and that the proposed evidence does not rise to the level of relevance.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant, having considered the terms of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995. Both the Crown and the Accused are relying, in different ways, on events spreading over a number of years between 2011 and 2014.
	
	
	The Accused is asserting, in effect, that the deceased, Mr Turner, was harassing him in some form with respect to the enforcement of the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	The Crown says that what ultimately happened on 29 July 2014 was really an act of revenge on the part of the Accused towards Mr Turner for what had happened over a number of years.
	
	
	There is to be other evidence in the trial where the Accused is alleged to have made a comment to State OEH officers about his attitude to these matters and to his age. It seems to me that evidence of this type, being statements allegedly made by the Accused indicating his apparent attitude to regulatory scrutiny and action which may be taken with respect to his land, is relevant to issues in the trial.
	
	
	What use is to be made of it will ultimately be a matter for the jury. I propose to allow the evidence of Mr Fisher as set out in MFI32.

2769363,R v GM [2016] NSWCCA 78,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Nature of application

Complaints of historical sexual assaults while they were children were made by four sisters against their uncle, the respondent. There were further allegations of a similar nature from a separate complainant who was not related to the respondent or to the four sisters. The separate complainant had moved to live on a farm near the respondent’s house where the four sisters had previously resided.


	
	Details of the four sisters and the other complainants are as follows:
	


JM born 1966 – tendency witness.

CM born 1967 – counts 1 – 2 on indictment.

SM born 1969 (twin to HM) – count 3 on indictment.

HM born 1969 (twin to SM) – tendency witness.

JC born 1982 – counts 4 – 6 on indictment.


	
	An indictment containing six counts of various sexual offences was presented by the Crown against the respondent which related to three of the five principal witnesses – CM, SM and JC. The complaints made by the other two sisters (JM and HM) were relied upon as tendency evidence by the Crown in respect of all counts on the indictment. The Crown served a tendency notice referring to all five persons. In addition to the tendency evidence from JM and HM, the Crown sought to rely upon the evidence of each of the complainants named on the indictment as tendency evidence in respect of all the other counts on the indictment.
	
	
	The counts on the indictment were as follows:
	


Count 1 – Commit act of indecency towards child under 16 years (11 years) (tucking penis up and saying “look I’m a girl”).

Count 2 – Indecent assault of child under 16 years (12 years) (digital penetration while on back of motor cycle).

Count 3 – Indecent assault of child under 16 years (12 years) (touching genital area while in Land Cruiser).

Count 4 – Sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years (12 years) (digital penetration while on back of Harley Davidson).

Count 5 – Sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years (12 years) (cunnilingus after going for a ride on quad bike).

Count 6 – Sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years (12/13 years) (digital penetration while on motor cycle).


	
	There were other incidents not charged. These involved the sisters.
	


Pinning JM against the wall in August 1981 while parents away.

Coming in while girls showering.

Incident with JM at holiday house at Malua Bay beach.

Asking sisters if they had pubic hair yet.


	
	The following matters were raised in the tendency notice, dated 29 May 2014.
	



	
	The person whose “tendency” is the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced is GM.
	
	
	The tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to act in a particular way, namely to indecently assault young girls, specifically his nieces, by conduct of rubbing their legs/genital area while driving his motor vehicle with the girls in the front seat.
	
	
	Further tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to sexually assault young girls, especially but not limited to, by acts of digital penetration while seated on either motor bike or quad bikes with the girls.
	
	
	Further tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to indecently assault young girls by rubbing the breasts of young girls while he is seated behind them on either a motor bike or a quad bike.
	
	
	Further tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to act in a particular way, namely to ask inappropriate questions of young girls in relation to the development of their breasts and/or pubic region.
	
	
	Further tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to act in a particular way, namely to act indecently towards young girls specifically his nieces by standing naked before them with his penis tucked behind his legs and saying to the effect of “look at me, I’m a girl”.
	
	
	Further tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely a sexual attraction to young girls, including but not limited to, CM, JM, HM, SM and JC.
	
	
	Further tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely a fascination bordering on the obsessive with the vaginas of young girls.
	



	
	Before the trial, the respondent filed a notice of motion seeking orders for a separate trial in respect of the counts relating to JC (counts 4, 5 and 6). The respondent sought to exclude the evidence of HM and JM (being relied upon by the Crown only as tendency evidence) in respect of any count on the indictment. The respondent also sought to prevent any evidence from any of the sisters being admitted as tendency evidence against the respondent in respect of the counts which related to JC.
	
	
	On 16 March 2015 the respondent was arraigned and pleaded not guilty at Wagga Wagga District Court. Her Honour English DCJ then heard legal argument in relation to the respondent’s notice of motion. The evidence before her Honour comprised statements of the four sisters and JC, as well as statements from the mother of the four sisters and the parents of JC. All of those persons had given evidence in earlier committal proceedings and transcripts of their evidence were before her Honour. One of the sisters, JM, did not give evidence in the committal proceedings.
	
	
	The orders made by her Honour on 18 March 2015 were:
	



	
	I uphold the defence application.
	
	
	I order that counts 4, 5 and 6 be severed from counts 1, 2, 3.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the evidence sought to be adduced as tendency evidence ought to be admitted and I uphold the defence application in that regard. The evidence of HM and JM is not to be admitted as tendency evidence in respect of the complainant SM. The evidence of CM, SM, HM and JM is not to be admitted as tendency evidence in respect of the complainant JC.
	



	
	Although her Honour made no specific mention of the evidence of HM and JM not being admitted as tendency evidence in respect of the complainant CM (as well as SM), the parties approached the matter on the basis that this was an oversight and that her Honour’s rejection of the proposed tendency evidence included that circumstance. I agree with that approach and I have dealt with this matter on the basis that her Honour made all the orders sought by the respondent in his notice of motion.
	
	
	Following her Honour’s judgment, the Crown asked for time to consider its position. On 19 March 2015 the Crown sought to have her Honour revisit her ruling in light of the decision of Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280 which had not been referred to in argument before her, either by the Crown or the respondent. Because Jones v R was subject to a non-publication order, it had only been brought to the Crown Prosecutor’s attention overnight. The Crown acknowledged, in the light of the decision in Jones, that he had erred in agreeing with the respondent that Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292 set out the correct test for considering questions of concoction and contamination in the context of an application to rely upon tendency evidence and accordingly that Hodgson JA had correctly stated the law in BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303.
	
	
	Further submissions were made by both sides on 19 March 2015. Her Honour indicated that she did not intend to reverse her ruling. She further stated “I will give further reasons if so required Mr Crown”. At the time the Crown responded that he did not require further reasons. Subsequently when a transcript became available, a request was forwarded by the Crown to her Honour to provide the further reasons which she had foreshadowed on 19 March 2015. On 12 June 2015 her Honour’s Associate notified the Crown that “her Honour does not propose to provide further reasons in the matter”. In the proceedings in this Court, the parties proceeded on the basis that the judgment under consideration was that delivered by her Honour on 18 March 2015. I have approached the matter on the same basis.
	
	
	The application in this Court is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against her Honour’s order that the indictment be severed and an appeal pursuant to s 5F(3A) against her Honour’s ruling in respect of tendency evidence on the basis that it has substantially weakened the Crown case.
	


Factual background


	
	The four sisters grew up on a farm in a rural town in the Riverina area. The respondent and his wife lived on the neighbouring farm. The respondent was the older brother of the father of the four sisters. The respondent had no children of his own. The sisters moved to Wagga Wagga when their farm was sold in 1980 (which was when JM was aged about 14, CM was about 13, and the twins SM and HM were about 11). Before then the sisters were regular visitors to the respondent’s farm where they would drive in his ute and ride on motor bikes. The respondent gave them driving lessons in his ute. Each of the four sisters described sexually inappropriate behaviour by the respondent during the course of some of those visits from a young age.
	
	
	The background to the charges against the respondent was as follows. Count 1 related to a specific occasion when CM was aged 11 and the respondent came into his lounge-room after a shower when all the sisters were present and tucked his penis between his legs and said to them “look at me, don’t I look like a girl”. Count 2 related to another occasion when CM was aged 12 and the respondent was on the back of a motorcycle being driven by her. He put his hand down her pants and digitally penetrated her vagina. Count 3 related to an occasion when the respondent and SM were in his ute and the respondent ran his hand up her leg onto her genital area.
	
	
	In 1983, a few years after the sisters had moved away from the farm, the unrelated complainant, JC, moved with her family into that property. JC had just had her first birthday. She had three brothers and over the years her family got to know the respondent and his wife well and her parents became close to them. She learned how to ride a motorbike from an early age.
	
	
	As children they would go to the respondent’s farm because he always had better motorbikes and quad bikes. The respondent taught her to ride the quad bikes from when she was aged 5 – 6 years old. She recalled him putting his hand down her pants and touching her vagina during these rides. At about the same age the respondent would also take her around the property in his farm ute and teach her to drive. While she was steering, the respondent would put his hand down her shirt and touch her breasts and put his hand down into her vagina and digitally penetrate her. This continued until she was in about year 7 – 8 when she stopped going to the respondent’s property. JC also alleged that as she was getting older, the respondent would make comments about her breasts and vagina developing.
	
	
	The details of the charges brought against the respondent relating to her (counts 4 – 6) are as follows. Count 4 involved an incident when JC was aged about 12 when the respondent had taken her for a ride around his property on his new Harley Davidson motorcycle. He stopped the bike and rubbed her breasts and then digitally penetrated her.
	
	
	Count 5 is also alleged to have occurred when JC was aged 12. It related to an occasion when she was riding with the respondent on a quad bike when he told her to pull over on a dirt track. He then performed cunnilingus on her.
	
	
	Count 6 occurred about six months later and involved the respondent touching JC’s breasts and digitally penetrating her after she had been riding on the back of his motorcycle.
	
	
	A summary of the evidence before her Honour, as set out in the statements and committal transcripts, is as follows. JM (a tendency witness) did not give evidence in the committal proceedings. The following comes from her statement of 11 May 2012. The first instance she could recall occurred in 1969. She was seated in the respondent’s Land Rover. She was sitting next to him and she could recall him running his hand up her leg. She said that that type of behaviour continued for years. Sometimes the respondent would touch her underneath her underwear and would make sounds while he did so.
	
	
	JM could recall another occasion when the respondent owned a GT Falcon and she was seated in the front seat and he ran his hand up her leg. A similar incident occurred while they were near a group of trees on the farm, but she could not remember specific details. She could recall witnessing the respondent touching her sisters in a similar fashion.
	
	
	In approximately 1978 she was in year 7 at school and the respondent requested she take him on her motorbike to check something in a paddock. He sat behind her on the motorbike and he touched her on the breasts on the outside of her clothing. She ordered him to stop and he did so.
	
	
	The family moved to Wagga Wagga in 1980. Between 1981 and 1983 JM’s parents went away for a weekend and the sisters were being cared for by the respondent and his wife in the Wagga Wagga house. The respondent pinned JM against a wardrobe and said words to the effect “Come on how about it? You’re big enough now”. He was pulling at her clothing. She told him to “fuck off” and “get away” and that she did not need his money. Two of the sisters witnessed the incident.
	
	
	JM said that she had been told by her sister, SM, that the respondent had pinned her (i.e. JM) to a bed in the family holiday home at Malua Bay and that SM had told the respondent to get off JM. JM could not remember that incident herself.
	
	
	JM first complained about the behaviour towards her by the respondent to her mother on Christmas Day in 1996. She did not make any statement to the police until May 2012.
	
	
	JM recalled the respondent making inappropriate comments about women’s breasts in the presence of her and her sisters. He would tell them what she considered to be inappropriate jokes of a sexual nature and ask questions about their developing bodies and he would talk to them about boys. She thought the jokes were inappropriate but that was his way of being friendly to his nieces.
	
	
	CM (a complainant – counts 1 and 2) said that when she was approximately seven years of age (around 1974) she would go to the respondent’s farm and he would take her and her sisters driving in his Land Cruiser. The respondent would let her steer the ute while she was sitting on his lap and he would run his hands up and down the inside of her leg. He would slide his hand up her inner thigh. It made her feel uncomfortable.
	
	
	When CM was approximately 11 years of age in 1977, she was in the lounge-room of the respondent’s home. Her three sisters were present. The respondent’s wife was in the kitchen washing up. The respondent had showered and came into the lounge-room wrapped in a towel. He removed the towel and tucked his penis between his legs and said to the girls “Look at me. Don’t I look like a girl?” he then left the room. The sisters did not discuss the incident. CM was shocked at the respondent’s behaviour.
	
	
	Approximately a year later, around 1978, CM and her sisters were at the respondent’s property. She was riding a motorbike and the respondent asked her for a lift to the shed. The respondent sat behind her on the motorbike as she rode to the shed. The respondent got off, retrieved what he came to get, and got on the back of the bike. As CM was about to start the bike, the respondent put his hands around her waist and put a hand down the front of her pants. He put his hand inside her underwear and penetrated her vagina with his finger. He stopped after about 30 seconds. CM started the bike and rode back to the paddock.
	
	
	Approximately a year later, when she was in year 7 when she was aged around 12, the respondent asked her for a lift on the motorbike. He sat behind her and asked “Do you have hair down there yet?” She answered “Yes”. CM dropped the respondent off and left.
	
	
	On Christmas Day 1996 CM was at home with her husband and children. Her mother, father and sister JM were visiting. She overheard a conversation between her mother and JM about the respondent touching JM. She was asked by her mother if the respondent had touched her and she replied in the affirmative. The following day she informed her husband who had been a police officer.
	
	
	In 1998 CM’s grandmother (the respondent’s mother) died. At that time the family became aware of allegations made by JC and another woman LL that they had been assaulted by the respondent. CM was aware that the respondent had been physically assaulted in 2000.
	
	
	In around 2005 JC visited CM at her home in West Wyalong and they sat and talked. CM said that they did not go into detail but the conversation was such that CM knew that the respondent had touched JC inappropriately. They discussed confronting the respondent but were not strong enough to do so at that time.
	
	
	In 2009 CM sought counselling. On 5 May 2010 she went to the Wagga Wagga Police to make a statement. On 24 August 2010 she made a statement at West Wyalong Police Station. CM gave evidence in the committal hearing in April 2014.
	
	
	In her evidence at the committal proceedings, CM said that she had spoken to her husband about the allegations but did not go into details. She said “No-one knows what he actually did to me” except what is contained in her police statement. She said that she had not spoken to anyone else, other than her husband. She said that she and her sisters had spoken about things that the respondent did in front of them, but none of them had ever spoken about things which he did to them individually. She had spoken to her sisters individually on a number of occasions over a number of years. They spoke about what he “used to do to us” when they were in the ute at the same time.
	
	
	CM said that she and JC had spoken to each other but neither went into detail. CM said that she said to JC “I don’t want to know what he did to you”.
	
	
	SM (a complainant – count 3) could recall incidents occurring in about 1978 when she was aged 9 involving the respondent. She could recall when she and her twin sister, HM, stayed with the respondent and his wife, that the respondent would come into the lounge room naked, he would tuck his penis between his legs and say “Look at me, I’m a girl”. He would do a little dance and turn his back and she could see his penis and testicles visible between his legs.
	
	
	SM could recall the respondent coming into the laundry while she was in the shower, looking at her through the shower screen. She could recall the respondent running his hand up her legs to her genital area in a tickling motion while they were in the car.
	
	
	When she was about 12 in 1981, she could recall sitting with her legs either side of the gearstick travelling into town with the respondent in his vehicle. The respondent ran his hand up to her genital region. She pushed his hand away and said “Don’t do that” and the respondent replied with words to the effect “Teenage boys will do that to you”.
	
	
	SM could recall the respondent asking if she had pubic hair or if she had a boyfriend. She could recall an occasion when the family were on holidays in Malua Bay when the respondent came into the girls’ bedroom and lay on her sister JM, groping at her breasts and genitals.
	
	
	SM said that in 2009 after her sister CM had attempted to commit suicide, she made contact with the respondent and his wife. She rang and confronted him on the phone saying “I’m going to ring the police. You are going to go to gaol for what you did”. She said that the respondent replied “Go ahead. It would be her word against mine and you couldn’t prove anything”. SM demanded that he put his wife on the phone but he refused to do so.
	
	
	After several phone calls, CM spoke with the respondent’s wife. She had a conversation with her and that was the last time they spoke.
	
	
	In SM’s statement of 4 November 2012 she said:
	


“At no time do I remember ever being sexually abused by GM. I don’t remember ever really talking about these incidents with my sisters or mum and dad. I vaguely remember when all this came out that I was told about what had happened to my sisters.

CM told me about an incident when she was riding a motorbike with GM behind her. She told me that GM was groping her with his hands that were inside her clothing. She told me that he put his hand down her pants and his fingers went inside her vagina. She could not do anything because she was riding the motorbike.”


	
	SM could also recall a day when JM told her that it had happened to her as well, but she did not ask her sister to go into any detail as she did not want to know.
	
	
	SM denied having a number of conversations with her sisters about the allegations against the respondent. She said that CM had told her what had happened and on another occasion, her sister JM had attempted to discuss matters with her but she cut her short. She said that she only had one discussion with CM about what happened. SM said that she never spoke with her mother about what occurred to her and that she did not intend to, nor had she had any discussion with her twin sister HM about the matter. She said that she did have “words” with her twin sister when she found out that HM had travelled to Albury to see the respondent and his wife following an assault upon him in 2000.
	
	
	SM said that when she said in the committal proceedings that she had not been sexually abused by the respondent she meant “penetrated”. At the time she first spoke with police, she was aware that her sister CM was going to make a statement to the police. SM said that she did not go to police earlier because she did not wish to hurt her aunt but once her aunt showed a lack of care about what the respondent had done to her and her sisters, she felt that her aunt was as bad as the respondent.
	
	
	HM (a tendency witness) was the twin sister of SM. She said that she was aged 11 when the family moved to Wagga Wagga.
	
	
	HM recalled an occasion when she and her sisters were in the respondent’s lounge-room and he entered the room naked with his penis tucked between his legs and said “Look I’m a girl”. She could recall regular occasions while in the car with the respondent that he would touch her on the leg and run his hand up the inside of her leg towards her crotch. She would push his hand away and remonstrate with him.
	
	
	In April 1981 her parents went on holidays. The respondent and his wife came to care for the sisters in the family home in Wagga Wagga. She could recall seeing the respondent pin her sister JM against a wall in the rumpus room and grope her and say words to the effect “How about it J?”. HM said that she tried to stop him and push him away from her sister. The respondent and his wife left the premises shortly thereafter.
	
	
	She recalled her mother RM asking her on her 27th birthday (1997) whether the respondent had ever done anything to her. She made a statement to police on 20 October 2012. She also gave evidence in the committal proceedings.
	
	
	HM said that on the day of her 27th birthday when her mother asked her if the respondent had ever done anything to her, she said “no”. She said that her sister SM was present at the time. She said that she had never discussed the allegations with her sisters. There had been a discussion about court dates, but not details. She could, however, recall asking her sister CM to speak to the respondent to stop him going to her house. She remembered that she was pregnant at the time.
	
	
	In her statement of 20 October 2012 HM said that even with her twin sister SM she never really spoke about the things that the respondent had done to us “like rubbing our legs in the car”. She could not recall the respondent touching her in a sexual way like her breast or genital area. She said that she had never gone into any details with her sisters about the respondent. She knew that he had done things to the others, especially JM and CM. She knew that they would tell her what happened, but she did not think she could cope with it if they did tell her.
	
	
	JC (a complainant – counts 4 - 6) and her family moved into the property adjoining that of the respondent in 1983. She and her brother, GC, spent a lot of time at the respondent’s property riding motorbikes. They would often have dinner with the respondent and his wife. She could recall sitting at the dinner table when the respondent would try to touch her leg with his feet and legs. She could recall the respondent walking naked through the house after he had taken a shower.
	
	
	When she was five or six, the respondent taught her to ride a quad bike. He would sit behind her and put his hands up her top and touch her on the breast. He would also put his hands into her pants and touch her vagina. He would take her out in the farm ute and teach her how to drive. She would sit on his knee and steer. He would change the gears and operate the pedals. He would put his hands down her top and touch her on the breasts. He would also touch her on the vagina before inserting a finger into her vagina.
	
	
	As she got older, she went to the respondent’s farm less and less. She could recall him making comments about her breasts and vagina developing. She could recall feeling the respondent’s erect penis pressing into her back while they were riding the motorbike.
	
	
	In 1993 or 1994, the respondent purchased a Harley Davidson motorbike. He took her for a ride. She sat behind him. He stopped the bike and touched her on the breasts before inserting a finger into her vagina. She asked him to stop as she was experiencing pain and they returned to the farm.
	
	
	On another occasion when she was 11 or 12 she was riding a quad bike. The respondent was seated behind her. He told her to stop and she did so. He got off the bike and told her to lie down. She lay on the seat of the bike. He removed her shorts and underwear and performed cunnilingus. He invited her to touch him or lick him. She pushed him off. They returned home. She went home and took a long bath.
	
	
	It was about six months before she returned to the respondent’s farm. On the next occasion, they were again on a motorbike. The respondent stopped the bike and inserted a finger in her vagina. She told him to stop, which he did, and they resumed riding the bike.
	
	
	She first complained to her parents in about 1995, although nothing was formally reported. During the committal hearing, she said that she first raised what had occurred to her in response to an inquiry from her mother, who had been informed that the respondent had allegedly interfered with someone else. That someone else was LL.
	
	
	JC’s parents apparently split up in around 1996. In 2000 the family sold the property adjoining that of the respondent and moved to Temora. JC said that she had spoken to others about what had happened to her. She had spoken to her father and her brothers and her mother. As the years went by, she had spoken with others and she had sought counselling. She was aware of rumours within the community about the respondent as long ago as 1999.
	
	
	She said that one of the respondent’s nieces (CM) made contact with her and asked her if she was a victim. She thought that this was around 2003. She said that she went to West Wyalong and met up with CM. She said that they talked about the allegations to an extent, but that she did not go into detail.
	
	
	She had a conversation with her ex-boyfriend DB and she was aware that he had seriously assaulted the respondent.
	
	
	RM was the mother of the four sisters. RM said that it was Christmas in 1996 when JM told her that the respondent had been touching her from the time she was little until the early 1980’s. She could recall her other daughter, CM, walking in and from the look on her face, RM said she was aware that she had also been a victim.
	
	
	RM said that while she did not discuss details with either daughter “Over the years things came out about what had happened”. She said that when she spoke to the twins on their birthday in January 1997, they both denied anything had occurred involving them. She subsequently learned that they chose not to make any disclosure that day because it was their birthday.
	
	
	RM said that in 1998 at her mother-in-law’s funeral, she spoke to a sister-in-law, EM, and advised her to keep her grandchildren away from the respondent. When asked why, she informed her sister-in-law that the respondent had assaulted her daughters. She heard that EM had spoken to others who also disclosed there had been other victims.
	
	
	She could recall the incident referred to by her daughters that occurred to JM in the house in Wagga Wagga when the respondent and his wife left early before she and her husband had returned from a trip to Melbourne. It was the recollection of RM that the respondent’s explanation for the early departure was that a disagreement had occurred between CM and his wife. RM said that she could not understand why such a disagreement would have occurred, but subsequently learned of the incident involving JM.
	
	
	RM said that CM had informed her of a comment made by the respondent when he rubbed his hand over her upper leg to the effect “This is what boys are going to do to you when they take you out”. She was aware of the dislike of the respondent by her daughters, but they had not gone into the reasons why.
	
	
	RM was extensively cross-examined in the committal proceedings. She said that she was close to her daughters. Before the disclosures about the respondent she had been ambivalent towards him and her husband did not trust the respondent. There was friction between the two of them. RM said that it was her daughter who first broached the subject of the respondent at Christmas 1996 saying to her “Mum, I’ve got something terrible to tell you. I want to tell you about Uncle G”. She said that she asked her daughters about the Melbourne weekend and why their uncle and aunt had left early and she was informed that there had been an incident between JM and the respondent. RM said that she did not push her daughters for details but encouraged them to talk to their husbands and partners.
	
	
	She confirmed that she then spoke to the twins, who initially said that they had not experienced anything at the hands of the respondent. This was because it was their birthday and they did not want to discuss it on that day. RM said that she soon found out that it was otherwise. She learned about SM first but could not be precise as to when that occurred.
	
	
	RM became aware of the respondent putting his penis between his legs and dancing around in front of them saying “Do you think I look like a girl”. It was something which she discussed with her daughters. RM said that she had no discussion with any of her daughters about things which were alleged to have occurred in the Land Cruiser or the ute, other than one of the girls had told her that the respondent had rubbed his hand up and down her leg and said “This is what boys are going to do to you when you grow older”. She thought it was CM who had told her that.
	
	
	RM recalled another occasion, a family wedding, but she was not sure about the year. It was after her mother-in-law’s funeral. On this occasion, she requested that she and her husband not be seated with the respondent and his wife at the wedding.
	
	
	RM was aware that the respondent had been assaulted in 2000 and she had her suspicions as to why. She did have a discussion with her daughters about the motive for the assault. She was aware that CM had gone to the police and that she would be contacted about making a statement.
	
	
	RB was the mother of JC. She and her former husband had four children, including JC. She was aware that two of her children, GC and JC, became friendly with the respondent and his wife. She could recall an occasion when those two children had been with the respondent and they returned home. JC ran a bath and remained in the bath for a long time, which she felt was unusual for her.
	
	
	She was aware of the respondent purchasing a new Harley Davidson motorbike. In 1997 she became aware of allegations that the respondent had been abusing CM. She had met up with LL and LL had told her that she too had been abused by the respondent.
	
	
	When she heard that, RB became concerned for her own daughter and spoke to her asking her whether GM had done anything to her. JC replied “yes”. JC told her that the respondent “Didn’t actually have sex with her” but that he used to touch her. JC did not want anyone to know. The family did end up finding out when JC’s boyfriend assaulted the respondent because one of her sons, GC, was present at the time of the assault.
	


The judgment of 18 March 2015


	
	Her Honour summarised the thrust of the respondent’s submissions as follows:
	


“The accused argues that there is a real risk of contamination of the evidence because of the way in which the allegations have emerged over time and of course of the way in which the complainants have interacted with each other and a decision was made to come forward and to complain, that there exists a relationship between the complainants and the other Crown witnesses, that there existed the opportunity for concoction as a result of the conversations between the various complainants and witnesses over time and there exists a motive for there to be a concoction on the part of at least some of the complainants and/or witnesses, that there is a risk of contamination of testimony to be called in the Crown case and that that is something which significantly reduces the probative value of the tendency evidence.” (Judgment, 16.7 – 17.1) (R v GM (District Court (NSW), 18 March 2015, unrep at 16 – 17) (R v GM, District Court (NSW) 18 March 2015, unreported)


	
	Her Honour then set out ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act). By reference to those sections, her Honour noted that the court was required to embark on two inquiries:
	


“First, whether the evidence has significant probative value which is the s 97 inquiry; and secondly, whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that it may have on the accused, and that is the s 101 inquiry.” (Judgment 17.9 – 18.1)


	
	Her Honour went on to further analyse those requirements as follows:
	


“The assessment of the probative value of evidence does not depend on its believability or reliability. The issue is whether, and to what extent, the evidence is “capable” of affecting a jury’s determination of a fact in issue – DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [182].

The onus is on the Crown to establish that tendency evidence has significant probative value. The “unfair prejudice” addressed in s 101 is similar to that addressed in s 137 of the Evidence Act. Generally it is prejudice associated with a risk that a jury will take an irrational approach and use the evidence to the detriment of an accused. In AE v R [2008] NSW CCA 52 the Court found that the trial Judge should have rejected tendency evidence of a long course of sexual misconduct against one complainant when considering whether the Crown had proved two counts of alleged sexual misconduct against a second complainant because of the risk that the jury would be “overwhelmed” by the strength of the tendency evidence - at para [45].

Further, the Court found that the evidence should have been rejected because there was a possibility of deliberate concoction arising from the fact that the complainants were sisters and had been in contact with each other at the time that each made a complaint - para [44]. The reasons for that finding were not fulsome unfortunately.” (Judgment 18.6 – 19.2)


	
	Her Honour then sought to analyse the position at common law, but in doing so, focused on s 101 of the Act rather than s 97. Her Honour said:
	


“The position at common law, it has been said that tendency evidence, that is “reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction” will lack the necessary probative value. When considering whether concoction is a reasonable possibility it is relevant to examine the relationship, opportunity and motive of the witnesses - Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 222 at 297. That formulation has been adopted in relation to s 101 of the Evidence Act.

In BP v R [2010] NSW CCA 303 at 110 Hodgson JA observed that the risk of concoction or contamination “powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect”. If concoction and/or contamination may be the explanation for apparent similarities, the tendency evidence is deprived of force.

It has often been noted that the chance of concoction must be a real chance, not merely a speculative chance - see R v Colby [1999] NSW CCA 261 at para [111], referred to in BP at para [110]. The Crown bears the onus of negating any “real chance” of concoction - R v OGD [2000] NSW CCA 404 at [74] and BP at [110].

In relation to contamination a slightly different and less restrictive approach has been adopted. Evidence that may have been contaminated will be excluded under s 101 and if the risk of contamination affects material issues and “goes to the substance of the evidence” - per Hodgson JA in BP at para [123].

In this case there appears to be no dispute that the contentious evidence has probative value in that it is capable of bearing on two facts in issue: first, whether the conduct founding each charge did occur; and whether the conduct, if it did occur, was sexually motivated. There is a real issue, however, as to whether it has significant probative value.”


	
	Having set out those statements of principle, her Honour briefly summarised the way in which the Crown sought to rely upon the tendency evidence and concluded:
	


“The statements do not show close similarity in all aspects of the details, but they do show a consistency in interest particularly the age of the young girls, in the way in which the opportunity was used, and in his behaviour. In relation to each count the evidence of the complainants and the witnesses has significant probative value in that the evidence is capable of being an important circumstance in establishing a definite tendency on the part of the accused to engage in sexual misconduct towards, particularly, prepubescent girls.

In that regard I find that the Crown has discharged the onus of establishing that the evidence has significant probative value.” (Judgment 20.9 – 21.3)


	
	Her Honour then had no further regard to s 97, but focused on s 101 of the Act as follows:
	


“Turning then to the provisions of s 101, the onus is on the Crown to establish that the probative value of the tendency evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect.

There is no onus on the accused in that regard, although his counsel has addressed to me extensively regarding the real possibility of concoction because two of the complainants and two proposed tendency witnesses are sisters; all of the alleged victims come from a close knit rural community where there has been considerable discussion, not only amongst the families involved, but the wider community, also including discussion prior to disclosures to others and the police; that if the evidence is admitted as tendency evidence the real risk of unfair prejudice to the accused is significant.

I accept that when assessing whether there has been a real possibility of concoction it is relevant to examine the relationship, opportunity and motive of the witnesses. I have gone to some length to set out the evidence in that regard.

The motive on the part of the four sisters is said to be a conscious or unconscious decision to bolster the complainant CM who appears to have been most adversely affected by the alleged sexual abuse upon her.

It is important to examine all of the relevant considerations, important and relatively objective considerations are the timing and the content of the complaints made by the various witnesses. The timing and content of the complaints may assist me to determine whether there is a real risk that an opportunity for concoction and/or contamination has been utilised.

As between the four sisters and their mother there is a close relationship both at the time of the alleged offences, although no contemporaneous complaint was ever made, but more importantly there has been ample opportunity for concoction.

Subsequent to the taking of statements there is no credible reason for the complainants to concoct their evidence but a close examination of the statements and the evidence at committal raises a real doubt in my mind as to the true extent of the discussions between RM and her daughters and their partners which gives rise to a suggestion of concoction.

All the various witnesses deny discussing detail, yet their evidence does contain material which is remarkably similar as to unusual detail of which those who were not present could not have known about unless the matter had been the subject of discussion at some length.” (Judgment 21.3 – 22.6)


	
	By reference to the evidence, her Honour set out her conclusions as follows:
	


“Contamination is also a real possibility in those circumstances.

The various witnesses reluctantly admit that there has been discussion but they maintain no detail was discussed. With respect, I find that somewhat incredulous, given the content of the statements and the evidence at the committal. It may well be that the evidence of the conduct of the accused towards each of the witnesses is true, but I find there is a distinct risk that the witnesses have developed their evidence as time has gone by, subconsciously or unintentionally, through influence and discussion. That risk undermines significantly the probative value of the evidence as tendency evidence.

Further, there is, what I see as a potential significant problem in the evidence of SM and HM, and that is their initial denials that anything occurred to them - the statement of SM in which she denies anything occurring and then her change of heart and a charge now being laid in respect of her as a complainant.

There has been contact between CM and the complainant JC prior to them making their statements to police, and whilst they deny discussing detail, it is apparent that they had a close discussion sufficient for them to both state at the time they were not strong enough to go to the police. It defies credulity that there would not have been some greater in-depth discussion than is suggested by them in light of the fact that they went to the effort of meeting to discuss what the accused had allegedly done to each of them.

A substantial risk of unfair prejudice arises if the evidence is allowed as tendency evidence.

In defending these charges, if the accused wishes to raise the risk of concoction before a jury, there are matters which he would no doubt not wish to raise, such as the rumours which were rife in the communities of Barmedman, Temora and West Wyalong for years that he had sexually assaulted a number of young girls, perhaps even over and above those to be mentioned in the evidence, if it is to be adduced at the trial. The jury may well hear more evidence of a highly prejudicial nature than ever was intended to be adduced in the Crown case.

In those circumstances, it may well be that despite the strongest of directions the jury would be overwhelmed by the totality of the evidence and arrive at conclusions without proper consideration of the evidence and return verdicts of guilty based upon impression rather than the evidence in the circumstances.

I find that the risk of concoction and contamination significantly reduces the probative value of the evidence. I find that an unfairness could arise which could not be overcome in the minds of the jurors.

I find there is obvious motive for concoction and when the chronology is carefully examined and the evidence, as it has evolved over time, is examined, there is a real risk of both contamination and concoction which extends not only between the M sisters but also involves JC.” (Judgment 23.3 – 24.8)

The current state of the law


	
	As a starting point it is necessary to keep the provisions of sections 97 and 101 clearly in mind. These provisions have changed what was traditionally the common law approach to questions of tendency evidence and the effect on it of the risk of concoction and contamination.
	


“97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a)    the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b)    the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. …”


	
	Under the Dictionary to the Act, “probative value” is defined:
	


““Probative value” of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.”

“101 – Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2)    Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. …”


	
	The most comprehensive statement by this Court of the law in relation to these sections and their interaction is in Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330 at [158] – [204]. In reviewing that case law, the court (Beazley P, Schmidt and Button JJ) said:
	


“159   There are three matters that call for consideration. The first is what the phrase in s 97, “evidence that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind”, means. The second is the meaning of significant probative value in s 97(1)(b). As explained below, the first and second of these matters are interrelated. The third is what is involved in the judicial task required by s 101 in determining whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

160   It needs to be understood at the outset that evidence that a person had a particular tendency is adduced for the purpose of providing the foundation for an inference that the person was more likely to act in a particular way or have a relevant state of mind on the particular occasion that is subject of the charge or charges: see Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; 162 A Crim R 233 at [124] per Simpson J. This was explained in Elomar v R; Hasan v R; Cheikho v R; Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303; 316 ALR 206 at [359]:

“The inference is that, because the person had the relevant tendency, it is more likely that he or she acted in the way asserted by the tendering party, or had the state of mind asserted by the tendering party on an occasion the subject of the proceedings. Tendency evidence is a stepping stone. It is indirect evidence. It allows for a form of syllogistic reasoning.”

…

Significant probative value

162   It is appropriate to commence with an understanding of the meaning of the defined term “probative value”. In Shamouil, Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) said in relation to the definition in the Evidence Act of “probative value”:

“61 … the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment ...’. The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has ‘probative value’, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.

62 This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ‘rationally affect’ the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in [Adam v R [2001] HCA 57; 207 CLR 96], a ‘test’ of ‘rationality’ also directs attention to capability rather than weight. (emphasis in original).”

…

The meaning of “tendency”

166   The New South Wales authorities have not accepted that it is necessary, for evidence to be admissible as a “tendency” that it exhibit, to use the language of the common law relating to similar fact and propensity evidence, “underlying unity”, “a modus operandi” or a “pattern of conduct”: Velkoski v The Queen [2014] VSCA 121 at [171]. As Basten JA (Fullerton and R A Hulme JJ agreeing) said in Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136; 87 NSWLR 481, at [40], “such language … may provide little guidance in applying the current statutory test”. Rather, the admissibility of tendency evidence requires that it have “significant probative value”.

…

174   Relevantly to the issue in this case, as to the relationship between similarity and significant probative value, Campbell JA stated:

“125 … there is no striking pattern of similarity between the incidents. In my view there is no need for there to be a ‘striking pattern of similarity between the incidents’. All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged. In my view, it meets that test.

126 The Respondent submits that ‘the phenomenon of young women, who are drunkenly sleeping after a social event, being the subject of sexual interference is unfortunately not so compellingly rare or exceptional as to give the evidence significant probative value’. I do not accept that tendency evidence has to be of a tendency to do an act that is ‘compellingly rare or exceptional’ before it can have significant probative value.”

175   His Honour’s approach was applied in PWD, where the accused, the music master and principal of a Catholic boarding school, was charged with 10 counts of sexual misconduct against four boys. The prosecution sought to adduce evidence of the four complainants, and a further two witnesses of sexual conduct by the accused as tendency evidence admissible on all counts. The sexual conduct described by each complainant was different, both as to the type of sexual act and the seriousness of the alleged conduct. The trial judge, in a pre-trial ruling, ordered that the counts on the indictment relating to each of the complainants be severed on the basis that, as the acts and surrounding circumstances constituting the several offences were so different, the tendency evidence lacked significant probative value (at [4]-[6]).

…

178   This Court held that the evidence was admissible as tendency evidence and ordered that the counts on the indictment be tried together, stating, at [79]:

“The authorities are clear that for evidence to be admissible under s 97 there does not have to be striking similarities, or even closely similar behaviour.”

…

182   Thus, in summary, the law in this State is that whether the Court thinks that evidence has significant probative value for the purposes of s 97 involves an assessment by the Court as to whether a jury could treat it of importance in supporting an inference of guilt of the accused on the count charged. It is an assessment of the capacity of the evidence to have that effect. In undertaking that task, the Court must consider, having regard to the evidence adduced, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation consistent with innocence.

183   In making the assessment whether evidence tendered as tendency evidence has significant probative value, regard will inevitably be had to similarities in the conduct relevant to the offence. That is different from requiring that the conduct bear similarities to the conduct with which the person is charged. This was emphasised by the Court in Saoud where Basten JA observed, at [44], that “the nature of the similarities will depend very much on the circumstances of the case”.”

184   The critical point made in these authorities is that tendency evidence need not show a tendency to commit acts that constitute the crime or crimes with which the accused is charged. There only needs to be a “tendency … to act in a particular way” (s 97(1)) relevant to the conduct subject of the charge. Relevance is determined by reference to the Evidence Act, s 55, that is, evidence which, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

185   When regard is had to the inferential nature of tendency evidence and the requirement that it be relevant evidence, it is apparent that tendency evidence is not only directed to the particular type of conduct that constitutes an element of the charge. There is a wide range of evidence relevant to the determination of the guilt of a person of a particular crime. When the question of admissibility of tendency evidence arises the question is whether conduct said to exhibit a tendency allows, by an inferential process of reasoning, that the person was more likely to act in a particular way or have a relevant state of mind on the particular occasion that is the subject of the charge or charges: see Gardiner at [124] per Simpson J.

Section 101 – whether probative value significantly outweighs prejudicial effect

189   Section 101(2) provides that tendency evidence cannot be used against a defendant in a criminal trial, [unless] its probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect on the defendant. The section involves an evaluative judgment by the trial judge, not the exercise of a discretion: see R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at [94]-[95], although it is accepted that the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 apply to the appellate review of a determination made under s 101(2) see Ford at [110]; DAO at [170]; Fletcher at [48]. As Simpson J (Kirby and Schmidt JJ agreeing) stated in DAO at [170]:

“What is involved under s 101 is quintessentially a judgment – a judgment as to the probative value of the evidence relative to any potential prejudicial effect. That, no doubt, is why it is established that a so called ‘decision’ (read judgment) under s 101 is reviewable only on House v The King principles.”

190   The determination to be made under s 101(2) requires the trial judge to engage in a balancing exercise. As explained by this Court in Ceissman v R [2015] NSWCCA 74 at [36], in relation to coincidence evidence, although the same principles apply in respect of tendency evidence:

“The question [under s 101(2)] requires an evaluation of the probative value of the evidence balanced against an evaluation of its potential prejudicial effect. Both evaluations are to be undertaken by the trial judge on the basis of the information available at the time its admission is determined. The first evaluation (of probative value) is to be made on the assumption that the evidence said to constitute coincidence evidence is accepted by the tribunal of fact: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228.”

191   As is the case with s 97, the “no rational explanation” test as held in Pfenning v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 no longer reflects the appropriate consideration of the matters to be balanced under s 101(2): see Ellis at [95]-[96]. As Campbell JA stated in Ford, at [64]:

“The proper carrying out of the balancing task requires the judge to identify the type or types of prejudicial effect it may give rise to, and why it is that the judge has reached the view that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs (or does not substantially outweigh, as the case may be) any such prejudicial effect: R v Harker [[2004] NSWCCA 427] at [47], [58]; R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413.”

192   In Sokolowskyj, the Court (Hoeben CJ at CL Adams and Hall JJ agreeing) held, at [47], that “[t]he concept of ‘prejudicial effect’ is understood in substantially the same way as ‘unfair prejudice’”, as the latter term is used in s 137, namely, that there is a risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in an unfair manner: see also Gardiner at [57]; Ford at [55]. The question for determination under s 101(2) is whether probative effect outweighs that prejudicial effect. The section calls for a determination of the “prejudicial effect” the evidence “may have on the defendant” (emphasis added). In DAO, Simpson J considered, at [171], that such terminology meant that:

“… it is legitimate and appropriate for the judge to take into account the ameliorating effect of any directions that may be available to reduce the prejudicial effect.”

See also R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161; 161 A Crim R 329 at [32].

193   This observation in DAO is to the same effect as observations made in Sokolowskyj. It is a function of the trial judge in a jury trial to give such directions in order to ensure a fair trial.”


	
	A question then arises as to where in that process of reasoning consideration should be given to evidence of a risk of concoction or contamination and when that is determined, how that evidence should be treated.
	
	
	Again, guidance is provided by recent case law. While these cases set out relevant principle, each was dependent largely on its particular facts.
	
	
	The first step in that process is to consider some of the observations in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 (Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, Whealy JA, McCellan CJ at CL and McCallum J). There Bathurst CJ said:
	


“8   Third, it follows from the use of the word could in the definition of significant probative value that what the Court is required to assess is the possibility of the evidence affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. It is not required to assess whether the evidence would have this effect, that is, engage in a fact-finding exercise involving an assessment of the reliability and credibility of the evidence: cf R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [59] - [67].

9   Fourth, the matters to which the Court is to have regard in performing this task is the evidence sought to be adduced either on its own or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to tender it. In particular, regard is not to be had to evidence either adduced or to be adduced by the other party to the proceedings. This also demonstrates, in my opinion, that it is no part of the Court's task to engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the reliability or credibility of the evidence, or to form a view one way or the other whether the jury would in fact find the evidence to be of significant probative value.

10   However, as Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78] - [81]), the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value. However, this does not involve either undertaking the fact-finding analysis suggested by senior counsel for DSJ or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the party seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s 98(1)(b) of the Act and would involve the judge usurping the fact-finding role of the jury.

11   ALLSOP P: I have read the reasons of Whealy JA. Subject to the following, I agree with his reasons. I agree with the orders proposed. I appreciate the reasons for, and importance of, the reconciliation of my reasons in DAO v R ([2011] NSWCCA 63; 278 ALR 765) with those of Simpson J in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437, 158 A Crim R 504. I accept his reconciliation of our views. It is important, as Whealy JA recognises, that there be no misunderstanding about the task of the judge. It is his or her task to assess the capacity of the evidence in the manner described by Whealy JA, not to assess what a jury will do. I also agree with the additional comments of the Chief Justice.

…

78   [WHEALY JA]: In this appeal the Crown has conceded that, in performing the task under s 98, a trial Judge may, in an appropriate case, have regard to an alternative explanation arising on the evidence. The Crown, however, insisted that, in so doing, the trial Judge is restricted to examining whether the Crown hypothesis has cogency, that is, whether the Crown evidence is capable of being regarded as significant in its ability to prove the Crown case. If the coincidence evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence in the Crown case, positively and forcefully suggested an explanation consistent with innocence, then the coincidence evidence could scarcely be regarded as important or of consequence in proving the fact or facts in issue. What is required is this: the trial Judge must ask whether the possibility of such an alternative explanation substantially alters his (or her) view as to the significant capacity of the Crown evidence, if accepted, to establish the fact in issue. Does the alternative possibility, in the Judge's view, rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown's case? If it does not, the trial judge may safely conclude that the evidence has significant probative value.

79   In a practical sense, there are two avenues of approach to be taken. First, in examining the coincidence evidence (together with other material already in evidence or to be adduced) the trial Judge is required to ask whether there emerges, from a consideration of all the Crown evidence, a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt. For regard to be had to the alternative explanation, it must be a real possibility, not a fanciful one. It must be a broad or overarching possibility, capable of being stated in general terms, even though it may derive from an individual piece or pieces of evidence or the evidence taken as a whole.

80   Secondly, the trial Judge must ask whether that possibility substantially alters his (or her) view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the coincidence evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue. Of course, if the trial Judge has already concluded that the coincidence evidence does not reach that level of significance in terms of its capacity, he will have rejected the evidence in terms of s 98. In that situation, the possibility of an alternative inference may, for the time being, be set to one side. Later in the trial, when the evidence has concluded, that possibility will become a matter for the jury to assess and determine when it comes to consider whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

81   The Crown, in making its concession, however, stressed that at no stage in this process was the trial Judge required or entitled to assess the actual weight of any part of the evidence, or to make any actual assessment concerning the probabilities of any alternative theory. Nor was the trial judge required or entitled to make a comparison of the Crown theory and the probabilities of any alternative theory. This proposition appears consistent with established authority. Any attempt by the trial Judge to anticipate the actual weight the jury would attach to the evidence is prohibited, as I have explained.”


	
	Although those statements of principle were concerned with s 98, it has been acknowledged on a number of occasions that the same principles apply equally to s 97 of the Act (JG v R [2014] NSWCCA 138 at [105] (per Simpson J with whom Hall and Schmidt JJ agreed)).
	
	
	The issue of where in the process of reasoning the risk of concoction and contamination should be considered was dealt with directly in Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280 where Bellew J (Gleeson JA and Schmidt J agreeing) said:
	


“The third issue

76   The primary judge concluded that questions of concoction and contamination were relevant only to issues of credibility and reliability. Having reached this conclusion, the primary judge found that the decision of this Court in Shamouil prohibited any consideration being given to questions of concoction and contamination.

77   The essence of the submissions advanced by senior counsel for the applicant was that in cases decided since Shamouil (notably DSJ and XY) there had been something of a relaxation in the application of the relevant principles, such that the possibility of concoction or contamination was a relevant consideration when assessing the probative value of tendency evidence.

…

85   In the present case, the primary judge found that the possibility of concoction or contamination of the evidence was a matter which went only to issues of credibility and reliability. He concluded, in effect, that in those circumstances the decision in Shamouil precluded him from having regard to any issue of credibility and reliability in an assessment of the probative value of the evidence.

86   It must be emphasised that in the course of his judgment in Shamouil, Spigelman CJ made reference to the fact that the relevant authorities were in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility might be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence. He did not describe that approach as one which prohibited the consideration of those issues when determining that question. In describing the approach as restrictive, his Honour recognised that there may be cases in which issues of credibility or reliability may be relevant to that determination.

87   The effect of the conclusion reached by the primary judge in the present case was that the decision in Shamouil prohibited, under any circumstances, consideration of issues of credibility. That overstated the effect of the decision in Shamouil, although it does not alter the view I have ultimately reached as to the disposition of the present application.

88   Those parts of the judgments in DSJ and XY set out above support the conclusion that in assessing probative value of tendency evidence for the purposes of ss 97 and 101, it is no part of the function of the Court to assess, and make its own findings as to, the weight of the evidence, or to determine the likely acceptance or rejection of the evidence by a jury. However, they also support the conclusion that in assessing such probative value the Court may take into account, without determining the acceptance or rejection of, such competing inference(s) as may arise from the evidence.

89   Whether that may extend, in a given case, to allowing a Court to take into account concoction and contamination is a separate question entirely, the answer to which will depend largely upon the evidence. The evidence in DSJ and XY did not involve any issue of credibility and reliability. Accordingly, the Court was not required, in either case, to determine the question.

90   It is conceivable that there may be cases in which evidence of concoction and contamination gives rise to competing inferences. It may be that in such a case, those inferences are relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence. However, the evidence in the present case does not give rise to such inferences. For the reasons set out below, his Honour’s conclusion that there was no evidence of concoction or contamination was one which was well open to him. In those circumstances, the third issue raised by senior counsel for the applicant based upon the judgments in XY and DSJ does not require determination.”


	
	The same issue was considered by the Court in DJW v R [2015] NSWCCA 164 where R A Hulme J (with whom Simpson and Bellew JJ agreed) said:
	


“40   It is, however, necessary to refer in some detail to a case in which judgment was delivered after the primary judge's determination. The judgment is presently restricted: Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280. In that case, the primary judge had held that questions of possible concoction or contamination relate to the reliability and credibility of the evidence. This was said to be so on the basis that Hoch v The Queen and post-Evidence Act cases that had applied it, notably BP v R; R v BP and FB v R, should not be followed. In accordance with cases such as R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 and R v XY the probative value of the evidence was not to be determined by an assessment of its reliability and credibility.

41   In Jones v R, Bellew J (Gleeson JA and Schmidt J agreeing) considered (at [87]) that the primary judge had gone too far in holding that R v Shamouil prohibited, under any circumstances, consideration of issues of credibility. He referred to some of the judgments in DSJ v R; NS v R and R v XY and said (at [88]) that they supported the conclusion that in assessing probative value a court may take into account, without determining the acceptance or rejection of, such competing inference(s) as may arise from the evidence. Whether that may extend to allowing a court to take into account concoction and contamination was said (at [89]) to be a separate question which would depend largely upon the evidence. His Honour allowed (at [90]) for the possibility that evidence of concoction and contamination may give rise to competing inferences that may be relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence.

42    What was said by Bellew J in Jones v R was strictly obiter; the determination of the case was based upon a finding that it was open to the primary judge to have found that there was an absence of evidence of concoction or contamination. Nevertheless, I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasoning with one relatively minor exception. That is that Simpson J in R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335; 237 A Crim R 238 at [189]-[194] (with whom Barr AJ and I agreed) identified that in R v XY, only two of the five judges constituting the court accepted the relevance of there being competing inferences to the assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 137. R v Shamouil and R v XY were concerned with that provision. DSJ v R; NS v R was concerned with s 98 (coincidence evidence). In JG v R, Simpson J said (at [105]) that (on the authority of DSJ v R; NS v R) competing inferences were also potentially relevant to the assessment of probative value in relation to s 97. The distinction is that ss 97 and 98 (but not s 137), require consideration of “other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence”.

43   The primary judge in the present case was in error (the decision in Jones v R was not available to her) in determining the issue of concoction or contamination quite separately from the issue of whether the evidence had significant probative value. Whilst her Honour acknowledged what was said by Basten JA in BJS v R [2011] NSWCCA 239 in criticism of BP v R; R v BP, the separate treatment by her of the concoction/contamination issue, and finding that it was determinative by itself in respect of the trials concerning RW and CW, indicated an approach which was more akin to the Hoch approach. The Crown submitted, and I respectfully agree, that this resulted in her Honour adopting an approach that was unduly favourable to the applicant.

44   in the present case I am prepared to assume that the issue of possible concoction or contamination in the present case could give rise to a competing inference in the assessment of whether there was significant probative value. I am prepared to make this assumption because the applicant’s submissions on this subject must all be rejected in any event.”


	
	The issue arose again in McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184 where Basten JA (with whom Hidden and Wilson JJ agreed) said:
	


“35   For reasons to be explained shortly, the question of “concoction” arose only peripherally in the present case. However, the reliance by the applicant on the possibility of concoction as a basis for rejecting the admissibility of the evidence raises an issue as to the relevant legal principle being invoked. Its relevance arises from the need for the court to be satisfied that the evidence will have “significant probative value”, for the purposes of s 97(1)(b) and, further, that the probative value will be sufficient to substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect, for the purposes of s 101(2).

36   In his written submissions, the applicant contended that tendency evidence is “not admissible where the prosecution has failed to exclude the reasonable possibility of concoction and/or contamination.” That proposition was derived from the pre-Evidence Act case of Hoch v The Queen. In the course of oral submissions, counsel for the applicant conceded that this proposition is not consistent with the language of the Evidence Act. The statutory scheme now in force was explained by Spigelman CJ in R v Ellis.

…

(iii) Assessment of probative value – concoction

42   The role that a possibility of concoction or contamination may play in the application of s 97 requires careful consideration. The first question requires the assessment of whether the proposed evidence has significant probative value. That assessment may depend on whether the evidence is accepted by the jury or not. If it is rejected in its entirety, it will have no probative value. On the other hand, if it is accepted in its entirety, it will still be necessary to assess its probative value. That exercise is separate from the assessment of its possible prejudicial effect.

43   Two questions arise in this context: first, are questions of reliability and credibility relevant in assessing probative value? Some assessment must be made both for the purposes of ss 97 and 98 and for the separate exercise required under s 101. The latter section has a similar function (though the language differs) to s 137, which requires the Court to refuse to admit prosecution evidence “if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” The proper approach to assessing probative value for the purposes of s 137 was discussed in R v XY. In that case the Court, following R v Shamouil, held that the function of the judge in applying s 137 was to assess the capacity of the evidence to support a particular finding, but it is not its credibility and reliability, those being matters to be left to the jury if the evidence be admitted. That approach depended in part on the definition of “probative value” in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as meaning “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect that assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”. Spigelman CJ in Shamouil noted that “[t]he focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude.” Further, the words “rationally affect” were apt to refer to “capability rather than weight”.

44   In the discussion which followed in XY, I considered the extent to which reliability and credibility could be involved in the exercise to be undertaken by the judge under s 137. In particular, that discussion noted that the term “credibility” can be used to refer to plausibility, objectively considered. On the other hand, it may refer to an assessment of the truthfulness of the witness. The term “reliability” can have similar nuances of meaning.

45   In adopting the reasoning in Shamouil and XY, it is appropriate to acknowledge that the exercise to be undertaken pursuant to s 97 differs in one respect from that likely to arise under s 137. It was noted in XY that the question of exclusion under s 137 was likely to arise in isolation from the full circumstances of the prosecution case. By contrast, both s 97 and s 98 require the judge to assess the probative value of the proffered evidence “either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced” by the prosecution. Acknowledging the difference in statutory language, the practical differences will often be less marked. That is partly because the exercise required by s 137 will not be carried out in total ignorance of the other evidence to be called in the prosecution case. Similarly, as demonstrated by the conduct of the present case, a decision to admit evidence under ss 97, 98 and 101 is most likely to be made before the full detail of the prosecution evidence has been revealed. The primary reason for the additional language in ss 97 and 98 is that, like the general law principle relating to “similar fact evidence”, tendency and coincidence evidence cannot have probative value except in a context where, for example, both the conduct of the accused and the relevant tendency to act have been identified with some particularity.

46   The concept of “concoction” suggests a deliberate fabrication of the evidence. By contrast, the term “contamination” may involve an unconscious process of suggestion being adopted.

47   Whilst, in determining probative value as a question of capability to affect the assessment of a fact in issue, the court is not required to disregard inherent implausibility, on the other hand, contestable questions of credibility and reliability are not for the trial judge, but for the jury. Accordingly, the suggestion that the possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in determining whether particular evidence has significant probative value should not be accepted.

48   It should be acknowledged that this conclusion is inconsistent with the approach identified in the leading Australian text, Cross on Evidence. However, that reasoning appears to have relied upon cases which predated R v Ellis in 2003. Further, the view accepted here appears to be consistent with the explanation of R v XY accepted by the author of Cross as the applicable law in this State.

49   In the present case, both Dion Chandler and CC were cross-examined in an attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of their evidence. The cross-examination was tentative, in the sense that while the possibility of conversations between the complainant and the witness were suggested, the possible content of those conversations was not explored, the topic being identified at a high level of generality. In any event, these challenges took place after the evidence had been admitted and not before. If a possibility of concoction at a level sufficient to affect the capacity of the evidence to bear significant probative value were to be identified, it would probably have been necessary to carry out a reasonably searching cross-examination on the voir dire, before admissibility was ruled on. That did not happen. Thus, the reason why the trial judge did not consider the possibility of concoction in making his rulings, was that it was neither relied upon by counsel for the accused at trial, nor was it inherently necessary for the judge to consider such matters in assessing significant probative value.”


	
	The most recent statement of principle in relation to the “possibility of contamination or concoction” is in Hughes v R:
	


“Risk of contamination or concoction

201   There is a question whether the possibility of concoction or contamination is even a relevant consideration in determining whether evidence has significant probative value. There are numerous cases on this question. It is necessary to refer only to BJS, which his Honour applied as well as Jones and McIntosh.

202   In BJS, to which we have already referred at [89] – [90], the Court was concerned with the tests posited in both s 97 and s 101 for the admissibility of tendency evidence. Basten JA, at [23], pointed out that the common law “no rational explanation” test was inapplicable both in respect of s 97 and s 101. His Honour at [27], also approved as “unimpeachable” a statement in FB as follows:

“110 One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence.”

203   The manner in which the risk of contamination and concoction should be dealt with is addressed in the cases of Jones and McIntosh, to which we have already referred, at [94] – [97]. It may be that Basten JA’s remarks in McIntosh at [47] and [49] are to a different effect than his remarks in BJS. We do not, however, see them as inconsistent with Jones, which has been substantially endorsed in DJW v R [2015] NSWCCA 164. However, it would be a distraction in this case to analyse the nuances of the various authorities on this question, given Zahra DCJ’s finding at p 55, which, on our consideration of the evidence was well based, that the Crown had excluded:

“… the reasonable possibility that there has been any concoction by the complainants or tendency witnesses or there is a reasonable possibility their evidence is contaminated.”

204   His Honour took the view, at p 52, that there was no reasonable evidence of contamination or concoction that would produce a risk of prejudice or would act to reduce the otherwise significant probative value of the tendency evidence. In any event, to the extent that his Honour, at p 8, applied the approach in BSJ, that approach was favourable to the applicant.”


	
	On 14 April 2016 the High Court by a majority (French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) gave judgment in IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14. The effect of that judgment was to uphold the interpretation of s 97 of the Act in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228. In that regard the plurality said:
	


“35    The issue here concerning a trial judge's assessment of the probative value of the evidence in question arises in the context of a statute that was intended to make substantial changes to the common law rules of evidence. The statute's language is the primary source, not the pre-existing common law.

…

44    The assessment of ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"" requires that the possible use to which the evidence might be put, which is to say how it might be used, be taken at its highest. The definition must be read in the context of the provision to which it is applied. For the purposes of s 97(1)(b), the enquiry is whether the probative value of the evidence may be regarded as ""significant"".

…

52    Once it is understood that an assumption as to the jury's acceptance of the evidence must be made, it follows that no question as to credibility of the evidence, or the witness giving it, can arise. For the same reason, no question as to the reliability of the evidence can arise. If the jury are to be taken to accept the evidence, they will be taken to accept it completely in proof of the facts stated. There can be no disaggregation of the two – reliability and credibility – as Dupas v The Queen may imply. They are both subsumed in the jury's acceptance of the evidence.”


	
	Unfortunately in the context of this case, there was no occasion for the plurality to consider the application of s 101. Some guidance, albeit slight, can be taken from the following observations:
	


“57    In R v XY, Basten JA spoke of reliability being taken into account, but this was in the context of an assessment of the risk of prejudice under s 137, not as part of the assessment of the probative value of the evidence, which is the other side of the ""weighing"" exercise. In R v Shamouil, Spigelman CJ ventured that there may be some limited circumstances in which credibility and reliability will be taken into account in determining probative value. His Honour referred in this regard to what had been said by Simpson J in R v Cook. Her Honour there suggested that evidence that was obviously ""preposterous"" might be withheld from the jury.

58   It would not seem to be necessary to resort to an assessment of the reliability of evidence of this quality for it to be excluded under s 137. For the reasons already given, evidence which is inherently incredible or fanciful or preposterous would not appear to meet the threshold requirement of relevance. If it were necessary, the court could also resort to the general discretion under which evidence which would cause or result in an undue waste of time may be rejected.

59    Before turning to the application of ss 97(1) and 137 to the facts in this case, there should be reference to the appellant's submission concerning the risk of joint concoction to the determination of admissibility of coincidence evidence. The premise for the appellant's submission – that it is ""well-established"" that under the identical test in s 98(1)(b) the possibility of joint concoction may deprive evidence of probative value consistently with the approach to similar fact evidence stated in Hoch v The Queen – should not be accepted. Section 101(2) places a further restriction on the admission of tendency and coincidence evidence. That restriction does not import the ""rational view ... inconsistent with the guilt of the accused"" test found in Hoch v The Queen. The significance of the risk of joint concoction to the application of the s 101(2) test should be left to an occasion when it is raised in a concrete factual setting.”

Consideration


	
	No issue was raised as to the application of ss 5F(2) and 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Quite clearly, the ruling by her Honour would significantly weaken the Crown case. The contrary was not submitted. It is also clear that her Honour’s decision to sever the hearing of the counts on the indictment flowed directly from her Honour’s refusal to allow the Crown to rely upon the tendency evidence. The issue here is not the Crown’s power to bring the appeal but whether it has established that the appeal should succeed.
	
	
	I have concluded that there are a number of errors in her Honour’s approach to the admissibility of the tendency evidence, such as would require the intervention of this Court. In that regard, it should be noted that no challenge was made in this Court to the contents of the tendency notice. It should also be noted that the material before her Honour comprised statements and a transcript of the evidence given in earlier committal proceedings so that when considering the evidence, this Court was in as good a position as her Honour.
	
	
	As was pointed out in Hughes v R there is an issue as to whether the possibility of concoction or contamination is a relevant consideration in determining whether evidence has significant probative value. In BJS v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 239 and in Jones v R and DJW v R this was a consideration in determining significant probative value under s 97. The observations of Basten JA in McIntosh v R, however, suggest otherwise.
	
	
	If (which I believe is correct) the possibility of concoction or contamination where it arises in evidence, is a relevant consideration when determining whether evidence has significant probative value under s 97, her Honour was in error in not taking that matter into account when considering whether the tendency evidence had significant probative value. Moreover, as was pointed out in DJW v R by RA Hulme J, the process followed by her Honour of determining the issue of concoction or contamination quite separately from the issue of whether the tendency evidence had significant probative value gave rise to an approach which was more akin to that in Hoch v The Queen. There RA Hulme J said:
	


“43   The primary judge in the present case was in error … in determining the issue of concoction or contamination quite separately from the issue of whether the evidence had significant probative value. Whilst her Honour acknowledged what was said by Basten JA in BJS v R [2011] NSWCCA 239 in criticism of BP v R; R v BP, the separate treatment by her of the concoction/contamination issue, and finding that it was determinative by itself in respect of the trials concerning RW and CW, indicated an approach which was more akin to the Hoch approach. The Crown submitted, and I respectfully agree, that this resulted in her Honour adopting an approach that was unduly favourable to the applicant.”


	
	Another error in her Honour’s judgment was her approach to s 101 of the Act in which she implicitly, if not expressly, applied the Hoch test and a “no rational view” test when considering the possibility of concoction or contamination. The error in this approach was made clear by the plurality in IMM v The Queen at [59] (see [96] hereof).
	
	
	At 19 her Honour said:
	


“The position at common law, it has been said that tendency evidence, that is “reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction” will lack the necessary probative value. When considering whether concoction is a reasonable possibility it is relevant to examine the relationship, opportunity and motive of the witnesses - Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 222 at 297. That formulation has been adopted in relation to s 101 of the Evidence Act.

In BP v R [2010] NSW CCA 303 at 110 Hodgson JA observed that the risk of concoction or contamination “powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect”. If concoction and/or contamination may be the explanation for apparent similarities, the tendency evidence is deprived of force.

It has often been noted that the chance of concoction must be a real chance, not merely a speculative chance - see R v Colby [1999] NSW CCA 261 at para [111], referred to in BP at para [110]. The Crown bears the onus of negating any “real chance” of concoction - R v OGD [2000] NSW CCA 404 at 74 and BP at 110.”


	
	Such an approach was specifically disapproved in McIntosh where Basten JA said:
	


“36   In his written submissions, the applicant contended that tendency evidence is “not admissible where the prosecution has failed to exclude the reasonable possibility of concoction and/or contamination.” That proposition was derived from the pre-Evidence Act case of Hoch v The Queen. In the course of oral submissions, counsel for the applicant conceded that this proposition is not consistent with the language of the Evidence Act. The statutory scheme now in force was explained by Spigelman CJ in R v Ellis.”


	
	Her Honour’s reasoning on this issue appears to have relied upon cases which predated Regina v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at [94] – [96]. Her Honour was clearly in error in adopting the Hoch approach as applied in BP v R; R v BP, (BJS v Regina per Basten JA at [24], [26], RS Hulme J at [42]; Jones v R at [75]). It follows that her Honour applied the incorrect test for the admission of tendency evidence under the Act.
	
	
	Her Honour also erred in making assessments of credibility and reliability when determining the admissibility of the tendency evidence. This is clear from IMM v The Queen at [52]. Statements of principle to this effect are set out in DSJ v R. When carrying out that exercise “it is no part of the court’s task to engage in a fact finding exercise to determine the reliability or credibility of the evidence or to form a view one way or the other whether the jury would in fact find the evidence to be of significant probative value (Bathurst CJ at [9] and “It is his or her [the judge] task to assess the capacity of the evidence in the manner described by Whealy JA, not to assess what a jury will do” (Allsop P at [11]).
	
	
	This is clearly what her Honour did when concluding that:
	


“… a close examination of the statements and the evidence at committal raises a real doubt in my mind as to the true extent of the discussions between RM and her daughters and their partners which gives rise to a suggestion of concoction”.

“… their evidence does contain material which is remarkably similar as to unusual detail of which those who were not present could not have known about unless the matter had been the subject of discussion at some length” (Judgment 22.5)

“… but they maintain no detail was discussed. With respect I find that somewhat incredulous given the content of the statements and the evidence at committal. I find there is a distinct risk that the witnesses have developed their evidence as time has gone by, subconsciously or unintentionally through influence and discussion.”

“… it is apparent that they had a close discussion sufficient for them to both state at the time that they were not strong enough to go to the police. It defies credulity that there would not have been some greater in depth discussion than is suggested by them in light of the fact that they went to the effort of meeting to discuss what the accused had allegedly done to each of them.” (Judgment 23)


	
	In making those findings which were pivotal to her Honour’s conclusion that the tendency evidence should be rejected, her Honour did precisely that which the case law enjoined her not to do, i.e. she made an assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence of the witnesses. As was made clear in Jones v R at [88]:
	


“88   Those parts of the judgments in DSJ and XY set out above support the conclusion that in assessing probative value of tendency evidence for the purposes of ss 97 and 101, it is no part of the function of the Court to assess, and make its own findings as to, the weight of the evidence, or to determine the likely acceptance or rejection of the evidence by a jury. However, they also support the conclusion that in assessing such probative value the Court may take into account, without determining the acceptance or rejection of, such competing inference(s) as may arise from the evidence.”


	
	The above errors are such that her Honour’s conclusion that the tendency evidence should not be admitted cannot stand. That, of course, does not end the matter. It is necessary for this Court to examine the evidence, apply the correct test and reach its own conclusion.
	
	
	The question of what is the correct test under s 101 is not without difficulty. The concluding sentence in the observation from Jones v R just set out provides some guidance. This was clarified in DJW v R where RA Hulme J said:
	


“41   In Jones v R, Bellew J (Gleeson JA and Schmidt J agreeing) considered (at [87]) that the primary judge had gone too far in holding that R v Shamouil prohibited, under any circumstances, consideration of issues of credibility. He referred to some of the judgments in DSJ v R; NS v R and R v XY and said (at [88]) that they supported the conclusion that in assessing probative value a court may take into account, without determining the acceptance or rejection of, such competing inference(s) as may arise from the evidence. Whether that may extend to allowing a court to take into account concoction and contamination was said (at [89]) to be a separate question which would depend largely upon the evidence. His Honour allowed (at [90]) for the possibility that evidence of concoction and contamination may give rise to competing inferences that may be relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence.”

The reference to “competing inferences” is, of course, a reference to the statements of principle in DSJ v R.


	
	In McIntosh Basten JA postulated the test somewhat differently:
	


“44   In the discussion which followed in XY, I considered the extent to which reliability and credibility could be involved in the exercise to be undertaken by the judge under s 137. In particular, that discussion noted that the term “credibility” can be used to refer to plausibility, objectively considered. On the other hand, it may refer to an assessment of the truthfulness of the witness. The term “reliability” can have similar nuances of meaning.

…

47   Whilst, in determining probative value as a question of capability to affect the assessment of a fact in issue, the court is not required to disregard inherent implausibility, on the other hand, contestable questions of credibility and reliability are not for the trial judge, but for the jury. Accordingly, the suggestion that the possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in determining whether particular evidence has significant probative value should not be accepted.”


	
	Does the evidence in this matter amount to a real risk of contamination or concoction so as to give rise to a competing inference sufficient to deprive the tendency evidence of significant probative value. Put another way, is there a competing inference to be drawn from the evidence such as to render the tendency evidence inherently implausible. In carrying out that evaluative exercise, questions of credibility, reliability and weight should be disregarded.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the two sister complainants and the two sister tendency witnesses spoke to each other about various aspects of their interaction with the respondent. Consistently, however, they denied speaking to each other as a group. Such discussions as they had, occurred on an individual basis. The exception to that was the evidence of the sisters that they had spoken about things that the respondent did in front of them but “none of us have ever spoken about the things that he did to us”. This was a reference to occasions when all four sisters were present, i.e. the penis between the legs occasions and the touching in the farm ute. The cross-examination at the committal hearing was of a general kind and did not extend to a testing of what was actually said in any of those one-on-one conversations between the sisters.
	
	
	JC only spoke to one of the sisters, CM. That conversation occurred when JC had visited CM at her home at West Wyalong. Both JC and CM denied that they had exchanged any detail about what the respondent had done to them. When one looks at their statements and evidence, that is clearly correct. The evidence of JC is quantitatively and qualitatively different to that of CM. The offences against JC are different and more serious. Their evidence to the effect that they did not feel strong enough to go to the police, does not indicate that they were talking about the detail of what the respondent had done to them, but rather what (if anything) they should do about it. It should be noted that JC did not speak to any of the other sisters.
	
	
	The reliability and credit findings made by her Honour were contrary to the evidence of the sisters and JC and would clearly be contested issues in any trial. In those circumstances, I do not see how it could be said on the material before her Honour, that there was an inherent implausibility in what those witnesses said at the committal. I do not see how the evidence of the sisters and JC could give rise to a competing inference sufficient to deprive their evidence as to tendency of its significant probative value.
	
	
	To the extent that the common law factors of relationship, opportunity and motive remain relevant, they do not give rise to any inherent implausibility or powerful competing inference in this matter. Just because four of the tendency witnesses are sisters and as such had the opportunity of discussing these matters with each other, is not enough. This is particularly so when they have denied any detailed discussions as to what the respondent did to each of them and they were not cross-examined as to the detail of those conversations. The evidence of motive is thin and does not apply to JC. In any event the accusations against the respondent had been made well before 2009 when CM made her suicide attempt.
	
	
	I have particular difficulty with her Honour’s finding that “All the various witnesses denied discussing details yet their evidence does contain material which is remarkably similar as to unusual detail of which those who were not present could not have known about unless the matter had been the subject of discussion at some length”. The only unusual detail which I can identify is the respondent’s conduct after a shower of positioning his penis behind his legs. Since the evidence of all of the sisters is that they were present together on at least one occasion when this occurred and that it was a regular occurrence, it is not surprising that the description of what the respondent did in that regard was similar. That criticism could not apply to JC.
	
	
	Her Honour’s finding (at 24.1) that if the tendency evidence were allowed to be given, the respondent’s capacity to properly defend himself might be impeded because evidence might emerge of the rumours which were extant in the local community, does not withstand scrutiny. The rumours to which reference was made in the evidence related to the four sisters and JC. This was particularly so in relation to the physical assault by JC’s former boyfriend on the respondent. It is difficult to see how the respondent would be unfairly disadvantaged in that circumstance since these were the very matters which he was required to meet in the Crown case. There is no suggestion anywhere in the evidence that there were any rumours concerning LL, which is not surprising since the alleged offences against her occurred well before these offences.
	
	
	If anything, the evidence suggested that contamination and concoction were unlikely. This can be inferred from the evidence of JM that her sister SM had told her about an incident with the respondent which occurred at the holiday home at Malua Bay. Despite SM having told her about it, JM was still unable to remember the incident and did not say or suggest that she had in some fashion recovered that memory. This is the very antithesis of concoction and contamination.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing in this Court, Hall J put forward a scenario which is to be contrasted with the evidence in this matter and which could give rise to inherent implausibility or a competing scenario which might substantially erode the significant probative value of any tendency evidence (Appeal transcript 5.33). The scenario put forward by Hall J was that of an allegation of sexual misconduct by a former teacher against a group of former pupils. In that scenario the former pupils, now adults, formed a victims’ group and used to meet on a regular basis to discuss what had happened to each of them with this teacher.
	
	
	In such a scenario there would be no issue as to the occurrence of the meetings, or as to what was discussed at the meetings. Depending on the level of detail discussed and the actual evidence, that may well be a scenario where a denial of contamination would be regarded as inherently implausible or where the very facts themselves might give rise to a competing inference which would substantially erode the significant probative value of any tendency evidence. The contrast between that scenario and the issues raised in this matter is stark.
	
	
	On my reading of the evidence of the four sisters and JC I am satisfied, for the purposes of s 97 and s 101 of the Act, that it has significant probative value. I am satisfied that significant probative value has not been eroded by inherent implausibility nor is there a competing inference sufficient to deprive the tendency evidence of its significant probative value. There is certainly material in the evidence which would enable cross-examination at trial as to the possibility of contamination or concoction. Those, however, are matters for the jury not for a trial judge ruling as to the admissibility of evidence at the commencement of the trial. This is particularly so when such a ruling of necessity would involve the making of findings as to the credibility and reliability of that evidence.
	
	
	Section 101(2) of the Act provides that tendency evidence cannot be used against a defendant in a criminal trial unless its probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect on the defendant. In carrying out that balancing exercise, I am satisfied that the probative value of the tendency evidence does substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect on the respondent. Just because four of the tendency witnesses are sisters, had the opportunity to talk about the actions of the respondent and did in fact talk about them, does not create unfairness of the type envisaged by the section. This is particularly so when that evidence can be tested at trial.
	
	
	It also needs to be kept in mind when considering s 101 that in a case such as this clear directions by the trial judge would substantially remove any potential unfairness. The factual scenario in this trial is relatively straightforward and such directions as would be required to be made by the trial judge would not be complex and would be readily understood by the jury.
	
	
	It has long been recognised that appropriate trial directions need to be provided so that a jury is properly instructed in the evaluation required of evidence in the nature of tendency evidence where it is contended at trial that the evidence is affected by contamination. This issue was addressed in The Queen v Glennon (No 2) [2001] VSCA 17. Although the court was there addressing the concept of similar fact evidence, the observations are of equal importance in relation to a Crown case in which tendency evidence is relied upon. In Glennon, Callaway JA (with whose reasons Winneke P and Ormiston JA agreed) observed:
	


“155   ‘Collusion’ does not have a special meaning which includes unconscious influence or innocent infection. The point is rather that, just as collusion deprives disputed similar fact evidence of its probative value, the same may be true of unconscious influence or innocent infection from media publicity. The unconscious influence or innocent infection may supply the explanation for the similarity between the respective complainants’ accounts without there being any dishonest fabrication. Where that is an issue at trial, the judge should direct the jury that they have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such unconscious influence or innocent infection is not the explanation for the similarities on which the Crown relies.”


	
	Although in that case the question of unconscious influence or contamination was argued on the basis of media publicity, the approach to be taken with respect to jury directions applies equally to a case of contamination arising in other circumstances. Callaway JA in Glennon (No 2), referred to the following observations from R v Best [1998] 102 A Crim R 56 at [64] per Callaway JA (with whom Phillips CJ agreed):
	


“In addition, quite apart from any such comment, there is a direction that the judge should give at trial where collusion is raised as an issue. The jury should be told, with the full authority of the judge’s office, that they must be satisfied that there was no collusion before they use disputed similar fact evidence as part of their reasoning. (The same applies to any other factor, such as unconscious influence or contamination by media publicity, that would affect the argument which gives such evidence its probative force.) Cases on the standard of proof of circumstantial evidence are referred to later in this judgment, but it will usually be wise to tell the jury that they must be so satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. That accords with the practice in England (see R v H [1995] 2 App Cas 596 at 602B) and is obviously conducive to justice.

The observations there made as to trial directions would, in my opinion, apply equally to an issue of contamination as raised in the present proceedings.


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	That the Crown appeal, pursuant to ss 5F(2) and 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 be allowed.
	
	
	That the orders of English DCJ of 18 March 2015 be quashed.
	
	
	That the six counts on the indictment against the respondent be heard together.
	
	
	That the Crown be at liberty to adduce as tendency evidence in that trial the evidence of JM, CM, SM, HM and JC.
	



	
	HALL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	As for his Honour’s discussion of the role of asserted concoction or contamination in assessing probative value with regard to tendency or coincidence evidence, I have reflected upon whether the decision in IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14 supersedes the jurisprudence that has developed in this Court since the handing down of the judgments in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 in 2006 and R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; (2013) 84 NSWLR 363 in 2013.
	
	
	On the one hand, if it is now clear that trial judges are not to engage in an assessment of credibility or reliability in assessing probative value, that could suggest that there is no role for consideration of alternative inferences about asserted concoction or contamination. That is because it could be said that the possibility of concoction is merely an aspect of credibility, and the possibility of contamination is merely an aspect of reliability.
	
	
	On the other hand, the plurality in the High Court of Australia did not expressly disapprove the analysis that has been provided by this Court over the last 10 years. To the contrary, by way of footnote 45 within [59] of the plurality judgment, their Honours referred with approval to what had been said by Basten JA (with the agreement of Hidden and Wilson JJ on this point) in one of the most significant of those cases, McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184 at [42]-[48], and did not demur from what his Honour said in the rest of that judgment.
	
	
	As well as that, the plurality expressly reserved the question of the role, if any, that asserted concoction could play with regard to the test contained in s 101 of the Act: at [59].
	
	
	Finally, the plurality spoke of the possibility of evidence, even when taken at its highest, possessing low probative value (the “identification on a foggy night” example): at [50]. That approach seemingly admits of taking into account, at least, factors that go to the reliability of evidence.
	
	
	In the circumstances, unless and until the High Court speaks more determinatively and adversely with regard to the jurisprudence developed by this Court, I am content to regard it as remaining applicable to the task of trial judges.

		09 February 2018",2016-05-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769365,State of New South Wales v Strong [2016] NSWSC 573,"judgment


	
	The State of New South Wales moves the Court for an interim detention order in respect of the defendant, Mr Strong, under s18A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW). The proceedings were commenced by summons dated 14 March 2006. The State seeks by way of principal relief the making either of a continuing detention order under the provisions of s 5D of the Act or, in the alternative, an extended supervision order under the provisions of s 5C.
	
	
	At the preliminary hearing before Hall J on 4 April 2016 orders were made under s 15 of the Act for the appointment of two qualified psychiatrists to examine Mr Strong and provide expert evidence at the final hearing of the proceedings. I am informed by counsel - as appears from the evidence read before me - that the psychiatrists have examined Mr Strong but that the reports are not yet available.
	
	
	Mr Strong is serving a term of imprisonment in respect of a serious sex offence. His term of imprisonment expires on 15 May 2016. It is not disputed before me that he meets the definition of a High Risk Sex Offender within s 5B of the Act. Indeed, so much is conceded on his behalf. Having considered for myself in a provisional way the material exhibited with the affidavit of Paul Nash, solicitor, affirmed on 14 March 2016, I am satisfied that that concession, made only for the purpose of today's proceedings, is properly made.
	
	
	It is therefore unnecessary for me to detail Mr Strong's criminal history. Suffice it to say that he has been convicted of about seven sex offences, many of them of a very serious type and he has spent the greater part of his adult life in prison. He is now nearly fifty-seven years of age.
	
	
	The court's power to make an interim detention order is conferred by s 18A in the following terms:
	


“The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim detention of an offender if, in proceedings on an application for a Continuing Detention Order, it appears to the court:

(a) that the offender's current custody...will expire before the proceedings are determined, and

(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order.”


	
	At the preliminary hearing before Hall J dates for the final hearing were fixed for 14 and 16 June 2016. It is apparent that the conditions stated in paragraph (a) of s 18A are satisfied, that is, that Mr Strong's current custody will expire before the proceedings are determined. The focus of the evidence and argument before me has been whether the matters raised in the supporting documentation, if proved, justify the making of an order under either s 5C or 5D.
	
	
	It seems that paragraph (b) of s 18A deliberately provides alternative tests for the making of an interim detention order setting the bar somewhat lower than that for a continuing order under s 5D. A continuing order under s 5D can only be made “if the offender is a High Risk Sex Offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by the standard supervision order"": see Anderson v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 86; Davie v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 96.
	
	
	This case may in its circumstances provide an illustration of why the legislature has adopted that approach. Essentially, notwithstanding what appears to be diligent efforts of Corrective Services New South Wales (“CSNSW”) and its officers to devise a plan for supervision in the community which would adequately supervise the offender and the unacceptable risk he presents of committing a serious sex offence if unsupervised, three factors remain outstanding. They are as follows:
	



	
	Very importantly, no suitable residence or accommodation has been identified for Mr Strong upon his release;
	
	
	A question about his ability to continue to comply with his medication outside prison; and
	
	
	A question in relation to his ability to manage his finances, which doubtless are very simple, if no order is made by the Civil Administrative Tribunal of New South Wales under the Guardianship legislation to enable those matters to be managed for him.
	



	
	Given the proper concession that Mr Strong is a High Risk Sex Offender it is obvious that the first alternative provided by s 18A (b) is satisfied, that is, without more, an extended supervision order is justified if the documentation provided is proved at the hearing: s 5C of the Act. This alone is enough to justify an interim detention order. But in deference to the evidence and argument that has been advanced before me today, and so that Mr Strong might better understand why the court is making the order sought, I propose to give some reasons why I am persuaded that the material before me, if proved at a final hearing, would justify a finding that an extended supervision order would not provide adequate supervision of him in the community.
	
	
	Suitable and stable accommodation is fundamental to adequate supervision in the community. From the affidavit of Mr Devoy sworn on 2 May 2016 I am satisfied that over a long period of time CSNSW has attempted unsuccessfully through its officers to find suitable accommodation for Mr Strong upon his release at the expiration of his sentence. The difficulty in that regard is presented by a number of factors.
	
	
	The first, it must be said, is his criminal history itself. Accommodating him is against the policy of otherwise suitable organisations. But it is also important to understand that he has been diagnosed as suffering from severe mental illness, although the evidence is not free from doubt about the precise diagnosis. He also suffers from personality disorder and cognitive impairment. There is evidence that these conditions overlap and some doubt about which may be more significant in terms of the risk he presents to the community. These matters limit available suitable accommodation. Release to a private residence on his own would not suitably or adequately supervise the risk. There are difficulties otherwise with private accommodation because, as the material indicates, family members are not confident that they could adequately cope with him given that some of his offending in the past has been directed at relatives. There are limited places available in halfway houses or the like; or even in civilian mental health facilities.    
	
	
	So far as civilian mental health facilities are concerned there is a difference of opinion about whether he is a candidate for admission to one. There are differences whether a community treatment order could be made in his case, although that is the preferred option of Doctor Jones who has examined him whilst he was in custody and whose affidavit was read today. Part of the difficulty, and only part, in relation to a civilian mental health facility is that, to his credit, Mr Strong has been compliant with the requirements of his medication whilst in custody. The medication covers not only treatment appropriate to his mental condition, including anti-psychotic medication, but also regular Depo-Provera injections to suppress his libido. He has, unlike other offenders in respect of whom continuing detention orders have been made, willingly whilst in custody complied with regular injections of that type, at least recently.
	
	
	The problem identified in the documentation, is that absent a guardianship order that would enable consent to that treatment to be given on his behalf, it would be difficult to continue to ensure his compliance with that necessary treatment whilst he is at liberty because of the mental health issues I have referred to.
	
	
	The efforts of the Department really have come down to one identified option for accommodation and that is at the Nunyara COSP. But his suitability for accommodation in that facility is yet to be assessed. A number of other applications made on his behalf by the Department to other facilities have been refused for various reasons.
	
	
	The guardianship order that has been sought extends to the management of his financial affairs. That is a particularly important matter for the management of the risk he presents to the community because part of the explanation for his past serious offending has been his inability to juggle his finances. This has led to periods of homelessness which have led him to offend by increasing feelings of resentment he has at times expressed in relation to women.
	
	
	The difficulty with accommodation also operates at a more basic level. Given his risk it is inevitable that he will be subject to electronic surveillance including wearing an anklet. Without a fixed place of abode, and a suitable one, that device cannot operate. A purpose of the device is ensuring compliance with curfew conditions and CSNSW needs to be able to monitor his comings and goings from his place of residence to successfully respond to any deviation from the requirements of any supervision order.
	
	
	Although it was perhaps not necessary to descend into this detail, given my understanding of the meaning of s 18A, were it necessary for me to so find, I am satisfied that the material placed before me today in support of this interim application if proved at a final hearing would justify the making of a Continuing Detention Order in as much as it demonstrates that, currently, he could not be adequately supervised by the conditions of an Extended Supervision Order.
	
	
	That is not to say, as I have said, that things will not change in the near future. The efforts of the Department continue with regard to finding suitable accommodation. Moreover, an application has been filed with NCAT for a guardianship order and it is expected that an expedited hearing can be allocated by NCAT on 31 May 2016.
	
	
	It seems to me there is a good prospect, given more time, that the concerns identified can all be addressed before the final hearing of the State's application. For those reasons I am satisfied that an interim detention order should be made in accordance with the provisions of s18A, in compliance with s18C of the Act, and I will make orders in accordance with the Short Minutes of Order, the form of which has been agreed by the parties.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 18A and s 18C of the Crimes (High Risk Offender) Act 2006, the defendant be subject to an Interim Detention Order (“IDO”) for a period of 28 days to take effect from 15 May 2016 to 12 June 2016.
	
	
	The matter is listed for further hearing before the Registrar at 9:00 a.m. on Friday 10 June 2016 to determine whether an application for further IDO is required.
	
	
	Order the Registrar to issue an order under s 77 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 directing the Commissioner of Corrective Services to cause the Defendant to be produced at the Court in person for the final hearing on 14 June 2016 and 15 June 2016, unless the court otherwise.
	
	
	Liberty to apply to the Duty Judge for the release of the reports of the Court appointed psychiatrists to Corrective Services NSW and practitioners treating the defendant.

		09 May 2016",2016-05-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769377,R v Smith [2016] NSWDC 135,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: I have an unusual case for sentence today. Jason Smith has pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs. Ordinarily, people who commit such an offence know that they have a significant quantity of drugs which they are supplying. There will be many kilos of cocaine. There will be large numbers of pills. There will be blocks of heroin. But the case before me today is somewhat unusual.
	
	
	Mr Smith is to be sentenced on the basis that he had in his possession for the purposes of supply, something in the order of 40 pills. These were not ecstasy, but Mr Smith apparently treated them as though they were its equivalent and that they would have the same effects. In fact, they were a different form of drug. They were not methylenedioxymethylamphetamine at all, but instead were a drug known in shorthand as 25C-NBOMe. The large commercial quantity of that drug is two grams. Mr Smith had more than nine grams of that drug in his possession.
	
	
	In assessing the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct, one has to look at the decisions that the offender made. He was completely unaware that the drug he was supplying was unlike ecstasy. That is an important matter in determining the sentence to impose upon him. Supplying a large commercial quantity of a drug carries with it a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Because of the circumstance that I have just described, this offending was very much at the lower end of the range covered by offences of a large commercial supply. I have, of course, taken into account the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period and my reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	Matters came to light after the offender took some of the drug for the first time. It apparently has an effect unlike that of ecstasy. Rather than making someone calm and relaxed and happy and loving, the drug that the offender took on 8 May 2015 had significant hallucinogenic effects. These became obvious to many people who dealt with Mr Smith on the morning of 9 May 2015.
	
	
	A woman by the name of Donna Bissett was driving to work. As she was driving along the road she saw two people standing there. One of them was this offender. The offender ran towards her car. She tried to brake, but he kept running towards the car and ended up on top of her bonnet. He fell off the car and Ms Bissett lost sight of him. Very kindly, she turned around and drove back to check on him. She found him lying on the road, parked her vehicle and called police.
	
	
	Continuing on with her very kind behaviour, she actually got out of her car to check on him. She asked if he was okay. His response was to get up and run towards her. Not surprisingly, she got scared at this, so she went back to her vehicle and locked herself inside. She contacted her boss, a woman by the name of Fiona Morris, and advised her what was happening. The offender then jumped onto the bonnet of Ms Bissett’s car and began screaming at her. Again not surprisingly, Ms Bissett suspected that he was under the influence of drugs.
	
	
	The offender began thumping on the windscreen. His friend, Mr Nickerson, pulled him off. The offender then kicked the front of the vehicle a number of times. He moved to the driver’s side window and started to punch it and attempted to pull the side mirror off. Ms Bissett contacted police again. Mr Smith clearly damaged Ms Bissett’s car and he has asked me to take into account when I sentence him for the drug supply matter an offence of damaging Ms Bissett’s property on a Form 1.
	
	
	Mr Nickerson pulled the offender away. At this stage Ms Bissett’s boss, Ms Morris, arrived. She got into Ms Bissett’s vehicle and waited with her. Despite the offender’s behaviour, both women, again acting incredibly kindly and out of concern for Mr Smith’s welfare, got out of their car and went to check on him. The offender’s response was to jump up and kick Ms Morris and Ms Bissett in their legs. He was grunting and ranting. Those assaults also appear on the Form 1.
	
	
	The offender followed them as they went back to Ms Bissett’s car and began running around it, screaming ,and kicking the back of the car.
	
	
	Eventually police arrived and handcuffed Mr Smith. Although he was initially compliant, as they were attempting to get him into the caged vehicle, he spat at one of the officers. That assault also appears on the Form 1. Clearly suspicious as to what was causing Mr Smith’s bizarre behaviour, they searched his car. They found the drugs to which I have referred. They also found one MDMA tablet. Possession of that drug is also on the Form 1.
	
	
	They then searched Mr Smith’s mobile phone. They reveal that he was not only a drug user, but a drug supplier. There were numerous text messages to and from the offender during the month before his arrest indicating that he was involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. On the night before his arrest he sent a text message to Mr Nickerson indicating that he had “45” to sell. In evidence today Mr Smith admitted that he had been supplying drugs for about four months before his arrest. He had no memory of his bizarre behaviour which led to his arrest.
	
	
	The offender has no real excuse for being a drug supplier. He was brought up in a caring and loving family, a family which supports him even today. There was no suggestion that any of his family members were drug users or had criminal records, and no suggestion that they were distant or provided poor role models. Many people appearing for sentence have had terrible upbringings. They have chosen to commit criminal offences in circumstances where the choice whether to do what they did or not was based on behaviour they had witnessed as they were growing up. Many drug suppliers are introduced to drugs at an early age by their parents. Mr Smith has no such excuse at all. His decision to commence the act of supplying drugs was his and his alone. He told the author of the pre-sentence report that he did it to make quick money. He had lost his job and in fact had only recently got a new job very shortly before his arrest. He told me in evidence that he had got involved with the wrong crowd and so in order to fit in with them he began supplying drugs.
	
	
	Often when people say that they got mixed up with the wrong crowd, upon investigation it turns out that the offender himself was the wrong crowd, but there is some support for what the offender has said. After his arrest his family were threatened by anonymous telephone calls. That does tend to suggest that Mr Smith was involved with people who were poor influences on him rather than him being a poor influence on them.
	
	
	The offender, I am satisfied, was trafficking to a substantial degree. That ordinarily means that he must receive a full-time custodial sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances. In assessing whether he needs to go to gaol full-time I take into account a number of factors, in particular, his rehabilitation. I also take into account the availability of a sentencing option which was not available at the time the Court of Criminal Appeal laid down its rule that those trafficking to a substantial degree should expect to go to gaol full-time unless there are exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	Let me speak about Mr Smith’s rehabilitation. He has been subject to urinalysis since his arrest. That confirms his claims to those who have interviewed him - a psychiatrist, a psychologist and someone from the Probation and Parole Service - that he has not used drugs since his arrest. His mother gave evidence today and described a significant change in his behaviour. At the time of his offending he was going out and was acting in a very closed way towards her, but he is now a different sort of young man. He has a steady job, he has a steady girlfriend and he spends a lot of time with his family, a thing which, as I have noted earlier, is a positive matter in the offender’s case. A reference from his employer was tendered today. It is clear that his employer now knows about his offending and yet he will keep his job.
	
	
	I should also mention that Mr Smith is a person who has had his troubles with depression over the years. Indeed at an earlier time after he broke up with a girlfriend he attempted suicide. The relationship between this and his offending is not easy to determine, but it is certainly the case that were a full-time custodial sentence to be imposed on Mr Smith, it would weigh very heavily on him indeed.
	
	
	There is no doubt that drugs are terrible things. The offender’s behaviour in attacking two women who had only his welfare in mind shows how terrible they are. Families are destroyed by drugs. Drug users often become awful people, committing offences as they seek to satisfy their need to obtain money to satisfy their addictions, and for that reason those who supply drugs are regarded by the criminal law as serious criminals.
	
	
	Mr Smith did a seriously bad thing and were it not for his age at the time of his offending and the rehabilitation that he has achieved, I would have no hesitation in sending him to gaol full-time even given the circumstance that his history of depression will mean that that would be a significant punishment for him.
	
	
	Mr Randle submits that I should deal with the matter by imposing upon his client an intensive corrections order. Implicit in that submission is that I will impose a sentence of two years’ imprisonment or less. The Crown did not speak in opposition to such an outcome. I am satisfied that that would appropriately deal with the need to both punish Mr Smith and to assist him in his rehabilitation. I believe that a sentence of two years’ imprisonment or less is likely and that, if suitable, an intensive corrections order may well be imposed.
	
	
	I will order that there is to be an assessment as to the suitability of Mr Smith to serve a sentence of imprisonment by means of an intensive corrections order.

		13 July 2016",2016-05-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769387,R v Gaetano VITALE; R v Mark SCALIA [2016] NSWDC 223,"Judgment


	
	After presiding over a judge-alone trial, on 16 October 2015 I found the offender Gaetano Vitale guilty of manufacturing not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 14 June and 26 June 2013 at Bringelly and other places in the State of New South Wales. I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of that substance. The offence of which I found him guilty is contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	On that date I also found Angelo Vitale and Mark Scalia guilty of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 14 June and 26 June 2013 at Bringelly contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Similarly, I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they knowingly took part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity.
	
	
	Accordingly, all three offenders are to be sentenced with respect to those offences. Section 24(2) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	I will proceed to sentence Gaetano Vitale and Mark Scalia today. Angelo Vitale’s sentence proceedings have been adjourned to 2 September 2016, in view of the medical evidence tendered on his behalf and the fact that it has become necessary for him to engage in radiotherapy treatment for his cancer.
	
	
	Each offender has also pleaded not guilty to a related offence contrary to s 93T of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) contained on a s 166 certificate. I will return to the resolution of those offences in due course.
	
	
	Gaetano Vitale is also to be sentenced for an unrelated offence of dishonestly obtain benefit by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b). That offence carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. The offender pleaded guilty to that offence in the Local Court and the matter was committed for sentence on 21 January 2016. When sentencing him for that offence, I take into account an offence of participating in criminal activity which is set out on the Form One document.
	


FACTS - MANUFACTURE


	
	In light of the fact that the offenders are to be sentenced following trial, it is necessary to set out a summary of the evidence relied upon by the Crown and the basis upon which I found the offenders guilty. This task will assist in crystallising the facts upon which I will sentence the offenders.
	
	
	At trial, the Crown relied upon a combination of the location of what was asserted to be 1,228.62 grams of prohibited drug. In large part, the Crown relied upon the admixture rule as provided under s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The substances were found in a number of vessels in the garage at the Bringelly residence. The Crown also relied upon various categories of circumstantial evidence. The 1,228.62 grams of preparations and/or admixtures said to contain methylamphetamine and upon which the Crown relied can be set out in the following way.
	



	
	Item B025 described as dark coloured solid substance in a glass dish located on top of a Kambrook portable hotplate, weighing 102 grams. The result of the analysis was that the substance contained methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Item B026, dark coloured solid substance in a Sunbeam electric frypan weighing 43 grams. The result of the analysis was that the substance contained methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Item B034, brown solid residue in a Sunbeam electric frypan, weighing 0.8 grams, which contained methylamphetamine and BMN.
	
	
	Item B042-1 described as two layered liquid in a 2000 millilitre Schott Duran separating funnel located sitting inside item B042-2. The bottom layer was strongly alkaline. The net weight was 1,075 grams. The result of analysis was that the substance contained methylamphetamine, chlorpheniramine and triprolidine. The top layer was indicated to include xylene.
	
	
	Lastly, Item B068, a substance in a dish weighing 7.82 grams. The result of analysis was that the substance contained methylamphetamine.
	



	
	In addition, the Crown relied upon a circumstantial case. In February 2013, police commenced investigating Gaetano Vitale in relation to the manufacture of prohibited drugs. Telephone intercepts on his phone caused the investigators to believe that he was taking steps to manufacture and later was manufacturing a prohibited drug together with Anthony Klonaris and several others. The Crown relied upon telephone intercept material and text messages together with the results of swabs taken at the residence in West Hoxton as evidence founding an inference or conclusion that Gaetano Vitale and/or Anthony Klonaris and/or Nicholas Fenech were involved in manufacture related activity at West Hoxton. On the Crown case, these drug related activities could not continue at that address and the operation was moved to the address at Bringelly, being the residence of Angelo Vitale, Gaetano Vitale's father. The reason on the Crown case that the operation had to be moved was because Gaetano Vitale's wife, Helen, became extremely upset and angry about the manufacture of drugs at their home.
	
	
	In evidence at trial were a number of text messages sent to Gaetano Vitale on about 15 June 2013. Intercepts revealed a number of text messages sent to Gaetano Vitale from his wife, Helen. At 5.39am, he received a text, ""You can look me in the eyes and - what's wrong? Are you fucking serious? Our son lives here. Okay? What the fuck do I need to do?"" At 5.42am, he received a text, ""This is our home."" At 5.53am, he received a text, ""You smashed cunt motherfucker."" At 5.43am, he received a text, ""I told you what happened, you fucking grump."" At 6.25am, a text is received, ""Are you still going?"" At 6.13am, he received a text, ""Fuck off now. You're lying."" At 6.13am, he received a text, ""Listen here, I'm not lying. I can't even sleep. Okay?"" At 6.28am, a text reads, ""I feel so sick."" At 6.29am, he received the text, ""My eyes are stinging and my nose is burning."" At 6.32am, he received a text, ""You don't listen. I told you. No, no, no. You don't - you fucking listen. Why are you like this? Why are you doing this to me and the baby? Why?"" At 8.26am, Gaetano Vitale sent a message to the number associated with Mark Scalia. It states, ""Don't come - not to go right now. Trust me. She's not happy with me and Nick just left.""
	
	
	In the course of delivering reasons for the verdict, I determined that the text communication between Gaetano Vitale and his wife was evidence, taken together with other evidence in the trial, from which I could infer beyond reasonable doubt that Helen was angry and frustrated because her husband had commenced the process of manufacturing methylamphetamine in their garage. She was also concerned for the welfare of her son.
	
	
	During the course of the sentence proceedings, Gaetano Vitale and his wife gave evidence. I will deal more fully with the offender’s evidence in due course. However, for present purposes, each gave evidence that the fight between them on 15 June 2015, including the exchange of text messages, related to the offender smoking methylamphetamine in their home and lying about it to his wife. Each denied that the fight related to the offender manufacturing drugs in their garage.
	
	
	This was not evidence called in the trial. In any event, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the fight between the couple was limited to the offender smoking methylamphetamine in the garage at their home. The degree of anger and frustration evidenced by the messages sent by Helen to her husband, together with the move from that house to Bringelly and the immediate setting up of a clandestine laboratory there, satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that Gaetano Vitale had commenced the manufacture of methylamphetamine at the West Hoxton house.
	
	
	A number of conversations captured by telephone intercepts included conversations between Gaetano Vitale and Anthony Klonaris, apparently speaking in drug related code and referring to a person called Nick whom the Crown alleged is the accused Nicholas Fenech. A number of telephone conversations referred to obtaining equipment and materials needed for the manufacture of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. On about 16 June 2013, the drug manufacture operation was removed from Gaetano Vitale's home in West Hoxton to his father's premises at Bringelly. On 25 June 2013, police attended at the Bringelly premises and executed a search warrant. The premises consisted of a semi-rural property occupying about five acres and containing two separate dwellings, number 10 and number 12.
	
	
	Number 10, The Retreat, Bringelly, was occupied by the accused Angelo Vitale and his wife. Number 12 appears to have been occupied by one of his sons, that son's wife, and their daughter. Upon attending at number 10, police could smell chemicals. They observed a closed internal door that was believed to lead into the garage. Upon opening the door, the police located Anthony Klonaris in the garage standing at a table in front of a metal block, tending to a yellow bubbling liquid which was later found to contain methylamphetamine. He was standing and stirring the mixture with a metal object. Police observed numerous empty chemical containers and bottles inside the garage. The video taken by police of the search of the garage and a number of still photographs that have been tendered clearly establish that a clandestine drug manufacture laboratory had been set up in the garage at number 10, The Retreat, Bringelly.
	
	
	Amongst other things, the police located the following items.
	



	
	A glass dish found on top of the Kambrook Hotplate with what was described as a dark coloured solid. The weight was 102 grams and the substance contained methylamphetamine, item B025;
	
	
	A frypan found to contain 43 grams of dark coloured solid found to contain methylamphetamine, item B026. The frypan was turned on when the police arrived on 25 June 2013;
	
	
	3. The separating funnel containing 1,075 grams of a two layered liquid containing methylamphetamine and other substances, the top layer including xylenes;
	
	
	4. 0.8 gram of a brown solid residue in a Sunbeam electric frypan;
	
	
	Swabs taken of two electric frypans showing or revealing traces of methylamphetamine;
	
	
	1,962 grams of a clear colourless liquid and white sludge located in a bucket, which were found to contain pseudoephedrine;
	
	
	273 kilograms of strongly alkaline brown liquid categorised as waste product;
	
	
	7.82 grams of methylamphetamine found in a dish, item B068;
	
	
	Tins and drums labelled as containing 80 litres of acetone, 96 litres of methylated spirits, 80 litres of xylene, a plastic bottle labelled as containing 6.5 litres of hydrochloric acid, a 10 litre reaction flask, four digital pH meters, water pumps, grinder, gas ring burner, glass dishes, and a fan.
	



	
	The police also located CCTV footage from a camera that had been installed at the subject premises. The footage contained images over a ten day period depicting a number of the accused leaving and entering the premises. Exhibit J in the trial was a disc containing a summary of that CCTV footage and exhibit K contained a number of stills from the CCTV footage. The footage included images of Gaetano Vitale arriving at Bringelly on 16 June 2013. I pause to note that he did not leave the premises until the police executed the search warrant on 25 June.
	
	
	On 16 June 2013 at about 3.16am, he entered the premises carrying a number of plastic bags and a plastic container. About four minutes later, Gaetano Vitale, together with his father, Angelo Vitale, reversed a vehicle out of the garage. This was the garage in which the laboratory was later set up.
	
	
	Angelo Vitale carried a halogen lamp towards number 10. At about 4.35am on the same day, Angelo Vitale arrived home carrying tins and cans, and walked towards the rear entry of number 10 where the garage is located. On a number of occasions, Gaetano Vitale walked from the rear of number 10 to the incinerator drum and back to the garage.
	
	
	On 17 June at about 10.20am, Mark Scalia attended at the Bringelly premises in a Pantech truck. He reversed the truck towards the area of the garage. Together with Gaetano Vitale, Mark Scalia removed a number of items from the back and carried them to the rear of number 10. It was unclear to me as to how many items were removed, but they appeared to be large containers consistent with at least some of the containers located in the garage on 25 June 2013. On 17 June 2013 at about 4 o'clock, Mr Fenech removed ice from a car and carried it in the direction of the garage. Mark Scalia was also observed on the same afternoon carrying ice.
	
	
	On 18 June at about 5.52am, Mark Scalia arrived at the Bringelly property in a black VW Golf, and at 7.34am, he carried an item from that motor vehicle to the rear of number 10. At 9.08am, he walked to the back fence and tipped something out, and at 9.14am, he carried an item to the VW and then left the property. He returned about an hour and a half later, removed an item from the boot, and conveyed it to the rear of number 10. Mark Scalia was observed at about 10.51am on the same day to be wearing gloves.
	
	
	On 20 June, he attended the property again in the VW Golf and carried items that appeared to be buckets from the boot to the rear of number 10. This is simply a summary of some of the movements captured on the CCTV footage.
	
	
	Essentially, that footage established that on 16 June 2013, Gaetano Vitale attended at the premises and thereafter I accept that a clandestine laboratory was set up in the garage at number 10. All the accused in this trial are seen to attend on various occasions over a period of some eight to nine days. They are seen to be carrying items, such as containers, tins, bottles, or lighting to the rear of number 10 where the garage is located.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the following pieces of circumstantial evidence: telephone intercept product, capturing conversations between the accused engaging in conversations alleged to be either drug related code or conversations relating to the purchase of equipment or chemicals for the purpose of manufacture of prohibited drugs; a number of items located by police upon the execution of the search warrant, including quantities of methylamphetamine and 273 kilograms of waste product; a number of containers containing acetone, methylated spirits, hydrochloric acid found in the garage.
	
	
	Also found were various items of equipment required for the manufacture of methylamphetamine, including four digital pH meters, a separating funnel, and a 10 litre flask; ten days of footage taken by way of cameras installed at the premises which showed the attendance and movement of the accused at the Bringelly property. The Crown also relied on the purchase of chemicals and equipment related to the manufacture of a prohibited drug, and the opinion of Ms Ellam that the clandestine laboratory discovered in the garage of the premises at Bringelly was in her opinion a large scale operation.
	
	
	At this stage, it is relevant to note that the Crown case relied in part upon s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), a provision that has been sometimes referred to during the course of the trial as the admixture provision. Section 4 provides the following:
	
	
	""In this Act, a reference to a prohibited drug includes a reference to any preparation, admixture, extract, or other substance containing any proportion of a prohibited drug.""
	
	
	In delivering judgment, rejecting the application for a directed verdict (see: judgment dated 26 August 2015), I concluded that the plain effect of the statutory language contained in s 4 is that preparation, admixture, extract, or other substance containing any proportion of a prohibited drug is included in the definition of prohibit drug (see: separate judgment on the application for directed verdict).
	
	
	The Crown relied on this provision in submitting at trial that the two layered liquid contained in the item identified as B042, which weighed 1,075 grams, is a prohibited drug. The Crown argued that the substance contained methylamphetamine and therefore, the admixture provision was enlivened. On this analysis, it was submitted that I would find that the accused guilty of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Ms Ellam, a qualified forensic chemist, gave admissible evidence at trial that can be summarised as follows:   
	
	
	On 25 June 2013, she attended the premises at Bringelly with a number of other police officers. She observed and was present when a number of items were located. Located in the garage was a table, on top of which were a number of items including a glass dish containing a dark coloured solid, located on top of the Kambrook portable hotplate with brown staining. Also on the table was the Sunbeam electric frypan containing a dark coloured solid, and the separating funnel containing a two layered liquid which was sitting in a plastic cup. Other items located on the table included chemical containers, a digital pH meter, and glass dishes. Placed next to the table was a pedestal fan. Throughout the garage were numerous factory labelled chemical containers and other containers containing liquids. Items B025 and B026 were both found to contain methylamphetamine. The total weight of prohibited drug contained in those items was 145 grams. The two layered liquid located in the separating funnel weighed 1,075 grams.
	
	
	In a statement, exhibit M in the trial, the witness states that analysis found the liquid to contain methylamphetamine, chlorpheniramine, and triprolidine. The top layer contained xylenes and the bottom layer was strongly alkaline. This item was consistent with methylamphetamine that is being separated from the remaining reaction mixture; that is, the extraction phase of manufacture. In her statement, she stated:
	


""The methylamphetamine as methylamphetamine base oil will be in the top xylene layer, and the bottom strongly alkaline layer will contain the waste from the reaction. The top layer containing methylamphetamine can be separated from the bottom layer using a separating funnel.""


	
	In light of the importance placed by the Crown on the substance contained in the separating funnel, it was necessary to determine whether the admixture rule applied to total quantity of the substance found in that vessel. In order to determine that issue, I summarised Ms Ellam's evidence as follows:
	
	
	Ms Ellam opined that the two-layered liquid contained in the separating funnel was an extraction of methylamphetamine and that it was produced as part of the manufacturing process. Xylene is added to the alkaline mixture within the separating funnel and allowed to settle into two layers. After a period, the xylene floats to the top, containing the methylamphetamine which has been extracted from the mixture. The strongly alkaline liquid settles at the bottom and they separate, in the words of the Crown during examination in chief, ""similar to oil and water."" During her examination in chief, Ms Ellam said that the separating funnel's purpose is to perform extractions of the two-layered liquid and to remove one layer from the other.
	
	
	The weight of 1,075 grams includes both layers. There was no attempt to discern the weight difference between the two layers. Ms Ellam described the layers as ""two discrete layers."" She was unable to say categorically whether the liquid in the separating funnel was manufactured at the garage, or whether it was transported there. She gave evidence that it would not have been practical to transport it to the garage. In contrast to liquids found in other containers, Ms Ellam was of the opinion that the liquid in item B042 was an extraction process occurring in that vessel that was located at the premises. Although there may have been small traces of methylamphetamine in the bottom layer - that is, the waste product - she was unable to say with any certainty that there was a prohibited drug in the waste product and no testing was done to ascertain any such fact.
	
	
	In the course of the judgment that I delivered with respect to the directed verdict, I said that having regard to the fact that s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) refers to any preparation, admixture, extract, or other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug, I was satisfied that there was evidence capable of establishing that a proportion of the liquid found in the separating funnel ( in the top layer) was an admixture within the terms of s 4, although there was an absence of evidence as to the quantification of that proportion.
	
	
	In light of Ms Ellam’s evidence about the substance found in the separating funnel, I was not satisfied that the total quantity of 1,075 grams is a prohibited drug within the definition of s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	I also held that if I was wrong in that regard, I was not satisfied that the offenders intended the manufacture of 1,075 grams of the liquid as a prohibited drug. Clearly the bottom layer was waste product. The fact that the bottom layer was clearly waste product speaks against a finding that the offenders had an intention to manufacture the total amount as a prohibited drug. Indeed, it seemed to me that a similar line of reasoning is what led the Crown to disavow any reliance upon the 273 kilograms of waste product located at Bringelly as being a prohibited drug within the definition of s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	Accordingly, I was not satisfied that the total quantity of substance in the separating funnel was a prohibited drug. Furthermore, in the absence of any evidence as to the weight of the substance in the top layer, I was unable to make any certain finding with respect to the quantity of prohibited drug that was contained in that item. However, I was satisfied that a proportion of the liquid - that is, the top layer - was a prohibited drug for the purposes of s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). It was a piece of evidence that I took into account in assessing the circumstantial case put forward by the Crown.
	
	
	Each of the offenders pleaded guilty at the commencement of the trial to manufacturing or knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. The only issue was quantity.
	
	
	I was satisfied on the basis of the admixture rule that a quantity of prohibited drugs was manufactured in the garage. In addition, I took into account the circumstantial evidence relating to the location of various items in the clandestine laboratory, the content of various telephone intercepts, the period over which the manufacture was taking place, and the content of the CCTV footage in finding beyond reasonable doubt that each of the offenders was involved in the manufacture or knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity of prohibited drug.
	
	
	Although a significant amount of waste product was located at the premises, there is insufficient evidence before me to establish with any precision the quantity of prohibited drug produced. The only finding that I can make to the requisite standard is that a quantity of not less than 250 grams of methylamphetamine was manufactured. I proceed to sentence the offenders on the basis that the quantity of prohibited drug manufactured was closer to the threshold of 250 grams rather than the middle or upper end of the range of commercial quantity. There was an absence of any evidence capable of satisfying me to the requisite standard that the amount of drug manufactured was at the upper end of the range of commercial quantity.
	
	
	I also proceed to sentence the offenders, on the basis that the quantity of end product, sometimes referred to as usable product, located by police in a dish (Item B068) was 7.82 grams. By end product, I mean methylamphetamine in a form that could be consumed or supplied for consumption. I do not accept the evidence of Mark Scalia and Gaetano Vitale that the amount of 7.82 grams was purchased and brought to the premises. The 7.82 grams of methylamphetamine was located in a dish in the vicinity of the equipment used to manufacture the prohibited drug. This is not a case where that quantity was located, for instance, in a plastic resealable bag suggestive of having been purchased. Indeed, there was no evidence of any packaging that may have suggested that the quantity of 7.82 grams was purchased and brought to the premises.
	
	
	However, on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the offenders had succeeded in manufacturing end product other than that quantity. Furthermore, I am not satisfied that the offenders had supplied or otherwise disseminated the prohibited drugs manufactured by them. There is simply insufficient evidence to make such findings. Although the CCTV footage reveals a number of the offenders leaving and returning to the premises, there is no evidence that they removed manufactured drugs from the garage. There is no evidence of records or telephone communication giving rise to an inference that in product was removed from the premises, supplied or otherwise disseminated into the community.
	
	
	It follows that I am not satisfied that the offenders in fact made any profit from the manufacture of the prohibited drug.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS


	
	The criminal conduct took place over about nine days in circumstances where the clandestine laboratory that was set up contained a significant amount of chemicals, waste product and equipment associated with the manufacture of methylamphetamine. A quantity of not less than 250 g of methylamphetamine was produced, having regard to the application of the admixture rule and a circumstantial case presented by the Crown.
	
	
	However, I find that the offence falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the following reasons:
	



	
	I am not persuaded that there was any planning or organisation over and above that inherent in offences of this type.
	
	
	The offence was committed in the garage at Angelo Vitale’s premises. This was not a case where a discreet location unconnected with the offenders was sourced and utilised.
	
	
	Although the manufacturing process involved the use of various pieces of equipment, they were in the main relatively unsophisticated.
	
	
	During the course of the sentence proceedings Mr Paish who then appeared for the Crown used the phrase “dumb and dumber” to characterise the account being given by Gaetano Vitale in his evidence. The reference was with respect to Gaetano Vitale’s evidence that the large volume of waste product located at the premises was the result of multiple failed attempts to manufacture the drug. At first blush there is some force in the submission that having regard to the volume of waste product, there must have been a significant amount of usable methamphetamine produced. However, upon close analysis, there is an absence of evidence, either by way of direct evidence or inferential reasoning, that end product, other than that located when the police executed a search warrant, had been manufactured at the premises.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the offenders succeeded in manufacturing end product apart from approximately 7.82 grams. There is no doubt that there was a significant amount of waste product located at the premises. However, the is evidence does not establish that end product was removed from the location and supplied or otherwise disseminated into the community.
	
	
	No profit was made as a result of the manufacture process.
	
	
	In this case it was the application of the admixture rule that rendered the majority of the substance located at the premises a prohibited drug.
	



	
	That said, the manufacture of prohibited drugs is very serious criminal conduct, involving as it does the production of dangerous substances that not only pose potential physical harm, but often create psychological and social problems of a debilitating nature. Considerations of general deterrence and denunciation must be given due weight when determining the appropriate penalty. Terms of full-time imprisonment of some length must be imposed upon offenders who engage in such criminal behaviour.
	
	
	The seriousness of an offence such as the present has been emphasised in a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. I have had regard to the relevant principles: see R v Reardon (1996) 89 A Crim R 180; Walsh v R (2006) 168 A Crim R 237.
	
	
	I bear in mind, however, individualised justice requires that each case be assessed having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances pertaining to that case.
	


WERE THE OFFENCES COMMITTED FOR FINANCIAL GAIN? (See: s 21A(2)(O) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW))


	
	A significant portion of time taken up on the sentence proceedings was with respect to the issue of whether the offenders had engaged in this criminal activity for financial reward. Mark Scalia and Gaetano Vitale were called to give evidence on the sentence proceedings and a number of submissions were made by each counsel.
	
	
	It is necessary for me to determine whether I am satisfied that the offenders engaged in this activity for financial reward, or whether they were otherwise motivated to manufacture methamphetamine.
	
	
	In seeking to rely upon financial gain as an aggravating factor, the Crown will have to establish that fact beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In my judgment of 16 October 2015, returning verdicts and setting out my reasons, I indicated at some length the circumstantial evidence that I relied upon to find the accused guilty of manufacturing not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (see judgment of that date).
	
	
	The Crown’s circumstantial case included a number of facts, none of which had to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Put another way, there was no fact indispensable to the chain of reasoning that had to be established to that high standard. One of the circumstances, I took into account as a piece of circumstantial evidence was that the three accused were involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine for financial reward. Of course this was only one of many factors that I took into account.
	
	
	During the course of the sentence proceedings, Mr Paish, the Crown who then appeared, submitted that, having made a finding that they were involved in the manufacture for financial reward, I could not now “go behind that finding”. (p78 14/4/2016)
	
	
	I reject that submission. The reference in my earlier judgment to taking into account as a piece of circumstantial evidence that the three accused were involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine for financial reward, was a reference to one of the strands in the cable relied upon by the Crown. It was not a circumstance that had to be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	By contrast, before I can rely upon financial gain as an aggravating factor, I would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders were motivated by an intention to make profit from the manufacture of the prohibited drug. To be clear, I am not of the view that I am bound by any one of the circumstances that I took into account in finding the accused guilty in determining whether the Crown has established an aggravating factor beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Rather, my task in these sentence proceedings is to consider all of the evidence, including the evidence at trial and on sentence, to determine whether in each case the offenders were motivated by an intention to obtain a financial reward. I must then decide whether on that evidence I can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the aggravating factor. A considered assessment of the evidence has led to different findings with respect to the individual offenders.
	
	
	I turn now to consider the evidence on this issue and to set out my findings.
	
	
	Although Angelo Vitale is not to be sentenced today, it is appropriate that I briefly set out my findings with respect to his motivation. I do so because it will become relevant in these proceedings with respect to my determination of the guilt of the offenders in relation to the charge on the s 166 certificate.
	
	
	Angelo Vitale provided the premises where the drugs were manufactured. He assisted his son to move a vehicle from the garage. Four telephone intercepts relating to calls on 22 June 2013 reveal conversations between Angelo Vitale and his son, Gaetano Vitale, about the purchase of items that could be used in the manufacturing process.
	
	
	Angelo Vitale was present at his house on occasions when one or more of his co-offenders brought items to the location.
	
	
	He was seen on four occasions to convey items consistent with the use in the process of extracting or refining methylamphetamine. They included:
	



	
	On 16 June 2013 he was carrying lights, silver tins and clear bottles.
	
	
	On 18 June 2013 he was carrying a 20 L white container with blue lid and a small blue container.
	
	
	On 22 June 2013 he was seen carrying tins and a 4 L clear bottle.
	
	
	On 24 June 2013 he was seen carrying a shopping bag.
	



	
	I am satisfied that Angelo Vitale knowingly took part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. This much is clear from the fact that he allowed his premises to be used for the manufacture of the drug and assisted by providing items consistent with the use in the process of extracting or refining methylamphetamine.
	
	
	However, I am not persuaded that Angelo Vitale committed the offence for financial reward. His role was significantly less than his co-offenders. True it is that he provided the premises but he did so, in my view, at the request of his son. This is not a case where Angelo Vitale initiated the enterprise, was involved in the planning or transport of items to the location, or was involved in the actual process of production inside the garage once the laboratory was in operation.
	
	
	I also take into account the fact that Angelo Vitale was a 66 year old man with no relevant criminal convictions. Indeed, other than an offence of goods in custody in 2002, he only has one matter of stealing in 1980. I am satisfied that, but for his son’s conduct, Angelo Vitale would not have become involved in the manufacture of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	I turn to consider the case of Mark Scalia. In determining whether he was motivated by financial reward, it is necessary to set out some of the evidence relating to his subjective case at this stage of the judgment.
	
	
	The offender’s medical records have been tendered in the proceedings. They confirm that he was involved in a car accident in 2012. The accident had a significant impact upon his physical wellbeing and his injuries led to prolonged chronic pain experienced in his back, neck and legs.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and was cross-examined at some length. He said that his life hasn’t been the same at all since the accident due to the chronic pain he has experienced in his back since then. For example he had trouble showering himself for a long time or going to the toilet properly. He was unable to work as a bread vendor for a period of time and now has altered his work load and capacity.
	
	
	I have had an opportunity to observe the offender give evidence during the sentence proceedings. I have also had an opportunity to observe him generally during those proceedings and during the course of the trial. He was unable to sit down for any lengthy period of time due to his pain. He spent a significant portion of the proceedings standing up and gave some of his evidence in the witness box while standing.
	
	
	Much of the medical material tendered in these proceedings has gone towards the ongoing physical effects of the injury and the treatment that is required. I have had regard to the reports and the medical records.
	
	
	Twelve months after the accident the offender was admitted to hospital after a suicide attempt. He was in hospital for about one month before being released. Clinical history notes from the SouthWest clinic report that the offender reported for voluntary admission at that clinic with a history of depression and anxiety commencing after his car accident. Clearly, his back injury caused considerable pain and was, at times quite debilitating.
	
	
	With respect to drugs and alcohol, the offender smoked marijuana daily since his accident to assist with his pain relief. He has also had periods where he has taken high levels of prescription pain medication with no pain relief. Drug use made him feel “half normal”.
	
	
	The offender commenced the use of crystal methylamphetamine about six months after his car accident. The offender stated to the psychologist Ms Lowery that his need to relieve his pain with limited funds led to his involvement in this offence in that he would be able to access free methylamphetamine.
	
	
	His evidence before me was similar. The offender said that he had only used methylamphetamine once prior to his car accident. At the time of the offending however he was using about $300 or 1 gram weekly or fortnightly because that was all he could afford. The offender said that he would take his medication, smoke marijuana, drink alcohol and smoke methylamphetamine in order to be able to function normally and to conduct basic tasks such as shaving his face or making his bed. According to the offender, the pain medication he had been prescribed since the accident was ineffectual, with some medications causing paranoia. He was told by a doctor that he has an extremely high pain threshold.
	
	
	The offender said that he involved himself in the manufacture of the methylamphetamine to access free drugs for pain relief. The offender was in a significant amount of debt at the time to his parents, a personal loan and as a result of his inability to work and earn an income. However the offender denied that his motivation for his offending conduct was to make any profit from the venture. The offender gave evidence that he knew at that time that he would receive an insurance payout which would clear his debts. It is the case that the offender received $450,000 in 2015.
	
	
	I accept that his family was assisting him financially in light of the fact that his reduced working hours resulted in a significantly reduced income. I also accept that there was no pressure placed upon him by his family to repay the debt he owed them.
	
	
	At the time of the offence his methylamphetamine use was costing him $300 per gram, a quantity that would last three or four days. Although his family was supporting him with respect to his financial commitments, they did not (and he did not expect them to) fund his drug use.
	
	
	I am satisfied that he believed that the use of methamphetamine alleviated his pain in the manner described by him during his evidence. He gave evidence that: “when you start using and you actually see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, it was farfetched as my mind was at the time, that’s all I really was fixated on. I became a bit of a junkie”.
	
	
	As I understand the evidence of this offender, the methylamphetamine operated in conjunction with the strong pain relief that he was getting to allow him to keep functioning. On the one hand, he was taking strong pain medication that clouded his affect. On the other hand, he was taking a stimulant to allow him to keep functioning at some level. His drug use was also taking place against a backdrop of depression.
	
	
	I have considered in some depth the totality of the evidence relating to Mark Scalia. The entirety of the circumstantial case adduced by the Crown persuaded me beyond reasonable doubt that he knowingly took part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity of drugs. However, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his primary purpose in doing so was financial gain. I make that finding for the following reasons:
	



	
	In his case, there is compelling medical evidence that following the car accident in 2012, he suffered from chronic pain that was not properly treated by way of prescribed medication.
	
	
	He developed depression as a result. I reject the Crown submission that his evidence is a convenient reconstruction. The medical material and other documents before me support the evidence that he has given during the proceedings that he was suffering from chronic pain and depression and had developed a significant drug habit.
	
	
	I accept that he self-medicated by using a combination of prescription medication and illicit substances including methylamphetamine.
	
	
	At the time of the offence he was spending $300 for a gram of methylamphetamine, which lasted 3 to 4 days.
	
	
	His income at the time was significantly reduced. He was living with his parents and they were assisting him financially.
	
	
	I am satisfied that by the time he became involved in this offence he was addicted to the drug and was finding it difficult to maintain funding his significant habit. I accept his counsel’s submission that “this is a case where his resort to illegal drugs is not some capricious whim of fancy wanting to have a good time, but a desperate attempt of self-help to cope with pain from which he was suffering”.
	
	
	I take into account the opinion expressed by Ms Cowdery, psychologist that: “given the emotional and financial strain Mr Scalia was under prior to and during the time of the offence, it had been a significant factor in his ill-considered decision to take part in a criminal enterprise. It is apparent that Mr Scalia’s prolonged chronic pain not only affects his physical mobility, but also has significant impact on his psychological well-being. It is likely that Mr Scalia’s psychological well-being and daily functioning have been compromised by such problems. Chronic pain is a known cause of the reduction in resilience in people as his lack of sleep”.
	
	
	All of the evidence at trial suggests that whilst he was knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, he did not initiate the operation, direct the activities or play a primary role in the criminal enterprise. He was not the one with the knowledge as to how to manufacture methylamphetamine. Rather, I am satisfied that he followed directions with respect to the tasks he was given that constituted his involvement.
	
	
	His parents were not placing any pressure on him to repay the money he owed them.
	
	
	The offender had a compensation claim pending and expected to receive a large payout. As it transpired, he received a payout of some $450,000 in 2015. Although at the time of the offence there was no certainty as to whether he would receive compensation or any certainty as to quantum, he did have an expectation that he would receive compensation of some value.
	
	
	I note that the intercepted conversation between this offender and Gaetano Vitale does not reveal that this offender believed that he could or would buy a massage parlour.
	



	
	I turn now to consider the same issue with respect to Gaetano Vitale.
	
	
	The evidence relating to this offender is somewhat different in that his addiction to methylamphetamine was not the product of extreme physical pain. In his case, although he was experiencing a number of personal difficulties in his life, he was not in a position where he relied upon illicit drugs to self-medicate so as to alleviate physical pain.
	
	
	I accept that by the time he manufactured the methylamphetamine, he was addicted to the drug. His drug use had escalated dramatically from about the end of 2011, early 2012. He lost a considerable amount of weight and his wife observed marked changes in his personality and his physical appearance, consistent with the use of methylamphetamine. His habit was costing him $500 per week.
	
	
	He gave evidence on the sentence proceedings that in about January 2013 he was given an esky with a bucket in it containing waste product. He was also given some items of equipment capable of use in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. He claimed that he stored these items on his father’s property.
	
	
	It was on or about 15 June 2013 that he told Anthony Klonaris about the bucket and its contents. Klonaris claimed that he had the knowledge to extract the methylamphetamine from the waste and so they decided to commence the manufacture of operation.
	
	
	I am not of the view that it is necessary to determine whether I accept Gaetano Vitale’s evidence that the inception of this criminal enterprise originated with an esky containing one bucket of waste and various pieces of equipment. Regardless of what was available at its inception, I am satisfied that it was this offender who had the raw product and equipment that commenced the operation.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that his intention was to extract methylamphetamine for personal use. He denied that he was motivated by a desire for financial gain.
	
	
	I am satisfied on all of the evidence before me that the offender had a severe drug addiction by June 2013 and that the manufacture of methylamphetamine in his father’s garage would provide him with a source for the drug that had come to consume his life.
	
	
	However, in his case, I am not satisfied that the desire to manufacture methylamphetamine for personal use was the primary motive. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was also motivated by a desire to make a profit from any usable methylamphetamine that was manufactured.
	
	
	Gaetano Vitale had a successful business operating concrete pumps. It was a family business of some 20 years standing. Prior to his demise, the business was earning about $35,000 a month. However, one of the consequences of his drug addiction was that his business was neglected and at the time of this offence, it was generating a substantially reduced amount of income somewhere in the vicinity of $10,000 to $12,000 per month.
	
	
	The lifestyle to which he had become accustomed and the lifestyle he wanted to provide his wife could not be financed with such a reduced income. Indeed, notwithstanding his financial limitations, in March 2013 he engaged in fraud with his sister and his broker so as to obtain a loan to purchase a Mercedes motor vehicle for the sum of $170,000. I am satisfied on the evidence before me that he purchased the car so that he could give it to his wife to drive. Helen Vitale gave evidence that her husband always wanted the best for her. That this was so is evidenced by the newly built family home, the investment property and the luxury car.
	
	
	By June 2013 however, the offender’s legitimate income could not cover the expenses. The repayments on the car were approximately $3,000 per month. The offender was able to make approximately $12,000 in repayments before he defaulted. In addition to these financial commitments he had a $500 a week methylamphetamine habit. It is abundantly clear that he was struggling financially.
	
	
	Unlike Mark Scalia who was still living with his parents and relying upon them for financial support, Gaetano Vitale had a family of his own that he had to provide for. He engaged in the manufacture of methylamphetamine at a time when the life that he had become accustomed to was crashing around him. In the midst of that maelstrom, he engaged in fraud so as to purchase $170,000 car to give to his wife.
	
	
	Although there is no evidence of conversations suggesting the sale of drugs or preparation for the sale of drugs, no records indicating a client base, nor evidence of any profit actually made by the offender, I am satisfied that he was partly motivated by an intention to obtain a financial reward.
	
	
	To be clear, I make that finding for the following reasons:
	



	
	This offender, together with Anthony Klonaris, initiated the criminal enterprise to manufacture methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Although this offender did not have the necessary knowledge to conduct the extraction of the drug from the waste product, he did direct the activities and played a primary role in the enterprise.
	
	
	By June 2013 the offender was neglecting his business as a result of his severe addiction to methylamphetamine. As a result the business was generating a significantly reduced income.
	
	
	The offender was under significant financial pressures including getting behind in his mortgage repayments and his car repayments.
	
	
	Unlike Mark Scalia he was not living with his parents and being financially supported by them. Furthermore, there is no evidence before me that he had a legitimate expectation that he would come into a significant amount of money through legitimate means. In those circumstances, the financial pressures operating upon him were likely to continue. It is within this context that he instigated the criminal enterprise to manufacture methylamphetamine.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the intercepted conversation between this offender and Mark Scalia. The conversation took place when Gaetano Vitale was in the garage expressing some hope that the substance in the frypan was going to yield a successful product. Mark Scalia said: “put it this way, am I gunna smile that much that we are gunna go for a massage”. Gaetano Vitale responded: “Massage? I am gunna by the place that massages you”. By itself this conversation is not probative of an intention to obtain a financial reward. However, it is a relevant piece of evidence that, taken together with the matters set out above, satisfies me that Gaetano Vitale’s intention was not limited to producing methylamphetamine for personal use, but extended to making a profit.
	



	
	I accept in his case that he was partly motivated by an intention to obtain a financial reward and I accept that this operates as an aggravating factor. The weight that I give this aggravating factor is moderated to a degree in light of the fact that I have also found that the offender was partly motivated to manufacture the drug so that he could source it for personal use.
	


STANDARD NON-PAROLE PERIOD


	
	The offence carries a standard non-parole period as a result of the introduction of Division 1A into Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Since the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120, the objective seriousness of the offence is determined without reference to matters personal to the offender but wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.
	
	
	The standard non-parole period should not be the starting point or the endpoint in arriving at a sentence. I am required to identify all the factors that are relevant to sentencing. In doing so I must be mindful of the two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The broad ranging and flexible enquiry envisaged by s21A is not subjected to a procedural straitjacket in respect of particular offences by the introduction of the standard non-parole period regime.
	
	
	I will impose a non-parole period significantly less than the standard non-parole period. I do so because I find that the objective seriousness of the offence falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Secondly, the offenders pleaded guilty to the offences of manufacture or knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug simpliciter. There was a significant degree of pre-trial disclosure and each offender facilitated the administration of justice in the way the trial was conducted. Furthermore, I have taken into account the subjective case of each of the offenders in determining the appropriate term of imprisonment, including the non-parole periods.
	


THE PLEA OF GUILTY


	
	The Crown acknowledges that there was some utilitarian value in the way in which each accused conducted the trial. The Crown submits that an appropriate reduction in sentence is one of 15%. On behalf of each offender, it is submitted that the discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty should be higher.
	
	
	On the first day of a trial, each accused pleaded guilty to manufacturing or knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. The Crown did not accept those pleas of guilty in full satisfaction of the indictment. The matter proceeded by way of pre-trial application and judge alone trial. From the outset each accused identified the sole issue in the trial as being the element relating to quantity of prohibited drug manufactured. Each accused indicated their willingness to proceed by way of tender of the relevant Crown material. No cross-examination was sought of any witnesses except of Ms Ellam on the voire dire relating to the pre-trial issue. The pre-trial issue was decided in favour of the accused.
	
	
	Each accused made admissions pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The nature of those admissions is set out in my judgment dated 16 October 2015. As it transpired, I found the accused not guilty of the offence of manufacture or knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine but guilty of manufacture or knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity.
	
	
	I am satisfied that each of the accused had clearly identified the sole issue in the trial and conducted the trial in a manner that reflected their willingness to facilitate the administration of justice. There was clearly a significant utilitarian value in the way they conducted the trial. Had the matter run to trial in the conventional way, it would have taken in excess of four weeks.
	
	
	It seems to me that had the offenders pleaded guilty to the offences of manufacture or knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the commercial quantity, a similar amount of time would have been spent on the proceedings.
	
	
	I am satisfied that an appropriate reduction in sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty is one of 20%.
	


SECTION 166 MATTERS – DIRECTING OR PARTICIPATING IN A CRIMINAL GROUP


	
	Each offender has pleaded not guilty to a related offence contrary to s 93T of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). In the case of Gaetano Vitale, it is alleged that he knowingly directed the activities of a criminal group whose activities are organised and ongoing contrary to s 93T(4A) and in the case of Angelo Vitale and Mark Scalia, it is alleged that they knowingly participated in a criminal group contrary to s 93T(1).
	
	
	The parties submitted that I would determine the guilt of all offenders based on the evidence led at trial. Before I turn to the evidence, it is necessary to set out the elements which the Crown must satisfy beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In relation to s 93T(1), the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt:
	



	
	There was a criminal group; and
	
	
	The accused participated in the criminal group;
	
	
	knowing it was a criminal group; and
	
	
	The accused knew or was reckless as to whether his participation in that group contributed to the occurrence of any criminal activity.
	
	
	In relation to s 93T(4A), the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt:
	
	
	There was a criminal group; and
	
	
	The accused participated in the criminal group;
	
	
	By directing any of the activities of a criminal group;
	
	
	Knowing it was a criminal group; and
	
	
	The activities of the criminal group were organised and ongoing; and
	
	
	The accused knew or was reckless as to whether that participation contributes to the activities of a criminal group.
	



	
	Section 93S specifies what a “criminal group” is for the purpose of these provisions. In this case it means a group of three or more people who have as one of their objectives obtaining material benefits from conduct that constitutes a serious indictable offence, in this case, the manufacture of prohibited drugs. There are other objectives that can constitute a criminal group, however they are not relevant in this case.
	
	
	It follows that I need to be satisfied of the existence of a criminal group involving three or more people before I turn to considerations of participation and knowledge.
	


DETERMINATION OF SECTION 166 MATTERS


	
	On behalf of each offender, it was submitted that I would not find the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt. It was put that there was insufficient evidence to establish three or more people were acting together with the necessary objective. Alternatively, it was submitted that I would not be satisfied that each of the offenders had as one of their objectives the obtaining of the material benefit.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that if an individual joins a group and the overall purpose of the group is to manufacture methylamphetamine, the element of obtaining a material benefit is satisfied.
	
	
	I do not agree with that construction of section 93S. The section provides a definition of a criminal group as requiring a group of “three or more people who have as their objective obtaining material benefits from conduct that constitutes a serious indictable offence”. The serious indictable offence in this case is the manufacture of methylamphetamine. The material benefit must be something that accrues from that conduct, rather than being the very conduct which constitutes the serious indictable offence.
	
	
	An intention to profit from the manufacture of methylamphetamine is clearly an objective of obtaining a material benefit. Is an intention to manufacture methylamphetamine for personal use a material benefit?
	
	
	There is very little authority on this issue. In White v R [2014] NSWCCA 329, the court overturned the conviction of an accused who had pleaded guilty to the offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. An element of that offence is that the accused supplied the drug on three or more separate occasions for financial or material reward. The appeal succeeded the on the basis that there was no evidence that there was a material benefit arising from each relevant transaction. Hidden J held that the third transaction “might have earned him the benefit of the supply of some drug for his own use on credit”, which his honour considered “could be relevant to material benefit”.
	
	
	Where an offender intends to manufacture methylamphetamine for personal use in circumstances where he or she is saved considerable expense or where that individual uses the drug to obtain pain relief, each would constitute a material benefit.
	
	
	In the present case I am not satisfied that the mere fact that Angelo Vitale was involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine satisfies the element that he had as his objective the obtaining of a material benefit. There is insufficient evidence to establish that he was motivated by financial reward and there is no evidence that he used methylamphetamine, let alone was addicted to the drug.
	
	
	Both Mark Scalia and Gaetano Vitale were addicted to methylamphetamine and were spending hundreds of dollars on a weekly basis to fund their habit. Manufacturing the drug so as to provide a source for their personal use would obviate the need to purchase drug thereby saving them a considerable deal of money. I am satisfied that this would be a material benefit.
	
	
	Furthermore, in the case of Gaetano Vitale, I am satisfied that he was partly motivated by an intention to profit from the enterprise.
	
	
	Is there a criminal group now that I have found Angelo Vitale did not have an objective of obtaining a material benefit? For there to be a criminal group, there must be at least three people who have as their objective the obtaining of material benefit from the manufacture of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	During the course of the trial evidence was adduced of the involvement of Anthony Klonaris in the enterprise involving these offenders. The CCTV footage placed him at the premises on various occasions when both Gaetano Vitale and Mark Scalia were present. He was clearly involved in the manufacture of the drug, having regard to the fact that when police executed the search warrant he was literally stirring the pot. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mark Scalia, Gaetano Vitale and Anthony Klonaris constituted a criminal group in which Mark Scalia and Anthony Klonaris were participants. There is no issue that Gaetano Vitale was directing the group’s activities. I am satisfied that the activities were ongoing in that they took place over a period of some nine days.
	
	
	Accordingly, I find Mark Scalia guilty of the offence of participating in a criminal group. I find Gaetano Vitale guilty of directing the activities of a criminal group. I find Angelo Vitale not guilty of participating in a criminal group.
	
	
	I have had regard to the fact that the facts upon which I have found the offenders guilty are substantially the same as the circumstances constituting the indictable offence of manufacturing or knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. The sentence I impose for that offence can comprehend the criminality involved in the offence pursuant to s 93T. The sentences I impose will be wholly concurrent.
	


FACTS – FRAUD OFFENCES IN RELATION TO GAETANO VITALE


	
	Gaetano Vitale’s co-offenders in relation to the fraud offence are George Barikhan and Carmelina Karouche. Ms Karouche is the offender’s older sister. I now turn to those facts.
	
	
	In March 2013, Gaetano Vitale was the subject of lawful interception of his telephone by police. In one call between the offender and Mr Barikhan they discussed the offender wanting to purchase a Mercedes ML, registration 189, from Ken Carroll Motors.
	
	
	In that call, the offender contacted Mr Barikhan asking him to facilitate finance for the purchase of the car. He indicated his difficulty in obtaining finance due to his and his wife’s bad credit history.
	
	
	From 2008, Mr Barikhan was a finance referrer, predominately within the motor vehicle industry. In this role he corresponded with various brokers and finance companies in various ways, including under the business ‘Infinity Home Loans Pty. Ltd’ which he operated from an office at Luddenham.
	
	
	During the call, the offender and Mr Barikhan discussed ways to obtain finance, including obtaining finance in the name of his sister, Ms Karouche. They also discussed the details to record on the loan application and supporting documents relating to Ms Karouche’s employment history.
	
	
	On 26 April 2013, a loan application on behalf of Ms Karouche was sent on her behalf by Mr Barikhan to Peter Shade – a broker at Trivett Pty Ltd. The loan application, with supporting documents relating to the assets and liabilities, employment history and income of Ms Karouche, her current employment for the past 4 years was stated as ‘Rocco Ristorante’ with a net monthly income of $6,952 and 4 years prior to that, employment at ‘Vitale Bros Concrete Plumbing’, three payslips from Rocco Ristorante were also included, as was a letter certified by an M Prasad stating that Ms Karouche was entitled to claim a predominant portion of the Mercedes as a business tax deduction.
	
	
	Settlement took place on 2 May 2013 (facts state 2015) and a number of other documents were forwarded to BMW Finance. Relevantly, some of those documents included:
	



	
	Declaration of acceptance of income;
	
	
	A declaration that the car was to be used predominately for business purposes “to see stockists, wholesalers, prospective vendors, events and for functions etc”.
	
	
	An assets and liabilities statement signed by Ms Karouche and Shade that records her as having $45,000 cash in the bank and a $650,000 investment property.
	



	
	The invoice for sale recorded an initial deposit of $31,000 leaving an outstanding balance of $169,000. The car was insured to the value of $170,000.
	
	
	The contract for sale listed Helen Vitale, this offender’s wife, as the purchaser of the Mercedes. ‘Vitale Brothers Concrete Plumbing’ was listed on the direct debit authority form – a business owned by the offender.
	
	
	Subsequent investigations revealed the following:
	



	
	Ms Karouche has never been employed at the restaurant. The payslips were not issued by the business.
	
	
	Bank statements for Ms Karouche between the period 22 March 2013 and 21 August 2013 record that during that time she was receiving Centrelink benefits and the balance in her bank account never exceeded $4,275.87; and
	
	
	Ms Karouche never submitted a tax return in 2013 and investigations through the ATO, Fair Trading and Rental Bond Board found no evidence of an investment property in her name.
	



	
	On 21 January 2014, the vehicle was repossessed by agents on behalf of Alphera Finance due to non-payment of the loan. The vehicle was sold and a default judgment was awarded against Ms Karouche in the sum of $70,324.88.
	
	
	On 2 October 2013, the offender was stopped by police for a breath test and it was found to be unregistered to ‘Ken Caroll Investments’. The offender told police that ‘it belongs to a car yard, I am in the process of purchasing it and I can’t believe it is not registered’. In the following days police observed the vehicle parked in the offender’s driveway.
	
	
	The offender was charged on 31 March 2015.
	
	
	In relation to his co-offenders, Ms Karouche pleaded guilty to two offences of dishonestly obtain benefit by deception and one offence of participation in a criminal group. She was sentenced at Parramatta Local Court to s 9 bonds for 2 years.
	
	
	Mr Barikhan pleaded guilty to one offence of pervert the course of justice, one offence of participate in a criminal group, 8 offences of obtain money by deception and 17 offences of dishonestly obtain financial advantage. His matter has not yet been finalised.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF FRAUD OFFENCE


	
	The offence involved a considerable amount of money in that the advantage gained was finance of approximately $171 to purchase the vehicle. Although the finance company obtained a judgment debt against the offender’s sister (a co-offender with respect to that offence), the value of the judgment debt, being $70,324, remains unpaid.
	
	
	I find that this offence falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Although the amount of money involved was significant the motor vehicle was returned to the finance company.
	
	
	Furthermore, although there was a degree of planning on the part of this offender I am satisfied that it was Mr Barikhan who played the primary role in planning and executing the fraud.
	
	
	The offence was committed at a time when the offender was using methylamphetamine on a regular basis and I accept that his judgment was drug affected and impaired. He purchased the vehicle not for his own use but for that of his wife.
	
	
	The offender’s sister pleaded guilty to a similar offence in the local court. She was dealt with by way of a section 9 bond for a period of two years. However, the principle of parity has little application in that her role was at the very lowest end of the range of objective seriousness. It does not appear that she benefited in any way from the fraud. No doubt she became involved to help her brother.
	
	
	Notwithstanding my finding that the offence falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, the conduct constitutes serious criminality involving a significant amount of money. This was not an offence committed out of a sense of need but rather motivated by a desire to maintain a lifestyle of luxury.
	
	
	In sentencing the offender for this offence I take into account the Form One matter being an offence of participating in a criminal group. However, in light of the fact that the facts giving rise to this offence are substantially the same as the substantive offence, I am not of the view that there should be an increase in the penalty.
	
	
	I have had regard to the fact that this matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court and that but for the manufacture offence, he would have been dealt within that jurisdiction.
	
	
	On behalf of the offender it is submitted that I would deal with the matter by way of a wholly suspended sentence of three months’ imprisonment. I do not agree with that submission. I am satisfied that the section 5 threshold is met and a term of imprisonment is warranted. Although the appropriate length of that term is less than two years imprisonment, I am not persuaded that the sentence should be suspended.
	
	
	Furthermore, the offending that constitutes the fraud offence is discrete conduct separate from and unrelated to the offence of manufacturing not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. I am satisfied that there must be a measure of accumulation which will be reflected in the aggregate sentence that I impose upon this offender. In determining the extent of the accumulation I have had regard to the principle of totality.
	
	
	I take into account that Gaetano Vitale entered his plea of guilty in the local court. It is a plea of guilty at the first opportunity and the sentence I impose will be reduced by 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.
	


SUBJECTIVE CASE – GAETANO VITALE


	
	The offender is 37 years old and the youngest of three children of Angelo Vitale and his mother, a relationship he describes positively. The offender reported that his home life growing up was “good” and that he was spoilt by his mother. He reported that he always got his way and that his parents did not put up boundaries. Nevertheless, the offender reported that as a child he was “pretty independent and knew what was right from wrong from a young age”.
	
	
	The offender attended school without incident and left in Year 11. He then commenced running a concrete pump business, as his father had. That business is still operating.
	
	
	The offender reported to Ms Allen, psychologist, that his friends were not a positive peer group. He agreed that they were involved in crime but that he stopped associating with them prior to the birth of his son.
	
	
	The offender married his wife when he was 27, some 11 years ago and they resided with his parents at Bringelly for two years until 2007 when they built their house at West Hoxton. His wife suffered a miscarriage in 2007. The offender had been told he was unable to father children and had two operations, both of which were unsuccessful. He and his wife tried IVF unsuccessfully a few times, spending approximately $20,000. This necessitated borrowing money from family and friends. In 2012, his wife Helen became pregnant and gave birth to a boy in early 2013. He now also has a daughter, who was born in January this year whilst the offender was in custody.
	
	
	The offender reported he has never had a problem with alcohol as he only drinks socially. He first used illicit drugs at 18, taking ecstasy, cannabis and speed once or twice, but not beyond that. At 18 he also began using steroids after being introduced to it by friends. He ceased his use at about 30 after being told it impacted on his fertility.
	
	
	The offender began using ice in 2011 after experiencing a number of hardships. He said he felt “down and out”. He had fertility issues, and he lost both his grandfathers, with whom he had been close, within months of each other. His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early 2012 and his brother and business partner were arrested and spent some 7 months in custody that same year. At the time of his arrest in June 2013, the offender was using about $500 per week of ice.
	
	
	The offender has some matters on his criminal record. In 2000 and 2005 he was fined and placed on a section 9 bond for matters of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and destroy/damage property. In 2012 he was fined $1,000 and subject to a section 9 bond and disqualified for 12 months for driving whilst suspended and speeding. He was also dealt with for an affray in 2011.
	
	
	The two convictions in 2000 and 2005 resulted from road rage incidents. The offender said he was using steroids on those occasions. The conviction for affray in 2011 was when he was using ice.
	
	
	The offender does not have an extensive criminal history and has no drug related matters on his record. He is in my view entitled to some degree of leniency.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence before me in the sentence proceedings. I have rejected part of that evidence, particularly in relation to the events connected with the manufacture of methylamphetamine. I have rejected his evidence that he was not manufacturing a prohibited drug at West Hoxton. I have also formed the impression that he was, to a degree, attempting to minimise his role.
	
	
	Since his arrest, the offender’s life has changed for the better. He ceased his use of illicit drugs. He has gained the weight that he lost as a result of his addiction. His concrete business is back on track and he has doubled or tripled his earnings in comparison to the time he was using ice and extracting money from the business. In 2014 he bought a gym franchise which has about 1400 members and has helped improve his health. He has sold his house at West Hoxton to fund his legal representation and was residing at a rental property with his parents until he thought to have his bail revoked recognising that a term of imprisonment would be imposed.
	
	
	Thirty references were tendered on behalf of the offender. I am not going to refer to all of them; however I have read and considered each one. I note that one such reference is from his older sister, Carmelina Karouche who is his co-offender in the fraud matter. Insofar as those references describe the offender as honest and a person of good moral character, I give them very little weight. However, I accept that before his addiction, the offender was a hardworking person and committed husband. Generally speaking the references speak of the offender’s criminal conduct as “out of character” and attest to the fact that he has dramatically changed his life around since the arrest in 2013. They acknowledge he is hardworking, responsible and a family man. A number of references also speak of the offenders expressed remorse with respect to his offending conduct.
	
	
	The reference from the offender’s wife Helen described what he was like in late 2012 to early 2013. She said that at the time she became pregnant in 2012, the offender was never straight with her, always high on drugs, and never wanted to sleep at night or eat. She said that in May 2012, when she was about 4 months pregnant, she walked into the garage and found the offender crying however he told her to leave him alone. This was about the time the offender’s father was diagnosed with cancer and his brother was incarcerated. After the birth of their child in January 2013, the offender apparently tried to change but was still addicted to drug. Clearly he was unable at that time to abstain from drug use.
	
	
	Mrs Vitale confirms that since then, he has remained drug free drug, has return to the gym, fitness and work. The offender has expressed remorse to her for his use of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the fact that the offender sought to minimise his role when giving evidence before me, I am satisfied on balance that he is remorseful for his actions. He pleaded guilty to manufacturing a prohibited drug; he has expressed remorse to his family and friends and in his evidence before me, and, despite the fact that he had made significant progress following his arrest, he volunteered to be taken into custody recognising that he must be punished for his behaviour.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. He does not have a criminal record of significance; he has stopped using prohibited drugs. Prior to his bail being revoked he returned to successfully operating his business and commenced a new business enterprise by opening up the gym. Since his incarceration, there have been no internal disciplinary charges and no suggestion of drug taking.
	
	
	Now that the fog of addiction has lifted, I am satisfied that his intention upon release is to return to his family and provide for them through legitimate means. Whilst specific deterrence remains a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate sentence, I am satisfied that the weight to be given to it is reduced, having regard to the offender’s positive progress.
	
	
	Psychologist Ruth Allen, in her report dated 16 December 2015, reported that, with respect to Gaetano Vitale, there was no evidence of mental illness, nor any reported history of it. The offender said that when he feels low, he thinks of family and prays. Since being in custody, the offender has attended church weekly. A letter from Reverend Paul Drury at the Chaplaincy Service at Parklea confirmed this is the case. Reverend Paul Drury also confirmed that the offender has completed the ‘Positive Lifestyles Program’ and contributed well and at the time, was completing the ‘Seasons for Growth’ program to understand grief and loss issues. He is also employed as a sweeper.
	
	
	Ms Allen administered a number of tests on the offender. She concluded that his overall non-verbal and verbal functioning was below average. The psychometric personality test revealed that the offender scored in the ‘significant’ range for narcissistic patterns which indicates that a person may perceive themselves as more deserving and special, entitled to act in a way that exploits others but that their self-image is fragile and they may become sensitive to criticism and hostile if challenged.
	


KINTOMINAS: Your Honour my client needs to go to the bathroom.

HER HONOUR: Yes alright. Well what do you want me to do? Do you want me to pause the judgment so that he can do that or should I continue in his absence? I think he should be here.

KINTOMINAS: Your Honour at the moment is dealing with the co-accused, I think he should go.

HER HONOUR: Alright, well if you’re satisfied for him to go to the bathroom while I’m dealing with Mr Gaetano Vitale.

KINTOMINAS: He intends no discourtesy to your Honour of course.

HER HONOUR: I will continue then.


	
	Other noteworthy responses were associated with interpersonal alienation, a sense of disconnection with others and a tendency to isolate himself. The offender provided significant scores for drug dependency and bipolar disorder, indicating that he experiences mood swings between elation and exaggerated self-esteem to depression and hopelessness.
	
	
	Ms Allen opined that while the offender has made positive steps forward that reduce the risk of reoffending, his test scores indicate that he continues to experience unstable mood swings, likely related to personality patterns and unresolved difficulties associated with feelings of failure/inadequacy. His experience of interpersonal alienation may prevent him from addressing problems underlying his emotional coping strategies.
	
	
	The seriousness of the offence, as reflected by its maximum penalty and standard non-parole period, warrants a lengthy period of full-time imprisonment. I reject the submission made on his behalf that it is well within my discretion to impose a penalty that results in little if any further period in custody.
	
	
	However I find special circumstances warranting a substantial variation of the statutory ratio. I note that the Crown did not speak against a finding of special circumstances. I find special circumstances for the following reasons: this is the first time that the offender is to serve a term of imprisonment; he will require treatment and supervision upon his release to ensure that he does not relapse into drug use; and he will require a longer than usual additional term to assist him to readjust to living in the community upon his release. There is a potential for relapse to substance abuse without appropriate treatment.
	
	
	I will pause there. Mr Scalia is back in Court. I will proceed to deal with his subjective case.
	


SUBJECTIVE CASE – MARK SCALIA


	
	Mark Scalia is Gaetano Vitale’s cousin. A number of reports have been tendered on behalf of this offender and he also gave evidence before me in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	He is 28 years old. He was born in Australia and is of Italian/European descent. He is the eldest of three children and although his parents divorced when he was aged 10, his family environment was close and supportive. Those relationships remain close and the offender is currently living with his mother and stepfather in Green Valley, with his father living close by. He is the cousin of Gaetano Vitale and the nephew of Angelo Vitale.
	
	
	In 2003, at age 16, the offender had surgery following a back injury. He left school in Year 10 and was to commence a carpentry apprenticeship however a back injury prevented him from taking up the position.
	
	
	Since the age of 18 the offender has worked as a security guard across locations in Sydney. He worked with his father in the family business as a bread vendor since he was 21. Following a car accident in 2012 he was unable to work for a period of time. Subsequently he resumed work on a restricted basis. He still holds aspirations to expand that business in the future.
	
	
	The offender reports that he has isolated himself from most of his friends and family. In December 2015 the offender broke off his engagement as he didn’t want to involve his partner along with her two young children in the current proceedings.
	
	
	Ms Cowdery opines that the offender is experiencing symptoms of chronic pain and an underlying depression. In particular, the prolonged chronic pain makes him more prone to psychological distress. The presented level of distress at the time the offender met with Ms Cowdery was also influenced by the uncertainty in the offender’s life in the context of the present proceedings.
	
	
	Based on his previous ineffective means of coping, Ms Cowdery opines that the offender is highly vulnerable to rash and impaired decision-making. However the offender also presented with sincere feelings of personal shame, remorse and regret over the alleged offence and appeared open and willing to address his behaviour about the decisions leading up to the offence.
	
	
	The offender has seen Ms Cowdery on 7 occasions, including two psychological assessment sessions and five therapy sessions. The offender gave evidence that he found the sessions helpful.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender is remorseful for his actions. He impressed me as genuinely remorseful when he gave evidence before me. He said that he struggles to look in the mirror sometimes, acknowledging the seriousness of his conduct. He has not used illicit drugs since his arrest.
	
	
	As a result of the injury sustained in the car accident, the offender cannot sit for more than 10 to 15 minutes in a chair before he needs to stand or stretch. I accept this is the case having witnessed him in Court during the course of the proceedings. His counsel submits that as a result of his physical injuries, his time in custody will be more burdensome. A number of medical documents were tendered in this regard. I have read all of them and I am satisfied that they evidence the offender’s injury and ongoing symptoms, as described by the offender in Court.
	
	
	The offender has seen Dr Tuan-Anh Nguyen, a rehabilitative medicine physician, intermittently since at least June 2013 and Dean Katselas for physical therapy at the beginning and end of 2015. He has also been seeing a massage therapist.
	
	
	From those reports I gather that since his accident in 2012, the offender has had times where he has been progressing quite well and his general function has been improving. However there have been periods where his pain symptoms have flared up. A note from the physical therapist from December 2015 reports that the offender had been attending the gym again without complaint.
	
	
	Neurologist Dr Paul F Teychenne, in his report dated 1 February 2015, gave a guarded prognosis in relation to the offender’s lumbar spine, cervical spine and bilateral lumbosacral and bilateral cervical radiculopathy. He stated that the offender would be restricted from any form of employment requiring normal strength in the legs or any form of activity requiring him to persistently walk, walk up or down stairs or require rapid or excess movement of the lumbar spine. Dr Teychenne was of the view that the offender would need 40% domestic assistance, particularly with heavy duties.
	
	
	Whilst the offender’s medical condition will make his time in custody more onerous, I am satisfied that he will be provided with medication and treatment necessary for the maintenance of his overall comfort.
	
	
	As indicated above I am satisfied in his case that his use of methylamphetamine commenced about six months after the car accident and resulted from ongoing pain that was not successfully treated with prescribed pain medication.
	
	
	The offender comes before the Court with no prior criminal convictions. Since his arrest he has abstained from illicit drug use. He continues to work on a restricted basis and has not reoffended. I am satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. Having regard to these matters, I also find that the weight to be given to specific deterrence can be moderated in his case.
	
	
	Although this offender played a lesser role than Gaetano Vitale, became involved in the manufacture so as to source drugs for personal use, and has a compelling subjective case, the seriousness of the offence warrants a term of full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	I find special circumstances warranting a significant variation of the statutory ratio for the following reasons: this is the first time that he is to serve a term of imprisonment; he will require a longer than usual additional term to receive treatment and supervision to avoid relapse into drug use and occupational counselling to assist him to manage his future directions either through expanding his education or redirecting his career into other areas.
	


DELAY & BAIL CONDITIONS


	
	There has been a period of nearly three years between each offender’s arrest in June 2013 and sentence. It has been nearly a year since the trial first proceeded before me.
	
	
	Counsel on behalf of each offender submitted that this period of delay is lengthy and I can have regard to it in the way articulated in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519.
	
	
	I have taken into account the delay in each case in assessing the progress that has been made by each offender. As indicated above I am satisfied that each offender has abstained from the use of illicit substances, not reoffended and demonstrated significant progress in their rehabilitation.
	
	
	On behalf of Gaetano Vitale it was submitted that the bail conditions to which he has been subject prior to the revocation of bail were onerous, thereby constituting a form of punishment to which I should have regard. The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Bolder; R v Zaphir [2008] NSWCCA 222 at [38] held that daily reporting conditions were not sufficiently onerous as to require any significant amelioration of the sentences. The period of time considered in that case was two years. I am not minded to take into account the fact that the offender was on conditional bail for a lengthy period of time as significantly ameliorating the sentence. I have had regard to it as demonstrating his overall positive rehabilitation.
	


PARITY


	
	There will be a measure of difference in the sentences I impose upon these two offenders. While I bear in mind the principle of parity, I am satisfied that there are a number of factors that distinguish their respective objective and subjective cases.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mark Scalia played a lesser role than Gaetano Vitale. It was Gaetano Vitale who instigated the criminal enterprise and provided the raw material and original equipment that were to be used in the manufacture process. I am satisfied that he directed the activities of Mark Scalia.
	
	
	Mark Scalia was a willing participant in the manufacture process. However, it is highly unlikely that he would have become involved had the idea not been put into action by Gaetano Vitale and Anthony Klonaris.
	
	
	As indicated above I am satisfied that each offender was addicted to methylamphetamine at the time they engaged in the offence. Addiction does not provide an excuse or defence for criminal conduct. However, it provides an explanation for the offending conduct in each case, although in the case of Gaetano Vitale, it only provides a partial explanation. His moral culpability is higher in that he was in part motivated by an intention to obtain financial reward.
	
	
	In sentencing Mark Scalia, I bear in mind the remarks of Basten JA in the case of Dang v R [2013] NSWCCA 246 at [30]: “a person in the grip of an addiction has less freedom of choice than would otherwise be the case.”
	
	
	In the decision of Dang a distinction was drawn between selling drugs for commercial gain and for feeding a habit. Mark Scalia’s moral culpability is reduced, in my view, having regard to the fact that his use of methylamphatime was a form of self-medication in circumstances where his chronic pain was resistant to prescribed medication and he was afflicted with depression.
	
	
	There are a number of differences between these offenders including differences in the roles they played and differences in each subjective case. I am satisfied therefore that the circumstances call for a measure of differential treatment in the sentences I impose: see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462; Tsai Yu v R [2016] NSWCCA 73.
	


COMPARABLE CASES


	
	A number of cases were provided to me during the proceedings. Some of those cases deal with sentencing for like offences (contrary to s 24(2)), others deal with sentences imposed for offences contrary to section 24 (1). I have had regard to those decisions and to the schedule of cases referred to in the case of Dang [2013] NSWCCA 246. A schedule of all the cases I have had regard to is attached to this judgment.
	
	
	I bear in mind that information about sentences that have been passed in other cases can be of significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts. But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix the boundaries within which sentencing judges must, or even ought, to sentence: Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520.
	
	
	The cases provide some guidance against which to examine the proposed sentences in this case. However, the objective seriousness of the offence with which I have to deal, and the subjective circumstances relating to the offenders, are different from the cases that have been provided to me on sentence. For instance, in the present case the offenders have been found guilty of manufacture or knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity on the basis of the application, in the main, of the ad mixture rule rather than a finding that not less than 250 grams of end product was produced.
	
	
	Furthermore, in the case of Me Scalia, I have found that his primary purpose was to manufacture methylamphatemine for personal use in light of the fact that he was using the drug to relieve physical pain.
	
	
	Whilst I have taken the ‘comparable’ cases into account, they are of limited use having regard to the objective gravity and subjective circumstances relevant here.
	
	
	Accordingly, with respect to Mark Scalia, the offender is convicted of the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of prohibited drug and of the offence of participate in a criminal group.
	
	
	For the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of prohibited drug, taking into account the reduction in sentence by 20% for the plea of guilty and a finding of special circumstances, I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 21 months commencing today 6 May 2016 and expiring 5 February 2018 with a balance of term of 21 months expiring 5 November 2019. The total term is 3 years 6 months.
	
	
	With respect to offence of participate in a criminal group being sequence 2 on the s166 Certificate I impose a sentence of 6 months to date from today 6 May 2016 and expiring on 5 November 2016.
	
	
	On 5 February 2018 the offender is eligible for release on parole subject to the supervision of Probation and Parole.
	
	
	With respect to Mr Gaetano Vitale the offender is convicted with respect to each offence.
	
	
	I will proceed by way of an aggregate sentence. Before I do so I must indicate the sentences I would have imposed.
	
	
	Taking into account a 20% discount for the plea of guilty with respect to the offence of manufacture not less than a commercial quantity of prohibited drug and a 25% discount for the plea of guilty with respect to the offence of dishonestly obtain benefit by deception, I note the following indicative sentences would have been imposed for each offence:
	


1.   For the offence of manufacture not less than a commercial quantity of prohibited drugs, I indicate a sentence of 4 years 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months.

2.   For the offence of knowingly direct activities of a criminal group, sequence 6, on the s 166 Certificate, I indicate a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment.

3.   For the offence of dishonestly obtain benefit by deception, I indicate a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment. The offence of participate in a criminal group, sequence 2, is taken into account on a Form 1 on this offence.


	
	Taking into account a finding of special circumstances, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the offender is sentenced to an aggregate period of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months commencing from 16 October 2015 and expiring 15 July 2018 with a balance of term of 2 years 3 months expiring 15 October 2010. The total term is 5 years.
	
	
	The offender is eligible for release on parole on 15 July 2018 subject to supervision by Community Corrections for as long as they deem necessary.
	
	
	The second offence on the s166 Certificate, namely the offence of participate in a criminal group offence, sequence 3, is dismissed.
	
	
	I order the return of the trial exhibits.
	


YOUNES: Just one correction if I may your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Yes.

YOUNES: I think your Honour indicated that 2010 be the expiry of the total term of sentence. She will - 2020.

HER HONOUR: Thank you. Any other corrections to the dates?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, you said $171 at one point.

HER HONOUR: $171,000, yes, all right, it’s been a long judgment.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: And a drug destruction order.

HER HONOUR: I will order the destruction of the drugs. Yes Mr Kintominas.

KINTOMINAS: Your Honour, I’m sorry, may I just--

HER HONOUR: Sorry, just one at a time, yes.

KINTOMINAS: They might be needed for the next trial, your Honour, I don’t think they should be destroyed actually, on reflection.

HER HONOUR: All right, I will actually - I will vacate that order of destroying the drugs and actually that reminds me of something else Mr Crown. There was a non-publication order with respect to the pre-trial judgment. I can’t remember now whether I made a non-publication order with respect to the verdict judgment.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I can’t remember either your Honour.

HER HONOUR: I should, shouldn’t I?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, lest there be some unwarranted inappropriate publicity that might affect the trial.

HER HONOUR: And I should make a non-publication order with respect to this judgment having regard to some of the findings I’ve made with respect to Anthony Klonaris.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I agree with that your Honour.

HER HONOUR: So I will make a non-publication order with respect to this sentence judgment and also with the verdict judgment. Yes Mr Kintominas you were saying?

KINTOMINAS: Two matters your Honour. In respect of my client we’ll need your Honour say the additional term expired.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The balance.

HER HONOUR: The balance?

KINTOMINAS: Yes, the balance.

HER HONOUR: So the date was 5 November 2019, can you just check that’s correct.

KINTOMINAS: Yes, that’s three and a half years. Your Honour, just in respect of the non-publication order in respect of Klonaris I note that his representative I think is here in Court or probably is, I’m not sure, but nevertheless I take it just for clarity’s sake that your Honour is not prohibiting us from discussing what happened here with the representatives of the co-accused yet to come to trial?

HER HONOUR: No, I don’t think my order extends to stopping you from discussing on a counsel to counsel basis the matters that have taken place and the sentence that’s been imposed. It may be that if the representatives for Mr Klonaris and Mr Fenech want to make application to have copies of the judgment that I would consider those applications but I’m not going to gag you, Mr Kintominas, with respect to having discussions with counsel of the remaining accused. Does that complete your enquiries? All right. So the file exhibits will be returned, as will, Mr Crown, the copies of those trial exhibits that were provided to me in three folders.

PATCH: Thank you, your Honour They may not be able to be picked up today but contact will be made with your Honour’s associate and that can be done.

HER HONOUR: Yes, that’s fine.

SPEAKER: I hear what your Honour said in relation to Mr Kintominas. I’ve received a request from the other parties in relation to copies of transcripts involving this matter and I take it there’s no problem with that?

HER HONOUR: The transcripts, no, I don’t think there would be any problem with that. If they want the judgments they can make an application. I would simply want to stress that it would be for it to be provided to the legal representatives only.

SPEAKER: That’s correct, thank you, your Honour.

HER HONOUR: These remarks will have to be transcribed and revised and placed on the file because obviously they’ll be relevant to the sentencing of your client in September or whenever the proceedings have been adjourned to. I will make an order that these remarks be transcribed and provided to me so that I can revise them and then they can be provided to the parties. That completes this matter.

YOUNES: Before your Honour adjourns, Mr Vitale has brought one matter to my attention. Your Honour indicated a commencement date for his term of imprisonment as 16 October.

HER HONOUR: Yes that was the date I understood that the bail was revoked, am I wrong about that?

YOUNES: I’m instructed it was 27 August, perhaps if we could check the Court file.

HER HONOUR: Yes, just excuse me a moment. I had my associate check this morning but I will have it checked again. Mr Crown do you have the details as to when bail was revoked or does your instructing solicitor?

PATCH: I don’t, your Honour, and we don’t have access electronically unfortunately to the internal DVD network here.

HER HONOUR: All right, well the file does indicate 27 August, you’re quite right. So I will amend the commencement date.

PATCH: Yes, the Crown sentence summary indeed says 27 August as well.

HER HONOUR: All right. So then the aggregate sentence will be a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years nine months commencing on 27 August and expiring on 26 May 2018 with a balance of term of two years three months, just excuse me for a moment while I-calculate that.

YOUNES: I’ve got 26 August 2020.

HER HONOUR: Yes, so do I. Mr Crown?

PATCH: Yes, your Honour.

HER HONOUR: So the balance of term will expire on 26 August 2020, the total term being five years. Thank you for raising that correction. I’ll adjourn now.

	Mr Shipman (“the applicant”) applied for leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1: In relation to count 1, the learned sentencing judge erred in finding the objective criminality at the mid-range.

Ground 2: In relation to count 1, the learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account the supply of cocaine and cannabis in assessing the objective criminality of the supply of methylamphetamine.

Ground 3: In relation to counts 2 and 3, the learned sentencing judge was obliged to regard the amount of supply as the statutory minimum.


	
	At the conclusion of the hearing of the application on 4 May 2016 the Court made an order refusing leave to appeal. The following are my reasons for joining in the making of that order.
	


Facts


	
	There was no dispute about the facts relating to the applicant’s offending. His involvement in the supply of drugs came to light in the course of a police investigation into the activities of members and associates of the “Lone Wolves Outlaw Motorcycle Gang” (of which he was not a member). The investigation involved telephone intercepts, listening devices and the use of undercover operatives. The applicant was identified as part of a network of people who were supplying drugs to others. By his pleas of guilty he acknowledged that his supply activities spanned the period 19 August 2011 to 3 April 2012.
	
	
	The applicant acquired methylamphetamine from Michael Why and sold it in small quantities. He sold cocaine to Michael Why and others, including on one occasion to an undercover operative.
	
	
	The applicant worked, and lived, in a panel beating shop in an industrial unit. His teenage son lived with him. He sold drugs from there and when he was away he organised his son to handle the drug supply business.
	
	
	In March 2012, police obtained an authority to conduct a controlled operation using an undercover operative to buy drugs from the applicant. He sold the operative “a weight” (0.68g) of methylamphetamine for $200 on 25 March 2012; an “eight ball” (3.5g) of methylamphetamine for $600 on 26 March; 0.94g of cocaine for $350 on 27 March; and an ounce (28.2g) of methylamphetamine for $4000 on 3 April 2012. On the last occasion the applicant told the operative that he could supply two ounces for $3,700 per ounce.
	
	
	The applicant and others involved in the drug supply network were arrested on 4 April 2012. The applicant’s industrial unit was searched and police found 1.54g of methylamphetamine; 26.4g of cannabis; electronic scales; multiple mobile phones; and $4500 in cash.
	
	
	In relation to count 1, the total amount of methylamphetamine the applicant supplied was 495.86g. It was an undisputed fact that the applicant supplied 14g per week over a 33 week period (19 August 2011 to 3 April 2012); he supplied 32.32g in his sales to the undercover operative; and 1.54g was found during a search of the applicant's industrial unit.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, the amount of cocaine sold by the applicant was specified in the facts as being an indictable quantity. The statement of facts set out a number of conversations in which the applicant agreed to supply cocaine to others and there was also a sale to the undercover officer on 27 March 2012.
	
	
	In relation to count 3, the amount of cannabis the applicant sold could not be specified other than being an indictable quantity. There were numerous telephone communications in which there were coded references to cannabis.
	
	
	In relation to count 4, in February 2012 the applicant gave a friend a shoebox to look after without saying what was in it. The friend noticed that it contained ammunition and, he suspected, a gun. In mid-March 2012 the applicant was involved in an altercation at the Lone Wolves clubhouse during which he was seriously assaulted. On 17 March 2012 he called his friend and asked him to bring the box over. He added, “Bring everything”. The friend had the good sense not to. When police searched the friend’s home on 12 April 2012 they found the shoebox. It contained a pistol which was in working order, an ammunition magazine, and a number of boxes of ammunition. There were 9mm calibre cartridges (399 of them) that were suitable for use with the pistol and .357 Magnum calibre cartridges (40) that were not.
	


Personal circumstances of the applicant


	
	The applicant was born in 1969. He was aged 45 at the time of sentence.
	
	
	He had a criminal record which the judge regard as disentitling him to leniency and to being regarded as a person of prior good character. Her Honour noted, however, that the last offence was in 2007 and the applicant had no prior matters for supplying prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Reports that were before her Honour indicated that the applicant had a positive upbringing and remained close to immediate family members. She said this was confirmed by the presence of family members in court and by references some of them had provided.
	
	
	The applicant had two prior relationships and three children who were aged 28, 20 and 11. It was noted that he got on well with the two oldest children but he had been denied access to the youngest, a daughter, for the past 7 years.
	
	
	Prior to 2000 the applicant was working full-time, predominantly in the spray painting industry. He provided an airbrushing service and through this he came into contact with outlaw motorcycle gang members. His currently stated intention was to avoid any further association with such people.
	
	
	The applicant sustained a chronic back injury through a work accident in 1997 which limited his ability to work. He had commenced using cannabis at about the age of 14 but his drug use escalated following the accident. Her Honour noted that the applicant had used cannabis as a form of pain management. The applicant had also abused prescribed medication, cocaine and methylamphetamine. Alcohol abuse was an issue as well. It was noted that the applicant had never engaged in any intervention or rehabilitation program for substance abuse but, although he considered himself cured of his addiction, he was presently motivated to do so.
	
	
	Her Honour considered that the applicant’s back injury had caused chronic severe pain, depression and irritability. It was “in part responsible for his descent into the use and abuse of illicit drugs”.
	
	
	Her Honour reviewed a quantity of testimonials from friends and family members. They spoke of him having been a hard working person from a very young age and various other positive aspects of his character were described and noted by her Honour. Some spoke of the heartache caused by the breakdown of his second relationship and his struggle to gain access and have a normal relationship with his youngest child. It was said that this had a negative impact on his morale.
	
	
	The applicant received treatment from a psychologist in 2013 and 2014 for depression and a panic disorder. A forensic psychiatrist noted a history or depression and anxiety. The applicant told the doctor that in the period leading up to the offences he was working hard to get money for legal fees in relation to proceedings to gain access to his daughter.
	
	
	The psychiatrist considered that the applicant was not currently exhibiting symptoms of depressive episodes, nor was he experiencing the same severity of symptoms at the time of the offences, although his use of substances could have masked them. The psychiatrist considered that the applicant had used substances throughout his life to cope with the various adversities he had faced, likely reflecting inadequate coping skills.
	
	
	The judge noted that the applicant had accepted full responsibility for the drug supply charges and had expressed regret and apology. She was satisfied that he had demonstrated remorse, “albeit belatedly”.
	
	
	Her Honour considered that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend.
	


Other findings relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty a few days after the second date the matter was listed for trial. For the utilitarian value of the pleas her Honour allowed a discount of 10 per cent.
	
	
	The judge considered that general deterrence was “an extremely important sentencing consideration”. Personal deterrence was also said to be relevant but not thought by her Honour to be crucial given her findings about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of re-offending.
	
	
	She noted the relevance of the prescribed maximum penalties for the offences and, in the case of count 1, the standard non-parole period, as guideposts.
	
	
	Special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2B) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were found so as to allow for the sentence to include a longer period on parole.
	


Ground 1 – error in finding objective criminality of the offence in count 1 as at the mid-range


	
	Her Honour devoted a discrete portion of her judgment to her assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. She prefaced it with the following observation:
	


“It is clear that the offending engaged in by this offender is of a most serious nature. The offender over a period of eight months supplied three different drugs on many occasions. It is clear that the offender must receive significant sentences for his offending, in particular for count 1.”


	
	In relation to the commercial quantity supply offence in count 1 she said:
	


“In relation to Count 1, I have come to the view that the offending falls squarely into the middle range of seriousness for such offences. I have formed that view in light of the amount supplied being just under 500 grams and placing the offender, by reference to the amount in the middle and, equally important, is the offender’s role in what can only be described as an organised and reasonably sophisticated joint criminal enterprise.

The offender was clearly a principal in that enterprise, and I accept the Crown’s submission that this offender operated at a higher level than most of the others who were charged as a result of this investigation. The phone calls and text messages reveal that the extent of activity is of a high order. There was a system of coded language and covert references used in order to avoid detection. In addition, the offender used his factory, which was also his residence as a base for supplying or storing prohibited drugs. The enterprise was clearly a commercial one and the offender must have made some considerable profit.

Whilst I accept Mr Little’s submission that the Crown’s calculations as disclosed in their submissions do not take account of the cost price, there must still have been a considerable profit.

There were many different customers and many instances of supply. I do, however, accept that there is no evidence of enrichment displayed in the offender’s industrial unit. The purity disclosed by the drugs that were seized was low, but there is no evidence that this offender had any idea of the purity of the drug and all in all this is a minor factor when it comes to assessing the objective gravity of the offending in relation to Count 1. See Laraway v R [2010] NSWCCA 46 at [32].

In forming my assessment of mid-range, I have placed far more reliance upon the total amounts supplied, as well as the role of this offender as a principal, and the number of supplies over an extended period of time. I do not accept the submission that because the supplies were of smaller discrete quantities, somehow the matter is less serious because of that fact. The role and the level of participation are crucial indicators of the objective seriousness, and this offender played a significant role, and his level of participation was of a high order: see Melikian v R [2008] NSWCCA 156 and R v McDonald [2002] reported at 128 A Crim R 44.” (Emphasis added)


	
	In relation to the offences in counts 2 and 3 of supplying cocaine and cannabis respectively her Honour said:
	


“As to the further counts of supplying cocaine and supplying cannabis, although the quantities cannot be ascertained beyond being indictable quantities, it is clear that the offender engaged in repeated supplies of both these drugs to a number of different customers. Again, he was a principal supplier of these drugs. Again, his level of participation was high.” (Emphasis added)


	
	In relation to the firearms offence her Honour said:
	


“In relation to the firearms offence, I accept the submission made by Mr Little on behalf of the offender that, in general, when it comes to possession of firearms, it is hard to rank offences in terms of a scale of seriousness. I do not place much weight, if any, on the fact that the firearm in question was held remotely from where the offender was. There is no evidence before me from the offender as to why he had this firearm, but the facts reveal it was connected with his involvement with Lone Wolves and, by implication, his illegal activity. This is a factor to be taken into account. I find that this offence is a serious one of its kind.”


	
	Once again speaking about the overall offending, her Honour then said:
	


“Having regard to the material that is before me, it is clear to me that the offender’s descent into the use and abuse of drugs and, ultimately, what led to the commission of these offences stemmed in large measure from his unfortunate back injury. It is clear to me that before the back injury and then his abuse of drugs, the offender was a very good worker and made a very positive contribution to the community. However, the commission of these offences was at least in part motivated in order to generate money to use to pay for legal proceedings, which was over and above what he needed to support his own use of the drugs.” (Emphasis added)


	
	In written submissions for the applicant it was contended that there was “no specific evidence of money being spent on legal fees. The applicant had aspirations to gain contact with his daughter but there is no evidence of money illicitly gained being successfully spent on this.”
	
	
	This submission impugns the last sentence of the extract from the remarks on sentence set out above (at [36]). However, there was evidence supporting what her Honour said. The report of the forensic psychiatrist included the following:
	


“He said he had ‘spent every cent’ getting court orders to allow him to see his daughter. He said he had no money left.”

“In the twelve months leading up to his arrest for the alleged index offences, Mr Shipman informed me that he was working hard to get money for legal fees. He said he was trying to enforce his right to have contact with his daughter who was in the care of her mother. He said that he was ‘depressed about my daughter’. He said he took drugs in order to keep working.”


	
	Whether the applicant was using profits from drug sales directly to pay legal fees, or using such profits to pay for drugs to use in order to work to pay for legal fees (or a combination of both) makes no real difference. The impugned finding of the sentencing judge was one that was open to her Honour to make.
	
	
	It was submitted that the finding of objective seriousness in the middle of the range was not borne out by the evidence that was said to be the effect that the applicant used whatever gain he made from his drug sales “for his own purposes of ameliorating pain and finding the energy against discomfort to continue working lawfully”. In other words his gain from his offending was to enable him to continue to use prohibited drugs. The submission is not soundly based on the evidence. Moreover, counsel appearing for the applicant in the District Court conceded, “no doubt … there would have been some profit”.
	
	
	It was submitted that, “in an overall view of his objective criminality … his level of criminality is reduced by reason of his personal consumption of the illegal drug arising from his compulsion to work. The illegal drugs defrayed pain and provided endurance to work.” As to this submission the Crown (rightly) pointed to the observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [197]-[198]:
	


“In my opinion drug addicts who commit crime should not be added to the list of victims. Their degree of moral culpability will vary, just as it varies for individuals who are not affected by addiction. There are a number of aspects of the relationship between drug addiction and crime which indicate that moral choices are made.

First is the original decision to experiment with drugs which, in the usual case, is a completely free choice. The addictive quality of drugs, together with the anti-social behaviour which so commonly results from addiction, is so widely known that persons who choose a course of addiction must be treated as choosing its consequences.”


	
	The Crown submitted that the consumption of illicit substances in order to enhance work performance cannot be condoned and that the applicant’s consumption of drugs was not “morally praiseworthy” as the applicant asserted. Those submissions are soundly based and I accept them.
	
	
	Submissions were also made to the effect that the quantities supplied by the applicant were relatively small and that the fact that the supplies were made over an extended period of time “actually mitigates the seriousness of the offence in that it demonstrates that the weekly nature of the sale of methylamphetamine was at a moderate level, after taking into account what was consumed by the applicant”.
	
	
	The assessment by the primary judge of these matters was a matter for her discretion and her reasoning is set out in the passage I have quoted above (see the last paragraph of the extract at [33]). In my view her findings were well open to be made.
	
	
	It is to be noted that the focus of this ground of appeal, namely the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in count 1 being in the middle of the range, was classically within the discretion of the sentencing judge: see Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] where Spigelman CJ said:
	


“Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instances judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.”


	
	In the same case, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) said:
	


“[46] The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.""


	
	There was no merit in this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2 – error in taking into account the supply of cocaine and cannabis in assessing the objective criminality of the supply of methylamphetamine


	
	This proposed ground of appeal was solely based upon the preliminary observation made by her Honour before she specifically addressed the objective seriousness of each of the offences: see above at [32]. It was submitted by the applicant that the criminality and related penalty applicable to count 1 ought to have been considered discretely but her Honour had incorporated the criminality in relation to counts 2 and 3 in assessing the criminality applicable to count 1.
	
	
	This assertion must also be rejected. The observation referred to in the submission was an overall one but immediately followed, as the above extract reveals, by a discrete assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the individual sentences.
	


Ground 3 – the judge was obliged to regard the amount supplied in relation to counts 2 and 3 as the statutory minimum


	
	The written submissions in support of this ground were misconceived in that they proceeded upon the mistaken basis that the applicant was being sentenced for offences of commercial quantity supply in counts 2 and 3. It was contended that the judge should have sentenced the applicant on the basis that the quantity involved was at the commercial quantity threshold: 250 grams in the case of cocaine in count 2 and 25 kilograms in the case of cannabis leaf for count 3.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant acknowledged the error at the hearing of the application. The submission was modified so it became a contention that the judge should have sentenced on the basis of the quantity being at the indictable quantity threshold: 5 grams in the case of cocaine and 1 kilogram in the case of cannabis leaf. But that is precisely how her Honour proceeded: see above at [34].
	


Conclusion


	
	There was no merit in any of the grounds of appeal. For these reasons I joined in the making of the order at the conclusion of the hearing:
	


Leave to appeal against sentence refused.


	
	R S HULME AJ: Subject to one matter, I agree with the reasons for judgment of R A Hulme J. My reservation concerns the correctness of the passages quoted from Mulato v R.
	
	
	However they have been followed on many occasions and as there was no argument in this case that they were wrong, now is not the occasion for reconsideration of them.

2769390,R v Turnbull (No. 15) [2016] NSWSC 787,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown seeks to adduce from Dr Christopher Nadolny, evidence of observations in September 2014 by reference to an area of land on the property, “Colorado”. The Crown has indicated that the evidence sought to be led is that, when Dr Nadolny inspected the property in September 2014, the relevant area had been cleared.
	
	
	Objection is taken to the relevance of this evidence, in particular, by reference to the fact that the Accused had in fact killed Mr Turner on 29 July 2014, and had been in custody continuously from that evening.
	
	
	The evidence presently being given by Dr Nadolny relates to events surrounding proceedings before the Land and Environment Court in 2014 by reference to remediation directions which had been given by the Office of Environment and Heritage.
	
	
	The presently relevant area has been referred to by Dr Nadolny as having not been cleared when he visited the property, with other experts, in April 2014 as part of an onsite inspection by the conclave of experts.
	
	
	Exhibits R and S, read together, indicate that the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court on 25 June 2014 included, in a portion marked for remediation, an area which is the subject of the expected evidence from Dr Nadolny by reference to his September 2014 inspection. The area in question is what might be described as the right-hand side of the saddle-bag shaped area marked in yellow on “Colorado” as depicted in Exhibit R.
	
	
	It is true that the Accused had been arrested, charged and detained following the tragic events of 29 July 2014. However, the chronology of events which have been considered so far involve the inspection by Dr Nadolny in April 2014 and the orders made by the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court on 25 June 2014. What is now sought to be led is evidence of an inspection in September 2014.
	
	
	Given the proximity of the events surrounding land clearing (in the context of remediation orders) to the events on 29 July 2014, and the words which the Accused said on that occasion as explained to the jury by Mr Strange, I am satisfied that this evidence is relevant.
	
	
	If it be the case that the area in question was only cleared after 29 July 2014, then that may be a matter for evidence from someone with direct knowledge of the topic. However, it does seem to me that the fact that that land was cleared in September 2014 is relevant to issues in the trial and I allow it.

		20 June 2016",2016-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769395,R v Turnbull (No. 16) [2016] NSWSC 788,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown seeks to tender two documents in the evidence-in-chief of Mr Terrence Bailey, the Chief Executive Officer of the Office of Environment and Heritage.
	
	
	The first is the judgment of Preston CJ, the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court, of 31 July 2014 in proceedings Turnbull v Director-General Office of Environment and Heritage (No 2) [2014] NSWLEC 112 (MFI47). The second is a document which was an attachment to the judgment of Preston CJ, being a direction to carry out remedial work in one of the two sets of proceedings to which his Honour's judgment relates (MFI48).
	
	
	The primary objection taken, on behalf of the Accused, to the tender of these documents is relevance. A second objection concerns s.91 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	It is submitted for the Accused that the documents are irrelevant. The judgment of 31 July 2014 postdated the events of 29 July 2014 in which the Accused killed Mr Turner. It is submitted, as well, that the Crown does not need this material given that the broad structure of the chronology is already before the jury.
	
	
	With respect to s.91 Evidence Act 1995, having heard that objection, the Crown indicated that only the front page of the judgment and paragraphs 11, 12, 13 and 14 were sought to be tendered, and not the reasoning of Preston CJ contained in the earlier paragraphs.
	
	
	It seems to me that the matters contained in the earlier reasoning do involve, in one way or another, a decision or findings of fact of Preston CJ, so as to be caught by s.91. However, the modified tender, being the concluding paragraphs only, do not have that difficulty. In the circumstances, the s.91 objection does not have further operation.
	
	
	With respect to relevance, the Crown submits that this material should be before the jury. It is, in effect, the continuation of a process which resulted in a judgment on 25 June 2014 by Preston CJ (part of which is Exhibit S) and an annexure to that judgment (Exhibit R).
	
	
	The evidence reveals that there were ongoing discussions between the parties after 25 June 2014 with respect to the detail of the orders to be made, the areas to be covered and other associated issues. Indeed, the judgment of Preston CJ of 31 July 2014 indicates hearing dates on 11 and 17 July 2014, with his Honour giving a direction to the parties to file the agreed final remedial work directions by 22 July 2014.
	
	
	Although the proceedings which were before Preston CJ did not involve the Accused as a party, it is clear on the evidence in this trial that the Accused had a close interest, at least, in the outcome of those proceedings and in what orders may be made.
	
	
	In my view, the continuation of events after 25 June 2014, and up to the decision of 31 July 2014, is relevant to issues in this trial. The activities being carried out, in particular on “Colorado”, on and prior to 29 July 2014, are relevant to issues in this trial, and in particular the unchallenged act of the Accused in attending Talga Lane in the early evening of 29 July 2014 and shooting dead Mr Turner.
	
	
	I am satisfied that parts of the judgment, together with the attachment, are relevant to issues in the trial and should be admitted.
	
	
	A further matter raised by senior counsel for the Accused is the identification of the legal representation on the cover sheet of the judgment of Preston CJ. That indicates that it was, in fact, senior counsel presently appearing for the Accused who was appearing at that time for the applicants in the Land and Environment Court. The solicitors for the applicants were Cole & Butler, the present solicitors for the Accused.
	
	
	There is already evidence before the jury that Mr Joseph from Cole & Butler has a longstanding role as the legal adviser to the Accused. There is no evidence to date that senior counsel presently appearing for the Accused was appearing for him in the Land and Environment Court.
	
	
	It might be said that this aspect was going to arise in some shape or form and at some stage, given the continuation of representation in this trial by senior counsel for the Accused and Cole & Butler following their appearance in earlier related proceedings in the Land and Environment Court. That said, it seems to me that it would constitute something of a distraction, perhaps giving rise to a measure of irrelevant speculation on the part of the jury, as to the identity of senior counsel for the Accused in this trial and also as lead counsel for the applicants in the Land and Environment Court proceedings.
	
	
	In that respect, I consider it appropriate, as the Crown accepted as a reasonable way forward, that the section on the cover sheet of the judgment indicating representation should be deleted.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to admit a modified version of MFI47, which will delete the representation section on the front page and delete paragraphs 1 through to 10 in the body of the judgment itself.
	
	
	I propose to admit as well MFI48, being the attachment to the order of 31 July 2014 containing a direction to carry out remedial work in the proceedings before the Court brought by Grant Wesley Turnbull.
	


[After further submissions, part of paragraph 1 of MFI47 was include in the tendered exhibit]

		20 June 2016",2016-05-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769414,R v Turnbull (No. 17) [2016] NSWSC 789,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of cross-examination yesterday of Mr Terrence Bailey, there was tendered by senior counsel for the Accused, a document which is MFI53 (T667), to which the Crown took objection.
	
	
	The argument on the admissibility of this document commenced, proceeded a short way and was then deferred until today as the day had been reserved for legal argument on a range of issues. Mr Bailey is to return to the witness box tomorrow and it is appropriate that I give a ruling on this tender.
	
	
	MFI53 is an email dated 23 August 2012 containing what is said to be the details of a conversation that Tom Celebrezze had with Anna Simmons about an event in August 2012 which is said to have involved Mr Glen Turner.
	
	
	I note that senior counsel for the Accused has indicated that he would have in mind tendering, as well, MFIs 54 and 55, with that approach being dependent to a considerable extent on the outcome of the tender of MFI53. I note that MFIs 54 and 55 are handwritten notes of conversations said to have been had with persons concerning the same alleged event as that discussed by Ms Simmons.
	
	
	The Court has been informed that Ms Simmons is intended to be called as a witness in the defence case. The suggested relevance of her evidence is that the event in August 2012 involving Mr Turner caused her some upset and she passed on information about that to the Accused. It is submitted that the state of mind of the Accused in that respect is pertinent and feeds into other issues in the trial, including his perception of the role of Mr Turner, an officer with the Office of Environment and Heritage.
	
	
	The Crown has objected to the evidence on the basis of relevance and as to its form and content in the sense of what is contained in MFI53.
	
	
	I note that, in R v Turnbull (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 439 at [101], I referred to the intention of the defence to rely upon the account of Ms Simmons concerning an event in August 2012 as tendency evidence. For reasons explained in that judgment, I declined to allow tendency evidence to be adduced.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused indicated then, and has repeated today, that it was always intended to adduce evidence from Ms Simmons about this incident as primary evidence and not just tendency evidence. That remains an open question for the moment, the Crown having indicated an objection to the relevance of it.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted today that, if the evidence was to be relevant, it would be so as to what Ms Simmons said to the Accused about this incident, with that itself being a matter contributing to the state of mind of the Accused. The Crown maintains its objection to the evidence of Ms Simmons about the event itself with Mr Turner as not being relevant.
	
	
	I do not need to make any definitive ruling on that issue today. What is needed at this stage is a ruling on the admissibility of the document which is tendered.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Bailey has involved a range of documents tendered through him on aspects of the interaction between the Office of Environment and Heritage and the Accused, including a Summons commencing court proceedings, stop-work orders and other notices.
	
	
	What is sought to be tendered here, however, as evidence of truth of the fact, is what is said to be Ms Simmons' account given to Mr Celebrezze in August 2012 about this incident.
	
	
	I do not consider that this evidence is admissible. The question of whether Ms Simmons can give evidence herself about these events awaits a future argument and ruling. I do not consider that the fact that there is a record contained within the Office of Environment and Heritage in the form of this email, which sets out what Ms Simmons is said to have stated to Mr Celebrezze, makes the email itself admissible. The same approach will apply to MFIs 54 and 55 which are handwritten notes of conversations with persons about other features of the same event.
	
	
	The question of what the Accused learned about these events, and how, may arise for consideration at a later time. However, I do not consider that MFI53 should be admitted and I decline to admit it into evidence.

		20 June 2016",2016-05-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769417,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 50) [2016] NSWSC 599,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	Exhibit M36 in these proceedings is a document dated 29 March 2015. There is no dispute that it is in the handwriting of the accused Rogerson. It commences with the words ""Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury"", and proceeds, in particular at paragraph 3, to set out an account of the circumstances in which the deceased Jamie Gao was allegedly shot and killed.
	
	
	The document was tendered in the course of the evidence of the accused McNamara. It is, for want of a better term, one of a series of documents which were said by McNamara to have been created during the period in which he and Rogerson were together in custody. It is part of McNamara's case that these documents were created in circumstances where Rogerson was, in effect, propounding that a defence to the present charges be fabricated. Rogerson denies that this was the case.
	
	
	In the course of cross-examination this morning, Rogerson conceded that he wrote Exh. M36 and gave it to McNamara whilst they were in custody together. When asked why he wrote the document, Rogerson said (at T4352 L6) that it was ""a little light-hearted humour"". When asked who he was humouring by creating the document, he answered ""probably myself"". He was then asked (commencing at T4352 L15):
	


“Q. You had nothing better to do and you wrote this document up, is that what you are suggesting?""

A. That is all I can think it would be. It is nothing more than a little bit of humour.

Q. Why did you give it to Mr McNamara for?

A. Just for the fun of it.

Q. What, what sort of fun? You expected him to laugh at this document? What was your expectation in giving him this document?

A. I think he did laugh at it and we had a bit of a joke.”


	
	I then asked (at T4352 L29):
	


“Q. You were asked what your expectation was when you gave it to him?

A. Light-hearted banter, light-hearted humour, my sort of humour maybe.”


	
	Against the background of that evidence Mr Wendler, who appears for McNamara, now seeks to cross-examine Rogerson in respect of a meeting between the two accused in either 2013 or 2014. If that cross-examination is allowed, it will be put to Rogerson that on that occasion he gave McNamara a gift of a pen with a matching letter opener, both of which have been tendered on the present application.
	
	
	The lower part of the pen is the shape of a bullet. The clip on the top of the pen is in the form a rifle. The “bullet section” of the pen, if it might be described in that way, has three names engraved on it, namely Phillip Western, Warren Lanfranchi and Butchy Byrnes. If the cross-examination is allowed, Mr Wendler will put to Rogerson that each of those named persons was shot and killed by Rogerson in the line of duty as a police officer.
	
	
	Mr Wendler submitted that the proposed cross-examination is relevant to the proposition (which is said to be consistent with the evidence of Rogerson in relation to Exh. M36) that Rogerson had a ""low value"" on human life. Mr Wendler further submitted that the proposed cross-examination went to the issue of the alleged fabrication by Rogerson of a proposed defence to the present charges, and that it was relevant, in particular, to the issue of what is said to have been Rogerson's fabrication of a response to the prosecution case. In making these submissions, Mr Wendler pointed out that part of Exh. M36 suggests a scenario in which the deceased was killed in the course of a struggle.
	
	
	The Crown objected to the proposed cross-examination. The Crown submitted that in reality, Mr Wendler was seeking to adduce tendency evidence. The Crown submitted that the probative value of the evidence, if there was any at all, was tenuous, and that there was necessarily a risk of unfair prejudice to the accused Rogerson if the cross-examination were allowed. Such risk was said to arise from the very nature of the issue which was sought to be pursued.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, also objected to the evidence. He submitted that the evidence was not relevant, that it had no probative value, and that there was a clear danger of unfair prejudice to Rogerson, which substantially outweighed any probative value that the evidence might have.
	
	
	Section 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) confers a discretion on the Court to refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might, amongst other things, be unfairly prejudicial to a party. I have, in the course of a previous judgment in the proceedings, made a number of observations regarding the operation of s. 135: R v Rogerson, R v McNamara (No 45) [2016] NSWSC 452 at [32] and following.
	
	
	For the purposes of the section, I must firstly assess the probative value of the evidence. In my view, the probative value of the evidence is marginal at best. In particular, is difficult to see how it could be probative of the issue of the alleged fabrication of a defence by Rogerson.
	
	
	Even if the evidence has some probative value, s. 135 requires that I consider whether such probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson. In order to exercise the discretion to exclude the evidence under s. 135, I do not have to be satisfied that it will be unfairly prejudicial. I need only be satisfied that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that this might be so. In considering that question, I must be mindful of any danger that the evidence might be misused by the jury in some unfair way: R v McNamara; R v Rogerson (No 45) (supra) at [36].
	
	
	In my view, there is a clear danger of unfair prejudice to Rogerson if the cross-examination is permitted. Such danger arises from the very nature of the gift, and its direct reference to persons who were allegedly shot and killed by Rogerson in the line of duty as a police officer.
	
	
	It is not difficult to envisage a risk of such evidence being misused by the jury. In particular, it is not difficult to envisage a risk that the jury might speculate upon the circumstances in which the three named people were killed. Those circumstances obviously have no bearing whatsoever on any issue in this trial.
	
	
	For those reasons, I have come to the view that such probative value as the evidence might have (which, on any view, is limited) is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson. For those reasons, the proposed cross-examination will not be permitted.

		15 June 2016",2016-05-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769418,Anthony John Sidgreaves v R; AJS Hotel Management Pty Ltd v R [2016] NSWDC 81,"Judgment


	
	Anthony John Sidgreaves (the appellant) was convicted of one count of licencee fail to comply with conditions of licence contrary to section 11(2) Liquor Act 2007 at the Downing Centre Local Court on 14 September 2015.
	
	
	AJS Hotel Management Pty Ltd (the company) was convicted of one count of master licensee employ an unlicensed person contrary to section 39(1) Security Industry Act 1997 on the same date.
	
	
	The matters arise from the operation of a hotel known as “Tommy’s Tavern” (the hotel) in Lismore in 2012.
	
	
	On or about 8 August 2011 the hotel was leased by its owners, AJ Holdings (NSW) Pty Ltd and Cumedo Pty Ltd (the owners) to a Mr Parrot. On or about 2 January 2012 the owners retook possession of the hotel as Mr Parrot had failed to pay rent.
	
	
	On 24 January 2012 the appellant attended the Casino Liquor and Gaming Control Authority (the Authority) in Sydney and submitted a document entitled “Liquor licence transfer”. In that document the appellant sought transfer of the hotel’s liquor licence into his own name. There is no evidence that the transfer application was approved, even provisionally.
	
	
	At all material times the company was the holder of a Master Security Licence pursuant to the Security Industry Act 1997. The master licence allowed the company to employ security guards to undertake crowd control work at the hotel. It was not a condition of the hotel licence that the licensee was required to provide security guards at the hotel.
	
	
	Between about 28 March 2012 and 24 April 201, Jason Geoghan, (the security guard) provided crowd control services at the hotel. The evidence does not disclose on how many occasions the security guard worked at the hotel in the relevant period. The security guard was licensed in Queensland, but in the relevant period his New South Wales licence had lapsed. The Security Licensing Enforcement Directorate (SLED) was aware that the security guard was licensed in Queensland but it appears from the documents that he had not lodged a formal Mutual Recognition request. The effective such a request would have been to alleviate the need to apply for two current security licences at any one time. The security guard reapplied for New South Wales licence on or about 10 April 2012 and his application was completed on or about 30 April 2012.
	
	
	The appellant on behalf the company made enquiries of the security guard as to the currency of his licence. The company contends in the appeal that it could not have done any more to ensure that the security guard was licensed at the relevant time.
	
	
	At about 9:17 PM on 30 August 2012 the staff of the hotel closed it to the public. The general manager of the hotel, another employee of the hotel and two of their friends proceeded to prepare 72 shots of various liquors on the bar and to consume them over a period of time, in various states of undress. Their activities lasted over a number of hours until a noise complaint was made by a neighbour of the hotel that resulted in the police being called. It is fair to say that the “shenanigans” involved at the hotel on the night in question constituted a number of breaches of licence condition, not the least of which was a breach of the statutory condition contained in section 17(2) Liquor Act 2007 that the licencee failed to keep the hotel open to the public when liquor was being sold or supplied.
	
	
	The issue in the appeal is limited to whether the appellant was the licensee of the hotel on 30 August 2012.
	


Relevant law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows.
	
	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31].
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22].
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24].
	
	
	The Court is obliged to give the judgement which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance: Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [23].
	
	
	Section 61 of the Liquor Act provides:
	


61   Application for transfer of licence on dispossession of licensee

(1)  This section applies in relation to a licence (other than a club licence) if:

(a)  the licensee is evicted from the licensed premises, or

(b)  the owner of the licensed premises comes into, or becomes entitled to, possession of the licensed premises to the exclusion of the licensee, or

(c)  the licensee is no longer employed by the owner of the business carried on under the licence (the business owner), or

(d)  the licensee is not complying, or does not have the capacity to comply, with the requirement under section 91 (1) to be responsible at all times for the personal supervision and management of the business of the licensed premises.

(2)  An application for a transfer of the licence may be made by the owner of the licensed premises or by the business owner.

(3)  The owner of the licensed premises who comes into, or is entitled to, possession of the premises, or the business owner (as the case requires), is taken to be the licensee of the premises until:

(a)  the day that is 28 days after this section becomes applicable, or

(b)  the day on which application is made under subsection (2),

whichever first occurs.

(4)  If an application is made under subsection (2) not later than 28 days after this section becomes applicable, the applicant is, until the application is determined by the Authority, taken to be the licensee under the licence to which the application relates.

(5)  The Authority is not to determine an application for the transfer of a licence under this section unless:

(a)  the Authority is satisfied:

(i)  that notice of the application was given to the dispossessed licensee at least 3 clear days before the Authority determines the application (or that all reasonable steps necessary for giving notice were taken by or on behalf of the applicant and that failure to give notice was not due to any neglect or default of the applicant), and

(ii)  if so notified, that the dispossessed licensee has been given a reasonable opportunity to make submissions in relation to the application, and

(b)  the Authority is satisfied that any lessee of the licensed premises has been notified of the application for the transfer of the licence and been given a reasonable opportunity to make submissions in relation to the application, and

(c)  the Authority has taken any submissions made under this subsection into consideration.

(5A)  If:

(a)  an application under subsection (2) in respect of the licensed premises is not made within 28 days after this section becomes applicable, or

(b)  such an application is made but the transfer of the licence to the applicant is refused by the Authority,

the licence is suspended until such time as the licence is transferred to another person.

(6)  Section 60 applies, with such modifications as are necessary, in relation to an application for the transfer of a licence under this section.

Material considered on the appeal


	
	The prosecution tendered the transcripts of the proceedings before the magistrate and the relevant exhibits.
	


The Security Industry Act offence


	
	The section 39 offence was a strict liability offence. The magistrate decided that the company did not have an honest and reasonable mistake of fact defence available to it because the mistake it made was as to a matter of law, ie was the security guard licensed, rather than as to a matter of fact. I agree with this analysis.
	
	
	The matters put to me by the appellant on behalf the company were all subjective considerations. I accept, taking into account the proximity of the hotel to the Queensland border that a significant proportion of the available security guards also worked in Queensland. I also accept that the state of the mutual recognition legislation in 2012 was complicated. I note that this was rectified in September 2014 when it persons in the position of the security guard, the subject of these proceedings, were given automatic mutual recognition. The failing on behalf the company was an administrative one. It could have simply kept a copy of the security guard’s New South Wales licence and recorded when it was due to expire. The company could thereby have prevented the security guard working when he was unlicensed.
	
	
	The present case is somewhat unusual, almost to the extent of being extraordinary, in that the security guard was licensed in Queensland during the relevant period and there was no suggestion that his failure to be licensed in New South Wales was other than an oversight on the security guard’s part or as a result of the complicated mutual recognition system in place at the relevant time.
	
	
	The orders I make in relation to the Security Industry Act conviction appeal are:
	



	
	The appeal against conviction is dismissed.
	



	
	In dealing with the severity appeal on this matter, for the reasons expressed the matter is at the lowest end of objective seriousness for this type of offence. I note that the company no longer holds the master security licence and the hotel engages security guards through an independent contractor. The hotel licence did not require the provision of security guards but they were thought to be essential for the proper management of the hotel and this was a responsible view to take. I also note that the appellant at the time had a number of personal problems that contributed to the company’s failure to ensure that the security guard was licensed. In all of those circumstances this is an appropriate matter to be dealt with pursuant to section 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The orders I make in relation to the Security Industry Act severity appeal are:
	



	
	The appeal against severity is allowed.
	
	
	I set aside the conviction and the penalty imposed by the magistrate and in lieu thereof I make the following order.
	
	
	The offence is proven. Because of the company’s lack of antecedents and the extremely low range of the objective seriousness of the matter considering that at all times the security guard was licensed in Queensland, I deem it inexpedient to inflict any punishment. The charge is dismissed under section 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


The Liquor Act offence

Determination of the hotel licencee issue


	
	The transfer of licence application to have the licence put in the appellant’s name was never approved, even provisionally, by the Authority. It was an application pursuant to section 60 Liquor Act 2007. Put simply, if it was not approved, it could not have effected a transfer of the licence into the appellant’s name.
	
	
	Rather, the provisions of section 61 Liquor Act 2007 operated. The section applied to this case because the licensee was evicted from the premises and the owner became entitled to possession. An application for the transfer of the licence could then be made by the owner of the licensed premises or by the business owner (the owner). The owner was deemed to be the licensee from period of 28 days after taking possession of the hotel or on the date when an application for transfer was made by the owner, whichever first occurred. The owner was then deemed to be the licensee until the application was determined.
	
	
	There is no evidence before me as to whether or not the owner made an application to have the licence transferred to it. The Administrative Decisions Tribunal decided in the circumstances of this case that the owners were responsible for the gaming machine tax. That decision was open because the gaming machine tax, according to the ADT, became due and payable within the 28 day period after the owners retook possession. At that time, by operation of section 61 Liquor Act 2007 they were deemed to be the licensee.
	
	
	For the purposes of my decision, I cannot establish the identity of the holder of the hotel licence as at 30 August 2012. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant because there is no evidence that the application he submitted to the Authority on 24 January 2012 was approved. The appellant was not the owner of the premises or the business owner and was thereby not able to be deemed the licensee pursuant to section 61 Liquor Act 2007.
	
	
	Accordingly, the appellant is entitled to be acquitted of the section 11(2) Liquor Act 2007 offence.
	
	
	The orders I make on the Liquor Act offence conviction appeal are:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction is allowed.
	
	
	I set aside the conviction and the penalty imposed by the magistrate on 1 September 2015.

2769433,R v Turnbull (No. 18) [2016] NSWSC 792,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown is re-examining Mr Terrence Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage.
	
	
	A question has been asked of Mr Bailey which has drawn objection on behalf of the Accused. To place this objection in context, it is necessary to refer to some matters of history.
	
	
	Between 4 and 7 March 2014, a sentencing hearing took place before Sheahan J in the Land and Environment Court following a plea of guilty by the present Accused to a charge under s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003. The Accused pleaded guilty to that charge, but there was a contest as to the area of land affected by the unlawful conduct of the Accused.
	
	
	The hearing in March 2014 involved evidence from a range of persons, largely expert witnesses, on the question of the land which was affected. The prosecution contention was that it was in the order of 480 hectares, the defence contention was that it was in the order of 38.7 hectares.
	
	
	The Accused shot dead Mr Turner on 29 July 2014. At that time, Sheahan J had reserved judgment after the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	In due course, on 19 September 2014, Sheahan J made a number of findings as part of the decision on sentence: Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet v Turnbull [2014] NSWLEC 150. These findings involved an acceptance (at [110]) that the area of native vegetation unlawfully cleared within the net area of 460.5 hectares was 38.7 hectares.
	
	
	His Honour went on to make other findings. His Honour noted (at [126]) that Mr Spiers (a prosecution expert) had opined that, subject to an error factor of +/- 10%, 2,708 trees were removed on “Colorado” and 694 on “Strathdoon”, and that this was not disputed.
	
	
	His Honour found (at [129]) that “approximately a minimum of 3,000 trees were removed across the cleared areas, and many, especially in Polygon 1, were environmentally significant”.
	
	
	His Honour found (at [136]) that “the level of the environmental harm caused was substantial”.
	
	
	In cross-examination of Mr Arthur Snook (T300), senior counsel for the Accused elicited evidence that, although the prosecutor alleged an area of clearing of nearly 500 hectares, only 38 hectares had been cleared according to the finding of the Court, that being a reference to the finding of Sheahan J on 19 September 2014.
	
	
	In cross-examination of Mr Bailey, the same line of questioning was undertaken and it was put to Mr Bailey (T679.18) that:
	


“Q.    You know, don’t you, that ultimately the judge hearing the case found that only 38.7 hectares had been cleared in breach of the Act?”


	
	Mr Bailey commenced to answer that question by saying:
	


“A.    I've read the judgment and acknowledge that it was - there was a substantial environmental impact and that the judge..."". 


	
	The witness was stopped and taken back to the question he had been asked. The proposition was put to him (T679.30):
	


“Q.    What I asked you was whether or not you know that the judge found that the area of native vegetation unlawfully cleared was 38.7 hectares?"" 

“A.    When you add the area of the trees together, that was the judgment.""

Q.    That's what the Judge found? 

A.    In the context of the area of the trees, yes.""


	
	In re-examination, the Crown wishes to ask questions of Mr Bailey by reference to [110], [126], [129] and [136] of the judgment of Sheahan J, being the portions which I have mentioned earlier.
	
	
	The primary objection which is taken is that the questions which the Crown seeks to ask do not arise out of cross-examination. It is submitted for the Accused that there was a focused line of questioning which related only to the areas of hectares as alleged by the prosecutor and by the Accused, and as found by the Judge. It is submitted that that foundation does not provide a basis for the Crown to re-examine along the lines which have been foreshadowed.
	
	
	Reference was made as well to s.91 Evidence Act 1995, which bears upon the admissibility of findings of fact from earlier judgments of a Court. However, it is accepted by senior counsel for the Accused that, if I find that the line of questions which the Crown seeks to ask arises out of cross-examination, then the s.91 objection would not have continued force. The real question is whether the proposed questions arise out of cross-examination.
	
	
	I should mention, as well, that the Accused has raised character in this case and continues to raise character and to adduce character evidence. That bears, to a limited extent, upon the ruling which I am making.
	
	
	In my view, the raising of one finding made by Sheahan J on 19 September 2014, by way of a comparison and contrast between the two areas, does raise sufficiently the line of questions which the Crown seeks to ask in re-examination.
	
	
	This issue should not be looked at in an artificially restricted way. What Sheahan J found was not something related by a bare reference to the number of hectares. Other findings were made which were associated with that, including the number of trees and the matter which Mr Bailey has mentioned, that there was a substantial level of environmental harm.
	
	
	Having introduced a finding made in Sheahan J’s judgment (which had not been given at the time of the tragic events of 29 July 2014), I am satisfied that the door has been opened by the defence in a way that the Crown should be entitled to utilise in re-examination.
	
	
	That said, what is necessary is that any questions be asked in a manner which does not lead to the potential uncontrolled expression of opinion by Mr Bailey.
	
	
	I propose to allow the parts of [110], [126], [129] and [136] of Sheahan J's judgment to be utilised by the Crown in re-examination.
	
	
	It may be that the Crown can approach this by using a measure of leading to avoid any further expressions of opinion or comment from Mr Bailey. However, I leave that to counsel to consider in consultation with each other.
	
	
	My ruling is that these questions arise out of cross-examination and I will allow the Crown to re-examine in this way.

		20 June 2016",2016-05-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769442,Attorney General for the State of NSW v Steadman (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 606,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By amended summons filed on 6 May 2016, the Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales (the plaintiff) sought an extended supervision order (ESO) in respect of the defendant for a period of five years under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). Except where otherwise stated all references to legislative provisions in these reasons are to the Act.
	
	
	The plaintiff also sought, in the summons filed on 9 February 2016, an interim supervision order (ISO) against Robert Steadman (the defendant) pursuant to s 10B pending the final hearing of this matter and an order pursuant to s 7(4) appointing two psychiatrists to examine the defendant and report to the Court on the examinations.
	
	
	On 29 February 2016 I heard the plaintiff’s application for an ISO and for orders under s 7(4). On 3 March 2016 I made orders, including an ISO, and published reasons: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Steadman [2016] NSWSC 174. The ISO has since been renewed twice. It is due to expire on Sunday 29 May 2016. The conditions of the ISO were the same as those that applied to a previous ESO to which the defendant had been subject except that a condition was added authorising the defendant’s Departmental Supervising Officer (DSO) to tell the family of the defendant’s spouse (whom he married in October 2015) about his criminal history.
	
	
	At the hearing of the substantive application on 6 May 2016 Mr Denman, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, sought leave to amend the summons to seek an ESO for a period of five years, being the maximum period for which the Act provides (instead of for a period of three years as sought in the summons which was filed on 9 February 2016). Ms Mathur, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, did not oppose leave to amend the summons being granted.
	
	
	The defendant opposed the making of an ESO. In the alternative, he contended that, if an ESO was made, it ought not be for a period longer than three years.
	


Evidence


	
	The plaintiff relied on the following evidence:
	



	
	Affidavits of Valentino Musico sworn 9 February 2016 (including VM-1), 26 February 2016, 23 March 2016, 15 April 2016, 21 April 2016 and 4 May 2016;
	
	
	Affidavit of Azam Bulbulia affirmed 19 February 2016 (including AB-1);
	
	
	Affidavit of Angela Rybak sworn 9 April 2016;
	
	
	The reports of the experts appointed by the order under s 7(4) referred to above: report of Dr Matthew Jones dated 29 March 2016 and Dr Andrew Ellis dated 2 April 2016;
	
	
	The oral evidence of Cornelius Van Ryn (on 6 May 2015); and
	
	
	The oral evidence of Samuel Ardasinski (on 6 May 2015).
	



	
	Dr Jones attended Court to give evidence (under the mistaken apprehension that the defendant still required him for cross-examination) and remained in Court while Mr Van Ryn and Mr Ardasinski gave oral evidence. He gave some brief oral evidence to supplement his report in light of their oral evidence.
	
	
	Subject to one exception, Ms Mathur did not object to any of the plaintiff’s evidence, much of which comprised material that had been produced pursuant to orders under s 25 of the Act (referred to below) and was therefore admissible under s 25(3).
	
	
	The defendant adduced no evidence. It is not appropriate for me to draw any inference against the defendant by reason of his not giving evidence as the Act does not displace the privilege against exposure to a penalty, save for the obligation upon an offender to be examined by the two independent experts: New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280 at [11]-[119] per Beazley P and Macfarlan and Leeming JJA. The defendant did not call his present wife to give evidence. Mr Denman confirmed that the plaintiff did not ask me to draw any Jones v Dunkel inference (after Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298) that her evidence would not have assisted the defendant’s case.
	


The applicable law

The Act


	
	Section 3 of the Act provides:
	


“Objects of Act

(1)  The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2)  Another object of this Act is to encourage high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.”


	
	The legislative purpose of the Act is protective, not punitive. The protective purpose is fundamental: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [21]; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Quinn [2007] NSWSC 873 at [10]; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [10].
	
	
	Section 5B provides:
	


“High risk sex offender

(1)  An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2)  An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3)  The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	Section 5C confers power on this Court to make an ESO in respect of a high risk sex offender. Implicit in s 5C is that the supervision imposed by an ESO is sufficient to counter what would otherwise be an “unacceptable risk”. Supervision can only be regarded as “adequate” if it is effective to reduce the risk such that the offender no longer poses an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	Section 5I(1) provides that an application for a high risk sex offender ESO may be made only in respect of a supervised sex offender. A person who is under supervision (under an ESO) is, relevantly, a supervised sex offender: s 5I(2).
	
	
	Section 7 deals with pre-trial procedures and what is to occur following the preliminary hearing. It relevantly provides:
	


“(4) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must make orders:

(a) appointing:

(i) 2 qualified psychiatrists, or

(ii) 2 registered psychologists, or

(iii) 1 qualified psychiatrist and 1 registered psychologist, or

(iv) 2 qualified psychiatrists and 2 registered psychologists,

to conduct separate psychiatric or psychological examinations (as the case requires) of the offender and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and

(b) directing the offender to attend those examinations.

(5) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is not satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must dismiss the application.”


	
	Section 9 provides that the following are to be taken into account in determining whether to make an ESO (as well as any other matter I consider to be relevant):
	


(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

(g) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).


	
	Section 10 provides that an ESO can be made for a total of five years. Section 11 provides for the conditions that may be imposed on an ESO.
	
	
	These proceedings are civil proceedings and, to the extent to which the Act does not provide otherwise, are to be conducted in accordance with the law (including the rules of evidence) relating to civil proceedings: s 21.
	
	
	Section 25 provides that the plaintiff may, by written order, require the production of documents that relate to the behaviour, or physical or mental condition, of any offender. Any document produced in answer to an order is admissible in proceedings under this Act.
	


Background facts


	
	If the threshold test in s 5B is met, matters to be considered are listed in s 9. Before addressing these matters, I propose to set out a narrative derived from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff. As the matters the subject of the narrative touch on personal details of those associated with the defendant in a personal capacity, I will not use the real names of his partners, their children or associates in these reasons.
	
	
	To the extent to which the evidence at the ESO hearing on 6 May 2016 does not differ from that at the ISO hearing before me on 29 February 2016, I have replicated some of the narrative from my earlier judgment where it is relevant to the question whether to grant an ESO, and, if so, for what period.
	


Birth and offending while a minor


	
	The defendant was born in 1944. His criminal history began in 1953 with offences of stealing. The first conviction of present relevance was a conviction in 1958 (when he was 14) for indecent assault on a female aged six years. In 1960 he was committed to a psychiatric institution for treatment following a charge of indecent assault on an 11-year old female (when he was 16) which was replaced with a charge of common assault. Both of these offences constituted “serious sex offences” as defined by the Act.
	


First marriages and relationship history


	
	The defendant was married for the first time in the 1960’s and had three children. After about five years this marriage ended in divorce. He remarried in about 1980. His second wife died in 1991. At some time prior to March 1993 the defendant formed a de facto relationship with a woman, who had a daughter, AV1.
	
	
	In an electronically recorded interview AV1 said that in March 1993 she woke up one night in bed to discover that the defendant had his hands down the front of her underpants and was touching her on her vagina. According to AV1, he said: “If you let me touch you more I’ll give you a horse for your birthday.” She did not tell her mother what had happened until about June 1993. The defendant was charged in relation to the alleged conduct. At that time her mother was planning to marry the defendant. Subsequently, and notwithstanding the charge, AV1’s mother resumed her relationship with the defendant and they became engaged to be married again. The defendant was acquitted of the charge with respect to his alleged conduct in respect of AV1.
	
	
	During the school holidays in September 1993, V3, one of AV1’s friends, was staying overnight at AV1’s place. One evening the children had been watching television in the bedroom the defendant shared with AV1’s mother. AV1 had fallen asleep in the bed, woken up and moved to a bunk bed in another room, leaving V3, AV1’s mother and the defendant in the same bed. V3 woke up to find the defendant’s hand down her underpants and his middle finger in her vagina. V3 started screaming and hitting him, after which she went to the bunk bed where her friend, AV1, was sleeping.
	
	
	As a result of these events, the defendant was charged with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. This charge proceeded by way of indictment in the District Court in 1994. The defendant was convicted. He was sentenced by Armitage DCJ to a minimum term of two years with an additional term of eight months. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.
	
	
	The defendant was released to parole on 17 November 1996 on an 8-month parole order. Although he was generally compliant with reporting (according to a pre-sentence report prepared in 2011), he refused to engage in any “interventions” in the community and maintained his innocence.
	
	
	After his release from gaol the defendant formed a de facto relationship with a woman who, in 1998, became his third wife. The defendant’s third wife had two daughters: one, who was herself the mother of five daughters (including V4, V5 and V6); and a second, TC, who was disabled. The defendant’s third wife was not aware of the defendant’s previous offending.
	


The index offences


	
	At Easter 2007, the defendant and his third wife went to visit her grandchildren on the North Coast of New South Wales. They took TC with them. They stayed in a caravan at the rear of the house where the defendant’s third wife’s daughter lived with her family (including V4, V5 and V6).
	
	
	The transcripts of recorded interviews with V4, V5 and V6 were tendered. In addition to matters that concerned the index offences, the transcripts included the girls’ versions of other (uncharged) sexual acts alleged to have been perpetrated against them by the defendant as well as reference to alleged offending against other children during the same period. The conduct described by the victims and alleged victims (each of whom was a young girl to whom the defendant had access through family relationships) was largely opportunistic in the context of a family situation. For example, the defendant drove one of the victims to the tip to fossick for toys and asked her not to wear underpants. He assaulted her while they were there and took photographs of her vagina and asked her to take a photograph of his erect penis.
	
	
	According to V5’s statement, the defendant’s conduct affected several girls, as demonstrated by the following passage in the transcript:
	


“A   Um, that I know all the girls have been touched by him.

Q398   All your sisters?

A   Yes. But mum only knew there was only three of us but there was actually five, seven seats in the car. She couldn’t put all of us girls. And I know they’ve all been touched. And [V5’s youngest sister] real close to him ‘cause all [V5’s youngest sister] been saying, When I grow up I, ‘cause she’s in love with pop.

Q399   Yeah.

A   She says, When I grow up I want to sex poppy and marry him.

Q400   And how old’s [V5’s youngest sister]?

A   Only 5.”


	
	V5 also said in the interview:
	


“A 424   Um, um, well, well we’ve all been told not to tell about they’ve been touched. And he keeps on saying um, I won’t tell any, I won’t tell anyone things that you tell me which I haven’t told him anything.”


	
	The defendant was arrested on 11 July 2007 and remained in custody pending his trial.
	
	
	On 22 October 2008 the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an indictment in which the defendant was charged with the following counts:
	


“1.   Between 28 February, 2007 and 2 May 2007 at P2 in the State of New South Wales did assault V4 and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on V4 a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 9 years.

2.   Between 28 February, 2007 and 2 May 2007 at P2 in the State of New South Wales did assault V5 and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on V5 a child then under the age of 16 years, namely 10 years.

3.   Between 28 February, 2007 and 2 May 2007 at P2 in the State of New South Wales did assault V6 and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on V6 a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 9 years.”


	
	The defendant pleaded guilty to the three counts. The following extract is taken from the statement of facts:
	


“7. The incidents detailed below came to light as a result of the following sequence of events:

a.   During the holiday period V5 was looking at pictures on the offender’s computer and saw pictures of her younger sister V4 engaging in inappropriate activity with the offender.

b.   V5 then approached her sister V4 telling her what she had seen and V4 them [sic] complained to her of what the offender had been doing to her.

c.   A few days after the offender had left the children’s place, V5 and V4 then told their mother what had happened.

d.   V3 – 5M at first confronted the offender and her mother about the children’s allegations and the offender said that the children had made it up.

e.   DOCS were contacted by V3 – 5M and statements were then obtained by the Police.

Count One – S. 61M(2) Indecent assault of a person aged under 10

8. This alleged offence involves the complainant, V4 when she was aged 9. The offence involved the offender touching, or playing with, the vaginal area of the complainant with his hand or hands whilst on a trip to the P2 dump with the offender.

Count Two – s. 61M(1) – indecent assault of a person aged under 16 years

9. The complainant, V5 was ten years of age. The offender touched V5 on her vagina when she was sitting on a chair facing the offender’s computer whilst her parents were not present.

Count Three – S. 61M(2) Indecent assault of a person aged under 10

10. The offender had V6 then aged 9 years accompany him in his van to the P2 tip at which location he pushed her down so that she was lying on the seat. The offender then fondled her genital area.


	
	A further matter (possession of child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act) was included on the Form 1 in the following terms:
	


“Expert Police examined the seized hard drive and a number of images were retrieved, including a picture of the offender’s penis with a child’s hand on it.”


	
	An offender intake data form in respect of the defendant (which was filled in when he was admitted to Wellington Gaol in February 2009) recorded much of the relationship history set out above. On 23 February 2009 he underwent a Static-99 assessment (an instrument designed to help predict sexual and violent recidivism in sexual offenders) and scored 6, which placed him in the high risk category.
	
	
	In April 2009 the defendant was assessed by Professor Greenberg, a forensic psychiatrist, who prepared a report for the sentence hearing on 6 April 2009. Professor Greenberg opined that the defendant probably suffered from paedophilic disorder and that he would benefit from Custody-Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT).
	
	
	On 17 April 2009 Judge Williams imposed a sentence of five years and five months imprisonment with a total non-parole period of four years and two months, to date from 11 July 2007, being the date on which he was taken into custody.
	
	
	In the remarks on sentence, Williams DCJ said, of the defendant’s third wife:
	


“23. [The defendant’s] wife during a telephone interview stated, despite his plea of guilty, that he was not guilty of any offences against her grandchildren and if there was any inappropriate behaviour at all, it was the fault of her daughter and grandchildren. She stated that the children were overtly sexual in nature and often masturbated for attention. This attitude to the offending by [the defendant’s] wife is of serious [sic] to the service as his primary support within the community is from her and he has limited contact with other family members. Discussions with his family indicated [the defendant] has been less than forthcoming about the agreed facts in this matter.”


	
	The sentencing judge also said:
	


“32. What is of particular concern in the present case is firstly [the defendant’s] previous history of sex offending and secondly that on this occasion [the defendant] was apparently engaged in taking inappropriate photographs of the victims and keeping them on his computer, part of presumably some sort of plan to interfere with them. Apart from the question of general deterrence, individual deterrence would appear to be a significant and necessary component of any sentence imposed.

…

34. It is of concern that like so many such offenders, [the defendant] has been reluctant to accept responsibility as has indeed his wife, for his actions and to recognise and accept the need for intervention if he is not to offend again.”


	
	The defendant’s wife continued to support the defendant throughout most of his sentence. However, in about early 2011, TC told her mother that the defendant had been sexually abusing her for years, including before they were married. This led to their divorce on 10 May 2011. A probation and parole pre-release report dated 29 June 2011 said:
	


“His former wife advised this revelation was the turning point for her in her attitudes to [the defendant], making her see a pattern in his sexual offending and making her accept his guilt in the current offences against her grandchildren. Enquiries indicate the [defendant’s third wife’s] change of mindset has enabled her to reconcile with her son and daughter-in-law, who are the parents of his victim.”


	
	The report concluded:
	


“[The defendant] has a history of sexual offending against children. He is currently in custody for an offence against his former step daughter. Since being in custody his marriage has dissolved following further allegations of sexual offending against another female relative, the outcome of which is uncertain. He has no identifiable pro social supports in the community at this time and has no suitable post release accommodation. In addition to this [the defendant] maintains his innocence in relation to his sexual offending and is resistant to engaging in appropriate intervention for his offence, most particularly the CUBIT program. Without appropriate post release accommodation and his failure to acknowledge or address his offending, [the defendant] poses a risk to the community if released at this time. Therefore, his release to Parole is at this time not recommended.”

The first application for an ESO


	
	On 21 June 2011 a risk assessment report was prepared for the purpose of determining whether an application for an ESO ought be made under the Act, as the defendant’s sentence was due to expire on 10 December 2012. The assessment was conducted by Patrick Sheehan (senior specialist psychologist) and Danielle Matsuo (Acting Director Sex and Violent Offender Programs). The defendant was assessed as remaining in the moderate-high risk category of sexual offending relative to other male sexual offenders.
	
	
	On 10 September 2012 the defendant was released from custody on parole. At first, he resided in a Community Offender Support Program (COSP) facility. On 19 September 2012 he was registered under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (NSW) (the 2000 Act). As such he is a registrable person within the meaning of the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 (NSW) (the 2004 Act).
	
	
	On 22 November 2012 the defendant was charged with failing to comply with his reporting conditions under the 2000 Act as he had a mobile phone with internet access which he had not disclosed to police. He explained that he thought that he was complying with the relevant reporting condition when he told police that he had a new phone. There was no allegation that he had in fact used the Internet for illicit purposes.
	
	
	In 2012, prior to the defendant’s release, orders were obtained from this Court, appointing Drs Allnutt and Roberts to examine the defendant and report to Court. Both experts considered him to pose a high risk of sex offending. Dr Robert’s expressed his opinion in the following summary:
	


“In my opinion, of those people who fall into the category of people being at moderate to high risk of engaging in future offences of a sexual nature, Mr Steadman would be considered to be at the higher end of that range. Individual factors which may be amenable to change through therapy or behavioural modification are less likely to prove amenable to change in Mr Steadman’s case. Having regard for the fact that he is either insightless, in psychological denial or dishonest with respect to his offending behaviour, he is unlikely to perceive benefit in restrictions placed upon him with the aim to moderate risk and he is not expected to avail himself of therapeutic opportunities aimed at moderating risk. His level of risk is therefore not expected to diminish in the way that might be expected in an offender who has acknowledged his propensity to aberrant behaviour and sees logic in restrictions placed on movement or contact and would seek to participate in therapy aimed at mitigating future risk.”


	
	Dr Roberts opined that an ESO of the maximum duration was called for. He noted that the defendant had not availed himself of any therapy and was “insightless”. Dr Roberts also observed of the defendant that:
	


“He has a propensity to abrogate responsibility for his behaviour and consistently assert that the allegations against him have been unfounded.”


	
	The plaintiff’s first application for an ESO against the defendant was made in 2013 and was granted by Button J who made an ESO against him which commenced on 7 March 2013 for a term of three years: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Steadman [2013] NSWSC 170. In those proceedings the defendant did not oppose the making of an ESO for that duration; the plaintiff contended that it should be for the maximum duration of five years. His Honour was satisfied that the defendant had a “chronic tendency to commit sexual offences against female children that has existed for well over 50 years” ([68]). His Honour also said, at [72]:
	


“I consider that there is certainly a risk to the community that the defendant may inveigle himself into sustained contact with children, either directly or (perhaps more likely) indirectly by way of, for example, a relationship of friendship or affection with an older person with grandchildren, and take the opportunity to commit serious sexual offences against them.”

The conditions of the first ESO


	
	Of present relevance the first ESO contained the following conditions:
	


“[6]   The defendant must notify the Departmental Supervising Officer of any change to the schedule at least 24 hours in advance, unless a shorter period is approved by the Departmental Supervising Officer.

. . .

[19]   Should the defendant enter into a relationship with another person (“the other person”), involving sexual or intimate contact, he must notify the Departmental supervising officer at the earliest opportunity. The Departmental supervising officer may disclose the defendant’s offence history to the other person if the officer is satisfied that to do so is necessary or desirable in the interests of the safety of the other person or any child of or related to that person, or who from time to time be in that person’s care, custody or control.”


	
	Condition 22 provided that the defendant was not to approach or have contact with a child under the age of 16 years, or attend certain nominated locations such as schools, playgrounds and day-care centres, unless he has prior written permission of the Department and is in the presence of an “appropriate adult”, being a person previously approved in writing by the Department for the purposes of the condition.
	


The defendant’s conduct during the period of the first ESO from March 2013 to present


	
	From at least 21 April 2013, the defendant began to complain about the anklet he was required to wear as a condition of the ESO (to provide continuous monitoring of his whereabouts). He said that it was not working for various reasons. The case notes (sometimes referred to as OIMS – Offender Integrated Management System – notes) prepared by Community Corrections officers (and produced to the plaintiff pursuant to an order under s 25(1)) are redolent with issues concerning the anklet, its charging and its operation. Such complaints have been a consistent theme and have been characterised as “diversionary tactics”, in that they are raised to thwart attempts by therapists to engage in a deeper discussion about the reasons for his offending behaviour and his proclivities. The complaints continue, as the most recent OIMS notes record.
	
	
	On 23 April 2013 the defendant attended his first appointment at Forensic Psychology Services (FPS), as required by a condition of his ESO. His psychologist was Craig Baird. From the outset, the defendant persistently maintained that he had been falsely accused and wrongly convicted. From that time onwards he gave elaborate explanations as to how and why he had been wronged.
	
	
	On 20 May 2013, in the Waverley Local Court, the defendant was acquitted of the charge of failing to comply with reporting conditions (arising from the charge in November 2012 referred to above).
	
	
	In a counselling session on 24 May 2013, the defendant raised that he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of assistance he provided for the Granville train disaster as a reason for his aversion to attending appointments in the city or travelling by train in any circumstances. At several consultations it became the main topic of discussion. On 22 July 2013 Mr Baird recorded that, although the defendant asserted that he had been diagnosed with PTSD, an earlier report had noted that there was no official documentation to that effect. It was decided that he ought be referred to another psychologist with a view to determining the existence (or otherwise) of PTSD and appropriate treatment.
	
	
	In August 2013 the defendant moved out of the COSP facility to a private address in Rossmore. On 20 August 2013 the Community Corrections officers conducted an unscheduled home visit at the defendant’s new residence. There was discussion about the defendant’s inadequate response to therapy. The following was also noted:
	


“- The offender then spoke about how the only reason he even went to custody was because the Police offered him a really good deal to reduce the sentence from 15 years to 2 years in goal [sic] but only gave him 10 minutes to decide. The offender now believes they only did this because they did not have a case against him and if he had better legal advise [sic] he would have handled things differently.

- The offender went on at length to discuss the issues with legal aid in his case, the Police and Prosecution, the strength of the witnesses and Corrective Services. The offender appears to blame everybody around him for his circumstances and holds no accountability for his own actions and decision making.”


	
	When Community Corrections officers visited the defendant at home they noticed that, in relatively close proximity to the granny flat where the defendant lived, there was a pool which was used by children (a fact which he did not disclose to the officers). Indeed, the pool was about 20ms from the vegetable patch which the defendant looked after. This led to the placement of an electronic monitoring boundary and a written direction (given on 13 October 2013) that he not associate with the neighbours.
	
	
	On 13 October 2013 the defendant was interviewed at his home by a Community Corrections officer. The note about the portion of the interview which related to the defendant’s offending history read:
	


“During the interview the offender made a reference to his offending and indicated that he was innocent of all charges. The offender was asked if he denies that he has ever committed a sexual offence against a child. The offender replied with “I have never done anything against a child that would be considered illegal” adding “all I ever done was to bathe his children and grandchildren, something that his wife also done so why is she not in this situation”. For clarity the offender was asked the same question, has [sic] ever committed a sexual offence against a child he replied ‘No’”


	
	In October 2013 the defendant’s landlord, Tony (not his real name), approached him to renovate a nearby property in return for reduced rent. The two became friends.
	
	
	On 9 December 2013 Mr Baird noted that the defendant continued to be “fundamentally opposed to openly engage in treatment”. At the conclusion of the consultation, Mr Baird told the defendant that he would not continue working with him if he did not focus on the treatment.
	
	
	On 16 December 2013 the Community Corrections officers visited the defendant and met Tony. After Tony left, the defendant confirmed that he had not told him that he was subject to an ESO. The defendant told Community Corrections officers that he could not recall if Tony had any grandchildren. However, the officers later learned (in about February 2014) that Tony not only had three grandchildren but they lived with their father next door to the defendant’s residence. On 16 December 2013 the defendant told the officers that he would “go to the grave” claiming his innocence. He blamed the “poor legal aid team and two bad barristers for the fact that he was found guilty”.
	
	
	On 10 January 2014 Mr Baird noted, in the clinical notes of his consultations with the defendant:
	


“Bob wished to stress the point that he has only been accused of sexual offending by close family members and as a consequence of this can’t understand why I’m asking him to develop a self-management plan as he has no contact with close family members anymore. I reminded Bob that one accusation was made by a stranger during a break and enter. Bob acknowledged this but added that he was only 14-15 years old at the time, adding that all his “adult” accusations have been made by family members.”


	
	By February 2014, the friendship between the defendant and his landlord had developed to the point where Tony, who was unaware of either the defendant’s history or the ESO, invited the defendant to his home. On at least some of those occasions, Tony’s grandchildren were present. The Community Corrective officers told the defendant that he must either disclose his history and ESO to Tony, or move house. Eventually, on 7 February 2014, the defendant was given a written direction to disclose to Tony that he was subject to an ESO. On 9 February 2014 the defendant informed Tony of this matter. The Community Corrections officer spoke with Tony directly to make sure that he understood the potential risks to his grandchildren. When the officer spoke with Tony on 13 February 2014, he told them that he did not have the “heart to evict [the defendant]”, in part because Tony was grateful for the renovations the defendant had performed on his properties, including the one to which the defendant was about to move.
	
	
	On 24 February 2014 Mr Baird noted that:
	


“[The defendant] expressed the concern that I was dragging out the sessions until he finally confessed responsibility for his sexual convictions. He reiterated his plan for reducing future accusations which is 1) never help anyone again, and 2) don’t socialise.”


	
	I accept that the note should not be read as indicating that the defendant actually confessed responsibility for his sexual convictions; he has never done so (except to the limited extent indicated by his pleas of guilty) and continues to maintain his innocence.
	
	
	In late February 2014 the defendant began seeing Raymond Hudd, psychologist, in lieu of Mr Baird, for the purposes of obtaining treatment for PTSD. At about this time the defendant moved to the property in Austral which he had been renovating for Tony. The defendant constructed an aviary on the property in which he housed several birds, including chickens.
	
	
	As is revealed by the clinical notes, the sessions with Mr Hudd were not productive. Indeed, in March 2014, Mr Hudd told Community Corrections that the defendant was the “most difficult sex offender he has been required to deal with”.
	
	
	In April 2014 a Community Corrections officer made an unscheduled visit to the defendant’s home. In the course of the discussion about treatment, the defendant’s attitude to his offending was raised. The officer made the following note:
	


“The offender became confrontational talking over and swearing at the author. The offender stated again and again that “you will never get me to say I did it” (meaning the sex offending), the offender was reminded that he did as he plead [sic] guilty (index offence) the offender stated something along the lines of he took a deal he did not plead guilty.”


	
	In early September 2014 a Community Corrections Officer suggested that the defendant might socialise at a club, either the local bingo club or a bird breeders club. He mentioned that he used to sing for the elderly in their retirement homes and he would consider this.
	
	
	On 7 October 2014, following discussions between Corrective Services and FPS, approval was given for the defendant to join a local bowling club. According to Kay (not her real name), she and the defendant met in October 2014 at Karaoke in Wallacia. Kay looked after four of her grandchildren on a regular and extended basis, including two girls under ten years of age. Three of the grandchildren whom Kay looked after were the children of her son Bill (not his real name), who worked full-time and needed his mother’s assistance to look after his children, including before and after school, as his own marriage had ended.
	
	
	On 13 October 2014, Mr Hudd contacted Mr Baird to inform him that the sessions with the defendant had ended and that he did not consider there to be any benefit in any future sessions. The note recorded:
	


“He [Mr Hudd] stated that he believes the offender may be suffering from PTSD however he had not been able to administer any formal testing as the offender will not divulge any information about this childhood or the offence. He stated the offender is very suspicious and often goes on a rant and tangents.

He stated that he has attempted to administer formal PTSD testing however the offender has not completed testing and will not complete the tests.”


	
	The defendant and Kay soon became good friends and a relationship between them developed around Christmas 2014. Notwithstanding the terms of condition 19 of the first ESO, the defendant did not disclose this relationship to Community Corrections.
	
	
	On 2 January 2015 the defendant made an unscheduled deviation to Kay’s residence, which then became the subject of an exclusion zone.
	
	
	On 23 and 30 January 2015 the defendant deviated from his scheduled movements by visiting Kay’s home.
	
	
	On 1 February 2015 the defendant was seen affectionately kissing a woman, who was later identified as Kay. She waited in the defendant’s car while he went to Aldi. He subsequently drove her to her home (a movement which was not included in his schedule of movements) and then returned to his own residence. The Community Corrections officers followed him home and noted women’s shoes under the bed in the spare room and a pink dressing gown.
	
	
	On 2 February 2015 a Community Corrections officer visited the defendant at home. The officer noticed cigarette butts in an ashtray, which aroused his suspicions as he knew that the defendant did not smoke. He asked the defendant about a deviation to his scheduled movements on the previous day. He said that he had visited a friend whom he had met at karaoke and that she was a “friend”. He gave her first name but refused to provide her last name. He admitted that she had come to his home but said that she had come with a number of friends from karaoke. The defendant was reminded of the terms of condition [19] of the ESO, to which he responded that he and this woman were “just friends”.
	
	
	On 2 February 2015 the defendant was given a written warning about the deviations from his scheduled movements on 23 January, 30 January and 1 February 2015. It was noted that he was detected at Kay’s address.
	
	
	In February and March 2015 the defendant and Kay were sighted together regularly. For example, he was seen with her in the centre of the Trash and Treasure Markets at Camden Valley Way. Kay was seated in a wheelchair with her foot bandaged and the defendant was pushing her around. Although the defendant was regularly questioned by Community Corrections officers about this relationship he maintained that they were just friends with common interests. The defendant did not, at that stage, mention Kay’s grandchildren.
	
	
	On 8 March 2015 the defendant was asked why he had left his property earlier that day without notifying the electronic monitoring unit. He said that he had had friends to stay for the weekend and they had gone to the markets that morning and he had to take them home. He told Community Corrections that he knew that it was the wrong thing to do but he “felt he had no choice as the friend does not know that he is monitored”. On 9 March 2015 he was issued with a final written warning regarding the deviation from his schedule.
	
	
	On 13 March 2015 Community Corrections officers visited the defendant at home. Kay was sitting on the front porch, smoking. The defendant told the officers, who observed a walking frame, that Kay had Parkinson’s and diabetes. The defendant continued to deny the relationship. He informed the officers that, although he had not yet told Kay about the ESO, he would do so.
	
	
	On 21 March 2015 Community Corrections officers spoke to the defendant who was again seen with Kay. The defendant told the officers that Kay did not even know that he had been in custody. He also reported that she had many problems and that he really only saw her on the weekend as she minded her grandchildren during the week. He denied that he had visited her place. The notes recorded:
	


“He continued to talk about how hard done by he was and had been due for a review and was perhaps going to let her know after that. He stated that he was thinking that he may have electronic monitoring reduced/ anklet off and author asked if perhaps he thought he would never have to tell. He did not reply. Concluded the lengthy discussion with informing the offender that perhaps it is time to inform his friend. Offender was not very happy.”


	
	On 24 March 2015 the defendant told the Community Corrections officers that he had told Kay that he was on an ESO and that “she understands about his circumstances”. On 29 March 2015 the Community Corrections officers spoke with Kay. The notes record that “she did not have any issue and would continue to support the offender” and “she is aware offender is not to have any contact with children unless supervised”. She asked them whether the defendant could come to her place as she “has some health issues and may require the assistance of the offender”.
	
	
	In April 2015 it was mooted that the defendant be permitted to attend Kay’s residence; however, this proposal was not approved by the Community Corrections manager on the basis that Kay’s son, Bill, was unaware of the defendant’s circumstances (prior convictions and ESO) and there was a possibility that Bill’s children (Kay’s grandchildren) would be there. However, approval was given for him to spend the weekend at her place. The defendant was given a written direction dated 8 April 2015 that he was not to approach or have contact with a child under the age of 16 years, or attend certain nominated locations such as playgrounds, day-care centres, unless he had prior written permission of the Department and was in the presence of an “appropriate adult” being a person previously approved in writing by the Department for the purposes of the condition.
	
	
	On 26 April 2015 Community Corrections officers encountered the defendant in Casula Mall. He was pushing Kay in a wheelchair. Kay explained that she needed to be pushed in a wheelchair because her left leg was in constant pain.
	
	
	On 5 May 2015 Kay spoke to Community Corrections officers and expressed a wish that the defendant be permitted to attend her home on her birthday and mother’s day. Both visits were approved. The notes record:
	


“-    [Kay] spoke of her knowledge of the offender’s past and claimed that she is like a mother to the children as the biological mother has left due to relationship issues.

[Kay] assured manager and writer that she would not let anything happen to the children. [Kay] spoke of how the granddaughter never leaves her side and the two boys are always with the father [Bill]. They are also at school during the weekdays.

ESO manager raised the issue that the father of the children [Bill] is currently unaware of [the defendant’s] past offending and hence approval cannot be given for the offender to visit [Kay’s] house at any time. Visitation to [Kay’s] house must be prior approved to which both [Kay] and [the defendant] stated they understood.”


	
	In May 2015 the requirement that the defendant submit schedules of his movements to the Community Corrections was lifted (and remained lifted until it was reinstated in May 2016 as a result of breach of a formal written direction: see further below). On 24 May 2015 Community Corrections officers made an unscheduled visit to the defendant’s home. They found him in Kay’s company and were told that she had just been diagnosed with cancer. The couple informed the officers that they intended to marry in a few months. On 26 May 2015 the defendant was given a written direction in similar terms to the earlier one that he not associate with children except with prior Departmental consent and in the presence of an “appropriate adult”. He was also directed that he was permitted only to attend Kay’s residence in order to pick her up and drop her off as required but that he was not to stay there.
	
	
	On 1 June 2015 the defendant confirmed that he had not yet told Kay’s son about the ESO.
	
	
	On 7 June 2015 Kay told Community Corrections officers that she was having difficulty performing household chores as Bill had been away and the defendant was helping her with these. When Community Corrections officers visited the defendant at home on 21 June 2015, Kay told them that they had set a wedding date of 2 October 2015 and that they were “just looking for the right time” to tell her son of the defendant’s antecedents and his ESO. On 5 July 2015 Community Corrections officers encountered the defendant and Kay at Casula Mall. She told them that her granddaughter was doing a “child protection awareness course” at school and Kay “spoke of the benefits of this”.
	
	
	On 15 July 2015 the defendant told Community Corrections officers that they were no closer to telling Kay’s son, Bill, due to his “personal issues”. A summary Community Corrections note dated 25 July 2015 recorded:
	


“Noted that Robert’s relationship with [Kay] is serious and the two are considering getting married later this year. Given that she has young grand children living with her, this is concerning regarding access. It would appear that [Kay’s] son (father of the children) is still unaware of [the defendant’s] offending history and thus he [the defendant] cannot be at the home when the children are there. This needs to be closely monitored to ensure that he is not trying to linger around the home to have access to the children. Ongoing contact with his partner is to continue to gauge his behaviour. Noted that she is currently unwell and he must understand that he cannot go to her home whenever he feels she requires his assistance. Noted completion report prepared. Continue as outlined.”


	
	An ESO Completion report dated 24 July 2015 was prepared by Kevin Makar, a Senior Community Corrections Officer. He recommended that a further ESO be sought. He concluded:
	


“Mr STEADMAN remains an untreated sex offender whom has continued to deny his offences, has consistently failed to engage in any sex offender treatment, continues to minimises or deny responsibility for his offending and has limited insight into his risk factors for future offending.

Community Corrections holds concerns around his impending marriage and the fact Mr STEADMMAN has still not made the disclosure to his partner’s son. This poses an unacceptable risk of re-offending and places the children at high risk should Mr STEADMAN be allowed unmonitored access to the children. Further concerns are held regarding his partner’s health and the possibility of Mr STEADMAN returning to isolation should she decease.”


	
	The case note for 26 July 2015 recorded in part:
	


“Continues to deny his offence and claims he only pled [sic] guilty as he believed he would have been released as time served. He has made mention on several occasions that he believed legal aid was the cause of his incarceration.

- Programs and services

His response to programs has been poor and he has not attended or completed FPS or CUBIT whilst in gaol. He claimed PTSD after being involved in the Granville train disaster however nil records of him being involved exist. He has attended private psychology (PTSD) however this ceased due to psychologist stating noting [sic] more could be done with the offender due to his negative attitude towards intervention. During his time in custody and in the community he has maintained his innocence.”


	
	Mr Van Ryn became the defendant’s DSO at the end of July 2015. His case note for 30 July 2015 recorded that the defendant needed to travel to the Family Court in Armidale in August 2015 for the purposes of a property settlement with his ex-wife (his third wife) and that he also proposed to travel to Scone. The defendant returned home on 6 August 2015. His DSO was informed that he was to be married on 3 October 2015.
	
	
	On 30 August 2015 the defendant was informed that the plaintiff was intending to apply for a further ESO when his current ESO expires. He was told that the reasons for the application included: his continued denial of the offence; his refusal to engage in counselling; and the concern about his relationship with a woman who had young grandchildren in her care and whose son (Bill, the children’s father) was unaware of either the defendant’s offences or the ESO.
	
	
	On 3 October 2015 the defendant and Kay married.
	
	
	On 6 October 2015 a risk assessment report on the defendant was prepared by Mr Ardasinski and Ms Matsuo, forensic psychologists. They identified the following risk factors: sexual deviance; denial and resultant problems with self-awareness and insight; refusal to participate in treatment; social isolation; and being in a relationship which may give the defendant access to female children. They concluded:
	


“CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Mr Steadman is a 71-year old man whose risk of sexual reoffending is estimated to be in the Moderate-High risk category relative to other men who have offended sexually. It was further determined that, in certain high-risk situations, Mr Steadman’s risk of future sexual violence would increase and that he may pose a significant sexual violence risk if left unattended with female children. It is understood that Mr Steadman has entered into a new intimate relationship, and that there is an 8-year old female grandchild living in the same house as his fiancée, along with her adult son and two male children. While under supervision during the course of his Order, Mr Steadman has a condition that he never be left alone in his fiancée’s home, and that he is always in the company of his fiancée whilst visiting that residence on weekends. This is because the children’s father is, to date, unaware of Mr Steadman’s offence history and therefore the potential risk he poses.”


	
	As referred to above, the case notes prepared by Community Corrections officers contain many references to the defendant’s complaints about the anklet and, in particular, the need to charge it and difficulties with charging. A note dated 14 October 2015 recorded:
	


“-    It would appear that this habitual complaining of the electronic equipment may be a tactic that the offender uses to steer the conversation away from the issues that need to be monitored.

The offender was asked about the health of his partner and reported that further tests have been conducted such as an MRI and it would appear that she does not have bone cancer. He further reported that she has been busy looking after her three grandchildren as her son continues to work long hours with his employment.”


	
	A further risk management report dated 20 October 2015 was prepared by Mr Van Ryn, who noted that, as at the date of the report, Kay did not believe that the defendant was guilty of any offences and shared his view that he was wrongly accused. He described their living arrangements: they live separately during the week, while she has care of the grandchildren (before and after school) but live together on the weekend. At that stage they had not disclosed either his history or the ESO to her family. He noted:
	


“The offender’s partner has stated that she will not leave her grandchildren in the company of the offender without another adult being present however this assertion must be balanced against the fact that she also supports Mr Steadman in his belief that he was wrongly accused of child sex offences and that he is innocent.”


	
	When addressing the risk of future offending, Mr Van Ryn noted that:
	


“Mr Steadman’s wife’s refusal to divulge the offender’s criminal history and current situation to the parents of her grandchildren raise significant concerns that even when in company of other adults, these adults would not be able to adequately assess risks and take preventative action as required.”


	
	On 24 October 2015 Mr Van Ryn conducted an unscheduled home visit to the defendant. Kay was also there. Mr Van Ryn raised with the defendant that the electronic monitoring revealed that he had spent more than an hour at Kay’s residence on several occasions notwithstanding that permission extended only to dropping her off and collecting her. The defendant said that such quick intervals would tend to raise the suspicions of Kay’s son, who lived at the house. Mr Van Ryn noted:
	


“Mr Steadman was informed that this decision will not be reviewed until [Kay’s son] has been informed of his offences so that he can make an informed decision as to who has access to his children. Both the offender and [Kay] were displeased with this direction, however stated that they would comply

[Kay] asked whether she was considered to be a responsible adult and was informed since her talk with the psychologist attached to the ESO team that there were questions in regards to whether she would be objective about the risk posed by the offender. [Kay] stated that she thinks that there has been a misunderstanding and that she believes her partner accepts the charges however believes in second chances.

The offender continued to protest his innocence. . .”


	
	On 26 October 2015 Community Corrections received a call from the Department of Community Services (DOCS) in which DOCS expressed its concern about the defendant’s attending Kay’s residence at all and wanted him to be directed not to attend. Community Corrections directed the defendant not to attend Kay’s residence. The case note recorded that the defendant became very upset and accused the officer of denying him his right to see his wife. He was told that he was not permitted to see her at home or when she was around her grandchildren and that the reason for this was that he and his wife refused to inform the parents of the children of his offending history. The defendant became angry and ended the phone call.
	
	
	On 29 October 2015 Community Corrections decided to allow the defendant to attend Kay’s house for a few minutes to pick her up and drop her off. It was noted that the defendant had signed up with the Mt Pritchard Community Club and that there was a children’s gym and a swimming pool on the premises.
	
	
	On 5 November 2015 the defendant told Community Corrections that he intended to tell Kay’s son about his offending history and the ESO that day but he wanted permission to have the discussion at her house. Permission was refused. Before the disclosure to Bill occurred, Department of Family and Community Services (FACS) (the successor to DOCS) independently contacted Bill and told him that the defendant was a person of interest to them because of his long history of harming young children. Bill told FACS that he was unaware of the history and that now that he knew he would not allow the defendant to have any contact with his children. Bill also said that he would ask his mother (Kay) about her knowledge of her new husband’s (the defendant’s) offences.
	
	
	Bill told his former partner (the mother of the children) about the defendant’s offending. She then told Bill’s brother, who went straight to Kay’s house and told her to divorce the defendant straight away or he would have nothing more to do with her. Kay chose to continue her relationship with the defendant; as a consequence, she became estranged from one of her sons (Bill’s brother).
	
	
	A Community Corrections case note dated 22 November 2015 said:
	


“It appears that he has groomed his new partner to believe that he is innocent of his most recent crimes and he has not divulged his paedophilia behaviours and offences throughout his life to her. It appears his recent behaviours are similar to previous relationships where he has accessed and offended against his partner’s children and grandchildren.”


	
	A Community Corrections case note dated 25 November 2015 recorded that the defendant blamed Community Corrections for the delayed disclosure to Bill because they would not permit it to occur at Kay’s house. When the defendant was reminded that the need for such a disclosure had been raised five months previously, he blamed Kay and said that she wanted to defer disclosure because her son was already under too much stress from work.
	
	
	The defendant sought approval to attend Kay’s house on Christmas Day. Bill confirmed that he would ensure that his children were not left in the defendant’s company at any time during the day. The defendant was granted permission to attend from 10am to 2pm and was directed not to have any physical contact with the children.
	
	
	The defendant and Kay wanted to travel to western New South Wales in early 2016 and stay in caravan parks along the route. Permission for him to go was refused on the grounds that Kay had not been approved as a “responsible adult supervisor” for the purpose of supervision around children.
	
	
	On 17 February 2016 Mr Van Ryn interviewed Kay at her home for the purposes of risk assessment. She was asked to describe her health problems, which she confirmed did not presently require hospital admission. She said that she did not take naps during the day. When asked what her attitude was to the defendant’s offending behaviour she said (according to the OIMS note):
	


“[Kay] stated that she believed [the defendant] was guilty. She is aware that Robert has been convicted of child relates [sic] offences on more one [sic] occasion. Has found information of past offences on google. When probed further [Kay] stated that she knew [the defendant] had been convicted of raping children (intercourse) and that he had touched children inappropriately. [Kay] Further [sic] stated that she would kill [the defendant] if he did anything to her kids (meaning her grandchildren).”


	
	Kay also informed Mr Van Ryn that Bill will be moving with his fiancée to Newcastle in December 2016 and that she intended to move in with the defendant when that happened. She said that the defendant wanted to move to Gilgandra but that she wanted to stay in the local area near her doctors and the hospital.
	
	
	Mr Van Ryn also interviewed Bill on the same occasion as he was home at the time. When asked about the defendant’s criminal history Bill said:
	


“Overall it’s bloody disgusting you can look it up on google there are over 20 offences, it fills an A4 page. [Bill] says that he believes [the defendant] is guilty and that he would never level [sic, let] him alone with his children at any time.”


	
	On 25 February 2016 Mr Van Ryn conducted a home visit. He asked the defendant similar questions to those he had asked Kay on 17 February 2015. When asked to describe Kay’s health problems he said that she had diabetes, bad knees and curvature of the spine which causes breathing problems. He said she has a nebuliser and most days needs to sit down and rest.
	
	
	On 3 March 2016 the case notes record that Kay was assessed as a “responsible adult supervisor” if the defendant comes into contact with children. Ms Gilmour (the Community Corrections staff member) noted that both Kay and Bill have stipulated that the defendant is not allowed at Kay’s home when the children are present unless Bill is also there. The effect of this was to remove Kay’s house as an “exclusion zone”.
	
	
	On 6 March 2016 a Community Corrections meeting took place, at which Mr Van Ryn was present. The conditions of the ISO were discussed, including whether electronic monitoring was still required. It was decided that the curfew (that the defendant be at his home between 9pm and 6.30am) would be removed but that electronic monitoring would continue so that the defendant’s attendance at the home where Kay, Bill and his children reside could be monitored. The defendant was also permitted to be at Kay’s house from 9.30am until 2.30pm when Bill’s two younger children were at school.
	
	
	The case notes record that on 18 March 2016 Mr Van Ryn spoke with Bill who said that he did not mind the defendant being at his home as long as the children were not present. Bill said that he usually arrived home between 3.30 and 4pm on Fridays and would remain at home on Monday mornings until the defendant returned Kay to her home.
	
	
	On 20 March 2016 Mr Van Ryn observed the defendant and Kay at Casula Mall. She was in a wheelchair. Mr Van Ryn visited the defendant and Kay at his home on 25 March 2016 (Good Friday). The defendant told him that he would be attending Kay’s home at about lunch time on Sunday to give Kay’s grandchildren their Easter eggs. Mr Van Ryn noted that enquiries were to be made with Bill about this activity.
	
	
	On 27 March 2016 (Easter Day), Ms Roberts, a Community Corrections staff member recorded that she rang the defendant when he was detected at Kay’s home (where he was not permitted to be on the weekend). The defendant informed her that it had been organised with Mr Van Ryn previously and that, in any event, neither Bill nor his children were present at the time of the visit. Mr Van Ryn’s evidence, which I accept, was that the defendant had told him that he wanted to go to Kay’s home on the Easter Sunday but had not nominated the time of such a visit before Mr Van Ryn went on leave for Easter. Mr Van Ryn told the defendant that he would have to provide advance notice of his proposed visit to the Community Corrections office or to the electronic monitoring room. There is no record in the case notes of the defendant’s having notified Community Corrections or the electronic monitoring room of his proposed visit (which is why Ms Roberts rang him when his presence was detected at Kay’s home).
	
	
	On 7 April 2016, Mr Ardasinski prepared a further risk assessment report (supplementary to the report dated 6 October 2015 referred to above) with respect to the defendant. The content of the report was supported by Ms Cieplucha, Acting Chief Psychologist in the Serious Offenders Assessment Unit. Mr Ardasinski specifically addressed the fact that both Kay and Bill had been assessed as “responsible adult supervisors” for the defendant and considered whether this matter would materially affect the risk he had previously been assessed as posing.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski was also asked to provide his opinion regarding the risks posed by the defendant to persons other than Kay’s grandchildren. His view was that Kay’s grandchildren may well be protected by her knowledge and that of their father, Bill (subject to the rider expressed in the quotation set out below) but that it was not known whether other children would be subject to the same protection. Moreover Mr Ardasinski pointed to the circumstance that the defendant’s relationship with Kay may not endure in any event. If it were to end, this would leave open the potential for the defendant to “commence a new relationship with similar characteristics to his current marriage”, which I take to mean that he might form another relationship with a woman who has caring responsibilities for young girls of a similar age to those to whom the defendant has, in the past, been sexually attracted (pre-pubescent).
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski also made the point (as to supervision by Kay and Bill):
	


“A person as a protective factor is only reliable while that person is present, available and vigilant.”


	
	On 13 April 2016 Mr Van Ryn interviewed Mrs Steadman, the defendant’s third (now ex-) wife. Ms Mathur objected to the tender of this case note. I allowed it to be tendered by reason of s 25(3) of the Act, which makes it admissible. I do not, however, subject to a single exception referred to below, regard it as being of sufficient weight to take it into account in deciding any of the issues in the present case. The chronology and Mrs Steadman’s change in attitude towards the defendant and his guilt of prior offending is, in any event, set out above and is derived from other evidence to which the defendant has taken no objection. The single exception referred to above is that Mrs Steadman confirmed in the interview that she was in good health at the time of the offences. Mr Denman said that, because the plaintiff is a model litigant, it was important that this fact be noted, since it goes (in the defendant’s favour) against the proposition that he selects vulnerable woman (with grandchildren or young children) with some physical impairment, since Mrs Steadman’s health was not compromised at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The case notes record that the defendant proposed to take a trip to country areas, including Wellington, Gilgandra and Coonamble for a period from 19 April 2016 to 26 April 2016. The case notes record the concern of Community Corrections about children who might be in caravan parks on the route where the defendant and Kay might choose to stay the night.
	
	
	On 14 April 2016 the defendant and Kay attended the Community Corrections office. During the course of their attendance Kay expressed her reluctance to go on a trip because of her poor health and her need to attend medical appointments. She informed Community Corrections that her health had deteriorated and that she was unable to stand for long periods of time. An officer noted that she had difficulty moving from her wheelchair to an office chair.
	
	
	Following this discussion, the defendant was issued with formal written directions, which included a direction that he was permitted to attend Kay’s home between 9.30am and 2.30pm on school days when none of three (identified) children were present. If any of the three returned to Kay’s home, the defendant was to leave immediately. He was also permitted to attend her home to drop her off on Monday mornings between 6 and 6.30am and allowed to collect her on Friday afternoons between 3.30 and 4pm. On all other occasions the defendant was not entitled to be at Kay’s home except with prior approval of his DSO. Mr Van Ryn explained that the purpose of these times on Friday afternoon was to ensure that Bill had arrived home from work by the time the defendant came to collect Kay from her home (to take her to his home for the weekend) so that the defendant would not be at Kay’s home on Friday afternoons when the children were present if their father was absent.
	
	
	There was further discussion within Community Corrections following this interview, as a result of which the defendant’s request to travel to the country was declined. According to the case note, this decision was principally made on the basis that Kay’s mobility was such as to diminish her physical capacity to fulfil the demands of a responsible adult supervisor with the responsibility of supervising the defendant.
	
	
	The defendant was advised of the decision to decline his request for a country trip unless Kay obtained a certificate from her own doctor saying that she is physically capable of supervising his contact with children. Kay was told that it would be necessary for her doctor to be told of the defendant’s offences so that she could make an informed decision whether to give such a certificate. The defendant responded to the news in an aggressive manner and demanded a written statement with reasons for his trip not being approved. As a result of his conduct he was required to report to the Blacktown office of Community Corrections on 22 April 2016 for his weekly interview (which would otherwise have taken place at his home).
	
	
	On 21 April 2016 Community Corrections visited the defendant’s house and found him at home. He was reminded that he was not to be at Kay’s house without approval during the school holidays. The defendant reported that Kay’s health has not actually changed in the past 20 years and that the only problem was that she had bad knees.
	
	
	On 22 April 2016 the defendant was given a copy of the review conducted on his electronic monitoring (which decided that it be continued). He told Community Corrections that he would not be dropping Kay off at her house on Monday as it was ANZAC day and the children were not going back to school until Wednesday (27 April 2016).
	
	
	On Friday 29 April 2016 the defendant’s presence was detected (by the electronic monitoring room) at Kay’s house between 3.56pm and 4.28pm, although he was not permitted to be there beyond 2.30pm and was only permitted to collect her for the weekend between 3.30pm and 4pm. The following day Community Corrections spoke to Bill who confirmed that he was present at the time the defendant was there beyond 4pm the previous day. I decline to draw the inference for which Ms Mathur contended that the delay was “entirely inadvertent” as there is no evidence to support her submission.
	
	
	On 30 April 2016 his DSO gave the defendant a verbal warning regarding the previous day’s breach of the written direction given on 14 April 2016. On 2 May 2016, as a result of the breach, it was determined that the condition of the ISO relating to provision of schedules of movements would be reinstated. A written direction to that effect was delivered to the defendant at home on 3 May 2016. The case note recorded in part:
	


“Offender continued to dispute his regression and stated that if Corrective Services [DCS] had done its job properly he would not be under so much scrutiny and would not be flagged for a further ESO.”

Whether an extended supervision order ought be made

Whether the defendant is a “high risk sex offender”


	
	The defendant meets the definition of “sex offender” in s 4 of the Act, having been sentenced for a “serious sex offence” (aggravated indecent assault on a child under the age of 10). The sentence imposed was five years and five months with a total non-parole period of four years and two months.
	
	
	In these circumstances he is a “high risk sex offender” if I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision: s 5B(2).
	


Section 9: the matters to be taken into account


	
	I shall address each of the matters in s 9(3) in turn, in so far as each is relevant. However, I propose to address safety of the community (s 9(3)(a)) in a compendious way at the end since many of the other factors are relevant to this matter.
	


Section 9(3)(b): the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination

Report of Dr Matthew Jones dated 29 March 2016


	
	In his report Dr Jones set out in detail the history he had taken from the defendant in the course of the examination which lasted for about three and a half hours. He included the defendant’s continued protestations of innocence which led Dr Jones to conclude that he lacked insight into his offending behaviour. Dr Jones considered that the defendant probably had a paraphilic disorder (paedophilic sub-type). He opined that the defendant’s preoccupation, attraction and sexual predilection for young girls is probably lifelong given his “extended history of sexual offending”. Dr Jones agreed with other assessments that the risk of his committing another serious offence (as his sexual offences are likely to be, having regard for his predilection for pre-pubescent girls) is moderate to high. Dr Jones noted the defendant’s refusal to consent to anti-libidinal medication (which has the effect that it cannot be prescribed). Dr Jones considered that a high level of supervision (such as would be provided by an ESO) is required to manage his risk of re-offending.
	
	
	Dr Jones considered the level of risk which the defendant continues to pose to be “likely to remain persistently high” and unlikely to diminish in the foreseeable future.
	


Report of Dr Andrew Ellis dated 2 April 2016


	
	Dr Ellis took a history from the defendant that he did not wish to be subject to an ESO; he would not engage in treatment; he would not consider (anti-libidinal) medication; and would prefer to live an itinerant rural lifestyle and return to organising music performances. Dr Ellis considered the defendant to exhibit “extreme psychological denial for his offences”. He considered the defendant to meet the diagnostic criteria for paedophilic disorder, attracted to females, which is a chronic relapsing condition. Dr Ellis also diagnosed a personality disorder.
	
	
	Dr Ellis said:
	


“From a psychiatric perspective if an ESO is applied a period of three years is considered reasonable to monitor and limit exposure to risk taking behaviour. Paraphilias are chronic, relapsing conditions and resistant to treatment and rehabilitative efforts. His comorbid personality disorder impacts upon likely treatment and supervision response. He has thus far avoided strategies to address these drivers of sexual offending behaviour.

As he is unlikely to change in engagement with rehabilitation and reduce his risk profile in this manner, it would be recommended that supervision continue. He has a propensity to evade aspects of supervision (such as letting the charge on his GPS run low, or not notify others of his convictions and restrictions). This pattern of behaviour is unlikely to change.”


	
	I note that, at the time Dr Ellis was asked to give his opinion as to the length of term of any further ESO, the summons sought (for reasons not apparent) an ESO for a period of three years. As Dr Ellis was not required for cross-examination, I have not heard his response to the amended summons which seeks an ESO for the maximum term of five years. Although Dr Ellis referred to three years and suggested that this was an appropriate term during which the risk could be monitored, I do not regard this assessment (the length of an ESO) as a matter for psychiatric opinion, or, indeed, one which is necessarily consistent with Dr Ellis’s views about the intransigence of the condition and the risk posed by the defendant.
	


Section 9(3)(c) and (d): assessments prepared by other psychiatrists or psychologists and statistical likelihood of re-offending


	
	As referred to above, the defendant was assessed by reference to Static-99 in 2009, at which time he was assessed as being moderate to high risk. I note that he was able to answer affirmatively the question whether he had ever lived with a lover for at least two years. While in other cases an affirmative answer to that question may properly be regarded as reducing the risk, in the present case I do not regard it as having that effect because of the defendant’s pattern of offending (which is addressed in more detail below in the context of s 9(3)(h)).
	
	
	In June 2012 Mr Sheehan considered the defendant to fall within the moderate to high risk category and did not regard his increasing age as mitigating the risk in any material way. Dr Allnutt in 2012 considered him to be at high risk for serious sexual recidivism. The report of Mr Ardasinski and Ms Matsuo dated 6 October 2015, sets out their opinion that the defendant’s present situation is “high risk” and that although the risk of re-offending is “moderate”, his lack of treatment during the ESO and the similarity between his current personal situation and the previous context in which his offending occurred presented a high risk.
	
	
	In his most recent report (dated 7 April 2016) Mr Ardasinski confirmed his view that the defendant still posed a moderate-high sexual violence risk generally and that there was an increased risk within Kay’s family unit. He said that his earlier risk assessment has not been affected by any recent change in circumstances and was based on both static and dynamic risk factors. He reiterated the view he had earlier expressed that the defendant had no real capacity to manage his own risk and was reliant on external risk management.
	


Section 9(3)(d1): any report prepared by Corrective Services as to the extent to which the defendant can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community and s 9(3)(f): his level of compliance with parole conditions and the first ESO


	
	The defendant was regarded as generally compliant with reporting for parole in the period from his release to parole on 17 November 1996 (according to a pre-sentence report prepared in 2011), although he refused to engage in any “interventions” in the community and maintained his innocence.
	
	
	The report of Mr Makar dated 24 July 2015 referred to above deserves substantial weight; it records Mr Makar’s assessment that a further ESO should be sought because of the continuing risk posed by the defendant. I note that the report pre-dated the defendant’s marriage to Kay, at a time when his non-disclosure to Community Corrections officers of the relationship was more recent.
	
	
	As to the defendant’s level of compliance with the ESO, the lengthy recitation of the narrative largely derived from the OIMS notes (set out above) provides a picture of the defendant as a man who resents any management or intervention by Community Corrections. He showed himself on occasions to be prepared to mislead the officers who were responsible for his monitoring. For example, he appears to have deliberately downplayed his relationship with Kay until such a time as he had engendered such hope for the future and affection in her (as well as a degree of physical dependency, having regard to her difficulties with mobility) that she married him. Moreover, the defendant prevaricated for many months about telling Bill, who eventually learned the truth only when FACS told him.
	
	
	Although the defendant has been subject to electronic monitoring, he has (throughout the entire period) frequently complained about the device, allowed it to exhaust the charge and not answered his mobile phone when officers have called.
	
	
	Mr Van Ryn’s reports (the content of which is outlined above) referred to these matters as well as the Community Corrections’ concerns about his living arrangements; his continual denial of the offending conduct; and the need to manage the risk. The defendant has been compliant to an extent with the ESO and has not been “breached”. However, he has sought to test the boundaries of several conditions, particularly those that relate directly to the risk (failure to inform Community Corrections of his relationship with Kay; deferring telling Kay or Bill of the ESO or his offending conduct; and visiting Kay’s house and staying for longer than permitted).
	
	
	I have set out in some detail in the narrative above the events that have occurred in recent months. Ms Mathur, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, submitted in substance that any breaches were of little moment. She insinuated that they reflected a pedantry on the part of the defendant’s DSO. I am satisfied that, to some extent, the defendant, who was resentful of the application for a further ESO and wants to be rid of electronic monitoring and would like to be able to travel to the country, has sought to test the limits of the Community Corrections’ resolve to control him by being present at Kay’s residence on 29 April 2016 largely outside the time permitted. This incident (which was otherwise unexplained since neither he nor Kay gave evidence) is an example of his resistance to authority and his preparedness to breach conditions of an ISO or ESO to test the boundaries. In these circumstances, it is not particularly to the point that, as it happened, no child appears to have been at risk, since Bill was present at the relevant time.
	


Section 9(3)(e): participation in treatment or rehabilitation programs and the level of the offender’s participation


	
	The defendant attended FPS consultations with Mr Baird and also attended Mr Hudd to obtain treatment for PTSD. His participation was colourable in both. He appears to have no insight into the effect of his criminal conduct on others and refuses to acknowledge either his guilt or his responsibility. There was no active engagement with the therapy. I accept the clinicians’ reports that he engaged in diversionary tactics on a regular basis. His preparedness to blame others (his legal team, his family, etc.) does not augur well for any prospect of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Ms Mathur accepted that the defendant could not be rehabilitated. Indeed she put as a positive proposition (to Mr Ardasinski, in cross-examination) that the defendant has a personality disorder which acts as a barrier to engagement in therapy. The personality disorder manifests itself in an anti-authoritarian stance, as well as aggressive and obstreperous behaviour.
	


Section 9(3)(g): the level of the defendant’s compliance with obligations under Child Protection legislation


	
	The only matter relied on by the plaintiff as relevant to this factor was the defendant’s alleged failure to comply with reporting conditions relating to a new phone with Internet capacity in 2012. He was acquitted of the charge. There is, accordingly, nothing to suggest that he has not complied with his obligations under this legislation.
	


Section 9(3)(h): the defendant’s criminal history and pattern of offending


	
	The defendant’s criminal history as set out more fully in the narrative above spans several decades. Age does not appear to have diminished his sexual urge. He remains lacking in insight.
	
	
	The defendant’s past offending has involved his obtaining access to young girls through (age-appropriate) women with whom he has been in apparently intimate relationships. Such women have been either the mother (in the case of the earlier offending in 1993) or the grandmother (in the case of the index offences in 2007) of the victims.
	
	
	The children under the care of their mother or grandmother (as the case may be) appear to have been lulled into a false sense of security by their mother’s, or grandmother’s, relationship with the defendant. With respect to the 1993 offences, the reason V3 was in the same bed as the defendant was that her friend, AV1, had been comfortable to watch television there as her mother (the defendant’s then partner) was also in the bed. In relation to the offences in 2007, the defendant was apparently able to engage in conduct (not all of which was charged) with several young girls in the context of a family environment where the defendant was called “Poppy” by his then wife’s grandchildren.
	
	
	Although no judgment can be made whether the defendant entered into the relationships with the mother, or grandmother, of his victims with a view to obtaining access to young girls to whom he was sexually attracted, this has been the effect of such past relationships. He has recently married Kay, a woman who has caring responsibilities for her grandchildren, and who, though the grandmother, effectively stands in the position of mother. But for the ESO and the constant surveillance and enforcement of its conditions by the Community Corrections officers, the defendant’s relationship with Kay would have given him unfettered access to young girls: those in her care and any of their friends who might visit them.
	
	
	It is also noteworthy that the defendant has demonstrated a substantial capacity to affect the judgment of the women with whom he is intimate. His third wife preferred to lose contact with her daughter and grandchildren and align herself with the defendant, notwithstanding his plea of guilty to serious sexual offences involving them. It was only when TC, her own daughter, told her of the sexual assaults which the defendant had perpetrated against her, that the defendant’s third wife was prepared to acknowledge that his claims of innocence were false.
	
	
	Kay, his fourth wife, was induced to believe that the defendant was innocent of all of the offences with which he had been convicted (and to some of which he had pleaded guilty). For a significant period she preferred to keep her own son, Bill, in the dark about the defendant’s criminal history, than disclose it and jeopardise her own relationships both with Bill and with the defendant. Kay has lost contact with her second son (Bill’s brother) as a consequence of her continued association with the defendant, on whom she depends for physical assistance and support. In the course of Mr Van Ryn’s interview on 17 February 2016 (less than a fortnight before the preliminary hearing) Kay indicated that she accepted that he was guilty of the offences for which he has been convicted. However, she has earlier said that she believes in “second chances”, which provides little assurance that she would be willing to control the defendant, even if she were physically able to do so.
	
	
	Ms Mathur relied on the 33-year gap between the second offence in 1960 and the third offence in 1993, followed by a 14 year gap until the commission of the index offences in 2007. I am not persuaded that these gaps between offences have the effect of diminishing the risk. There is no evidence that suggests that the defendant is presently within a period where he would not offend but for the imposition of an ESO
	


Section 9(3)(h1): the views of the sentencing court


	
	The concerns of Williams DCJ are set out above. They relate principally to the defendant’s lack of insight, pattern of offending and ability to groom his partner to take his side in the face of what might be regarded as overwhelming evidence (including his plea of guilty).
	


Section 9(3)(i): any other information


	
	I have referred to the transcripts of interviews with children who spoke of the defendant’s conduct at about the time of the index offences. I have taken these matters into account with respect to the pattern of offending conduct referred to above, with allowance for their weight (since they were not the subject of charges and were not tested at trial).
	


Section 9(3)(a): the safety of the community


	
	Ms Mathur submitted that no assumption ought be made that the marriage between the defendant and Kay would endure and that therefore such protection as was afforded by her presence would not necessarily continue. She put a submission in the following terms:
	


“. . .the exercise at hand should not be approached on a basis where the current circumstances of the defendant are determinative of an appropriate order or conditions, for the reason that relationships are not static.”


	
	However, she submitted that there were other protective mechanisms available under the Child Protection legislation (the 2000 Act and the 2004 Act), pursuant to which the defendant was registered. She submitted that, for these reasons, although there was a risk, I ought not be satisfied that it was an unacceptable risk. Ms Mathur referred to the following passage from the Second Reading Speech for the Bill that became the 2004 Act:
	


This bill recognises the special risk that child sex offenders and other violent offenders against children may still pose after they are released back into the community. Child protection prohibition orders are intended as a means of managing offenders of the highest risk to children. By prohibiting high-risk offenders from specified conduct previously shown to be a precursor to offending, a child protection prohibition order will help prevent further serious offences before they are committed. If police have reason to believe, based on their intelligence about a registrable person and their knowledge of that person's previous offending behaviour, that the person may be engaging in conduct that is likely to pose a risk to a child or children generally, they will be able to apply to the Local Court for a order prohibiting that person from specific kinds of behaviour.


	
	Ms Mathur referred to the provisions in the 2004 Act which enable the Commissioner of Police to apply to the Local Court for a prohibition order prohibiting the defendant from engaging in specified behaviour within the meaning of s 8(1)(c) of the 2004 Act.
	
	
	Ms Mathur submitted that, because the Minister described the Bill as intended to be a means of “managing offenders of the highest risk to children”, I should infer that an ESO is not required if a prohibition order can be made under the 2004 Act. When I raised the mechanism of enforcing such orders (through the New South Wales Police Force), Ms Mathur submitted that I “would comfortably infer from that [the 2004 Act and s 8 in particular] that there is a practical means by which that management can be facilitated”. I reject that submission.
	
	
	Further, Ms Mathur submitted in the following terms: that because the defendant could not be rehabilitated, a prohibition order under s 8 was more appropriate than an ESO:
	


An extended supervision order provides for two things primarily: monitoring and rehabilitation, rehabilitation through referral to and access to a psychologist. If rehabilitation is not realistic as a result of an incapacity, that is a personality incapacity, a cognitive incapacity, then one is left with monitoring and I think one is left with monitoring and the provisions of s 8 of the prohibition order make good a safeguarding of the community and would have your Honour find that the community can be safeguarded.


	
	As referred to above, the primary purpose of the Act is the protection of the public: s 3(1). Another object is rehabilitation: s 3(2). I do not regard the defendant’s incapacity to be rehabilitated (as accepted by Ms Mathur) as a reason for declining to make an ESO. Rather, I consider that the fact that he cannot be rehabilitated is a factor that tends towards the conclusion that he poses an unacceptable risk because he is unable to manage the risk himself.
	
	
	The safety of the community in the present case is, in substance, the safety of pre-pubescent girls to whom the defendant is sexually attracted, and in particular those who are within a family circle to which the defendant belongs. The defendant has no insight into the danger he poses and is unwilling to restrain himself from indulging his sexual urges. The safety of the community would appear to be jeopardised except to the extent to which he can be controlled by external forces. Absent an ESO, there are no readily identifiable external forces that would apply, or be effective, to restrain the defendant. The Child Protection legislation does not include surveillance or electronic monitoring of the sort available under an ESO. Moreover any application for a prohibition order under the 2004 Act is made by the Commissioner of Police, not the plaintiff. Accordingly I cannot be satisfied that any such application would be made if no ESO were ordered.
	
	
	It is difficult to see how a prohibition order (even if one were applied for) would materially reduce the risk since its enforcement would depend on the resources available to the New South Wales Police Force, which, as referred to above, would not permit the use of electronic monitoring or many of the other conditions which are authorised by the Act if an ESO is granted.
	
	
	The defendant has shown remarkable skill in insinuating himself into the affections of women who, by reason of their standing as mothers or grandmothers, have close relationships with (and play caring roles with respect to) young girls. Although Kay’s attitude appears (from the documentary material, particularly the case notes referred to above) to have changed somewhat, I do not consider that she would necessarily provide any real protection for girls in the defendant’s presence, having regard to her undoubted love and devotion to him, as well as her physical infirmities. Although access to Kay’s grandchildren is likely to be much diminished when Bill moves his family to Newcastle, it cannot reasonably be contemplated that Kay will not have contact with her grandchildren, particularly as she has performed the role of mother for them for some years.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having considered the factors in s 9(3) of the Act addressed above, in the context of the narrative of facts, I am satisfied that the defendant, being a sex offender, poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence in the absence of any supervision: New South Wales v Donovan at [24] and Lynn v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 57 at [55]. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defendant is a high risk sex offender within the meaning of s 5B of the Act. I note that, although the extent to which a defendant’s liberty is constrained by proposed conditions is a relevant consideration in formulating such conditions (addressed below), it is irrelevant to the determination of whether he poses an unacceptable risk: Lynn v State of New South Wales at [44], [55]-[58] (per Beazley P), [128] (per Basten JA) and [148] (per Gleeson JA).
	
	
	I am persuaded that it is appropriate, and necessary, to protect the safety of the community, to order a further ESO pursuant to ss 5C and 9(1)(a) of the Act on the conditions considered in more detail below. I am not satisfied that there are any factors personal to the offender which would militate against the making of the order.
	


The term of the ESO


	
	It was contended on behalf of the defendant that it was not necessary for an ESO to be for the maximum period of five years pursuant to s 10(1A). Ms Mathur submitted that the objects of the Act could be met with a supervision order of no longer than three years with a view to determining whether he continues to pose an unacceptable risk at the conclusion of that period. I reject this submission. In the circumstances of the present case there is no reason to suppose that there will be any significant amelioration of what I have found to be the unacceptable risk posed by the defendant in the next five years. I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the ESO be made for the maximum duration permitted by the Act, namely five years.
	
	
	I note the terms of s 13 of the Act, which make provision for an application for variation or revocation where there is a sufficient change in circumstances. An application under s 13 could be made if the defendant became so substantially incapacitated (by age, dementia, accident or other cause) that the risk he poses was materially reduced such that it was no longer an unacceptable risk.
	


Conditions


	
	Since the previous ESO, the plaintiff has reviewed the conditions which are generally sought in relation to an ESO and added or modified conditions, to which the defendant takes exception.
	
	
	Some of the defendant’s objections are substantive, such as the objection to electronic monitoring and scheduling, while others are more formal and can be dealt with more briefly. I propose to set out my decision on the conditions to which the defendant objects (and which are pressed by the plaintiff) in the following table and provide further reasons below where I consider this to be necessary to explain my rulings.

Electronic monitoring and the requirement to submit schedules: conditions 4-8


	
	The way in which electronic monitoring operates is set out in Ms Rybak’s evidence, which was uncontroverted. Mr Van Ryn, the defendant’s DSO, gave evidence in support of a condition authorising electronic monitoring. He explained that such monitoring allowed Community Corrections to know “where he is and where he has been”. It also assists with covert surveillance because it allows his DSO to go directly to the location where he has been detected or to confront him with definite evidence of his location at a particular time. The requirement that he submit schedules is associated with the condition regarding electronic monitoring: both are expressed to be subject to the direction of his DSO.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinki considered electronic monitoring (which imposes boundaries on his movements) to be particularly effective for an offender such as the defendant who is, relevantly, untreated and does not have internal constraints to re-offend (because he denies any wrongdoing). Ms Mathur put to Mr Ardasinki that the defendant had been electronically monitored for a period of three and a half years and, in substance, it had been sufficient. He responded, as follows:
	


“I am not sure that I could quantify how much longer a man who has no, who has demonstrated no capacity to self‑manage his own risk would be able to then be let go from external monitoring as part of a suite of supervision practices to ensure that the members of the community that may be at risk from a new offence are adequately protected.”


	
	Mr Ardasinki said that, from the point of view of rehabilitating an offender, best practice would be to wean someone off very restrictive conditions such as electronic monitoring, with a view to reaching a stage where the risk could be managed by unconditional liberty. However, he opined that, as the defendant is entirely depended on external supervision since he does not have his own internal mechanisms to stop himself from placing himself in risky situations (by being in the company of pre-pubescent children), there was no “self-management plan” that could be trusted to manage the risk.
	
	
	Dr Ellis said, in his report of 2 April 2016, that there is evidence that the defendant has a capacity for “deceitful behaviour” and that electronic monitoring should be considered “within the whole framework of risk management”.
	
	
	By reason of the risk posed by the defendant and his incapacity to manage his own risk (or even to admit that he poses a risk) I am persuaded that the conditions with respect to electronic monitoring and scheduling of movements are warranted.
	


Curfew: condition 10


	
	The defendant opposed the condition that he abide by a curfew that he be at his approved address between 9pm and 6am unless his DSO has given prior approval for another arrangement. Mr Van Ryn explained in his evidence the importance of knowing that the defendant is at home between those hours in an environment which is regularly monitored. It was put to Mr Van Ryn in cross-examination that six to 11-year olds (that category to whom the defendant poses a risk) would generally be home in bed by 9pm. He responded:
	


“I'd like to think that happens out in the community, but that's not my observation, unfortunately.”


	
	But for this condition, the defendant could, for example, stay late or overnight at a friend’s place where young children might be sleeping overnight. His prior offending has been committed in the home environment in situations where he has been able to engender trust in his victims before the commission of offences. Any relationship of friendship he (or Kay) might have with adults who are grandparents is likely to engender trust in the grandchildren, thereby exposing the children to the risk of sexual assault by the defendant.
	
	
	The OIMS notes disclose that the curfew requirement was removed for a period before it was reinstated recently when the requirement that he submit schedules of movements was also reinstated. That it was regarded as unnecessary by the defendant’s DSO for a period does not mean that it is generally unnecessary. I regard the ability of a DSO to adjust conditions to suit the day-to-day circumstances of a sex offender as a significant part of managing the risk. I consider this condition to be appropriate.
	


The effect of condition 2


	
	Condition 2 provides that the defendant must follow all reasonable directions by his DSO or any other person supervising him. Ms Mathur contended that some of the conditions sought by the plaintiff were unnecessary since such directions could be given by the DSO under condition 2 in any event. In my view, it is fairer to the defendant to include some detail as to what prohibitions apply and what the discretion of the DSO is, rather than to leave such matters to fall within condition 2.
	


Orders


	
	In the schedule to the reasons I have included all the orders sought in the amended summons (although some have been slightly amended due to concessions made by the plaintiff). Some, which have been struck through, are no longer pressed (such as conditions 24 and 25) or have been rejected (such as condition 3). However, in order to preserve the integrity of the numbering for the purposes of these reasons, I have not renumbered the conditions.
	
	
	For the reasons set out above, I make the following orders:
	



	
	An order pursuant to ss 5C and 9 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act) that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order for a period of five years from 12 May 2016.
	
	
	Direct the defendant, pursuant to s 11 of the Act, to comply with the conditions set out in the schedule to these reasons.

		12 May 2016",2016-05-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769452,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 52) [2016] NSWSC 628,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	The case for the accused Rogerson was completed on 13 May 2016, at which time there arose an issue concerning evidence the Crown wished to call in reply from Mr Tony Butler, a long-standing friend and acquaintance of Rogerson.
	
	
	The question of evidence being given by Butler was raised by Mr Thomas in the course of the evidence of the accused McNamara, at which time the Crown issued a subpoena for Butler's attendance. However the origins of Butler's evidence, and the possibility of him being called as a witness, go back further.
	
	
	Police obtained a statement from Butler in November 2015. Apart from making a reference to having contact with Rogerson on 23 May 2014, the statement said very little. It is common ground between the parties that prior to the commencement of this trial the Crown provided to the representatives of each of the accused a list of witnesses. That list was divided into several categories, one of which listed those witnesses who the Crown proposed to call in its case. Another category was those witnesses who the Crown did not propose to call, but agreed would be made available for cross-examination upon a request being made by either or both of the accused. Butler, fell into that latter category. However, no request was made by the representatives of either accused that he be made available by the Crown for cross-examination. Accordingly, the Crown did not call him in its case.
	
	
	In the course of giving evidence-in-chief, the accused McNamara (commencing at T3243 L42) gave evidence of conversations that he allegedly had with Rogerson immediately prior to Christmas 2014 when they were in custody together. Those conversations, according to McNamara, followed a number of previous discussions in the course of which Rogerson allegedly suggested that a defence to the present charges be fabricated. Rogerson has denied such allegations.
	
	
	According to McNamara, he had a conversation with Rogerson (which was recounted at T3243 L44) in the following terms:
	


McNamara: I think I'm willing to go along with you but I've got some concerns.

Rogerson: What are they?

McNamara: Primarily the gun.

Rogerson: What do you want to know?

McNamara: Everything.

Rogerson: Tony Butler has been a mate of mine for about 25 years. He's a mad gun perv. I've got guns from Tony when I've needed them. My Chinese friends told me what a dangerous little cunt Jamie was and I got a gun. God strike me, he pulled a knife first.

McNamara: I know that. Tell me about the gun.

Rogerson: I had the gun for a week or so prior to the shooting after I had spoken to my Chinese friends.

McNamara: Where is it now?

Rogerson: On Friday, 23 May, I dropped it back at Tony's work at Aviation Welding at Bankstown Airport.


	
	McNamara then gave evidence (commencing T3244 L5) that the ""Tony"" to whom Rogerson was referring was in fact Butler. He also said that in the same conversation Rogerson had made reference to a person by the name of Jimmy Brown. That was in the context of McNamara asking Rogerson where the gun was at the time of the conversation, and Rogerson replying:
	


After all the shit blew up with you on the Sunday night, I saw it on the news in Queensland. I got Farley to get me a bodgie phone.


	
	The reference to ""Farley"" is a reference to a witness who has already given evidence in the Crown case.
	
	
	Rogerson, in his evidence, has denied possessing a gun on the day of the deceased's shooting, shooting the deceased and having any association with Butler in relation to the return of any firearm. There were references in the course of McNamara’s evidence to other conversations about the gun which he said took place whilst he and Rogerson were in custody together. Rogerson has denied those conversations.
	
	
	Exh. M28 is a summary of telephone contact between various persons, including Rogerson, Butler and another person by the name of William Duff.  Duff is also a long-standing acquaintance of Rogerson who was previously called by the Crown to give evidence. In the course of his cross-examination, it was put to him by counsel then representing McNamara that he (Duff) was party to an arrangement with Rogerson to provide Rogerson with a false alibi as to his movements on the day of the deceased's death. An application by McNamara’s then counsel to cross-examine Duff about a previous conviction for supplying a prohibited drug was refused: R v McNamara; R v Rogerson (No 28) [2016] NSWSC 160. It is evident that Butler and Duff are closely acquainted. Exh. M28 establishes that on 20 May 2014 there was telephone contact between Rogerson and Duff, on 23 May 2014 there was contact between Butler and Duff and on 22 and 26 may 2014 there was contact between Rogerson and Brown.
	
	
	In the course of McNamara's cross-examination (but in the absence of the jury) Mr Thomas raised the issue of Butler being called. Initially it was his unequivocal position that the Crown “must” call Butler in light of the evidence which had been given by McNamara. Subsequently, the Crown served (by way of disclosure) a number of documents relating to Butler which established (inter alia) that on 6 May 1999 Butler’s business premises were raided by police, at which time what was described as a ""large arsenal of unlicensed firearms, weapons and prohibited articles along with a large amount of compatible ammunition"" were found. As a consequence, Butler was charged with a series of offences, including possession of a prohibited weapon without a permit, possessing an unauthorised firearm, possessing ammunition without a permit, failing to keep a firearm safely and possessing an unauthorised firearm. Those matters came before the Bankstown Local Court on 17 November 1999. The Magistrate found that the evidence adduced by the prosecution was insufficient to establish a prima facie case and all of the charges were dismissed. In light of some of the evidence given by Butler on the voir dire today, I have inferred that the basis for the dismissal of those charges was an absence of evidence which established the element of knowledge.
	
	
	After that material had been served by the Crown, Mr Thomas' position changed somewhat. Having had the opportunity to obtain instructions following the conclusion of Rogerson's cross-examination, Mr Thomas objected to Butler being called. However, it was agreed by all parties that I should hear Butler’s evidence on the voir dire. Before going to that, it is appropriate that I recount part of the contents of the statement that he made to the police on 16 November 2015. Having set out (at paragraphs 3 and 4) the nature of his friendship with Rogerson, Butler stated (commencing at paragraph 5):
	


“5. About two to two and a half years ago I was at Roger's house in Padstow when Glen McNamara turned up. I'd never met him before and Roger introduced Glen as a person he worked with in private investigation work. I left Roger's place shortly after meeting Glen. That was the first and last time I ever met Glen McNamara.

6. On Monday 19 May 2014 I went on a cruise up to Brisbane and some of the islands nearby. I didn't get back home until Thursday 22 May, about 2.30pm. That afternoon Billy Duff called me to say g'day and mentioned Roger, Gary Windred and another mate Joe were going to the Crown Hotel, Revesby, for a beer. I wasn't able to go because I was too busy at work.

7. The last time I caught up with Roger was on Friday 23 May 2014. Roger came to my hangar at the airport to have a beer about 3pm. Roger usually dropped in for a beer roughly every couple of weeks. On that day a few other mates who also regularly had a beer were there that afternoon, including Billy Duff, Ray Phelps, Bob Fraser, Warren McGlyn and my son Kyle Butler.

8. I didn't notice anything unusual about Roger. It was just another normal afternoon where we had a beer and told some jokes and talked about different things. I remember Roger told me he was heading up to Redcliffe, Queensland, the next day for one of his speaking engagements.”


	
	Butler gave evidence before me on the voir dire on 13 May 2016, and again today. In the course of his evidence-in-chief on the voir dire (commencing at T4580 L34) he departed from the statement that he had made to the police. Firstly (at T4580 L35) he stated that it was on the 16th of May 2014 (not the 19th of May 2014) that he had left to go on a cruise to Brisbane. He confirmed that he arrived back on the 22nd of May 2014 and (at T4580 L44) that “someone” contacted him on that day about having a drink. When asked who it was (at T4580 L46) Butler maintained he could not recall. When asked specifically whether it was Duff he responded:
	


""No, it wasn't Bill at all, I thought it was, but it wasn't"".


	
	The assertion that it was not Duff who phoned him was at odds with his statement to police.
	
	
	Butler went on to assert (commencing at T4581 L1) that he tried to correct those discrepancies in his statement but that his efforts ""apparently went unheeded"". When asked how it was that he tried to do so, he told the Court (at T4581 L23) that he sent an email to the police, and had also asked each of Detectives Phillips and Jouni in person to correct the statement.
	
	
	When his evidence resumed this morning Butler, as it were, “corrected the correction.” He said that although he had thought that he sent an email to the police, he had had a discussion with his son over the weekend, the effect of which was that each had thought the other had sent the email, resulting in the fact that no email had been sent at all. He continued to maintain that he had asked the police to correct the statement in the two respects that I have identified. The Crown specifically put to him, pursuant to a grant of leave under s. 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”), that he had made no such request until he arrived at Court to give evidence on 13 May 2016. He denied that this was the case.
	
	
	Butler disclosed he had been driven to court on Friday, and again today, by none other than Duff. He also asserted that over the weekend, at his request, Duff had provided him with his (i.e. Duff's) mobile telephone records for 2014, a perusal of which (according to Butler) confirmed that it was not Duff who had telephoned him on 22 May 2014. When asked what it was that caused him to make the assertions that he had previously made regarding that issue, Butler was unable to assist. He denied that Rogerson returned a gun to him on 23 May 2014.
	
	
	It should be noted that Duff was previously called to give evidence in the Crown case. He too departed from one aspect of a statement that he made to the police. Having asserted in his statement to police that he had met with Rogerson on 20 May 2014 (i.e. the day on which the deceased was killed) Duff then stated that this was an error and that it was in fact 15 May when they had met. That caused counsel then appearing for McNamara to put to Duff that he was a party to arranging a false alibi for Rogerson so as to account for his movements on the afternoon on which the deceased was killed. Duff denied that this was the case. At that time, there was little or no significance in any contact between Duff and Butler. Accordingly, he was not cross-examined on that issue by counsel for either of the accused.
	
	
	Mr Wendler cross-examined Butler on the voir dire as to the circumstances of the offences with which he was charged in 1999. The answers given by Butler to some of those questions led me to draw the inference to which I earlier referred, namely that the failure of the prosecution on that occasion to prove its case to a prima facie level was because of the absence of any evidence of knowledge.
	
	
	All of that background leads to a position where the Crown now seeks to call Butler in its case in reply. In the event that this is permitted, the Crown will ask Butler whether or not he was responsible for dealing with a gun given to him by Rogerson on or about 23 May 2014. Consistent with his evidence on the voir dire, it can be expected that Butler will say he was not so involved. The Crown will, however, make a further application for leave under s. 38 of the Act to cross-examine Butler as to the departures from the statement that he made to the police which I earlier identified. In the event that Butler is called to give evidence before the jury, and in addition to asking him whether Rogerson returned a gun to him (which he will deny) the Crown will seek to recall Detective Phillips to give evidence that the first time that Butler sought to correct any discrepancy in his statement was on 13 May 2016.
	
	
	Mr Wendler has indicated that he will seek to cross-examine Butler as to the circumstances of his contact with Rogerson on 23 May and, in particular, as to the alleged return, by Rogerson, of a gun to him. Mr Wendler also indicated an intention to cross-examine Butler as to the charges laid against him in 1999.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, on behalf of Rogerson, opposed Butler being called in reply.
	
	
	It seems to me that there are three issues which arise. The first is whether or not the evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown properly arises so as to be able to be led in a case in reply. The second is whether or not the evidence is relevant. The third is whether or not it ought be excluded under s. 137 of the Act, either in whole or in part.
	
	
	As to the first of those matters, I am satisfied that the issues to which the evidence of Butler might go were not foreseeable by the Crown. The Crown was not put on notice of any requirement to make Butler available for cross-examination by counsel for either of the accused. In particular, there was no request made by those then acting for McNamara.
	
	
	The issue of Rogerson's alleged passing of the gun to Butler arose only when McNamara gave evidence-in-chief. It was not, as Mr Thomas pointed out, the subject of any reference at all in the opening address by counsel who then appeared for McNamara. In these circumstances, it could not be said that in now seeking to lead the evidence, the Crown is splitting its case: R v Chin [1985] HCA 35; (1985) 157 CLR 671.
	
	
	The second issue is whether Butler’s evidence is relevant.  Butler, notwithstanding the departures from his statement, will give evidence that he met Rogerson on 23 May 2014. He will assert, consistent with paragraph 7 of his statement, that Rogerson came to his business premises on that day. That, of course, is the same day upon which (according to McNamara's evidence) Rogerson said he took the gun back to Butler. Whilst it may well be that Butler will deny that he was provided with any gun on that occasion, his evidence (particularly his evidence of the fact that he did meet with Rogerson on that day) is relevant.
	
	
	The third issue is whether or not the evidence ought be excluded under s. 137 of the Act.
	
	
	In that respect, Mr Thomas made a number of submissions. Firstly, he submitted that the focus of any evidence from Butler would be upon collateral (and highly prejudicial) issues concerning his departure (in the 2 respects that I have identified) from his statement. While Mr Thomas accepted, as I understood it, that Butler’s denial that Rogerson took a gun to him would (prima facie) assist Rogerson's case, his submission was that such evidence would, as it were, be overwhelmed by evidence touching upon other peripheral issues which went to Butler's credit. This seemed to amount to the proposition that there was a danger that Butler’s denial that Rogerson brought a gun to him might not be accepted by the jury. Mr Thomas emphasised that this would occur in circumstances where Butler would effectively be the last witness called after several months of evidence. Although not stated in these terms, the effect of Mr Thomas' submission was that these circumstances would give rise to a situation where the jury would necessarily be left with a final impression of Butler’s evidence, leading to the risk of that evidence being given more weight than it really deserved.
	
	
	Mr Thomas also submitted that a degree of unfairness arose because of the way in which this matter had evolved. He pointed out, in particular, that no request had been made by those acting for McNamara that Butler be called by the Crown. He submitted that this omission occurred in circumstances where it could be inferred that Mr McNamara's representatives must have instructions about McNamara’s conversation with Rogerson concerning the gun. Whilst the submission was not put in these terms, it effectively amounted to the proposition that it would be unfair to Rogerson for McNamara to now derive some benefit from Butler’s evidence, in circumstances where his (McNamara’s) representatives should have put the Crown on notice that they wished Butler to be called in the Crown case.
	
	
	Mr Thomas also submitted that quite apart from the resultant prejudicial effect, those circumstances had given rise to a situation where Rogerson had effectively been deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Duff as to any issue which might become relevant as a consequence of the evidence of Butler.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Thomas indicated that his position as outlined in his submissions would be the same irrespective of whether or not I admitted the evidence in relation to the charges brought against Butler in 1999.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that in the event that I were to conclude that the evidence of the events in 1999 was in some way relevant and admissible, there was merit in Mr Thomas’ position. However, the Crown submitted that if the evidence of those matters were excluded, the probative value of the remaining evidence to be given by Butler was high, and that it was not outweighed by the danger of any unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown accepted that Butler would deny any involvement in dealing with the gun with Rogerson, it was submitted that there remained evidence of contact between Butler and Rogerson on 23 May 2014 and that, in these circumstances, Butler’s evidence was relevant and probative.
	
	
	Mr Wendler, on behalf of McNamara, submitted that there was a clear connection between the evidence of Butler and the evidence given by McNamara, as well as the evidence in the form of a denial made by Rogerson. He submitted that the ultimate issue was whether the justice of the case, viewed overall, was such that the evidence ought be permitted. He indicated that he proposed to pursue the cross-examination of Butler in relation to the charges brought against him in 1999, and that even if that evidence was excluded, his position would remain the same as to the remainder of any evidence that he might give.
	
	
	Because of the manner in which the argument developed, it is firstly necessary for me to consider whether or not the evidence of the charges brought against Butler in 1999 ought be excluded. I have already outlined the circumstances which led to those charges.
	
	
	In my view, the probative value of that evidence, particularly in the light of the fact that all of the charges brought against Butler were dismissed, is low. However, the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused Rogerson if that evidence were admitted is high. It would, in my view, give rise to the distinct possibility of the jury speculating as to an association between Rogerson and a person at whose premises firearms were found some 17 years ago, and in respect of whom all ensuing charges were dismissed. In my view, that prejudice substantially outweighs any probative value that the evidence might have. For those reasons, even if the Crown is permitted to call Butler, evidence of the events in 1999 will be excluded.
	
	
	In that event, Butler’s evidence would then comprise the following. Firstly, on the assumption that he adhered to his statement, he would give evidence that he and Rogerson met on 23 May 2014. Secondly, he will deny that this meeting had anything to do with dealing in a gun. Thirdly, he will specifically deny that Rogerson gave him a gun at that time. Fourthly, on the assumption that an application by the Crown pursuant to s. 38 of the Act were made and leave was granted, the Crown will cross-examine Butler on the departures from his statement. The Crown will then seek to lead further evidence from Detective Phillips in order to establish that Butler did not, until coming to court, make any request that his statement be corrected.
	
	
	The evidence of Butler that he met with Rogerson on 23 May 2014 is relevant and probative. Part of its probative value lies in its capacity, at least in part, to support Rogerson's assertion that he did not give any gun to Butler. The curious aspect of the present case is that although Butler's expected evidence would assist the case of Rogerson, counsel for Rogerson argues against its admission. Conversely, the expected evidence would not assist McNamara’s case as it would be inconsistent with his evidence of the terms of a conversation which took place between he and Rogerson. Yet, for the reasons I have outlined, counsel for McNamara agitates for its admission.
	
	
	In my view, there is merit in the submission advanced by Mr Thomas that the issues concerning the departures from Butler's statement would, as it were, overwhelm any other evidence that he might give. It seems that the primary focus (at least from the Crown's perspective and to a lesser extent from that of Mr Wendler) would be upon Butler’s departures from his statement. That, it seems to me, has at least the capacity to divert the jury from its task. It also has the capacity to have the jury ascribe more weight to the evidence than it at aspect of the evidence than it appropriately deserves.
	
	
	Section 137 of the Act concerns itself, amongst other things, with the danger of evidence being unfairly prejudicial to an accused. It mandates a refusal to admit evidence if the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the danger of such unfair prejudice. It has been observed that unfair prejudice means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way, be it by provoking some irrational or emotional response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it should be given. It has also been observed that the section is concerned with prejudice that is unfair because it is additional to, or distinct from, the damage to the accused's case created by the probative force of the evidence: Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 3; (1999) 196 CLR 297.
	
	
	It is also of some significance that when given the opportunity to have Butler called in the Crown case, the then representatives of the accused McNamara made no such request. Had they done so, the association between Butler and Duff may well have come to light, such that Duff would have been cross-examined about those matters by Mr Thomas. Because of the fact that this issue had not arisen, that cross-examination did not take place. Those circumstances, in my view, also have the capacity to give rise to unfair prejudice to Rogerson.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I have come to the view that the probative value of the evidence of Butler is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Rogerson in the manner that I have outlined. Accordingly, the evidence will be excluded.

		15 June 2016",2016-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769457,Haines v R [2016] NSWCCA 90,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 14 April 2016 this Court heard and determined an application by Ms Haines pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on her following her conviction for the murder of Haibo Wang. The Court granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal, quashing the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge and imposing orders confirming the conviction and sentencing Ms Haines to a term of imprisonment that expired on 2 March 2016. Accordingly, Ms Haines was to be released forthwith. The Court reserved its reasons for granting leave and allowing the appeal. These are those reasons.
	


Background


	
	The offence to which Ms Haines ultimately pleaded guilty and which was the subject of the present application was one that took place on 3 March 2001. Ms Haines, who had been in the Somerset Hotel, left the hotel and entered a nearby shop. There was then an argument of some kind between Ms Haines and the shopkeeper, Mr Wang. Ms Haines stabbed the shopkeeper, using a knife that matched others in the shop; took Mr Wang’s watch and wallet; and fled the shop premises. Shortly after, Mr Wang was found unconscious behind the shop counter, bleeding profusely from a stab wound to the chest. He died a short time later.
	
	
	Ms Haines was arrested that same day. There was, however, an issue as to her mental health and hence her fitness to be tried. On 14 February 2003, a jury found Ms Haines to be unfit to be tried. In September 2003, the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that she would not become fit to be tried within 12 months.
	
	
	On 27 October 2003 the then Attorney-General directed that a special hearing be conducted in respect of the offence. Following a hearing before Miles AJ in June 2004, a jury found that on the limited evidence then available Ms Haines had committed the offence of murder as charged. Miles AJ, for reasons given on 11 June 2004, indicated that he would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment had the trial been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person fit to be tried for the murder of Mr Wang and then nominated, as a limiting term for the purposes of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), a period of 17 years commencing on 3 March 2001 and expiring on 2 March 2018. That term took into account the period that Ms Haines had already been in custody in relation to the offence.
	
	
	Since her arrest, Ms Haines has been under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. She spent a number of years in a Womens' Correctional Centre before being transferred to The Forensic Hospital in July 2009 and then to the Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital in December 2011.
	
	
	Following a hearing on 5 April 2013 before the Mental Health Review Tribunal, the Tribunal formed the unanimous opinion that Ms Haines had become fit to be tried for the offence of murder. The Director of Public Prosecutions then determined pursuant to s 29(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act that further proceedings be taken. On 7 June 2013, the matter was listed for arraignment but this date was adjourned to enable the parties to obtain updated psychiatrist reports.
	
	
	On 23 September 2013, Dr Michael Giuffrida provided to Ms Haines’ legal advisers an expert report in which he expressed the opinion that Ms Haines had available to her a defence of mental illness and also raised the possibility of a defence of substantial impairment.
	
	
	On 4 November 2013, Ms Haines was found fit to be tried. She remained under the care of the Bunya Unit at Cumberland House as an involuntary patient.
	
	
	Ms Haines was arraigned on 7 March 2014. A plea of not guilty was entered at that stage on the basis of a defence of mental illness. It was agreed that the trial would proceed as a judge alone trial and a trial date of 26 May 2014 was set. The trial was set down for one week. The sole issue was as to the defence of mental illness.
	
	
	On 29 April 2014, Dr Giuffrida provided a further report, in which he expressed the opinion that Ms Haines probably did not have available to her the mental illness defence. However, he also indicated to Ms Haines’ legal advisers that if there existed file notes of observations consistent with a psychosis shortly before or after Ms Haines was transferred from Mulawa to The Forensic Hospital on 29 July 2009 then he would be inclined to revert to the opinion expressed in his September 2013 report. On 16 May 2014, the 26 May trial date was vacated, apparently to enable Dr Giuffrida to have access to the Justice Health material required for him to resolve his doubts (one way or another) as to the availability of the mental health defence. The proceedings were stood over for further arraignment on 4 July 2014.
	
	
	On 30 June 2014, Dr Giuffrida provided a further report to Ms Haines’ legal advisers in which he concluded that Ms Haines probably did not have available to her a defence of mental illness on the charge of murder.
	
	
	On 4 July 2014, Ms Haines was re-arraigned and entered a plea of guilty. In August 2014, Ms Haines’ bail was revoked and she was transferred to Mulawa Hospital.
	
	
	A sentencing hearing was held on 21 November 2014 before RS Hulme AJ. For the reasons published on 16 April 2015 (R v Haines [2015] NSWSC 390), his Honour sentenced Ms Haines to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 12 years and 9 months from 3 March 2001, together with a further term of 4 years and 3 months. In accordance with those orders, Ms Haines became eligible for release on parole on 3 December 2013 but, as at the time of the present application, she remained in custody.
	


Proposed grounds of appeal


	
	Although four proposed grounds of appeal were identified in the notice of appeal filed on 25 November 2015, at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal only two were sought to be pressed, namely that:
	


1.   His Honour erred in finding that the Applicant’s plea was not at the first available opportunity; and in allowing “no appreciable allowance” for the limitation of the issues for determination, and accordingly erred in assessing the discount arising from the Applicant’s plea of guilty as 15%.

3.   His Honour erred in failing to take into account of [sic], or alternatively gave insufficient weight to, the subjective features of the Applicant, in particular:

(a)   the Applicant’s deprived background;

(b)   the Applicant’s intellectual disability;

(c)   the Applicant’s mental illness;

(d)   the Applicant’s physical ill health.


	
	Moreover, in the course of oral submissions, Mr Odgers SC, appearing for Ms Haines, accepted that if this Court were to accept the applicant’s submissions on ground 1 and were to re-sentence Ms Haines based on the same starting point as that adopted by the sentencing judge but with a 25% (rather than 15%) discount for Ms Haines’ guilty plea, then it would not be necessary for the Court to deal with ground 3 (as Ms Haines’ head sentence would, on those assumptions, have already expired).
	
	
	Accordingly, the Court proceeded first to hear oral submissions only on ground 1.
	


Ground 1


	
	The sentencing judge accepted that Ms Haines was entitled to a discount for her guilty plea and accepted that, given her mental condition, she could not have pleaded guilty prior to the finding on 4 November 2013 that she was fit to be tried. However, his Honour considered that Ms Haines had not pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity after she became able to do so and said (at [46]):
	


… Rather she did so only shortly before her trial was due to begin. One of the factors inspiring a discount for a plea of guilty is its utilitarian value and in the circumstance [sic] it would not be appropriate to allow her the normal maximum discount for her plea. Indeed that plea was almost at the last moment and while I would not adopt the minimum of the usual range for pleas of guilty, the allowance should be closer to that minimum than to the maximum. I propose to allow a discount of 15%.


	
	His Honour noted that there was clearly co-operation on Ms Haines’ behalf in limiting the issues to be canvassed at the anticipated trial but was not persuaded that the co-operation was of such significance as to merit any appreciable allowance for it ([52]).
	
	
	The force of the submissions put for Ms Haines in this Court on this issue was that, in all the circumstances, Ms Haines had pleaded guilty as soon as reasonably possible, having done so almost immediately after it became clear that the defence of mental illness that had been considered by her psychiatrist and legal advisers to be available to her was no longer available (i.e., when Dr Giuffrida gave his 30 June 2014 report). It was submitted that in circumstances where there was delay in obtaining clarity regarding the medical evidence on the mental illness defence (through, it was said, no fault of Ms Haines) his Honour erred in concluding that the plea had not been made at the first reasonable opportunity after Ms Haines had been found fit to plead.
	
	
	For Ms Haines it was submitted that the Crown, in its submissions before the sentencing judge, had recognised that this was an unusual matter and had not argued that, in the unusual circumstances that pertained, Ms Haines had not pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity (pointing to his Honour’s observation at T 35.29 as to the import of the Crown’s submissions being that the discount is based on the utilitarian value of the plea not the reasons for it).
	
	
	The Crown argued that there was no error in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion, submitting that generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value of the plea is reduced (referring to R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; (2006) 160 A Crim R 510 at [11]) and argued that whether or not there was a defence available to an offender is not a relevant consideration when considering the utilitarian value of the plea. The Crown emphasised that the guilty plea was entered eight months after the finding of fitness to be tried and just ten days prior to the commencement of the trial (the date for which had been set and vacated once during that eight month period) and argues that the 15% discount the sentencing judge applied for the plea was within an acceptable range within his Honour’s discretion.
	


Determination


	
	In R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ (Wood CJ at CL, Foster AJA, Grove and James JJ agreeing) said, in the course of setting out a guideline for the application of the discount for a guilty plea (at [160]):
	


(iii)   The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10–25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge. (my emphasis)


	
	Spigelman CJ noted that a discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, for example, those entered on the date fixed for trial (at [155]) but also that the complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced will affect the value of the plea: the greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea (at [154]). His Honour also noted that a discount within the range specified will not mean that a trial judge’s exercise of discretion cannot be subject to appellate review (at [159]).
	
	
	In R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32], Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) noted that generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced (referring to Stambolis; Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 280), but nevertheless implicitly accepted (at [31]) that there may be exceptional cases arising from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case where a maximum discount (that might not otherwise be appropriate as a matter of general practice) might properly be awarded.
	
	
	In Stambolis Howie J said (at [11]):
	


… There is no utility in a plea of guilty that has not been forthcoming. If the accused is not prepared to plead guilty until the Crown takes some course, then so be it. But if by withholding the plea the offender achieved the result he wanted, I do not understand why he should receive further favourable treatment on the basis that the plea of guilty had utilitarian value when it did not. Rarely, if ever, will the reason why the accused has withheld the plea of guilty be a relevant matter in determining the utilitarian discount. Where it has been used as a bargaining tool in order to achieve a favourable outcome from the Crown in respect of some other charge, I do understand that this circumstance can excuse the delay or provides a basis for asserting that the plea was made at the first reasonable opportunity.


	
	Similar observations were made by Howie J (Beazley JA, as her Honour then was, and Hislop J agreeing) in R v Nicholson [2010] NSWCCA 80 (at [36]).
	
	
	However, Bathurst CJ in R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 said (at [3]) that, while courts should generally continue to follow the approach in Borkowski, “the principles have to be applied by reference to the particular circumstances in any case”. One such exceptional case was Atkinson v R [2014] NSWCCA 262, where the applicant had instructed his solicitors to enter guilty pleas prior to his first appearance in the Local Court, but (unbeknownst to him at the time) the instructions were not carried out.
	
	
	Another such “exceptional” case in which the reason for the delay was taken into account was Villalon v R [2015] NSWCCA 229, where the applicant had been charged with murder but during committal proceedings made an offer (rejected by the Director of Public Prosecutions) to plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment, that offer being accompanied by a report from a psychiatrist who expressed the opinion that the applicant was suffering from a paranoid psychotic illness at the time of the offence. On arraignment and on the first day of trial, the applicant pleaded guilty to the alternative count of manslaughter (of which he was subsequently found guilty). Gleeson JA (with whom Adams and Fagan JJ agreed) found that the sentencing judge had erred in assessing the discount on sentence for the guilty plea as 20% and that the sentencing judge was required to take into account the offer of the plea of guilty which matched the crime for which the applicant was ultimately convicted ([38]), applying R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310. Gleeson JA found that, in the circumstances, the applicant’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was made at the earliest reasonable opportunity (at [52]).
	
	
	In the present case, the challenge to the sentencing judge’s assessment of the discount for the guilty plea requires demonstration of error of the kind referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. It is clear from his Honour’s reasons that he had in mind, when setting out the chronology of events in relation to the guilty plea, that the psychiatrist who had been retained on Ms Haines’ behalf had withdrawn his opinion as to the availability of the defence of mental illness ([45]) (and to the steps that had been taken to limit the length and complexity of the trial). Nevertheless, it is not apparent how that factor was taken into account, if at all, in his Honour’s assessment that Ms Haines did not plead guilty at the “first reasonable opportunity after she became able to do so” ([46]).
	
	
	Having regard to her long history of mental illness, during which time his Honour accepted Ms Haines could not have pleaded guilty, and the reliance that one would expect to be placed by Ms Haines and her legal advisers on the assessment of a specialist forensic psychiatrist in determining the availability of a defence of mental illness, in all the circumstances it must be concluded that his Honour erred in finding that Ms Haines did not plead guilty at the first opportunity when it was reasonable for her to do so.
	
	
	In those circumstances the sentencing discretion miscarried. Having regard to the fact that there was almost no delay in her change of plea once Dr Giuffrida confirmed his change of mind and expressed the opinion that she probably did not have such a defence, it can be inferred that had Dr Giuffrida been from the outset of the view that he ultimately reached then there would have been a plea of guilty when Ms Haines was first arraigned. The delay caused by the vacation of the May trial date was clearly for the purpose of enabling certainty as to Dr Giuffrida’s assessment of her mental state at the relevant time.
	
	
	In the exceptional circumstances of this case, the reason for the delay in entering a guilty plea must be taken into account, as must the fact that Ms Haines had also co-operated in confining the issues to be dealt with at the trial, which was not to take place before a jury, to the testing of the evidence of the two psychiatrists. The effect of the latter is that the utilitarian value of the guilty plea, even though only shortly before the trial date, remained high.
	
	
	Having formed that view, it was incumbent on this Court to re-sentence Ms Haines (Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601). The Court was of the view that a 25% discount was appropriate to reflect the guilty plea, having regard to the very unusual circumstances of the case. The Court considered it appropriate to adopt a starting point of 20 years, as the sentencing judge did. As a result, on re-sentencing the head sentence was one that expired on 2 March 2016; hence the orders as made on 14 April 2016.
	
	
	For completeness, it should be noted that this Court reiterated the concerns expressed by the sentencing judge as to the need for appropriate resources to be made available on Ms Haines’ release from custody and the acknowledgement from her legal representatives that they were aware of those concerns (see for example the concerns raised in the report of Dr Ana-Louise Martin, psychiatric registrar, of August 2009; the report of Dr Giuffrida of 23 September 2013; and the letter of 20 November 2014 from Michael Brownlee of the Department of Family and Community Services tendered at the sentencing hearing).

2769465,R v Turnbull (No. 20) [2016] NSWSC 799,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of cross-examination by the Crown of Grant Turnbull, the Accused's son, the Crown has sought to raise with Mr Turnbull matters concerning potential fencing of the “Colorado” and “Strathdoon” properties as a result of remediation orders, in the context of what was considered and decided by Preston CJ on 25 June 2014 in Turnbull v Director-General, Office of Environment and Heritage [2014] NSWLEC 84 at [113] to [122].
	
	
	Objection was taken to a question which the Crown was seeking to ask by reference to [113] of his Honour's judgment.
	
	
	The background to this objection is certain evidence adduced in examination-in-chief of Grant Turnbull by senior counsel for the Accused with respect to the cost of fencing. In particular (at T955-957), there was evidence as to the cost of fencing - a quotation being obtained for 24 kilometres of fencing for “Colorado”, a cost of just over $400,000.00 and seven-and-a-half kilometres of fencing for “Strathdoon” at a cost of just on $140,000.00.
	
	
	A question was asked (T956, line 34):
	


“Q.    So in July of 2014, was the possible cost of half a million dollars, on fencing something that you and your father could afford at the time? 

A.    No.""


	
	The quotation which contained these figures became MFI74.
	
	
	Implicit in this question is that this was a potential cost which was alive as at 29 July 2014, the date of the tragic shooting of Mr Turner.
	
	
	The cross-examination for the Crown, as I understand it, seeks to demonstrate what the position was, at least as far as the ongoing process of decision making by the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court as at 25 June 2014.
	
	
	His Honour’s judgment, at [113] to [122], includes a summary of the submissions made and his Honour's approach to the matter, which was to agree with the applicants' approach, that is, the approach of Grant Turnbull, including this statement at [119]:
	


“For example, the applicants might choose to achieve the outcome by not grazing livestock on their properties at all, but only crop the land, in which event the erection of fencing around the boundaries of the remediation areas within the properties would be unnecessary.”


	
	His Honour referred again to the fencing topic at [122]:
	


“I consider, therefore, that the terms of the remedial work directions dealing with fencing and stock management should be generally based on the applicants' revised direction, but with the changes I have noted as well as some modification of language to improve clarity.”


	
	It is the position that there was a further hearing before the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court on 11 and 17 July 2014. The further judgment of Preston CJ was not handed down until 31 July 2014. Thus, it may be accepted that what his Honour said on 25 June 2014 reflected the view which his Honour then had and intended to put in place, subject to further negotiations between the parties and further arguments that may be advanced.   
	
	
	The fact that his Honour did not deliver the final judgment in this set of proceedings until 31 July 2014 is not to the point, in my view.
	
	
	The Accused has sought to make an issue in the trial, the potentially large cost of fencing if substantial parts of “Colorado” and “Strathdoon” had to be fenced. The evidence of Grant Turnbull is that the property was always intended to be a farming property only with no grazing. That was, in fact, the entire purpose of the operation which was underway to prepare the properties after their purchase in 2011.
	
	
	In my view, the Accused, having raised the issue of the cost of the fencing, renders admissible the Crown's questions on this issue. The question which is relevant is what was the known position as at 29 July 2014. On the process which was underway in the Land and Environment Court, the known position at that time was that the Chief Judge of that Court had expressed a conclusion that would be favourable to the applicants, and would see a very limited involvement of fencing, if any at all.
	
	
	In earlier judgments where questions have been asked about parts of decisions of the Land and Environment Court, reference has been made to s.91 Evidence Act 1995: R v Turnbull (No. 16) [2016] NSWSC 788; R v Turnbull (No. 18) [2016] NSWSC 792. I have adopted the approach that if the issue had been raised by earlier questions asked, it was appropriate that there be further questioning allowed on that topic. I adopt the same approach to the present objection.
	
	
	In my view, questioning about the potential cost of fencing, if it is to be relevant at all to any issue in this trial, should be placed in the context of the position as it stood on 29 July 2014.
	
	
	For that purpose, I will allow the Crown to ask questions of Grant Turnbull utilising parts of this judgment. Having so ruled, this ought be done in a controlled fashion and by reference to particular parts of the judgment which bear on this topic. Accordingly, I overrule the objection to the question asked by the Crown.

2769469,R v Turnbull (No. 19) [2016] NSWSC 793,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of the evidence-in-chief of Grant Turnbull, the son of the Accused, senior counsel for the Accused sought to tender a letter dated 30 April 2014 from Cole & Butler, solicitors, to the Honourable Kevin Humphries MP (MFI78). Objection was taken to the tender of the letter by the Crown. Submissions were deferred to avoid further interruption of evidence in the presence of the jury.
	
	
	I have heard submissions now with respect to the objection. Evidence was given yesterday by the Accused concerning contact made with Mr Humphries, who was the State Member of Parliament, in April/May 2014 (T879-880). The letter (MFI78) was not the subject of direct evidence yesterday, in the sense that the Accused was not shown the letter, nor was it marked at that point or tendered.
	
	
	The Accused said (at T880, line 11), that he had read a letter but had forgotten, but had read it again “the other day”. And that is where matters were left with the Accused in evidence-in-chief.
	
	
	Today, more detailed evidence was given by Grant Turnbull about events surrounding the contact with Mr Humphries.
	
	
	The letter from Cole & Butler sets out what are said to be the instructions given by the Accused and Grant Turnbull in a number of respects. They involve some strong views expressed, as opinions or conclusions, about aspects of the conduct of Officers of the Environment and Heritage. There is already evidence that there was contact by the Accused and Grant Turnbull with Mr Humphries.
	
	
	Evidence of conversations with Mr Humphries were not led yesterday, and if they had been led, there would have been difficulty with their admission.
	
	
	This letter is another form of communication with Mr Humphries, not setting out reference to precise events, but conclusions, opinions or impressions on the part of the Accused and Grant Turnbull.
	
	
	In answer to an inquiry by the Court, senior counsel for the Accused indicated that it was not tendered as evidence of the truth of the fact. The question would then arise as to what use it would have, in circumstances where it is sought to place the letter before the jury as evidence in the trial.
	
	
	The content of the letter which contains opinions and conclusions is, in my view, inadmissible. Nothing has happened in the course of the trial which renders the letter itself admissible. I decline to admit MFI78.

2769473,Application by Alex Jimenez under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2016] NSWSC 635,"DECISION


	
	Pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“the Act”), Alex Jimenez (“the applicant”) applies for an inquiry into his conviction for an offence contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 of possessing child abuse material on 2 June 2010.
	
	
	On 10 January 2011, the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence in the Local Court. He was convicted of the offence and fined $6,600 by O’Shane LCM.
	
	
	He lodged an appeal to the District Court of NSW, seeking leave to appeal against his conviction, to have his conviction quashed, and to have the matter returned to the Local Court to have the question of his guilt determined afresh.
	
	
	On 5 September 2011, Berman DCJ refused the applicant’s application to appeal against his conviction.
	


Relevant Legislation


	
	Sections 78 and 79 of the Act relevantly provide:
	


“78   Applications to Supreme Court

An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.

79   Consideration of applications

After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

it appears that the matter:

has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A) …

(3B) …

(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”

Applicable Principles


	
	In determining this application, the Court is engaged in an administrative task or function. That function is not another avenue of appeal; it is a function engaged once the criminal justice system has run its course following a trial and an appeal: see Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 at [4] ff per Johnson J. That the proceedings are not judicial proceedings is expressly stated in s 79(4) of the Act.
	
	
	This Court’s powers under s 79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, there being no power to quash a conviction or sentence. The precondition for the exercise of these powers is the appearance of a “doubt or question” as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case, or as to any part of the evidence in the case. This precondition will be satisfied if there is available material which causes the decision-maker “… unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand”: Holland at [6].
	
	
	Given the nature of the Court’s jurisdiction under Part 7, there is some flexibility involved in terms of the material which may be placed before the court in support of an application for an inquiry or referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	


Relevant Factual Background


	
	On 2 June 2010, Mr Jimenez was arrested at Sydney Airport as he entered Australia. During a search conducted of him and his possessions, a USB drive was found. A full examination of the USB drive conducted at a later point in time identified a total of 53 images, all apparently depicting the same female. The officer who examined the images formed the opinion that the female in them was approximately 12-14 years of age. By reference to the COPINE scale developed by the UK Sentencing Panel in 2002, the officer categorised the images in this way:
	



	
	31 images depicting erotic posing with no sexual activity (Level 1);
	
	
	13 images depicting the female masturbating (Level 2); and
	
	
	9 images showing the female in various poses restrained by ropes (Level 5).
	



	
	As a result of this examination, Mr Jimenez was arrested and cautioned. He was interviewed.
	
	
	Following the interview he was charged with a single offence of possession of child abuse material contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act. It was to this offence that he ultimately pleaded guilty.
	
	
	After two further interviews, on 4 and 10 June 2010 respectively, Mr Jimenez was served with a court attendance notice for a further charge of using a carriage service to access child pornography material, contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).
	
	
	On 14 September 2010, Mr Jimenez’s solicitor, Mr Watson, made representations to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (“CDPP”) proposing that the Commonwealth offence be withdrawn and the State offence be dealt with in the Local Court’s summary jurisdiction. On 15 November, the CDPP replied to Mr Watson indicating that the course he proposed would be followed.
	
	
	When the matter returned to Local Court on 30 November 2010, the Crown tendered to O’Shane LCM an agreed Statement of Facts, the full and complete transcripts of the three interviews between Mr Jimenez and officers of the Australian Federal Police (“the AFP”), and a disc containing the 53 images. Mr Watson provided various written submissions and tendered various documents on behalf of Mr Jimenez.
	
	
	O’Shane LCM adjourned the matter for sentence to 10 January 2011 to allow herself time to read the tendered material, view the images, and enable witnesses to be called.
	
	
	On 10 January 2011, the sentencing hearing took place before O’Shane LCM. This included the applicant himself giving evidence, and a number of the witnesses. Ultimately, the solicitor for the applicant submitted that an order should be made under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and that no conviction be recorded.
	
	
	On 14 January 2011, O’Shane LCM convicted the applicant and imposed a fine of $6,600.
	
	
	On 25 January 2011, the applicant lodged a Notice of Appeal, appealing his sentence to the District Court. In addition, the applicant sought leave to appeal against his conviction. The applicant contended before the District Court that although he had pleaded guilty to the offence in the Local Court, it could not be established that the images were of a child.
	
	
	On 5 September 2011, Berman DCJ delivered two judgments, the first refusing leave to Mr Jimenez to appeal against his conviction and the second dismissing Mr Jimenez’s appeal against his sentence.
	
	
	In the first judgment, Berman DCJ said the following:
	


“[The applicant] has sworn an affidavit. It indicates that the only issue that [the applicant] would have tested, were the matter returned to the local court, was the age of the person depicted in the photographs. It was his view that she is over the age of 18. Clearly, if the person in question was over the age of 18 then no offence has been committed.”


	
	His Honour went on to say that both parties to the appeal had agreed that he should view the images. After viewing the images, his Honour said:
	


“I can say categorically that I am firmly of the view that there is no way in the world she is 18 or above. I fully appreciate that people mature, and more clearly young girls mature at different rates, but every aspect of the images suggests a girl well below the age of 18, and probably around the age of 13.”


	
	Accordingly, his Honour concluded:
	


“I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the images were clearly of a girl well below the age of 18. As was agreed, that is enough to determine this application. I refuse the application to allow [the applicant] to appeal against his conviction.”

Grounds of the Application


	
	The Application is somewhat discursive. It is unfocussed, and deals with a wide range of matters, not all of which are directly relevant. As well, a number of documents have been supplied by the applicant in support of his Application, the relevance of which is unestablished.
	
	
	The submissions made on behalf of the Attorney-General helpfully distil the Application into nine grounds. They are:
	


“(a)   That his plea of guilty should not stand as it was entered on incorrect legal advice and he had entered into a ‘false plea bargain’.

(b)   That he was sentenced by Magistrate O’Shane, who has been the subject of complaints to the Judicial Commission of NSW.

(c)   That his solicitor (Mr Watson) who appeared on his behalf at the Local Court hearing on 10 January 2011, failed to mention various matters on his behalf.

(d)   That various defences were available to the Applicant under s 91H(4)(a), (c) and/or s 91H(5) of the Crimes Act 1900.

(e)   That no conviction or fine should have been imposed, and an order should have been made under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

(f)   That Judge Berman should not have granted his sister, Ms Abraham, leave to appear on his behalf at his District Court appeal. It is also suggested that Judge Berman was biased against him.

(g)   That Judge Berman failed to accord Mr Jimenez procedural fairness.

(h)   That it could not be proved that the females depicted in the images were children.

(i)   That he should be granted a pardon and removed from the child protection register, or granted a fresh hearing.”


	
	As the relevant test under the legislation requires me to consider whether there appears to be a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt or, put another way, whether the available material causes me unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction to stand, it is unnecessary for me to consider every ground if one of the grounds leads to that state of mind.
	
	
	Conveniently, I will commence with a consideration of the first ground nominated by the applicant, as encapsulated by the Attorney-General, namely whether the applicant’s plea of guilty should not stand as it was entered into on an incorrect legal basis.
	


Discernment


	
	The charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty was contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act, namely being in possession of child abuse material. For the purposes of that section, “child” is defined in s 91FA of the Crimes Act as a person who is under the age of 16 years.
	
	
	For the purposes of the Commonwealth offence with which the applicant was initially charged under s 474.19 of the Criminal Code Act, namely using a carriage service to access child pornography material, “child pornography material” is defined in s 473.1 as material that depicts a person who is or appears to be under 18 years of age.
	
	
	It is to be recalled that on the first occasion when the matter came before O’Shane LCM, her Honour was informed that the Commonwealth DPP was withdrawing the charge for the Commonwealth offence and only proceeding with the charge for the Crimes Act offence. Consequently, the prosecution needed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the female depicted in the images was a person under the age of 16 years.
	
	
	In the sentencing hearing on 10 January 2011, a factual issue arose before O’Shane LCM as to the age of the female depicted in the images. The following exchange occurred between the Bench, Mr Watson who was the applicant’s solicitor, and Ms Catsanos who appeared for the CDPP:
	


“Her Honour:   This is child pornography.

Watson:   It’s child pornography of a young girl. There’s a bit of dispute, but she’s in her teens, somewhere between 14 and …

Her Honour:   18, it would have to be.

Watson:   I think the prosecution said between 12 and …

Her Honour:   Is 18 the age of …

Catsanos:   That’s correct.

Her Honour:   Is for the law, our legal purposes …

Watson:   Yes, she’s a child.”


	
	Her Honour was informed that while the precise age of the female was in dispute, the parties were at one that she was a “child” for the purpose of the Crimes Act offence.
	
	
	In further exchanges between Mr Watson and O’Shane LCM, it became clear that O’Shane LCM had, by looking at the images, formed the view that the female was somewhere between the ages of 12 and 16, but that her Honour had in mind that the relevant age for the purpose of the charge was 18.
	
	
	As recounted earlier, the applicant was convicted in the Local Court.
	
	
	When Berman DCJ was considering the question of whether or not to grant leave to appeal against conviction, his Honour asked to look at the images. He did so. There was then a discussion with Ms Abraham, the applicant’s sister, to whom the Court had granted leave to appear on behalf of the applicant. The following exchange occurred:
	


“His Honour:   … well Ms Abraham, there’s many legal principles that govern the matter, there’s evidence that has to be called but it would all be futile, if I was satisfied that there is no possibility in the wide world that … young girl was older than 18 wouldn’t it?

Abraham:   Your Honour, I must say to your Honour I’m not convinced 100% sure that she is an 18 year old …

…

His Honour:   My question is, if I was satisfied that there is no way in the world that the person depicted in that image and the other ones I’ve seen, was under 18 then the proceeding further is futile, isn’t it?

Abraham:   Yes your Honour.”


	
	Then his Honour took submissions from Ms Abraham on behalf of the applicant as to whether or not he ought to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the female in the images was over 18 years old.
	
	
	In his decision, Berman DCJ expressed the view that he was firmly satisfied that “… there is no way in the world she is 18 or above”.
	
	
	It is clear from these exchanges that the wrong question has been addressed in these two proceedings. The prosecution had to prove, as an element of the offence under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act, that the person depicted in the images found in the applicant’s possession was a “child”, being a person under the age of 16 years. Throughout these proceedings, it has been assumed, wrongly, that a “child” for the purposes of the Crimes Act offence is a person under the age of 18 years. In particular:
	



	
	On 14 September 2010, Mr Watson wrote to the CDPP, stating that “[n]o issue is taken that the material depicts a female who appears to be under 18 and thus a child within the meaning of the legislation”;
	
	
	In the Local Court proceedings, Ms Catsanos for the CDPP and Mr Watson for the applicant referred to the relevant age of a “child” as being under 18 years;
	
	
	In the District Court proceedings, Ms Abraham for the applicant referred to the relevant age of a “child” as being under 18 years; and
	
	
	Both O’Shane LCM and Berman DCJ proceeded on the understanding that the relevant age was18 years, and this understanding was not corrected.
	



	
	Prima facie, a plea of guilty is an admission of all the elements of the offence. However, a miscarriage of justice may occur if a plea of guilty is permitted to stand in circumstances where there has been a failure on the part of the applicant to appreciate the true nature of the charge to which the plea was entered or, alternatively, that there was a mistake or other circumstance which affected the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt: see Meissner v The Queen [1995] HCA 41; (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157. A miscarriage of justice will also occur if the advice of the applicant’s lawyers is imprudent, inappropriate or incorrect: see R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97; R v Hawker [2005] NSWCCA 118.
	
	
	The Attorney-General in her submissions on this Application accepts that it is clear that the proceedings in both the Local Court and the District Court erroneously proceeded on the basis that the meaning of a “child” for the purpose of s 91H of the Crimes Act was a person under the age 18.
	
	
	The Attorney-General accepts that this erroneous approach may itself be sufficient to give rise to a question or doubt as to the applicant’s guilt.
	
	
	That question or doubt as to the applicant’s guilt could be resolved by me by looking at the images in question.
	
	
	However, the Court has been informed that the images are no longer available. In that circumstance, the Attorney-General submitted that:
	


“It is conceded that if the images are no longer available, there would remain a doubt or question as to [the applicant’s] guilt, and the appropriate course would be for the matter to be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.”


	
	I have concluded that I have a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt because of the erroneous approach of both of the Courts that have dealt with the applicant’s matter, and in particular the erroneous approach of the applicant’s solicitor in providing advice to the applicant as to whether or not it was in his interests to plead guilty to the offence. That doubt cannot be resolved by me in the absence of the images of the female in question.
	
	
	In those circumstances it is inappropriate that I express any view as to the other grounds of the Application.
	
	
	Accordingly, I conclude that it is appropriate for me to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	


Order


	
	I make the following order:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

2769478,R v Turnbull (No. 22) [2016] NSWSC 801,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of the evidence-in-chief of Anna Simmons, called in the defence case, senior counsel for the Accused has tendered a document (MFI83), which is said to be a version of the incident on 21 August 2012 as provided by Ms Simmons to an officer of the Office of Environment and Heritage.
	
	
	There has been an objection to the tender of this document. The evidence of Ms Simmons was that she left a copy of this document on the seat of a vehicle owned by the Accused.
	
	
	The Accused gave evidence on Monday this week. He was asked questions in examination-in-chief as to what he had been told about the incident involving Ms Simmons on 21 August 2012. It is appropriate to refer to the entire evidence of the Accused on this aspect (T879, lines 12-32):
	


Q. And having spoken to Cory and having spoken to Mr Spencer, did you also speak with Anna Simmons at some stage? 

A. Probably a day or two later. 

Q. And did you come to learn that Mr Turner had said something to Anna Simmons a couple of days earlier when she, Ms Simmons, was on Strathdoon? 

A. Yes. 

Q. What did you learn? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I object to that. 

ALEXIS: I understand the objection.

Q. What was said to you, Mr Turnbull? 

A. Mr Turner told Ms Simmons, Mrs Simmons, that he would keep at the Turnbulls till he put them off their farms. 

Q. How did that make you feel when you heard that, Mr Turnbull? 

A. Of course I didn't like that at all.”


	
	Senior counsel for the Accused then moved to another topic.
	
	
	It will be apparent that there was no question asked as to whether the Accused had received any document from Ms Simmons which is said to relate to this topic. Nor were any further questions asked as to whether anything else had been said by Ms Simmons to the Accused. It was a matter for senior counsel for the Accused to ask questions of the Accused on this topic. What was asked is, self-evidently, what is apparent in the transcript.
	
	
	With respect to the objection to MFI83 by the Crown, there is no evidence that this document came into the possession of the Accused, or that he took it into account. In those circumstances, that reason alone warrants not admitting it into evidence in the trial, and I decline to admit MFI83.
	
	
	The oral evidence of Ms Simmons in examination-in-chief had reached the point where senior counsel for the Accused had brought her to an occasion which she described as being a few weeks later, when she saw the Accused near one of the old oat sheds on the property and had a conversation with him. Objection was taken to that question, and I asked the jury to retire.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused indicated that he anticipated that Ms Simmons would give evidence that she spoke to the Accused about the incident said to involve Mr Turner, the effect of that incident on her, and other aspects as well.
	
	
	The primary basis for allowing evidence to be given of what was said to the Accused about the 21 August 2012 incident is what impact it is said to have had upon him, for the purpose of, what the defence argue, is a type of cumulative process arising from his involvement with officers of the Office of Environment and Heritage. The indication to the Accused that something had happened, and the impact on him, is the primary purpose of this being admitted in the first place. There is evidence from the Accused on that very topic (see [3] above).
	
	
	It seems to me, in these circumstances, that if what is sought from Ms Simmons is an expanded recital of things allegedly said to the Accused, which have not been referred to in his evidence as having been said or having an effect on him, this would involve an element of unfairness in the trial.
	
	
	It may be taken that the Accused has the benefit of the evidence which he gave as to what he had been told and the effect on him (T879). However, I will not allow evidence to be given by Ms Simmons which recites a conversation at what seems to be a different time to that referred to by the Accused in his evidence-in-chief. The Accused has the benefit of the evidence which he has given on this aspect.
	
	
	I decline to allow the present witness to give evidence of the matter she discussed with the Accused on the occasion to which she refers near the oat sheds a few weeks after 21 August 2012.

		21 June 2016",2016-05-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769479,R v Turnbull (No. 21) [2016] NSWSC 800,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused has called in the defence case Gary Adam Spencer.
	
	
	The Accused seeks to adduce evidence from Mr Spencer with respect to events in August 2012. At that time, Mr Spencer was an officer with the Office of Environment and Heritage (""OEH""). Specifically, evidence is sought to be adduced from Mr Spencer concerning events on 21 August 2012, when a conversation is said to have taken place between Glen Turner and Anna Simmons, on the property ""Strathdoon"". Mr Spencer was present at the time of the conversation.
	
	
	The Crown objects to this evidence. I commenced to hear submissions yesterday afternoon on the objection, and those submissions have continued this morning, including the provision of a short written outline of submissions for the Accused (MFI80).
	
	
	The evidence which has drawn the objection is a conversation, of which notes are made in MFI64, in Mr Spencer's 2012 work notebook. It is said that Mr Turner spoke to Ms Simmons, a number of questions were asked in relation to aspects of the Turnbull family and then a question was asked:
	


""The Turnbulls have been clearing contrary to the NV Act and we are going to get them for that. It's clear they are doing this for the money"".


	
	According to Mr Spencer's note, Ms Simmons replied, ""I don't know anything about it"".
	
	
	The Accused submits that this is relevant to a number of issues in the trial. Firstly, substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, because it is said to relate to the Accused's mental state, including his perception of persecution, and may have contributed to the emergence of depression. Secondly, it is said that it goes to the partial defence of extreme provocation, upon which the Accused seeks to rely, in that it is said to disclose an attitude on the part of Mr Turner to the Turnbulls. Thirdly, it is said that the material goes to a broader question of context.
	
	
	I should note, as well, that the Accused, if allowed, would seek to adduce evidence from Mr Spencer of two further conversations on 22 August 2012 and 24 August 2012, where he is said to have spoken by telephone with the Accused. I will return to those matters.
	
	
	I note that in the evidence-in-chief of the Accused, he was asked questions about having met Mr Spencer and having some contact with him (T878-879). There was no evidence adduced from the Accused about anything that Mr Spencer said to him. The Accused was asked whether Ms Simmons had spoken to the Accused about this incident involving Mr Turner on 21 August 2012. The Accused was asked what had been said to him by Ms Simmons, and he said (T879, line 28):
	


""Mr Turner told Ms Simmons, Mrs Simmons, that he would keep at the Turnbulls until he put them off their farms.

Q. How did that make you feel when you heard that, Mr Turnbull? A. Of course, I didn't like that at all.""


	
	The Crown objects to the conversation of 21 August 2012 upon the basis that it is hearsay and that it is not relevant to any issue in the trial.
	
	
	There is already before the jury, in the portion of the evidence of the Accused which I have just mentioned, evidence of what Ms Simmons told the Accused about this event, and the Accused's reaction to it. It seems to me that the conversation of 21 August 2012 is at least relevant to some issues in the trial. At the least, it provides an account of the actual conversation which may be capable of being compared, or contrasted, with what Ms Simmons reported to the Accused. In circumstances where the account given to the Accused is in evidence, and will be the subject of submissions, I am satisfied that the primary account itself ought be admitted.
	
	
	In taking that approach, however, I am not indicating any firm view that this bears in any real way on the substantial impairment issue. There is force in the Crown submission that this incident is some two years before 29 July 2014. That said, the defence contends, as I understand it, that there was an accumulation of factors that are said to contribute to this incident. I say no more about that topic except to record that I regard this conversation as being relevant to that issue.
	
	
	The subject of extreme provocation has already been the subject of submissions, and a judgment in R v Turnbull (No. 5) [2016] NSWSC 439. Further submissions will be made on that topic, I have been told, at the close of the defence case. In allowing this evidence, I should not be taken to be accepting that this evidence bears upon the issue of extreme provocation. I understand that the Accused wishes to contend at some point that it does. However, my ruling allowing this should not be interpreted as being in any way accepting that this material provides a foundation for extreme provocation. Having made that clear, however, I am satisfied that it is relevant for other reasons.
	
	
	I will, therefore, allow Mr Spencer to give evidence of the conversation at about 3.00 pm on 21 August 2012. I note that in his evidence yesterday, at one point, he sought leave to refer to his notes. I take it that what he was seeking leave to look at was in fact the notes which are MFI64, which I am utilising for the purpose of this ruling.
	
	
	In allowing evidence from Mr Spencer of the conversation I will, of course, allow evidence to be given of what was said and what he observed. The ruling I am making does not allow commentary or opinion beyond that, any more than it would if a police officer was giving evidence of a conversation with a person. There are well known limits to the evidence which can be adduced in circumstances such as this.
	
	
	I turn to the second and third conversations, which were between Mr Spencer and the Accused. In my view, these are in a different category. There are a number of difficulties with these conversations. The conversation on 22 August 2012 appears to contain largely what the Accused said he was told by Cory Turnbull about the Anna Simmons incident. Beyond that it is, in my view, clearly hearsay.
	
	
	I note, in particular, that the Accused did not give any evidence about these conversations with Mr Spencer. These were not put forward as conversations about this incident which fed into, or contributed to, the Accused's state of mind on this issue.
	
	
	I do not think the fact that Mr Spencer at the time may have been an OEH officer, and that these were, in some way, part of the contact between OEH and the Accused renders them relevant. I do not propose to admit the second conversation, that which was on 22 August 2012.
	
	
	The third conversation, on 24 August 2012, is, in my view, in a similar category. It is attended by the difficulties to which I have referred in the context of the second conversation.
	
	
	Accordingly, my ruling is that the first conversation may be given. I would have no difficulty, subject to what counsel wish to say, in Mr Spencer utilising the notes to refresh his memory for the purpose of giving evidence, given that that seems to be the course which he would seek to take.
	
	
	Accordingly, I allow evidence of the conversation of 21 August 2012, as contained in MFI64. I decline to allow evidence of the conversations of 22 and 24 August 2012, as contained in MFI 64.

2769496,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 53) [2016] NSWSC 653,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	The Crown has sought that a direction be given to the jury that each of the accused has told a series of lies which amount to evidence of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	In the case of McNamara, the Crown submitted that he had said that:
	



	
	he had ""ripped"" the label from Exh. BT;
	
	
	he did not take the drugs into his apartment.
	
	
	the reason that he had the vehicle BV67PX was to take rubbish to the tip;
	
	
	he took rubbish to the tip in that vehicle;
	
	
	he took his boat out on 19 May 2014 from Hunter Self Storage for the reasons he stated;
	
	
	he saw Fiona Schultz from New Holland Publishing in person in February or March of 2014, for the purposes of discussing his proposed book;
	
	
	he conducted what he described as a ""covert operation"" whilst in custody, in order to gather evidence against Rogerson; and
	
	
	he had not discussed, in the conversation with Rogerson which took place following the meeting that he had with the deceased at the Meridian Hotel on 15 May 2014, anything about the proposed supply of drugs.
	



	
	Each of these statements was asserted by the Crown to be a lie.
	
	
	In the case of Rogerson, the Crown submitted that he had said that:
	



	
	McNamara had stalled the vehicle BV67PX at a position on Davies Road when commencing his turn into Bridge Road, at about 1.13pm on 20 May 2014, as a consequence of which Rogerson had moved his car around it;
	
	
	he did not know the location of McNamara's vehicle in Arab Road on the afternoon of 20 May 2014;
	
	
	he could offer no explanation for the period of 8 minutes in which he was in unit 803 from 1.16pm to 1.24pm on 20 May 2014;
	
	
	the period was 10 to 12 minutes in a conversation with his wife, Anne Melocco;
	
	
	he returned the keys to storage unit 803 to Michael Maguire on 23 May 2014;
	
	
	he gave back to Mr Maguire all of the keys that Mr Maguire had originally given to him;
	
	
	he could not say whether the black tracksuit pants he had worn on 20 May 2014 were washed prior to being sought by the police;
	
	
	he could not say whether he had seen investigators at Rent-a-Space on the morning of 22 May 2014;
	
	
	whilst listening to the news in Queensland (in the company of Mr Farley) about being wanted in connection with a kidnapping, he said to Mr Farley ""I don't know anything about it""; and
	
	
	he remained at Grays Point for a period of one to two hours on 21 May 2014 ""contemplating things"", at a time when McNamara was engaged in disposing of the body of the deceased.
	



	
	Each of these statements was also asserted by the Crown to be a lie.
	
	
	Counsel for the respective accused did not take issue with the proposition that the statements relied upon by the Crown were capable, if found by the jury to be deliberate lies, of being used by the jury to assess issues of credit. However, both counsel objected to a direction being given to the jury that the asserted lies were capable of amounting to evidence of a consciousness of guilt. In essence, the submission made by counsel for each of the accused was that on the Crown case, the entirety of the account of each of the accused was a lie, and that the use of lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt was inappropriate, because it would require the jury to engage in a process of impermissible circular reasoning.
	
	
	The circumstances in which a direction of the kind sought by the Crown can be given were discussed in Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193, and by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157. In order for a lie told by an accused to be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt, a number of pre-requisites must be satisfied, namely:
	



	
	the statement said to be a lie must be false or wrong;
	
	
	it must be deliberate;
	
	
	it must go to a material issue in the proceedings;
	
	
	there must be evidence to support the proposition that the motivation for the lie was a realisation of guilt, and a fear of the truth; and
	
	
	the statement said to constitute the lie must clearly be shown to be a lie by some evidence, or by an admission.
	



	
	In Lane (supra) Simpson J (as her Honour then was) observed (at [61]) that the factual falsity of a statement made by an accused person may, like the Crown case as a whole, be established by circumstantial evidence. Her Honour went on to observe that the Crown had sought to prove the factual falsity of three statements made by the accused by relying upon circumstantial evidence, which she described as amounting to ""a circumstantial case within a circumstantial case"".
	
	
	In an earlier decision of R v Zheng (1995) 83 A Crim R 572, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Smart and Studdert JJ agreed) warned against the adoption of a process of circular reasoning in order to determine whether a statement made by an accused could amount to a lie, and therefore be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. His Honour observed that if the only logical way in which the jury could be satisfied that a statement made by an accused amounted to a lie was by an acceptance of the Crown case, then the evidence could not be used in the way in which the Crown in the present case seeks to use it (see also Lane (supra) per McClellan CJ at CL at [14]). If, in reality, the process of reasoning which must be adopted in order to establish that a statement is a lie is really a matter of assessing the credibility of an accused in the light of the Crown case as a whole, then the asserted lie is not available for the purpose for which the Crown presently seeks to use it: R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 672 at [33].
	
	
	The Crown case against both accused is that they engaged in the execution of the deceased for the purposes of what might be colloquially described as a ""drug rip off"". The matters relied upon by the Crown to establish the falsity of McNamara’s statements in (1), (2), (3), (6), (7) and (8) above are, in effect, the very same matters upon which the Crown relies in order to prove its case. In other words, the two bodies of evidence are essentially co-existent. Contrary to the position in Lane, the present is not a case where there could be said to be one circumstantial case within another.
	
	
	The statement attributed to McNamara in (4) is slightly different. That arises from other statements made by him in the course of his evidence concerning the use of the vehicle BV67PX for the purposes of taking rubbish to the tip. In his evidence-in-chief, the clear effect of McNamara's evidence was that the vehicle was used for that purpose. When he was cross-examined, he retreated from that proposition. He later explained that this apparent inconsistency was due to the fact that he had made a mistake.
	
	
	As I have observed, in order to establish that a statement is a lie, such that it can be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt, it must be established that the lie was deliberate, and was told as a consequence of a realisation of guilt, and a fear of the truth. Arguably, the circumstances in which the statement in (4) was made would be capable of meeting that test. At the same time, an explanation was given by McNamara, the acceptance or rejection of which will ultimately be a matter for the jury. Moreover, in circumstances where the vast majority of the statements sought to be relied upon by the Crown as lies are not able to be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the asserted lie concerning the use of BV67PX would, if the direction sought by the Crown was given, have the capacity to lend itself to some degree of confusion. That, in turn, would attract the application of s. 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) to limit the use of the evidence.
	
	
	What then remains in the case of McNamara is the statement in (5) which was made to his wife in a telephone conversation. He admitted in evidence that the statement was untrue, and he gave a reason for making it. I am satisfied that there is evidence to establish that the statement was a deliberate lie. However there must be some doubt as to its materiality. Certainly the issue of whether or not McNamara was in fact researching a book during the period up to the time of the deceased's death is very much an issue in this case. The statement made by him concerning contact he may or may not have made with a prospective publisher could be viewed as being one step removed from that issue. In any event, even if that were not the case, s. 136 of the Act would lend itself, in my view, to the evidence being limited to evidence going to his credit.
	
	
	A similar position exists with the statements relied upon by the Crown in respect of Rogerson. A conclusion that the statements in (1) to (8) inclusive, and (10), are deliberate lies really depends upon an acceptance of the Crown case as a whole.
	
	
	The statement in (9) is different. Evidence was given by Mr Farley of the fact that Rogerson had said to him words to the effect that he “did not know anything about” the circumstances in which the deceased had gone missing. Rogerson agreed in evidence that he had a conversation with Mr Farley. However, he denied saying the words attributed to him by Mr Farley, and stated that he had told Mr Farley, upon hearing a news broadcast relating to the kidnapping of the deceased, that he “didn’t even hear the guy’s name”.
	
	
	There is a clear inconsistency between these respective accounts. Even if the statement attributed to Rogerson by Mr Farley is capable of meeting the various tests that I have outlined, the fact remains that out of 10 asserted lies relied upon by the Crown, 9 can go only to Rogerson’s credit. A separate direction in the terms sought by the Crown in respect of the one remaining statement relied upon as a lie would again give rise to considerable confusion in my view. In those circumstances, s. 136 should again apply to the asserted lie in (9) so as to limit its use.
	
	
	For these reasons, the direction sought by the Crown will not be given. However, consistent with the accepted position of counsel for each of the accused, the jury will be directed that it if they find that any statement(s) relied upon by the Crown constitutes a lie, it can be used to assess the credibility of the particular accused who made such statement(s).

2769499,Clarke v R [2016] NSWCCA 88,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Introduction

The applicant brings this appeal against conviction pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). He relies upon a single ground of appeal as follows:

The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	The applicant was convicted on 16 October 2014 as a result of a trial before RA Hulme J and a jury of the offence of murder.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on 5 December 2014 to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months commencing 19 September 2013 and expiring 18 March 2030, with an additional term of 5 years and 6 months expiring 18 September 2035.
	


The Crown case


	
	The applicant resided in a ground floor unit comprising a living room and adjacent kitchen and a single bedroom with en-suite bathroom in a Housing Commission unit block in Hamilton South in Newcastle. The deceased, Deborah Marie Wolfgram, resided in a Housing Commission unit at Cooks Hill, also in Newcastle.
	
	
	On Wednesday 18 September 2013 the deceased went to the applicant’s unit block to purchase some cannabis. She gave $10 to another resident, who took the money and did not return. The deceased became irate and was complaining loudly to other residents that she had been “ripped off” and had no money to get home. The applicant invited the deceased into his unit.
	
	
	The applicant had been drinking alcohol since midday or 1pm. At about 5.30pm Lance Paynter brought him some home made spirits in a Midori bottle and a vodka bottle. The applicant and the deceased continued to drink the homemade spirits into the evening. A number of residents and friends, including Les O’Brien, Paul Harvey, David Fletcher, Mark Crooks and Catherine Jarvis came into contact with the applicant during the afternoon and evening and each made observations concerning his state of intoxication.
	
	
	At about 9pm Mr O’Brien called police about a baby monitor camera he had lent to the applicant. At 9.15pm Constables Armitage and Nonkovski attended the applicant’s unit and each made observations of his state of intoxication. After police departed, Mr O’Brien visited the applicant’s unit.
	
	
	Mr Harvey, the applicant’s next door neighbour, was drinking with the applicant and the deceased. He accompanied a friend to a train station and returned to the applicant’s unit at about 10pm. Mr Harvey, the applicant and the deceased continued to drink and also smoked some cannabis. Mr Harvey observed that the deceased was touching the applicant’s leg while they sat on the lounge. Sometime after midnight but before 1am, the applicant said that he had to go to sleep. Mr Harvey got a pillow and a blanket for the deceased from his unit and put them on the lounge for her. The applicant went to bed and Mr Harvey returned to his unit. Sometime after 3am, Mr Harvey heard some thumps on the wall but was unsure whether they came from upstairs or next door. He got up and saw the light on in the applicant’s bathroom.
	
	
	At about 8.30am on the following morning the applicant phoned a friend, Christopher Little. The applicant said that he was in trouble and needed to talk. Mr Little drove to the applicant’s unit and observed that the applicant vomited into his kitchen sink. The applicant and Mr Little then went for a drive around Newcastle. The applicant told Mr Little he had been drinking in his unit with a girl the night before and that he hit and killed her. The applicant said that he might get rid of the body in the sand dunes at Belmont. Mr Little suggested that the applicant tell the police that he had been attacked and acted in self defence. Mr Little dropped the applicant back at his unit. The applicant asked Mr Little not to tell anyone.
	
	
	Mr Little contacted Senior Constable Clayton, a detective he had known for some years. He told Detective Clayton that the applicant had killed a woman in his unit the night before.
	
	
	At about 4.20pm on 19 September the applicant phoned Kim James, a former girlfriend and Mr Harvey’s sister. He asked to borrow Ms James’ car to go to Swansea in the early hours of the following morning.
	
	
	At about 4.30pm Detective Sergeant Wink attended the unit block and found the applicant in a neighbour’s unit. When asked the applicant agreed that there was someone dead in his unit and he was arrested.
	
	
	Police searched the applicant’s unit and found the deceased’s body between the bed and an adjacent wall wrapped in a blanket. When the body was turned over, blood was found on the underside of the mattress. The blood was later analysed and confirmed to be that of the deceased. Bed linen and the deceased’s clothing were found in a bag in the wardrobe. There were traces of blood in the bathroom and shower.
	
	
	The applicant was interviewed later on 19 September. He said that he was unable to recall what had happened because he had been drinking. Nevertheless, he recounted that he had awoken during the preceding night to find someone standing over him in bed, which reminded him of abuse he suffered in his youth by his uncle. The applicant said that he grabbed the person by the throat and punched the person repeatedly.
	
	
	On 20 September 2013 the applicant spoke with Detective Senior Constable Grob in the Newcastle Police Station cells. The applicant said that he was sorry and wanted to give everything he owned to the deceased’s family. The applicant said that he could recall nothing more of what had happened but wished to speak further with police.
	
	
	On 16 October 2013 the applicant was interviewed again. He said that he could remember nothing more but had experienced flashbacks, dreams and nightmares. The applicant said that he now believed that he thought the deceased had been a former girlfriend, Sara Nixon. Ms Nixon had threatened him with knives. Ms Nixon and her boyfriend, Paul Watts, had threatened to kill him and had been at his unit block on 18 September 2013.
	
	
	In each interview the applicant mentioned the person standing over him having a knife which he put in the kitchen sink. No knife had been found in the sink during the search of the applicant’s unit. A serrated knife found in a block near the kitchen sink bore DNA consistent with that of the deceased but the applicant denied that it was the knife involved.
	
	
	Dr Beer, a forensic pathologist, conducted a post-mortem examination of the deceased on 20 September 2013. The deceased had a number of facial injuries consistent with punches to the face. The deceased lay bleeding for some time and a mass of blood and mucus formed in her upper airway so that she was unable to breathe. Blunt force trauma was a factor in the sequence of events leading to her death.
	


The defence case


	
	No evidence was called in the defence case. The applicant’s accounts in interviews with the police were relied upon to support a case that the applicant acted in self-defence. The defence case asserted that the applicant’s acts were a reaction to circumstances as he perceived them, which included his experience of night terrors as a result of sexual abuse he suffered as a teenager at the hands of an uncle who the applicant would wake to find standing over his bed.
	


Evidence relied upon by the applicant in the appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that the following categories of evidence were of particular significance in making out the ground of appeal:
	



	
	The forensic pathologist’s evidence regarding the deceased’s injuries and the manner of their infliction.
	
	
	The applicant’s accounts in his interviews with police.
	
	
	The applicant’s account to Mr Little.
	
	
	Witnesses’ observations of the applicant’s state of intoxication at the time of the events.
	



	
	The applicant relied upon the following evidence of Dr Beer, the pathologist.
	
	
	These findings were made by Dr Beer as a result of the post-mortem examination of the deceased. She was aged 55, 164cms in height and weighed 43kgs. She appeared undernourished, consistent with chronic alcoholism. She had advanced micro-nodular cirrhosis. A number of old minor bruises indicated that the deceased bruised easily, reflecting poor clotting ability resulting from liver disease.
	
	
	Toxicology results revealed that the deceased had a blood alcohol level of 0.356%, an extremely high and potentially fatal level, although chronic alcoholics developed tolerance of alcohol and could still function reasonably well even with high blood alcohol levels.
	
	
	The deceased’s facial injuries included a broken nose, a bruise to the scalp just under the hairline, a blackened left eye, lacerations between the eyebrows, to a nostril and to a lip and swelling and bruising to the nose and cheek area. The injuries were consistent with a number of blows to the face such as punches.
	
	
	Dr Beer estimated the number of blows at between four and six. Dr Beer described the force required to inflict the injuries as “severe” by which he explained “not a simple tap” but a fist pulled back and delivered “with some speed and force”.
	
	
	Dr Beer examined the deceased’s neck externally and internally for evidence of injury but found none. Injury to the neck would have been expected had an assailant squeezed the deceased by the throat with one hand while punching her face with the other.
	
	
	Dr Beer concluded that the deceased’s facial injuries would not of themselves have caused death nor did the deceased have any significant brain or inter-cranial injuries that would have caused death. Bleeding from the deceased’s injuries continued over a period of time because of her poor clotting ability. Blood on the mattress suggested that she lay on it bleeding slowly for some time. An amalgam of mucus and blood had formed in the deceased’s upper respiratory tract, blocking the deceased’s airway so that she was unable to breathe. The blockage of the airway was a component, if not the major component, and may have been the entire explanation for her death.
	
	
	Although the precise mechanism could only be postulated, blunt force trauma was a definite factor in the sequence of events leading to the deceased’s death. Alcohol Concussive Syndrome, in which blunt force trauma combined with high blood alcohol causes functional brain or abnormality resulting in loss of breathing, increased blood pressure, decreased heart rate and abnormal heart rhythm, may have played a role. Individually or in combination, factors such as concussion or alcohol induced stoppage of breathing may have resulted in the deceased remaining stationary and continuing to bleed. Alcohol is a respiratory depressant. Whether the deceased was concussed, could not be determined at post-mortem. Morphological evidence could not confirm that Alcohol Concussive Syndrome was a cause of death.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the following accounts which he gave in interviews with police.
	
	
	In his interview on 19 September 2013 the applicant said that he could not recall what had happened as he had been drinking home brew. He had started drinking at midday, or 1pm the day before. After he went to bed, he went out to the kitchen at some stage and the deceased was on the lounge with her top off. She said “Do you want it?” but he said “You’re kidding me” and went back to bed.
	
	
	The applicant remembered waking up, being shaken, yelling and screaming and it just stopped. She was standing over him shaking him and “going off”. He just remembered someone being over the top of him, yelling and screaming. All the applicant could remember was being in bed “having em by the throat and not letting go and just hitting”. He remembered her being on top and grabbing the throat and telling her to calm down. He remembered “holding her by the throat and just squeezing and squeezing and squeezing”. He grabbed the person and did not stop hitting until there was no more movement. He held her with his left hand. He had his left hand around the person’s throat and struck with his right hand. He was half up off the bed which had moved out by that time. He did not know how many times he hit her. He hit until there was “no more anyone coming at me”. He punched with a closed fist. He was lying on his back, punching as hard as he could. He was a pretty strong sort of bloke. He had done martial arts and boxing.
	
	
	The applicant had fears of people standing over him because his uncle abused him as a teenager. He did not know whether it was a male or a female during the assault, but imagined he “would’ve” realised towards the end. He knocked a knife from the person’s hands. He got the knife off the floor and put it in the sink.
	
	
	When he stopped assaulting the person he turned the light on and realised what had happened and walked around not knowing what to do. He woke up at some time during the night and found the deceased down the side of the bed. He saw blood and the deceased was not moving. When he woke up in the morning there was blood all over his bed and doona. He put the bed linen and her clothes in his wardrobe. He wiped up blood with a cloth. He covered her with a blanket that was half on the ground. He turned the mattress upside down because of the blood. He did not move the deceased from where he found her down the side of the bed. He told Mr Little he “snapped”. He denied telling Mr Little that he thought about disposing of the body in the sand dunes with Mr Little.
	
	
	In his interview on 16 October 2013 the applicant said that he had experienced a lot of “real bad nightmares” and “flashbacks”. The next morning he realised it was not Sara Nixon, a former girlfriend, who he had thought it was at the time. Ms Nixon and her boyfriend, Paul Watts, had been at his unit. Ms Nixon and Mr Watts had been threatening to kill him for ages and had previously damaged his car. Ms Nixon had previously threatened to stab him and would have knives in her hands while saying so. Ms Nixon had smashed his window. Ms Nixon had pulled knives on him. His nightmares had indicated it was Ms Nixon. He was pretty sure from his nightmares that it was Ms Nixon on the bed. He remembered nothing more about what happened except he would have been yelling as in his nightmares. He had thought about the knife. He remembered seeing one at the end and pushing or kicking it out into the kitchen but could not say whether the person had a knife.
	
	
	He was trying to remember through his dreams and nightmares. He remembered cleaning the wardrobe drawers. He had a shower. The next morning he kept drinking and smoking until he realised what had happened, thinking it would go away. He saw blood and injuries to her face. He was crying and just started drinking.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the following evidence from Mr Little.
	
	
	He phoned Mr Little at about 8.30am on 19 September 2013. He told Mr Little that he was in trouble and needed to speak. Mr Little arrived at his unit at about 9.30 or 9.45am. The applicant closed the door and vomited into his kitchen sink. The applicant wanted to go for a drive and they drove around Newcastle for about 20 minutes. The applicant told Mr Little he “killed a girl”. The applicant and the girl had been drinking and “he hit her”. The applicant said that he woke up in the morning “thinking it was a dream but the girl was dead”. The applicant said he “snapped and he hit her”.
	
	
	The applicant said he could not go to the police as he could not go to gaol. Mr Little suggested that the applicant tell the police that the deceased attacked him and that it was self-defence. The applicant said that he was going to get rid of the body in sand dunes at Belmont. The applicant said there was blood all over the doona and he had put his bed over the body so no-one could see. The applicant said he would ask a neighbour for help. Mr Little drove the applicant back to his unit. The applicant told Mr Little “this is between you and me”.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the following evidence as to his state of intoxication.
	
	
	Police who attended the applicant’s unit at about 9.15pm on 18 September 2013 gave the following evidence regarding his state of intoxication:
	



	
	Senior Constable Nonkovski smelt alcohol on the applicant’s breath and considered he was “well intoxicated”.
	
	
	Constable Armitage did not smell alcohol on the applicant’s breath and did not notice whether he was intoxicated. The applicant appeared to be walking fine and able to talk coherently. However, Senior Constable Nonkovski was the one who spoke with the applicant.
	



	
	Witnesses who observed the applicant during the afternoon and evening of 18 September 2013 gave the following evidence regarding his apparent state of intoxication:
	



	
	Ms Jarvis saw the applicant and Mr Harvey drinking beers out the front of their units at about 6pm and it seemed like they had been drinking for a while because of their speech.
	
	
	Mr Fletcher entered the applicant’s unit at about 8 or 9 pm. The applicant appeared “pretty pissed” and was “stumbling around a bit”.
	
	
	Mr Harvey said that at one time the applicant became more composed and looked less drunk. When he returned to the applicant’s unit at 10pm after accompanying a friend to the train station, the applicant was “drunk” but did not “bounce around the walls”. He observed that the applicant and the deceased were drinking the home made spirits. The applicant loved the Midori but “it punched him in the face pretty hard” and would “knock him around”. At one stage the applicant was “really pissed”, “the most pissed” Mr Harvey had seen him in a long time.
	
	
	Mr Crooks saw the applicant drinking in his unit at some time. He was “maggoted” and could not even sit on his stool properly. The applicant offered Mr Crooks some of the home made vodka. Mr Crooks had two drinks and they were “really strong”.
	
	
	Mr Grach saw the applicant at about 11pm. He was “very intoxicated” and “couldn’t stand up himself”. He was “sort of leaning over”, “like off the wall”. He had been “drinking most of the day” and was “pretty pissed”. He was mumbling and incoherent and stumbling and falling over the lounge.
	
	
	Mr O’Brien would not comment on the applicant’s intoxication.
	



	
	In his interview with police on 16 October 2013 the applicant said that he was “pretty well smashed” and that he had been told he was “blind” and “incoherent”. He had not just the two strong bottles of spirits but “smoked a fair bit of marijuana too”. He normally drank alcohol and smoked cones to “blow his head off”.
	
	
	Mr Paynter said that his home made spirits were between 37.5% and 41% proof. Some people said they gave “a good kick”.
	


The appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that the verdict of guilty in respect of the offence of murder was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence because the evidence did not permit satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that he had the mental state necessary to constitute the offence.
	
	
	The applicant noted that the Crown’s contention was that he did the act of punching the deceased in the face which caused her death with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm and was therefore guilty of the offence of murder. The applicant noted that in the event that such an intention was not established beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown relied in the alternative upon the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	The applicant took as his start point that the definition of “grievous bodily harm” in s 4 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was not exhaustive but was inclusive of the kinds of injuries that might constitute it. He accepted that conventionally the concept of “grievous bodily harm” has been equated with “really serious injury” (DPP v Smith [1961] AC 290 at 334; R v Perks (1986) 41 SASR 335).
	
	
	The applicant accepted that the evidence clearly established that he had struck the deceased to the face a number of times which ultimately caused her death. He submitted, however, that the evidence did not demonstrate that he did so with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. He submitted that his act of punching the deceased to the face did not of itself demonstrate that he had such an intention. He submitted that the forensic pathologist’s evidence as to the number of blows and force required to inflict the injuries to the deceased at most raised a “possibility” and not a “certainty” that he did the act with such an intention. The applicant submitted that his accounts of the circumstances of the assault in his interviews with the police did not disclose that he had such an intention.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence relating to his actual and planned conduct with the deceased’s body was properly treated at trial as relevant only to the question of credibility and was irrelevant to the question of whether he had the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. He submitted that evidence of lies, or other post offence conduct, might be indicative of an accused’s consciousness of guilt for causing a death but such evidence said little, if anything, about an accused’s mental state in committing the act (R v Cao [2004] NSWCCA 61 at [7] – [8]).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that murder was an offence of “specific intent” to which the provisions of Part 11A of the Crimes Act 1900 applied (s 428B Crimes Act). It followed, so he submitted, that his intoxication was to be taken into account in determining whether he had the intention to cause the specific result of inflicting grievous bodily harm (s 428C(1) Crimes Act 1900). The applicant submitted that the evidence of multiple witnesses established that he was heavily intoxicated in the period leading up to the time of the assault. He submitted that when the nature and circumstances of the assault were taken into account with the evidence regarding his state of intoxication, it gave rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether he had the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that deference to the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing witnesses give their evidence, did not resolve the reasonable doubt that this evidence gave rise to in relation to whether he had the requisite intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the whole of the evidence left open the reasonable possibility that he acted with an intention to inflict some lesser degree of injury than grievous bodily harm and his conviction for murder should not stand (Knight v The Queen [1992] HCA 56; 175 CLR 495; R v Cutter [1997] 94 A Crim R 152; R v Cao). It follows, so the applicant submitted , that the verdict of guilty for the offence of murder is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence (s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)).
	


Consideration


	
	The principles to be applied were set out by the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 242 CLR 400 at [11]:
	


“The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

11    It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12    This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.

13   The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

…

14   In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""


	
	Later in SKA v The Queen the plurality said:
	


“20   The reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal exposes a fundamental problem with its approach to its task. The Court concerned itself with whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support the verdicts, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence. …

21   To determine satisfactorily the applicant's appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to determine whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged. …”


	
	More recently this Court said in Elwood v R [2016] NSWCCA 18 per Meagher JA (with whom McCallum and Button JJ agreed):
	


“21   The question for this Court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt; in other words, “whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt”: Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Hayne J, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J relevantly agreeing), citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-493.

22   In answering that question the Court has to make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. In doing so, it is required to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses: M v The Queen at 493. Ordinarily a reasonable doubt entertained by this Court would be one which the jury also ought to have experienced, except where the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence could have resolved that doubt. The jury’s advantage is diminished but not removed where that evidence is or includes, as it does here, video recordings of police interviews given by the accused. However even where that is so, there remain the advantages identified by McCallum J in Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [480], which include, when evaluating all of the evidence, that of having seen other witnesses give any conflicting evidence.”


	
	For this verdict to be upheld it had to be open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the acts of the applicant which caused the deceased’s death were done with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, i.e. really serious bodily harm to the deceased. Put another way, the applicant has to establish that it was not open to the jury to so find.
	
	
	Against that background, it is trite to observe that what a person actually does may provide the most convincing evidence of what the person’s intention was at the time. Where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person’s acts, and where the person deliberately carries out those acts, it is open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the person did those acts with the intention of achieving that particular result. That such a specific result is a possible or even probable consequence of those acts is not sufficient. The facts of this case are complicated because the only evidence of actual intent comes from the applicant himself. There is also the issue of the applicant’s intoxication by alcohol and drugs.
	
	
	On the issue of intoxication, the applicant does not assert that his level of intoxication was such that he was incapable of forming the specific intent, but that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did in fact form the necessary specific intent, i.e. to cause to the deceased really serious bodily harm. The applicant’s intoxication is, of course, only relevant to that issue.
	
	
	It is also trite to observe that just because a person may have no recollection of the incident afterwards, or that a person’s judgment was affected so that they acted in a way different to how they would have acted if sober, or that the incident was not premeditated, do not necessarily mean that such a person was not acting with a specific intention at the time of the incident.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that what was said in the second interview of 16 October 2013 ought be largely disregarded given the effluxion of time and the clear elements of reconstruction which emerge from it. I do not understand the Crown to disagree with that position and I have substantially disregarded the contents of that statement. By way of contrast, the statement of 19 September was provided on the day of the incident and to that extent is more reliable.
	
	
	The following extracts from that first interview are of significance in relation to the issue of intention.
	


“A120   … I remember holding her by her throat and hitting and just squeezing and squeezing and squeezing. I remember that.

…

A129   I said I hit until there was no, no more anyone coming at me, no-one.

…

A159   … closed fist.

…

A161   … I was punching as hard as I can.

…

A267   And that’s all I can remember I just remember the yelling and screaming, I just remember me grabbing someone and hitting and honestly mate, I did not stop hitting until there was no movement.

…

Q328   … Was there a point that you can recall that you believed you were either overpowering this person or …

A328   Right at the end I think.

Q329   … or getting the better of this person?

A329   Yeah, right at the end.

Q330   And when you had that thought in your head what did you do?

A330   I can snap mate.

Q331   Yeah did you continue after …

A331   No mate I let go, I let go. That was it.

…

Q337   During the assault did you at any stage realise who it was or that it in fact was a woman?

A337   No I kind of think it was a woman. I’m trying to think that bit there meself. I’m trying to get yeah cause I remember throwing punches, everything else, but I still honestly mate I just can’t for the life of me fuckin just get that bit out of my head mate.

…

A338   I definitely would have realised it was a female towards the end I’d imagine.”


	
	I infer from those questions and answers in the first interview that the applicant recalled assaulting the deceased by punching with a closed fist as hard as he could. He continued to hit until there was no movement and no-one coming at him. The fact of continuing the assault until the victim was rendered immobile is strongly suggestive of an intent to disable which would require more than a minor injury. This is also strongly suggestive of an intent to inflict incapacitating, really serious harm.
	
	
	The applicant also said in that interview that he “snapped” and hit the deceased which is consistent with what he said to Christopher Little (T.131.35). When one adds to that the evidence of Dr Beer that there were at least four – six punches delivered and Dr Beer’s assessment of the significant force with which they were delivered, the inference of an intention to inflict really serious harm becomes stronger. Other telling evidence is his realisation that the person he was punching was a woman in circumstances where he was “pretty strong” and was experienced in martial arts and boxing. Although there is no evidence that the applicant realised that the person he was punching was the deceased, it is likely that he realised at some point that the person he was punching was considerably smaller than he. The deceased was in fact of small build and weighed only 43kgs.
	
	
	Repeated punches to the head by such a person as the applicant to anyone, but in particular to an emaciated older female using as much force as he could and continuing until there was no resistance, were factors such that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant’s intention was to inflict really serious harm.
	
	
	In setting out the above analysis, I have said nothing about the applicant’s state of intoxication. In that regard, it was (at least implicitly) conceded on behalf of the applicant that those factors might well allow a jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had the intention of inflicting really serious bodily harm if he were sober at the time. It was, however, the applicant’s submission that he was far from sober at the time which meant that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that as a matter of fact he had such an intention.
	
	
	It was accepted at trial, and the evidence was all one way, that the applicant was intoxicated on the evening of 18 September, before he went to bed. There were, however, differing observations as to the level of intoxication and those observations were made at different times. It is also relevant that the applicant was habituated to the heavy consumption of alcohol so that its effect on him would have been less than on a person who was not such an experienced drinker.
	
	
	The persons who gave evidence as to the applicant being very heavily intoxicated were Mr Grach, who described him as “pretty pissed” and just mumbling and incoherent at about 1am when he shared some cannabis with him and Mr Harvey. Mark Crooks in his statement described the applicant being heavily intoxicated but no time was mentioned. By way of contrast, when the police officers spoke to the applicant at 9.15pm, he was assessed as being “well intoxicated” by one of them but he was “walking fine and speaking coherently”. David Fletcher saw the applicant at around 8-9pm and described the applicant as being “drunk and stumbling around a bit”.
	
	
	The person who was with the applicant most of the time was his next door neighbour, Mr Harvey. He described the applicant as being drunk but not bouncing off the walls (T.154.28). His evidence was:
	


“Q. And your assessment that he was earlier in the day and around about - in the evening about 6pm the most pissed you’ve ever seen him, did he seem to sober up or did he stay the same or did he get worse? How would you describe it for the jury?

A. I think he - I wouldn’t know if he sobered up, but he become more composed, yeah.

Q. Right, seemed to be not - didn’t get any worse?

A. No, didn’t get any worse, not - not at that stage, no.” (T.162.28)


	
	It is not clear when the applicant went to bed, although Mr Harvey gave evidence of the applicant expressing an intention to go to bed at about midnight when he brought a pillow and a doona for the deceased to use when sleeping on the applicant’s lounge (T.155.36 – 156.30). Sometime after 3am Mr Harvey heard knocking or banging sounds which may have come from the applicant’s apartment. He observed that the bathroom light in the applicant’s apartment was on.
	
	
	There was evidence to suggest that the applicant’s level of intoxication was higher earlier in the night than later. This evidence came from Mr Harvey who spent more time with the applicant than any of the other witnesses. He parted company with the applicant when the applicant indicated that he was going to bed. The observations of Mr Grach conflicted with those of Mr Harvey in a number of respects.
	
	
	Perhaps the best evidence of the applicant’s state of intoxication was from the applicant himself. Although he said that he was heavily intoxicated, the applicant was still able to provide an account of his movements before going to bed and when he assaulted the deceased. His account was quite detailed in relation to a number of aspects. In particular, he could remember going to bed, telling the deceased she could stay on the lounge and quite vivid details of him being in bed at the time of the assault. He also had a good recollection of what he had had to drink that evening. He had a recollection of the argument which had occurred outside his apartment, of him asking the deceased to come inside, of the deceased telling him what the argument was about, telling him that she had no money for a taxi and of him telling the deceased what to do if she needed to use the toilet.
	
	
	It is also not without significance that before the applicant contacted his friend, Christopher Little, at 8.30am on the morning of 19 September he had spent a considerable amount of time cleaning up his apartment and removing the more obvious signs of what had happened to the deceased. From Mr Little’s observations, the applicant was functioning normally when he arrived at his apartment that morning.
	
	
	On that evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that despite his intoxication, the applicant was not only capable of forming a specific intention to inflict grievous bodily harm to the deceased but in fact did so. The strongest evidence to that effect comes from the applicant’s own statements indicating an intent to disable the person standing over his bed (which at some point he realised was the deceased), coupled with the evidence of Dr Beer as to the force with which the blows to the deceased’s head were delivered. It follows that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant murdered the deceased. The applicant’s ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal be granted.

(2)   The appeal be dismissed.


	
	CAMPBELL J: Having considered the whole of the evidence at the trial, I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the murder of Deborah Marie Wolfgram. I agree that the orders proposed by his Honour should be made. I also agree with his Honour’s reasons for reaching that conclusion.
	
	
	The issue so ably presented to us by Mr Gartelmann SC, with respect, was not quite the issue on which the case was fought at trial. The sole issue presented by defence trial counsel for the jury’s consideration was self-defence (AB 300.32; 525.30 and 543.25T). Naturally, if the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had negatived the elements of self-defence, the applicant was entitled to an acquittal whether or not he punched the deceased meaning to injure her in a really serious way.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the limited ground chosen by the applicant at trial to fight the case, the Crown, properly, opened (219.30 – .40T), and closed, on the need for the jury to be satisfied “that the accused assaulted” the victim “with the intention of doing her really serious bodily injury”: (AB 515.20 – .45T; and 517.15 – 518.25T). Moreover, the learned trial judge (RA Hulme J) instructed the jury, with respect, in completely conventional terms concerning the need for the Crown to prove the applicant had the specific intention of causing grievous bodily harm, and the possible importance of the applicant’s state of intoxication for that essential element of the crime. There was never any suggestion at the trial that, on the whole of the evidence, there was any doubt about it being open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the mental element of murder.
	
	
	Like Hoeben CJ at CL, a consideration of the interplay among the four categories of facts, matters or circumstances (see [20]) said to create a doubt about the applicant’s guilt did not induce a doubt about his guilt in me.
	
	
	The applicant’s own account in the first record of interview is somewhat garbled, certainly discursive, and difficult to follow. As Hoeben CJ at CL’s analysis shows, on a careful reading it is possible to extract a coherent account from it which raises the issue of self-defence, but nothing in it is inconsistent with him punching the victim with the requisite specific intent for murder. The detail of the account there recorded, and therefore its reliability, however, is called into question because as Hoeben CJ at CL points out at [26] “the objective, undisputed, expert evidence of the forensic pathologist failed to disclose evidence of injury to the victim’s neck if the applicant’s account extracted at [60]” were accurate. The jury would have been justified in not accepting what he said at all. In any event as Hoeben CJ at CL says, the totality of his account is “strongly suggestive of an intent to inflict incapacitating, really serious harm” (see [61]).
	
	
	In my view the evidence of Mr Christopher Little is of particular significance. His evidence in chief was that the accused had told him he had been drinking with the victim and hit her. “He woke up in the morning thinking it was a dream but the girl was dead” (AB 394.35T). He gave the following evidence at 395.20 - .42:
	


“Q.   Did he continue on and explain to you anything more about how he had hit her?

A.   No

….

Q.   Just take a moment and -

A.    Michael said he snapped and he hit her.

Q.   Did he go into any more detail about snapping or was that just it?

A.   He did, he did say that he knows that I’ve seen before, he said like, you know, you’ve seen me when I hit someone.

Q.   Just leaving that aside, in terms of snapping did he say that or did he go on to explain what he meant anymore?

A.   No, he just said he snapped.”


	
	Mr Little’s evidence was severely challenged by learned trial counsel, sorely testing his credibility. It may be, with the advantages they enjoyed, that the jury were entitled to think the cross-examination was not without some effect. However, the evidence I have set out was not directly challenged. And at AB 407.5 the following appears in cross-examination:
	


“Q.   He told you, did he not, correct me if I’m wrong, that he woke up in the night, a person was over the top of him, he snapped and punched the person and woke up this morning and there was a dead woman?

A.   No.

Q.   Is that not correct?

A.   No, he didn’t tell me he was in bed asleep.”


	
	The main thrust of the cross-examination was to challenge other evidence of Mr Little to the effect that it was him who suggested to the accused that he tell police that the victim attacked him, and he acted in self-defence. Obviously, if the jury believed that Mr Little had prompted the accused to raise the question of self-defence they may more readily be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had negatived the defence. This possibility was explained to the jury by the trial judge in his summing up (AB 9.7).
	
	
	It is notable that Mr Christopher Little’s evidence that the accused had told him, inter alia, that he had just snapped and hit the victim was corroborated by the evidence of the former’s father, Mr Peter Little (AB 446.45), presumably admitted without objection under s 108 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). There was no cross-examination of Mr Peter Little.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Hoeben CJ at CL and for these additional reasons, I am not persuaded that the jury must have entertained doubt about whether the applicant hit the victim with the specific intent of causing really serious injury, and accordingly about his guilt of murder.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		18 May 2016",2016-05-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769500,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 54) [2016] NSWSC 654,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	In the course of hearing submissions from counsel prior to the commencement of the Crown's final address, the Crown submitted that the jury should be directed as to the nature of a circumstantial case, on the basis that the various pieces of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown are what are generally described as ""strands in the cable"".
	
	
	Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, opposed that course and submitted that the appropriate direction was that the matters relied upon by the Crown were ""links in a chain"" or, in other words, that there were one or more indispensable intermediate facts, in the absence of proof of which the jury would be compelled to return a verdict of not guilty against the accused.
	
	
	The indispensable intermediate facts identified by Mr Thomas were as follows:
	



	
	Rogerson's alleged complicity in the purchase of vehicle BV67PX;
	
	
	the fact that the deceased was alive at the time that Rogerson entered storage unit 803;
	
	
	the fact that Rogerson was alleged to have had a gun in his possession whilst at McNamara's apartment on the afternoon/evening of 20 May 2014;
	
	
	the fact that Rogerson threatened Jessica McNamara on 20 May 2014; and
	
	
	the fact Rogerson was aware of meetings taking place between McNamara and the deceased, and was aware of the purpose of those meetings.
	



	
	The submission put by Mr Thomas attracts consideration of the decision in Shepherd v R [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573 where Dawson J (at [5]) considered the rationale behind a direction of the kind which is now sought by Mr Thomas.
	
	
	In my view, the present is not a case of the kind which lends itself to such a direction being given. Broadly speaking, the Crown case encompasses evidence of three general areas, namely:
	



	
	the events leading up to 20 May 2014, including the contact between the deceased and McNamara and telephone contact between the two accused;
	
	
	the events of 20 May 2014; and
	
	
	the events after 20 May 2014.
	



	
	It is not necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion about one area of evidence before proceeding to consider another: see Shepherd (supra) at [16]. In my view, none of the suggested indispensable facts (or links) are, on a proper assessment of the Crown case, indispensable facts at all. Even if each and every one of them were removed from the Crown case, there would remain a Crown case sufficient to go to the jury. It is also worthy of note that in Shepherd, Dawson J expressly recognised (at [15]) that even if indispensable facts of the kind articulated by Mr Thomas were identified, a direction of the kind proposed may in some circumstances not be helpful.
	
	
	In this latter respect Spigelman CJ in Davidson v R [2009] NSWCCA 150; (2009) 75 NSWLR 150 made reference (at [8]) to an earlier decision of R v Merritt [1999] NSWCCA 29 where there were only two intermediate facts established in the Crown case which were identified as being indispensable. The Chief Justice observed that in a case where there are numerous separate facts of varying degrees of probative force, it could very well be confusing to give a direction of the type now sought by Mr Thomas. His Honour also observed that the prospect of confusion is a matter which had been emphasised in other cases as a factor tending against giving the jury a direction of the kind now sought: see for example Minniti v R [2006] NSWCCA 30; Hannes v The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (No. 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373.
	
	
	For the reasons I have outlined, none of the matters identified by Mr Thomas are indispensable intermediate facts. Even if they were, the nature of the Crown case is such that to give a direction of the kind sought would be unnecessarily confusing. Accordingly the jury will be directed that the various matters relied upon by the Crown form part of an overall circumstantial case which should be viewed as “strands in a cable”.

		15 June 2016",2016-05-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769515,New South Wales Crime Commission v Luu [2016] NSWSC 664,"Judgment


	
	A Summons was filed in the Registry of this Court on 4 May 2016 by the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, seeking a restraining order against the defendant, Thi Quyen Luu. The restraining order, pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1900 (NSW) (“the Act”), would prohibit any person from dealing with any interests in property of the defendant, including her interest in the property as set out in Schedule One.
	
	
	Section 10A of the Act provides for applications of this nature to be heard ex parte, and this application proceeded on that basis.
	
	
	The plaintiff has filed an affidavit of Mr Jonathan Lee Spark, sworn 3 May 2016, in support of the application for a restraining order. Mr Spark is employed by the plaintiff as a Director of Financial Investigations and his affidavit sets out that he is an authorised officer. He is a person authorised in writing by the plaintiff generally to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10A and Part 4 of the Act.
	
	
	As a result of his employment with the plaintiff, Mr Spark has had access to records held by the New South Wales Police Force on its Computerised Operational Policing System, and records held by Land and Property Information New South Wales, being a unit of the Department of Finance, Services and Innovation. He has also seen, on a number of occasions, information provided to the Commission by Westpac and is familiar with the nature and appearance of such information.
	
	
	Mr Spark’s affidavit sets out his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity as defined by s 6 of the Act. The serious crime related activity is the supply of a prohibited drug (cannabis), contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), which is an offence falling within the definition of “serious criminal offence” provided by s 6(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark relies on a New South Wales Police Force Fact Sheet. The Fact Sheet outlines that on 21 March 2016 a search warrant was executed at an address in Fairfield Heights. The defendant and her co-accused were discovered inside the lounge room at the rear of the granny flat located on the property.
	
	
	Police located a large open blue canvas bag in the lounge room of the granny flat. Inside the bag, police discovered nine clear plastic vacuum sealed bags with approximately 3.9 kilograms of cannabis head inside. Police also located a second open blue canvas bag inside the bathroom of the granny flat, containing ten clear plastic vacuum sealed bags with approximately 5 kilograms of cannabis head inside.
	
	
	Also found on the property was $5000 in $50 dollar notes, four electronic scales, an electronic money counter, two packets of vacuum sealed bags, a large amount of various “high end” female clothing items, assorted crystals and $450 dollars in $50 notes in a wallet in a bedroom.
	
	
	The defendant and her co-accused were subsequently arrested.
	
	
	Police allege that the Fairfield Heights address was a safe house for the supply of prohibited drugs, and that the defendant and her co-accused are part of an elaborate criminal enterprise responsible for distributing cannabis to street level suppliers within the metropolitan area.
	
	
	I have considered the material supplied by the plaintiff, including the affidavit of Mr Spark and I am satisfied that his suspicion about the defendant is reasonably held. I am prepared to make the orders sought by the plaintiff, pursuant to s 10A(5) of the Act.
	


ORDERS

2769516,New South Wales Crime Commission v Nghiem [2016] NSWSC 663,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court of NSW on 4 May 2016 the NSW Crime Commission, the plaintiff, seeks orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1900 (NSW) (“the Act”) against the defendant, Tien Cuong Nghiem. The orders sought are for a restraining order in respect of any interests in property of the defendant, including property set out in Schedule One, but excluding the property outlined in Schedule Two of the Summons.
	
	
	Section 10A of the Act provides for applications of this nature to be heard ex parte, and this application proceeded on that basis.
	
	
	In support of the application for a restraining order, the plaintiff relies upon the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark, filed 4 May 2016. Mr Spark is employed by the plaintiff as a Director of Financial Investigations and his affidavit sets out that he is an authorised officer as defined in s 4(1) of the Act. He is a person authorised in writing by the plaintiff generally to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10A and Part 4 of the Act.
	
	
	As a result of his employment with the plaintiff, Mr Spark has had access to records held by the New South Wales Police Force on its Computerised Operational Policing System, and records held by Land and Property Information New South Wales, being a unit of the Department of Finance, Services and Innovation. He has also seen, on a number of occasions, records held by the New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services and is familiar with the nature and appearance of such information.
	
	
	Mr Spark suspects that the defendant has engaged in the following serious crime related activities as defined in s 6(1) of the Act, being acts which are offences falling within the definition of “serious criminal offence”, pursuant to s 6(2)(b) and 6(2)(d) of the Act:
	



	
	Cultivate by enhanced indoor means prohibited plants (cannabis), contrary to s 23(1A) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (“DMTA”); and
	
	
	Knowingly take part in the cultivation of prohibited plants (cannabis) which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited plant, contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the DMTA.
	
	
	Recklessly deal with the proceeds of crime (in excess of $200,000), contrary to s 193B(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) being an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and involving money laundering.
	



	
	Mr Sparks relies upon a police Fact Sheet which outlines the suspected serious criminal activity outlined above. The defendant was charged with the offences specified in the Fact Sheet on 23 March 2016.
	
	
	The Fact Sheet outlines that in February 2016 the State Crime Command Drug Squad established a strike force to investigate the cultivation of cannabis. During the course of the investigation, a number of premises were identified as of interest to the police. The premises included addresses in Baulkham Hills, West Pennant Hills and two addresses in Greenacre. Police conducted physical surveillance of the premises and observed the defendant attending the addresses in Baulkham Hills and West Pennant Hills
	
	
	Search warrants were executed on both of the premises which the defendant was seen attending in March 2016. Both premises were secured and an elaborate indoor hydroponic cannabis cultivation was found to be active in several rooms at each location. It was later detected that the mains electricity supply for both premises had been illegally bypassed to support the cultivation systems. At one address, 89 cannabis plants were found, and at the other 85 cannabis plants were located.
	
	
	The police have evidence to establish that the defendant is responsible for the care and supervision of the cannabis cultivations. The estimated street value of the plants seized is $525,000.
	
	
	The defendant was arrested on 23 March 2016 after he arrived at one of the Greenacre addresses, and charged with the offences outlined above. Following his arrest, police executed two further search warrants on the Greenacre residences and sums of $200,000 AUD and $860,000 AUD were discovered. The police allege that the sums of money are proceeds from the cultivation of cannabis. The police have located documents in the name of the defendant linking him to the Baulkham Hills address.
	
	
	Having considered the material tendered by the NSW Crime Commission, including the affidavit of Mr Spark, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion held by Mr Spark. In accordance with s 10A(5), I make the restraining order sought, and the further orders requested by the plaintiff.

		25 May 2016",2016-05-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769535,R v Curtis [2016] NSWSC 660,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: Oliver Curtis stands charged with an offence of conspiracy to commit the offence of insider trading contrary to ss 1043A(1)(d) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). His trial commenced with a jury on 11 May 2016. The Crown closed its case yesterday (25 May 2016).
	
	
	The Crown gave notice in advance of the trial of its intention to adduce coincidence evidence. The evidence in question is identified in an amended coincidence notice dated 29 January 2016. By notice of motion filed 7 March 2016, the accused sought a pre-trial ruling in the following terms:
	


that the coincidence evidence identified in the Amended Notice of Intention to Adduce Coincidence Evidence is not admissible for the purpose of proving that the accused did a particular act and/or had a particular state of mind identified in that Notice on the basis that, having regard to the similarities in the events and/or the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally pursuant to ss 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act.


	
	This judgment determines that application.
	
	
	The application invoked the Court’s authority under s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). That section authorises the Court, if it considers it to be appropriate to do so, to give a ruling or make a finding in relation to a question as to the admissibility or use of evidence proposed to be adduced before the evidence is adduced in the proceedings. It will often be appropriate to give such a ruling in advance of the trial where the proposed coincidence evidence would not otherwise be admissible. However, it is common ground in the present case that the evidence is relevant for another purpose (to prove overt acts pursuant to the alleged agreement). Accordingly, the parties accepted that it would not be necessary for the Court to rule on the coincidence issue before the evidence was adduced.
	
	
	The indictment on which the accused was arraigned alleges the following offence:
	


Between about 1 May 2007 and about 30 June 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with John Joseph Hartman to commit an offence, being the contravention of sub-sections 1311(1) and 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

Particulars

The agreement was that John Joseph Hartman would, from time to time, procure Oliver Peter Curtis to acquire or dispose of relevant Division 3 Financial Products, namely, Contracts for Difference, when John Joseph Hartman possessed inside information about the trading intentions of Orion Asset Management Limited in relation to the purchase or sale of shares in certain companies and when John Joseph Hartman knew that such information was not generally available and if it were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of those Contracts for Difference.


	
	The Crown case rests primarily on the evidence of the alleged co-conspirator, Mr Hartman. He was employed as an equities dealer by Orion Asset Management Limited. Orion conducted the business of managing investments, primarily for institutional investors such as superannuation fund managers. It had over $5 billion under management during the relevant period. Orion offered four different investment portfolios. Each portfolio consisted of a list of stocks chosen by Orion’s senior investment managers according to the profile of the relevant portfolio. The investment managers determined the “target weighting” (by percentage) of each stock within a portfolio (that is, the composition of stock Orion would strive to acquire for that portfolio).
	
	
	It was not possible for a portfolio ever to meet its target weightings exactly. The actual weightings fluctuated constantly as the price of the relevant stocks fluctuated on the stock market. In addition, the target weightings were regularly revised by the senior investment managers. In order to keep the composition of each portfolio as close as possible to the target weightings from time to time, Orion bought and sold large volumes of shares on a daily basis. Mr Hartman’s job was to execute those trades in accordance with instructions from the senior investment managers. The instructions were specific as to the stock to be acquired or disposed of over particular periods of time and the parameters (as to volume and price) within which that was to occur but a measure of discretion was left to Mr Hartman as to the timing of his trading (in theory, so as to enable him to trade in the optimum volume at the best achievable price). Mr Hartman traded millions of dollars’ worth of shares on behalf of Orion each day. He was aged 21 years at the time.
	
	
	Mr Hartman observed that, owing to the type and volume of shares in which it traded, Orion’s trading could have an impact on the price of the relevant stock. In mid-2006, unlawfully and contrary to the terms of his employment, he began trading in his own right using inside information about Orion’s trading intentions.
	
	
	Mr Hartman and the accused were best friends and each worked in the financial sector. The Crown alleges that, in early 2007, Mr Hartman told the accused what he had observed about the impact of Orion’s trades on the market and that they began discussing the prospect of trading cooperatively using the information available to Mr Hartman about Orion’s trading intentions. The Crown alleges that the two men agreed on a plan to capitalise on that information by “front-running” Orion’s trading. The plan was that Mr Hartman would identify occasions on which his knowledge of Orion’s intended trading could be used and would provide trading instructions to the accused based on that information. The accused was to place the trades as instructed and they would share the profits.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that, in the course of those discussions, the accused informed Mr Hartman about a method of communicating, using a Blackberry device, which was secure and virtually undetectable (known as “PIN” messaging or “pinning”). There is evidence suggesting that the accused bought a Blackberry on 23 May 2007. The Crown alleges that he bought it for Mr Hartman, to enable them to communicate secretly.
	
	
	On 24 May 2007, the accused opened an account with CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, a company that trades in contracts for difference (CFD’s). The account was opened in the name of a company, Encounter Investments Pty Ltd, of which the accused was the sole director. According to the Crown case, the accused and Mr Hartman began trading in accordance with their unlawful agreement the following day (25 May 2007).
	
	
	Mr Hartman has been cross-examined at length and there is a substantial attack on his credit. He pleaded guilty to a number of charges arising from his own insider trading not involving the accused. He also pleaded guilty to a number of “tipping” offences arising from the trading he says he undertook with the accused. For the purpose of his sentencing proceedings, he gave an undertaking pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to co-operate with law enforcement agencies. He received a discount on sentence for that assistance, including a 10% discount for future assistance in giving evidence against the accused. He was given an indemnity by the Crown in respect of his evidence in these proceedings. The burden of the cross-examination on those and other issues was that his evidence about the unlawful agreement is unreliable and should not be accepted.
	
	
	Apart from the evidence of Mr Hartman, the Crown case rests primarily on documents, including records of the relevant trading undertaken by Mr Hartman and the accused. Most if not all of that evidence was admitted by consent and is undisputed.
	
	
	The documentary evidence includes records of 45 separate incidents of trading by Encounter which bore significant similarities to Orion’s trading at around the same time. The Crown alleges that, on those 45 occasions, the accused acted on trading instructions sent to him by Mr Hartman via Blackberry PIN message, on each occasion causing Encounter to buy or sell CFD’s in accordance with those instructions. The similarities with Orion’s trading are striking. On each of the 45 occasions, Encounter and Orion traded in the same stock, on or about the same day, at about the same time and in the same direction (buy or sell). In many instances, the accused opened Encounter’s position before Orion began trading and closed it before Orion finished. Most of the accused’s trading on those occasions earned a profit; on five occasions he incurred a loss.
	
	
	It is important to understand the very limited scope of the issue raised by the present application. First, as already noted, the accused accepts that the evidence of the 45 occasions on which Encounter’s trading matched Orion’s is admissible for another purpose in the trial. Specifically, that evidence is relied upon by the Crown as evidence of overt acts pursuant to the alleged agreement. The accused accepts that the evidence is admissible to prove the alleged overt acts.
	
	
	Secondly, the accused accepts that the similarities between Encounter’s trading and Orion’s are such that some improbability reasoning is permissible (if not inevitable). The present contest concerns the extent of the permissible reasoning. The critical issue raised by the accused’s application is whether the coincidence evidence can be used for the purpose of proving the existence of any anterior agreement or the existence of an agreement in the precise terms alleged by the Crown. The accused accepts that the existence of such an agreement could be proved or at least corroborated by inference but says that such an inference could not rely on improbability or coincidence reasoning based on the obvious similarities between the 45 matching trades of Encounter and Orion.
	
	
	Finally, in the event that the Court accepts that the evidence in question is not admissible for a coincidence purpose, the accused nonetheless specifically asks the Court not to give a direction to the jury to that effect. That was the position taken by Mr Dhanji SC, who appeared with Ms Huxley to argue the pre-trial application for the accused, and it was expressly confirmed (at my request) by Mr Thangaraj SC, who appears with Dr Higgins for the accused in the trial (T 452). The reason for adopting that approach, as I understood it, was that such a direction could be self-defeating (and so damaging to the accused’s case) because it could inspire the jury to engage in the very kind of reasoning prohibited by the Court’s ruling, which reasoning might not otherwise occur to them. In my view, there is force in that concern.
	
	
	Further, in my view, even if the evidence is admissible for a coincidence purpose, it may be doubted whether it is necessary or appropriate to direct the jury to that effect. That issue is considered further below.
	
	
	For those reasons the accused’s application, as developed in argument, was ultimately concerned for all practical purposes with identifying the submissions that can permissibly be put to the jury in closing addresses.
	
	
	The coincidence notice is directed to the documentary evidence, focussing on the objective similarities between the trades in CFD’s undertaken by the accused and Orion’s trades in the same underlying stock. The notice attaches a schedule providing particulars of the 45 occasions on which the accused’s trading matched Orion’s in the ways specified above.
	
	
	Section 98 of the Evidence Act provides:
	


98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Note: One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.


	
	It is accepted that the Crown has given reasonable notice in accordance with s 98(1)(a). The critical task is to determine whether the evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced by the Crown, has significant probative value on the basis of improbability reasoning (as opposed to ordinary inferential reasoning). The “probative value” of evidence means the extent to which it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. That assessment must be made by reference to the particular acts and states of mind specified in the notice.
	
	
	The “two or more events” specified in the s 98 notice are the 45 occasions on which the accused’s trading matched Orion’s. As I understood the argument, the Crown would rely on each or any pair of matching trading as a separate pair of events for the purpose of the section.
	
	
	The accused accepts that the similarities between each pair of matching trading (Orion’s and Encounter’s) are such that it is improbable that they occurred coincidentally. It was expressly accepted by the accused at the pre-trial argument that the evidence of the matching trades was admissible to prove a particular act by Mr Hartman (that he communicated something to the accused which was “relevant to the desirability of trading in particular shares in a particular direction”). It was also expressly accepted that the evidence was admissible to prove that the accused had a particular state of mind (“that it is desirable to trade in particular shares in a particular direction on the basis of information provided to him by Mr Hartman”: transcript of 4 May 2016 at 12.40).
	
	
	The accused submitted, however, that the coincidence notice “significantly overreaches” as to any further acts or states of mind able to be proved by improbability reasoning based on the evidence of Encounter’s and Orion’s matching trades.
	
	
	The acts and states of mind sought to be proved by the Crown by improbability reasoning were specified in the coincidence notice as follows:
	


a.   (Act of the Accused and Hartman): The accused and Hartman formed an agreement that Hartman would communicate information to the Accused, being information that concerned, related to or was derived from information Hartman possessed because of his employment as an equities trader with Orion Asset Management Pty Ltd (“Orion”), regarding the trading intentions of Orion in respect of particular securities.

b.   (States of minds of the Accused and Hartman): At the time the Accused and Hartman formed the subject agreement they each intended that the Accused would use the information received from Hartman to buy or sell Contracts for Difference (“CFDs”) in respect of the relevant securities at times that would pre-empt Orion’s intended trading in those securities.

c.   (Acts of the Accused and Hartman): Pursuant to the subject agreement, Hartman communicated, and the Accused received, information about Orion’s trading intentions.

d.   (Act of the Accused): Pursuant to the subject agreement, on the 45 sets of occasions between 25 May 2007 and 11 June 2008, summarised in Schedule 1 (“the Encounter Trades”) and Schedule 2 the Accused used the information he received from Hartman, to buy and sell CFDs through his company, Encounter Investments Pty Ltd (“Encounter”), in respect of securities that were the subject of the information he received.

e.   (State of mind of the Accused): When conducting the subject trading in CFDs the Accused knew or believed that:

i.   the information he had received from Hartman was information that concerned, related to or was derived from information Hartman possessed regarding the trading intentions of Orion; and

ii.   Hartman had become aware of the trading intentions of Orion because of his employment at Orion; and

iii.   Hartman would carry out Orion’s trading intentions; and

iv.   Orion’s trading would sustain a movement in the price of the relevant security for a period of time that was favourable for the CFDs he had bought or sold; and

v.   the information had been communicated to the Accused by Hartman pursuant to their agreement.


	
	As implicitly accepted by the accused, the probability that any of the pairs of trading (Encounter’s and Orion’s) occurred coincidentally is so remote as to be dismissed as fanciful. The similarities between the relevant trading events are so striking as to give rise to an irresistible inference that there was some communication between the two men in respect of those trades.
	
	
	Further, in my view, the accused’s concession on that issue falls short. The similarities between the trades and the circumstances in which they occurred are such as to give rise to a strong inference that there was some anterior understanding or agreement between the two men. It is not only a matter of the trades being in the same stock and in the same direction; the timing of the trading is such as to give rise to a strong inference that the men had discussed front-running Orion’s trading and that it was their intention to do just that. The Crown should be allowed to address the jury on that basis.
	
	
	However, I do think the coincidence notice “over-reaches”, as submitted by Mr Dhanji. It may be observed that the acts and states of mind specified in the notice exactly reflect the elements the Crown must prove to establish the guilt of the accused. I apprehend that was deliberate; the Crown submitted that those are the “facts in issue” against which the probative value of the improbable coincidence must be assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	It may be correct, as a matter of logic, that the improbability of the matching trades occurring by coincidence is capable of sustaining an inference that the accused entered into an anterior agreement in the terms alleged by the Crown. I confess I have found that issue very difficult, but it is not ultimately necessary to determine it.
	
	
	In the case of evidence admitted only for a coincidence purpose and not otherwise admissible, it would ordinarily be necessary to explain the relevance of the evidence to the jury. Where evidence has been admitted for both a coincidence purpose and another purpose, however, the position is more complex. The primary purpose of the evidence of the 45 occasions of matching trading, as I understand the Crown case, is to prove that there were overt acts pursuant to the alleged unlawful agreement (not a coincidence purpose). In that context, to explain that the same evidence could also be used for the purpose of proving the alleged unlawful agreement pursuant to which those overt acts were committed could be very confusing.
	
	
	For that reason, assuming the evidence is capable of sustaining the inferences contended for in the coincidence notice (that is, all of the elements of the offence), I consider that the use of the evidence for that purpose could have a prejudicial effect on the accused. In particular, it could confuse the jury in the important task of determining whether the Crown has established the unlawful agreement beyond reasonable doubt. I am not persuaded that the probative value of the evidence to prove the existence of the agreement described in the indictment (as opposed to some anterior discussion or agreement) based on improbability reasoning substantially outweighs that potential prejudicial effect on the accused.
	
	
	It follows, in accordance with s 101 of the Evidence Act, that the evidence of the 45 trades cannot be used to prove the unlawful agreement alleged by the Crown by improbability reasoning. That is not to preclude the Crown from addressing on the basis that that evidence is part of the circumstantial case to support the existence of the unlawful agreement. The critical question in the trial is whether, before the trading began, the accused entered into an agreement in the terms described by Mr Hartman. In determining whether that is established beyond reasonable doubt, the jury is entitled to draw inferences from all the circumstances, including the subsequent conduct of the two men (as I think is acknowledged by the accused). The effect of this ruling will be to constrain the Crown from addressing the jury as to an additional basis for inferring the existence of the agreement described in the indictment founded upon improbability reasoning by reference to the 45 trades.

2769563,Harb v Trustees of the Christian Brothers trading as St Patrick’s College Strathfield [2016] NSWDC 90,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	These are my reasons for orders on 27 April 2016 in relation to imputations (a), (c), (d) and (e) as pleaded by the plaintiff (and subsequently amended), following an argument on form and capacity, heard by me (as to the capacity of imputation (d)) pursuant to UCPR r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	I first note the relevant principles in relation to objections to the capacity of an imputation being capable of being conveyed, as set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[136], namely that it is “an exercise in generosity not parsimony“, as well as being a “matter of impression … the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant” (see also Berezovsky v Forbes [2001] EWCA Civ 1251).
	
	
	Where the objection relates to the form of the imputation, the relevant tests are set out in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 197 and, more recently, in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20].
	


The matter complained of and the imputations


	
	The matter complained of consists of the following two sentences spoken by the second defendant, the headmaster of St Patrick’s College Strathfield, in the course of a parent information evening event at the college on 3 February 2015:
	


“I have made changes to the College executive. I now have eleven disciples and I have managed to get rid of Judas.”


	
	The plaintiff was not named, but relies upon particulars of extrinsic facts in relation to identification. Prior to these words being spoken, there had been, according to these particulars of identification, a 12-person executive which assisted the headmaster in the administration of the school. The plaintiff was dismissed from his employment by the first defendant when his contract was terminated at the end of 2014 instead of being renewed, leaving 11 members.
	
	
	The particulars of identification do not refer to who Judas was, or what he did, this being considered by both parties to be so notorious as not to warrant inclusion in the particulars of identification. The parties agree that Judas was paid thirty pieces of silver to perform what Mr Rasmussen described as one of the earliest examples of identification evidence, namely to identify Jesus to Roman law enforcement officers by kissing him on the cheek. This is the basis for the first three imputations. Judas’ performance of this act of betrayal of trust in exchange for the thirty pieces of silver is also relied upon in relation to the sting of the libel as set out in the fourth and fifth imputations pleaded.
	
	
	Precise imputations are, however, not easy to convey from just one word (i.e. “Judas”). The plaintiff’s statement of claim initially pleaded the imputations as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a traitor.
	
	
	The plaintiff is not to be trusted.
	
	
	The plaintiff betrays his friends and colleagues.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a Judas like person.
	



	
	Following correspondence challenging the form and capacity of these imputations, they were repleaded as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a traitor.
	
	
	The plaintiff is not to be trusted.
	
	
	The plaintiff betrays his friends and colleagues.
	
	
	The plaintiff is the type of person who accepts bribes.
	
	
	The plaintiff is the type of person who would sell out his associates for money.
	



	
	The challenges relate to these revised imputations.
	


The issues for determination


	
	The imputations argument, like the matter complained of, was short and to the point. No objection was taken to imputation (b). The issues for determination were:
	



	
	Whether imputations (a) and (c) differ in substance;
	
	
	Whether imputations (d) and (e) differ in substance and, if so, whether imputation (d) is capable of being conveyed.
	


Imputations arising by way of comparison to notorious persons


	
	The correct approach to imputations containing unflattering comparisons to notorious persons is often a question of the degree of infamy involved (New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council v Perkins (1998) 45 NSWLR 340 – “Government Jackie”).
	
	
	Where the person concerned is someone of a sufficiently opprobrious character, such as Judas, the issue is comparatively simple. Defamatory imputations arising by comparison to Judas are, in fact, so common in defamation litigation that “Judas” has his own heading in the index to R. E. Brown, Brown on Defamation (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States) (2nd Ed., Carswell). This means I am not obliged to perform the more difficult task of determining whether it is defamatory to call someone “Clintonesque” (“a reference to a former President of the United States with a reputation for not telling the truth” according to Shaw J in Ager v Canjex Publishing Ltd 16 CCLT (3d) 188 2003 CarswellBC 1406, 2003 BCSC 891, reversed on other grounds in Ager v Canjex Publishing Ltd (2005) 259 DLR (4th) 727), or to compare someone with a person of flawed but fascinating character, such as Madame Bovary (as to which, see the discussion by Professor Brown at [5.9(8)]).
	
	
	The imputation generally conveyed by a comparison to Judas has generally been interpreted as one of being disloyal (see, for example, Geary v Alger (1925) 57 O.L.R. 218, where a lawyer acting for the defendant in criminal proceedings was accused of being “a Judas who betrayed His Lord and Master”), or as a person who is untrustworthy in that he or she is likely to sell out friends or other persons in a trust relationship (Lawson v Thompson (1968) 66 WWR 427; (1969) 69 WWR 304 (BCCA)).
	
	
	While Professor Brown notes at [5.9(8)] that a mere comparison to Judas is capable of being defamatory, he goes on to note that in today’s world it may in some cases amount to “rhetorical hyperbole”, citing Communications Workers, Local 8611 v Archibeque 105 N.M. 635, 735 P. 2d 1141 (S. Ct. 1987). Accordingly, it is essential to consider the meaning of a comparison to Judas by reference to the context and contents of the matter complained of, rather than have regard to its interpretation in other judicial decisions.
	


Imputations (a) and (c)


	
	The matter complained of, when interpreted by reference to the extrinsic facts, clearly draws a direct parallel between the absence of the twelfth “disciple” and the newly effective running of the Executive.
	
	
	The first issue is whether the imputations differ in substance. The essence of Judas’ betrayal was agreed by both counsel, in the context of the words spoken by the headmaster, to be that Judas betrayed the trust of the person to whom he owed loyalty (i.e. the headmaster), rather than that he was a “traitor”, in the general sense (for example, being a traitor to one’s country). This is, therefore, the same as an imputation that he betrays his friends and colleagues.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen conceded during argument that imputations (a) and (c) do not differ in substance and proffered the amended imputation contained in the orders I made on 27 April. Imputations (a) and (c) have accordingly been struck out and the plaintiff given liberty to plead, in their place, an imputation that “the plaintiff is a traitor in that he betrays his friends and colleagues”.
	


Imputations (d) and (e)


	
	These imputations refer to the additional meaning arising from the reference to “Judas”, namely an attempt to capture the sting of his accepting 30 pieces of silver for his betrayal of Jesus.
	
	
	The concept of accepting thirty pieces of silver is used in common speech and literature to refer to people “selling out” a person who trusts them for personal gain, according to the Wikipedia entry for “thirty pieces of silver” (see also D. L. Jeffrey, ed., “A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature”, 1992, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. p. 766). Imputation (e) clearly captures such a meaning.
	
	
	The imputation of accepting bribes (imputation (d)), while differing in substance from imputation (e), is different to the concept of selling out a person with whom one has a relationship of trust. The concept of bribe generally connotes the giving of money or some other benefit to a person in power, which does not capture the sting of the libel in relation to the conduct of Judas. Consequently, while I accept the plaintiff’s submission that imputations (d) and (e) differ in substance, I consider that imputation (e) is not conveyed.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff has effectively repleaded the imputations on two occasions. Four of the five imputations were challenged and resulted in the amendments sought by the defendant.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen submitted that by reason of his concessions in the course of argument, he should be entitled to a more favourable costs order. Mr Rasmussen’s quick and effective conduct of the argument certainly aided the prompt resolution of the argument, and I also take into account the late raising of the capacity challenge to imputation (d). However, there were concessions that the plaintiff could have made earlier, rather than putting the defendant to the cost of the argument today; additionally, it was the plaintiff’s second attempt at drafting imputations. Accordingly, the appropriate order is for the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs of the imputations argument.
	


Orders


	
	Strike out imputations (a) and (c) and in lieu permit the plaintiff to plead “the plaintiff is a traitor in that he betrays his friends and colleagues”.
	
	
	Imputation (d) is struck out as incapable of arising.
	
	
	Plaintiff to serve amended statement of claim in 7 days.
	
	
	Defendants to file and serve their defence(s) 21 days after receipt of the amended statement of claim.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendants’ costs of the imputations argument.
	
	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on 2 June 2016 for further directions.

		30 May 2016",2016-05-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769583,R v ND [2016] NSWCCA 103,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed in the District Court by her Honour Judge Norton SC on 6 November 2015.
	
	
	The respondent, ND, was convicted by a jury on 3 September 2015 of an offence contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900, namely sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years. He pleaded not guilty to the offence.
	
	
	Judge Norton sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months, commencing on 6 November 2015.
	
	
	At the time of sentence, the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 25 years. A standard non-parole period of 15 years applied.
	


Facts


	
	The facts, as set out by Norton SC DCJ in her Remarks on Sentence, may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The respondent was born on 24 December 1975, and was aged 28 at the time of the offence. He was the victim’s uncle, his wife being the sister of the victim’s mother. The victim was born on 26 November 1998 and was aged 5 years and 10 months at the time of the offence. The victim and the respondent lived near each other and their families occasionally interacted at social events.
	
	
	On 14 September 2004, the victim and her mother visited the respondent’s home after the victim had been on a school excursion. At some point, the respondent’s wife and the victim’s mother left the home, leaving the victim in the respondent’s care. The victim and the respondent watched television in the lounge room while the respondent’s two sons played in another room. The respondent was drinking beer. He indicated to the victim to sit on his lap, which she did.
	
	
	While the victim was sitting on the respondent’s lap, the respondent started rubbing her leg. He then put his hand up her school skirt, into her underwear, and put one finger inside her vagina. The victim said that this hurt and “didn’t feel very nice”. The respondent moved his finger around for a few minutes. The respondent removed his finger when the victim’s mother and the respondent’s wife were heard returning in a car.
	
	
	A victim impact statement was tendered to the sentencing Judge. The victim indicated that she dropped out of school when she was 12-13 years old and turned to alcohol and cannabis in order to “cope with what … happened”. She also indicated that the incident has made it difficult for her to trust others and has negatively impacted her confidence and ability to concentrate at school.
	


Notice of Appeal


	
	On 18 November 2015, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence relying upon the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	Her Honour’s remarks were delivered orally shortly after the conclusion of the submissions on sentence. It is not the role of this Court to examine these remarks with an unduly critical eye, concentrating on matters of form and not substance.
	
	
	Her Honour recounted the fact of the respondent’s conviction, and the facts surrounding the offending to which I have earlier referred. Her Honour noted that the respondent had one prior conviction in 1995 for a minor offence.
	
	
	Her Honour noted the Victim Impact Statement which recorded the effects which the assault had, and continues to have, on the victim. Her Honour, while recognising the effects of the offence upon the victim, found that the emotional harm and damage caused by the offence was not sufficiently substantial to constitute an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Her Honour then considered the objective seriousness of the offence. She noted the Crown’s submission that since the offence was isolated, short in duration, opportunistic in nature, involved no threat of violence and involved a minimal use of force, it fell below the mid‑range of objective seriousness. Her Honour then noted the respondent’s submission that the objective seriousness was at the bottom, or at the low end, of the range.
	
	
	After considering these submissions, her Honour found that the offence fell “towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness” for offences of this kind.
	
	
	Her Honour then turned to consider the subjective factors relevant to the sentence. She noted that the respondent was almost 40 years old at the time of the sentence, had always maintained employment, and was married with four children. She recorded his service with the Defence Forces, including service in Iraq, for a total period of 10 years.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted a submission that the respondent’s prior criminal conviction was isolated and should not feature in his sentencing. As well, the sentencing Judge accepted that the respondent’s wife suffered from a significant back injury which impaired her ability to work. The sentencing Judge also accepted that the respondent’s family would suffer hardship, in particular financial hardship, as a consequence of a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	However, with respect to these last two adverse effects, her Honour accepted that, to the extent that they could be taken into account, they were only relevant as part of the mix of factors to be considered when fixing a non-parole period.
	
	
	Her Honour referred generally to the sentencing statistics and acknowledged their limited use. She concluded that the prospects of the respondent re‑offending were low. She went on to find the existence of special circumstances. Having identified these matters, her Honour then imposed the sentence to which I have referred above.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	Although the Crown’s appeal was limited to the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, it pointed to the following errors in her Honour’s reasons which produced that result:
	



	
	the sentencing Judge failed properly to assess the objective seriousness of the offence;
	
	
	the sentencing Judge failed to find the abuse of the position of trust as an aggravating feature;
	
	
	the sentencing Judge failed properly to address the victim’s age and vulnerability as an aggravating factor;
	
	
	the sentencing Judge failed properly to assess the respondent’s prospects of re‑offending; and
	
	
	the sentencing Judge erred in finding special circumstances and in setting an erroneously lenient non-parole period.
	



	
	The first three of these matters address the objective seriousness of the offence and can conveniently be considered together.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act is an offence of “the utmost seriousness”, as indicated by the maximum penalty of 25 years and the applicable standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that it had submitted to the sentencing Judge that the offence was below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of the kind. It did not disavow that submission in this Court, but submitted that the sentencing Judge’s characterisation of the offending as being “towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness” was plainly erroneous. In support of this submission, the Crown relied principally on two matters. First, at the time of the offence, the victim was 5 years and 10 months of age, well below the age of 10 years required for an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act. Secondly, there was a considerable breach of trust involved in the offending, given that the respondent was the uncle of the victim, and was in charge of the victim in the absence of the victim’s mother.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that while the offending was relatively short in duration, lasting only a few minutes, it was not merely transient, and only ceased when the respondent heard the victim’s mother returning home. The Crown pointed to the fact that the offending persisted even though it caused the victim pain.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the age and vulnerability of a victim and the abuse of a position of trust or authority are both aggravating factors in ss 21A(2)(k) and 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In those circumstances, the Crown submitted that it was not open to the sentencing Judge to characterise the objective seriousness of the offence as she did.
	
	
	In further support of this submission, the Crown drew attention to the fact that this Court has, on a number of occasions, remarked that the abuse by an offender of a position of trust is a significant aggravating factor: R v Stoupe [2015] NSWCCA 175, Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [73]. As well, the Crown pointed to the fact that the age of the victim should have been considered a highly aggravating factor: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [47], particularly when combined with the fact that the younger the child is, the more vulnerable and defenceless they are: MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271 at [22].
	
	
	The fourth respect in which the Crown challenged the sentencing Judge’s findings was with respect to her conclusion that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation and was at a low risk of re-offending, particularly in the absence of any expression of remorse, contrition or insight into his offending. The Crown also pointed to the fact that there was no pre-sentence report and no psychological assessment as to the respondent’s risk of re-offending. Accordingly, the Crown submitted that there was little, if any, material upon which the sentencing Judge could base such a finding, and that it ought not to have been made.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge erred in finding special circumstances, and in setting an erroneously lenient non-parole period. While acknowledging the fact that the fixing of a non-parole period is discretionary, the Crown contended that the non-parole period did not appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [63]. The Crown pointed to the fact that the matters relied upon by the sentencing Judge to constitute special circumstances could not properly be characterised as such.
	
	
	More generally, the Crown submitted that the nature of the offence was one which called for a strong element of general deterrence, denunciation and the protection of the community: see EG v R [2015] NSWCCA 21 at [42].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that although the sentencing Judge did refer to general deterrence in the abstract, the sentence which she imposed did not adequately reflect the need for either general or specific deterrence.
	
	
	The Crown drew the Court’s attention to a series of cases which it submitted were of assistance in determining whether error had been shown.
	


The Respondent’s Submissions


	
	With respect to the categorisation of the objective serious of the offence, the respondent submitted that an examination of the sentencing Judge’s reasons reveals that she had regard to all of the factors to which the Crown has pointed, and that this Court would in those circumstances be reluctant to intervene.
	
	
	The respondent conceded that the submission which had been made to the sentencing Judge, namely that the offence was at or near the bottom or low end of the range of objective seriousness, could not be maintained. However, the respondent pointed to the fact that that submission had been rejected by the sentencing Judge when she concluded that the offence fell “towards the lower end of the range”. The respondent submitted that the Court should be satisfied that, in substance, the sentencing Judge had accepted the Crown’s submission that the offending was below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The respondent also pointed to the fact that it was clear from her Honour’s remarks that the sentencing Judge was aware of the victim’s age, and also the abuse of trust which was involved, and that these factors were taken into account.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that there was no error to be found in the sentencing Judge’s conclusions with respect to the respondent’s prospects of re‑offending and the existence of special circumstances. With respect to her Honour’s finding of special circumstances, the respondent pointed to the fact that this finding was not based on any one fact, but rather a combination of factors relevant to the case. As well, the respondent pointed to the fact that the adjustment of the non-parole period from 75% to 66.67% of the head sentence was a relatively modest adjustment.
	
	
	Finally, the respondent pointed to the cases relied upon in the Crown’s submissions and urged the Court to exercise caution in taking them into account because they were a small sub-set of potentially relevant cases and, accordingly, were likely to present a misleading picture of an appropriate range of sentences.
	
	
	Ultimately, counsel for the respondent accepted that the sentence might be regarded as lenient. However, he emphasised that, having regard to the fact that the offending was a single isolated event, the sentence was nevertheless within the permissible discretionary range of a sentencing Judge, and that this Court should not intervene.
	


Discernment


	
	The commencement point of addressing this appeal is to identify the seriousness of an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act. The legislation conveyed that degree of seriousness by fixing a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	The reasons for this are clear: the age of a victim, which the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt as being under 10, demonstrates in and of itself, the vulnerability of the victim to offences of this kind. Further, the likelihood that such a young person would be able to resist an adult is very low. As well, Courts have acknowledged the long-term psychological effects that such conduct can have upon a child. All of these features combine to demonstrate why the legislature and the Courts regard this offence as very serious.
	
	
	In light of the seriousness of an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act, Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Harrison and R A Hulme JJ agreed) said the following in EG v R at [42]:
	


“General deterrence, denunciation and the protection of the community are principles of sentencing which are relevant to cases involving child sexual abuse. The concern of the courts is to send a message to those who would sexually abuse children intentionally and repeatedly that their actions will not be tolerated, and that they will receive significant punishment.”


	
	As the Chief Judge went on to point out, there is a need for courts to denounce the actions of those who prey on vulnerable children and who intentionally sexually assault them.
	
	
	In our view, there are several features of this case which rendered the objective seriousness of the offence higher than that found by the sentencing judge, including:
	



	
	the victim was only 5 years and 10 months old, well below the statutory age of 10 years and, on any view, young and vulnerable;
	
	
	the victim was in the care of the respondent, who abused his position of trust in behaving as he did;
	
	
	the respondent persisted in his offending after the victim had complained of pain; and
	
	
	the respondent only ceased his offending when he thought he might be caught upon the return of the victim’s mother.
	



	
	It was an error for the sentencing Judge to describe the objective seriousness of the offence as being “towards the lower end of the range”. It was properly described, as the Crown submitted, as being below the mid-range of objective seriousness. We would add to that description the words “… but not by very much”.
	
	
	The respondent’s subjective features were important matters to be weighed in the balance as matters of mitigation. He was responsible for the financial support of his family, and the care of his wife. That is not an uncommon feature of offenders coming before the courts. He could properly be regarded as a person of prior good character. There were no other features of the respondent’s subjective case which warranted leniency.
	
	
	We note, on the question of the respondent’s good character, that the Crown did not submit that s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which prevents good character being taken into account in mitigation in child sexual assault cases, applies. Whilst arguably it does apply here, given the absence of submissions addressed to its application, the preferable course is to not apply it. It is well recognised in existing authority that good character is of less significance in cases of repeated sexual offending: see PGM v R [2008] NSWCCA 172 at [43]-[44]; Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 at [49]. As this is not a case of multiple offending, and the Crown did not submit that the principles were directly applicable, we will put these authorities to one side.
	
	
	No explanation was afforded to the sentencing Judge for the offending which occurred. Nor were there any features identified which could have contributed to the subjective circumstances being of greater weight than would ordinarily be the case.
	
	
	As a result of the erroneously lenient categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offence by the sentencing Judge, and having regard to all of the circumstances, we conclude that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. It did not reflect the principle of general deterrence or of denunciation of the crime. It did not reflect the legislative guideposts which demonstrate that this offence is one of the utmost seriousness. Importantly, the sentence simply did not reflect the degree of objective seriousness of the criminality involved.
	
	
	In the circumstances, we need not further consider the submissions of the Crown dealing with the respondent’s prospects of re-offending and the making of an allowance for special circumstances.
	


Residual Discretion


	
	This Court has a residual discretion in the event of a Crown appeal to decline to uphold the appeal despite finding error. Once error is shown, the Crown bears the onus of persuading the Court to intervene by upholding the appeal and resentencing the respondent. In considering the exercise of this discretion, amongst other things, the Court needs to keep in mind that the principal purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to enable this Court to lay down and clarify sentencing principles for the guidance of sentencing courts. Consistency of sentencing is a matter of importance in maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice: Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 306 per McHugh J.
	
	
	We are persuaded by the Crown that we should refrain from exercising the residual discretion to dismiss the Crown’s appeal. There was no specific matter suggested by the respondent militating against intervention except the passage of just under 7 months since the sentence was imposed. But this is only about one-third of the non-parole period imposed by the sentencing Judge, and is not a factor which of itself would justify the exercise of the residual discretion.
	
	
	In light of the disparity between the sentence actually imposed, and what we regard as one necessary to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, this is not a matter for the exercise by us of the residual discretion to dismiss the appeal.
	


Re-sentence


	
	As has been said, the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness but it was not at the low or lower end of that range. We have earlier referred at [5] to [9] the facts found by the sentencing Judge. We are content to adopt those facts for the purposes of re-sentencing the respondent.
	
	
	The particular features of the offence referred to above at [42] call for denunciation and general deterrence to be given particular consideration in resentencing the respondent. This Court should also receive and consider the victim impact statement which was made by the victim: s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Here, the victim impact statement speaks eloquently of the adverse effects of the respondent’s conduct.
	
	
	The respondent is entitled to be regarded as a person who, aside from this offence, is to be regarded as a person of good character who does not have a record of significant previous criminal convictions. We also conclude, contrary to the Crown’s submissions, as did the sentencing Judge, that the respondent is unlikely to re-offend, and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Court has also had regard, in the limited way permissible, to the many cases drawn to its attention by the parties in the appeal. None of them are sufficiently similar to this case to warrant discussion.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that a finding of special circumstances is available upon the basis that the respondent is required to be the full-time carer for his wife and two year old child on account of his wife’s significant back injury. We agree, and make such a finding, but only so that the statutory ratio is altered to a modest extent.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, the appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
	


Orders


	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal upheld.
	
	
	Sentence of the District Court (Norton SC DCJ) imposed on 6 November 2015 be quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, for the offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act, the respondent be sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 6 November 2015 and expiring on 5 November 2019, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 5 November 2021.
	



	
	The respondent will not be eligible for release before the expiry of his non‑parole period.

2769587,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 55) [2016] NSWSC 720,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	I am presently approximately halfway through my summing-up to the jury. At the conclusion of yesterday's proceedings, I had indicated to the jury that I expected that they would be asked to commence their deliberations either late today or tomorrow. Before proceedings commenced today I received, through the Sheriff's Officer, a note from one of the members of the jury (MFI 206) which is in the following terms:
	


“Dear Judge, it was a privilege to serve on a jury panel in your courtroom, kindly if I could with your approval and permission dismiss myself from the final panel of 12 and save everyone the hassles of a ballot for a very strict work commitment. Thank you very much.”


	
	When I raised the content of that note with counsel, I expressed the tentative view that if it were simply the case that the member of the jury was seeking to, as it were, “dismiss himself” in order to ""save everyone the hassles of a ballot"", I had some doubt as to whether or not my power to discharge a member of the jury extended to those circumstances. However, as matters have transpired, it is not necessary for me to resolve that question.
	
	
	It was generally agreed between counsel that it would be necessary to obtain further information from the juror about the nature of the work commitment to which he referred. That request produced a second note (MFI 207) which is in the following terms:
	


“Dear Judge, I have a restaurant, and next Monday or Tuesday the Holy month of Ramadan starts and in this month we change our opening hours and estimated closing time every night is about 4am.”


	
	When I raised the contents of that note with counsel, it was the Crown's position, as well as that of Mr Thomas, that there existed a basis upon which I could exercise the discretion contained in s 53B(d) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) (“the Act”) to discharge the juror.
	
	
	Mr Wendler, whilst to some extent embracing that position, submitted that I should make an enquiry about whether there was any other person who could take the juror’s place in his business for such time as the jury deliberations might continue. The Crown had no objection to that course being taken. Mr Thomas' position was that there was a sufficient basis to discharge the juror in the absence of any further enquiry being undertaken. However, I sought further information which was contained in a third note (MFI 208) which was in the following terms:
	


“Dear Judge, for the duration of the trial I had someone filling in for me. But since we will be changing our trading hours as of Monday for the fasting month I will be required at night until very late, about 4am every day.”


	
	As I observed in the course of discussing the issue with counsel, if the juror remained, and assuming that he was not eliminated by ballot, and assuming further that the jury's deliberations continued into early next week, he would be required to work for very long hours in his business, until 4am each day. He would then be required to attend court only a matter of hours later to participate in what are, on any view, very serious deliberations.
	
	
	If those circumstances came to pass they would obviously not be conducive to the juror being able to discharge his functions and obligations properly. It would not be fair to any of the parties in this trial to allow such a situation to eventuate. Over and above that, there is a risk that if the juror is not discharged he may simply conform to, and adopt, a particular view in the course of deliberations, purely for the purpose ensuring that he is free to conduct his business. The significance of that risk requires no further comment.
	
	
	The terms of s 53B(d) of the Act are wide. They confer a discretion on the Court to discharge a member of a jury if it appears to the Court that, for any other reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror. There are a series of matters which would affect the juror's ability to perform his functions if he were required to remain.
	
	
	In those circumstances, and noting that all counsel were in agreement with the course that I propose to adopt, I make an order discharging juror number 01436073 and I further order that the trial proceed with the remaining 12 jurors.
	
	
	As I indicated to counsel, I propose to have the juror brought into court and indicate to him personally that I have made that order. This is essentially for two reasons. Firstly, as a matter of courtesy to a member of the public who has invested more than four months of his life in service to the community in this trial, the juror deserves to be thanked for his efforts. Secondly, it is important that he be reminded that having been discharged, he is to have no contact whatsoever with any of the remaining jurors in the period between now and the delivery of the verdicts. I will remind him that the Act creates offences relating to the disclosure of information emanating from any aspect of the jury's functions. When the remaining 12 jurors are brought into court, I will remind them that they too are to have no contact with the juror who has been discharged. In this regard, I note that I have directed the Sheriff to ensure that once the juror in question leaves the court room, he is to be escorted from the premises without having any further contact with any one of the twelve remaining jurors.

		15 June 2016",2016-06-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769591,Penfold v R [2016] NSWCCA 101,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I have read the judgment of R A Hulme J. The reasons given by him for joining in the orders made by the Court on 3 March 2016 reflect the reasons for which I agreed with the orders.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with the reasons set out by Justice R A Hulme. Those reasons reflect the basis upon which I joined in the conclusion reached by the members of the Court, namely, that the three grounds of appeal had been established.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Gavin Penfold was found guilty by a jury on 9 April 2014 of an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months.
	
	
	Mr Penfold appealed against his conviction but not the sentence. There were three grounds of appeal. Grounds 1 and 2 related to an incident that occurred in the courtroom at the conclusion of the evidence of the principal prosecution witness in the case against the appellant. Success on either of these grounds would result in an order for a retrial. Ground 3 asserted that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or not supported by the evidence. Success on this ground would result in a verdict of acquittal being entered.
	
	
	Mr Penfold has a right of appeal in relation to the first two grounds but leave was required in relation to the third: s 5(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing on 3 March 2016 the members of the Court were of the unanimous view that each of the grounds was made out. Leave to appeal upon ground 3 was granted, the appeal on each ground was allowed, the conviction was quashed and a verdict of acquittal was entered. The following are the reasons I joined in the making of those orders.
	


The prosecution case


	
	The prosecution case was that in the afternoon of 12 October 2012, Ms Adelaide Porter, then 19 years old, and her friend Mark Mills, then 24 years old, were at Ms Porter’s flat in Nelson Bay on the mid-north coast. Mr Mills answered a knock at the door. A male voice said it was “Jessie” (the name of a friend of Mr Mills). As it turned out, there were two men at the door, one of whom was Scott McGuire, a man known to both Mr Mills and Ms Porter. The other man was not identified by either of them at the time but Ms Porter thought his face was familiar.
	
	
	The two men forced their way inside and Mr Mills fell to the floor. McGuire, who was armed with a machete, demanded, “Give me everything you’ve got. Give me all your stuff”. Mr Mills attempted to defend himself and Ms Porter with a kitchen knife and he stabbed McGuire. Mr Mills was then felled by the other intruder. There was more struggling and Mr Mills was assaulted by both men who then fled empty-handed.
	
	
	Ms Porter called police and nominated McGuire as one of the offenders. In circumstances outlined in detail below she later identified the appellant as the other offender.
	
	
	The appellant was tried jointly with McGuire whose case was that he had gone to the flat with a person named “Jason”, expecting to see his friend “Beau”. He had an altercation with Mr Mills who accused him of having slept with Ms Porter. It was his case that Mr Mills was the aggressor who had attacked him with a spear gun and then a machete.
	
	
	No other evidence in the prosecution case identified the appellant as the second offender. Accordingly, the evidence of Ms Porter was critical; her evidence of identifying the appellant as the second offender had to be accepted as being accurate by the jury beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Ground 1 – The learned trial judge erred in declining to discharge the jury

Ground 2 – In the alternative, the direction given by the learned trial judge on 27 March 2014 was inadequate


	
	The trial commenced on Monday 24 March 2014. Ms Porter gave evidence on Wednesday 26 March from about 9.30am until about 3.00pm. The following morning the trial judge drew the attention of counsel to an incident that had been raised by members of the jury with the court officer when they were released the previous day. The officer recorded in a document that became MFI 6 what she had been told:
	


""Upon releasing the jury for the day at approximately 3.45pm one jury member enquired from me whether it would be possible to view the security footage of the courtroom. They noticed that there were cameras in the courtroom and wanted to review something that some of the members noticed occurred at the conclusion of Ms Adelaide Porters evidence.

Without wanting to go into detail with the jurors in relation to the security requirements in the courtroom I advised the jury that security footage wasn’t accessible but I could raise any issues with the Judge.

Some jury members then indicated to me on an informal basis as we were walking out of the jury room that it appeared to a few members who were watching the accused as Ms Adelaide Porter walked out of the witness box at the conclusion of her evidence they viewed Mr Gavin Penfold raise his fist to his cheek in what they have taken to be a threat made to Ms Adelaide Porter that he was going to hit her.

I have indicated to the jury that I would bring that matter to the Judges attention but that at this point of time, and due to the fact I was releasing them for the day that my belief was security footage was not available and the matter would be raised with the Judge. I then released the jury at 3.50pm."" (Emphasis added)


	
	Footage from a security camera installed in the courtroom was available. The judge described what he made of it as follows:
	


""It does show Ms Porter leaving or walking down in front of the jury box and past the dock and she appears to be looking straight ahead towards the back of the room as she's leaving. It does show Mr Penfold turning, and this is my interpretation, turning his head which would be to his left and that is away from Ms Porter who is either beside him or further to the back of the room and then his fist being placed against his jaw or side of his face, possibly fist, which could be consistent with either a fist being made or it could be consistent with him just putting his hand on that part of his face. I was unable to determine whether or not there was any threat that could be inferred from that action. That's my interpretation. It may be others but that's how I see it from that.""


	
	I pause at this point to observe that the footage was made available to this Court and I have viewed it a number of times. The trial judge’s description of the “gesture” by the appellant occurring as Ms Porter was “either beside him or further to the back of the room” is not quite accurate. The event occurred just as Ms Porter was drawing level with the dock.
	
	
	It is also important to note that the security camera was installed high on the wall above the bench, quite some distance from the dock. The jury box is close to the dock and Ms Porter was passing between the two. Jurors were in a far better position to see what occurred than a person viewing the camera footage.
	
	
	The trial judge made the footage available for the parties to view. He then asked the Crown Prosecutor whether he had an application. He replied:
	


""I don't have any application, but I anticipate there will be application or applications coming to your Honour and when that happens I don't know that the Crown can oppose them."" (Emphasis added)


	
	Counsel then appearing for Mr Penfold applied for the jury to be discharged. She submitted that the security camera footage was equivocal but said ""the source of the difficulty that would preclude the jury from exercising an impartial mind is the sentiments that have been expressed in the letter from the court officer"". Counsel for the co-accused joined in the application.
	
	
	The trial judge refused the application on the basis of the following reasons:
	


“I am not going to discharge the jury and I will give some reasons for that. In this most unusual matter, as indicated earlier today, I received information from a Court Officer, who was in Court 4 Newcastle. I asked that officer to put in writing what was said to her by members and members of the jury.

Application has been made on behalf of each accused for the jury to be discharged. Ms Hutchins, who appears for the accused Penfold, correctly raises two matters. Firstly, there is the conversation between the officer and one jury member which is set out in the MFI, in the first paragraph and secondly, there is what appears to be informal discussion between other members of the jury not in the - or as they were leaving the jury room.

The information received is a request by the jury to review security footage and that is to form a view as to what occurred. In my mind, that creates that there some uncertainty by the jurors as to what did or did not occur.

In my mind, having now viewed the footage a number of times, it is clear that Ms Porter had moved past the dock and was not in sight, that is her sight, of Mr Penfold, or indeed of Mr McGuire and thus, in terms of there being any threat that she was aware of, that could not be demonstrated.

The counsel raised with me the prospect of prejudice against each accused and I propose to deal with any possible prejudice by issuing a firm direction that the jury is not to consider any actions by anyone, including the accused in this jury, unless it is evidence and they must disregard any matter that is not evidence, from their minds.

I will also indicate to them that it is my job and not theirs, to be involved with security matters, but I will tell them that having viewed the footage, I am of the view that there was not any threat made to Ms Porter and in my mind the action or inaction of Mr Penfold, is not a matter that amounted on any version, to a threat to Ms Porter.”


	
	Some observations can be made about that reasoning. As previously mentioned, Ms Porter had not moved past the dock when the appellant made the gesture in question. Secondly, whether or not Ms Porter was in a position to see it, the more significant thing was the interpretation the jurors may have placed on the gesture and according to the court officer’s note, a “few members” interpreted it as ""a threat to Ms Adelaide Porter that [the appellant] was going to hit her”.
	
	
	The jury were then brought into court and the judge gave a direction which included:
	


“ … it is not your job, and you must not, and I emphasise must not, consider any matter in relation to this trial other than the evidence, and you’ve heard evidence, under oath, from the witness box and from the exhibits, and I can tell you, from my experience, that often things are misinterpreted or seen in any way, and it’s my job in respect of matters of security and looking at image, that’s my job, not yours.

…

I have shown that image to counsel and, having seen that image a number of times, I am of the view that the trial should proceed, because, looking at the image, it would appear that as Ms Porter left the room, she is looking towards the back of the room, perhaps to a person who was, who was in a white shirt who was sitting in the public area, and it would appear that the action of Mr Penfold that was identified by one of you occurs after she’s passed him …

So, and in terms of the action of Mr Penfold, I do not see his action in any way being intimidatory or any other matter for that part. It may be interpreted that way, but I don’t see it, frankly. …

So, having viewed the matter, I am of the view that you must, and I direct you, in respect of, and I will in any event direct you that you’re not allowed to look at anything that isn’t evidence. That’s where you draw the facts from, and to consider to look at what may or may not happen in any other part of the room other than the witness box or in respect of the exhibits, is not allowed, and

indeed you are directed, and I direct you, to excuse and to dismiss all such matters. Indeed, I will give you a direction later that in respect of the identification, or the supposed, alleged identification of Mr Porter, you are not to form any view of him as he sits in that witness box - sorry, Mr Penfold, as he sits in the witness box. It’s not for you to - it’s for the witness, coming from evidence, not your job. Very easy for all of us to become investigators.

…

And, of course, if you start forming any conclusions from other matters, an accused person not only will have the chance to defend themselves, or to challenge it, they won’t even know. That’s how important it is, and that’s a matter of absolute fairness that you must, and I direct you, to apply.” (Emphasis added)


	
	Later that day (Thursday 27 March), counsel for both accused asked for the trial to be adjourned to the following Monday in anticipation of an appeal being brought to this Court pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act against his Honour's refusal to discharge the jury. The judge acceded to that request.
	
	
	On Monday 31 March the judge was told that the application for leave to appeal was listed before this Court on Thursday 3 April. An application for a further adjournment of the trial was made but refused. Counsel for the appellant also made a further application for the jury to be discharged based both on what the jury had reported to the court officer and upon the asserted inadequacy of the direction the judge had given the jury. On this occasion the Crown Prosecutor opposed the application to discharge, saying that upon reflection it was a matter appropriately dealt with by way of direction. The application was again refused.
	


Determination


	
	At the very least, this issue raised a question as to whether a fair-minded and informed observer would have apprehended a lack of impartiality on the part of one or more jurors. That is not to say that there is any suggestion of fault on the part of any juror. But the fact that some jurors had reported perceiving that the appellant had made a threatening gesture directed at the principal Crown witness against him could well give rise to a fair-minded observer thinking that such impartiality of those jurors could be affected adversely.
	
	
	It is possible that such perceptions can be sufficiently assuaged by directions given to the jury by the trial judge: see, for example, Webb & Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 at 55-56 (Mason CJ and McHugh J) and 88 (Toohey J). In this case there was a direction, in effect, to ignore the incident and to decide the case on the evidence presented through witnesses and exhibits. To a lawyer or judicial officer that might be thought to be a command to put the incident entirely to one side. But the fair-minded and informed observer would also have noticed that in addition to the judge expressing his personal view about what he saw on the camera footage he also allowed for the possibility that what in fact happened was intimidatory conduct by the appellant towards the most significant witness in the case against him (“It may be interpreted that way, but I don’t see it, frankly”). Given the close proximity of the jury to the incident compared to the obvious disadvantage of the judge interpreting footage recorded from a distant camera, the direction did very little to dispel concern the fair-minded observer might have had about the jury being prejudiced against the appellant.
	
	
	The exhortation to the jury by the judge to decide the case on the evidence and not to take into account anything that had been observed in the court room was appropriate and it would in many circumstances be thought sufficient to avoid the risk of a miscarriage of justice: see, for example, Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at [31] (McHugh J). But leaving it open to the jury to consider that, from the judge having viewed the camera footage repeatedly, he thought their reported concern could be valid, tainted the whole affair such that it cannot otherwise be concluded than that the fair-minded informed observer could think that the jury might not bring an impartial mind to bear upon the critical issues they had to decide.
	
	
	It might be thought that an accused person who misconducts him or herself in the presence of the jury during a trial should not be heard to later complain that a miscarriage has occurred through prejudice either in the mind of jurors or perceived by a fair-minded observer. But that can only be taken so far. Here, it seems clear that only some of the jurors saw the incident. However, it is a practical reality that it is likely their observations and interpretations of the event would have been conveyed to the jurors who did not see it. There could be no certainty that what would be conveyed would be consistent with what actually occurred, particularly in circumstances where the event occurred in no more than about a second.
	
	
	For these reasons grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal were made good.
	


Evidence pertaining to Ms Porter’s identification


	
	Ms Porter said that she had lived her whole life in the Nelson Bay area. On the afternoon of 12 October 2012 she was lying on her bed talking on her phone to a friend when there was a knock at the door. She described the ensuing events which, on any view, were chaotic. Ms Porter said “there was a lot of yelling”.
	
	
	Ms Porter thought the whole incident took a minute or two: “it wasn’t a long time at all”. Mr Mills thought it would not have taken any longer than four or five minutes, probably less. He described Ms Porter as hysterical the whole time, crying and screaming.
	
	
	Ms Porter knew Scott McGuire. She said that when the men first entered the house she called out, “Scott, not at my house. You’re not welcome here. Please leave.”
	
	
	She said that the second man followed her as she retreated to her bedroom whilst there was an altercation between McGuire and Mr Mills. The second man did not say anything but she said:
	


“[He] was pacing backwards and forward keeping his body towards me and towards Mark, just pacing between sort of where we were and what was going on. I don’t have a lot of memory of the altercation itself. I try not to watch violence.”


	
	As to the second man she said (in her evidence) he looked ""extremely familiar"" but she “couldn’t put a name to who he was”. She thought at the time that he was the younger brother of a man who received guitar lessons from her father. She qualified this in her evidence by saying that she had recently found out that “he used to hang around with the boy that my dad taught guitar”. In cross-examination she said “he used to be babysat by the parents of the guy my dad taught guitar to at the time when I was young”.
	
	
	Ms Porter said she gave a description to the police of the second offender that he was of “similar build to Scott [McGuire] in height and shoulder structure and everything else. He had mousey blond hair or blond/brown hair with a round flat sort of face”. When asked by the prosecutor how he was dressed she said, “Quite casually, in dark clothes”. During an identification procedure five months later she said “I think he was in a dark hooded jacket at the time with a hood on”.
	
	
	Ms Porter made a statement to police on the night of the incident (12 October 2012). Three weeks, or may be a month later (she said she could not recall exactly) Ms Porter heard that the name of the second intruder was “Gavin”. Friends had told her that the “word around Nelson Bay [was] that it was a guy named Gavin”. Her brother had heard this as well. One of the friends “gave me two names saying it could’ve been one Gavin that he didn’t remember the last name of or another guy that could’ve been Gavin Bagnall”. She said she knew Gavin Bagnall and it was not him.
	
	
	Ms Porter said that three or four months after she was given the name “Gavin” she saw the second intruder walk past her when she was at the Salamander Shopping Centre. She said she remarked to a friend who was with her, “Do you know who that is? That was the guy that was at my house that day with Scott”. Her friend did not know the man but Ms Porter said “I knew he was the bloke, he was the guy that was at my house that day.”
	
	
	Ms Porter was asked if she saw the man again and she said that a few weeks later:
	


""I'd seen the same figure as the guy that was at my house walking along Gan Gan Road, I think – not Gan Gan Road, Taylor's Beach Road. I never saw a face to the guy that I saw walk in but the same figure of the guy walked in along there was the exact same figure of the man that was at my house that day"".


	
	She said that she then saw him at Anna Bay on an occasion when she was driving past on her way to pick up her father. On the return journey she saw him again and asked her father who he was. He told her that the man was Gavin Penfold. She said she told her father that he was one of the men who were at her house “that day”. She continued her evidence as follows:
	


“That day I called Detective Harvey. Before I did, when I saw him at Salamander, I thought I knew who he was but I wasn’t 100 per cent sure. We both live in the same area, the same town. It’s such a small area, everyone knows everyone. There’s one high school. Well, there’s two high schools, one’s a private, one’s a public. I went to both. It’s such a small area that you know everyone through everyone, so when I saw him at Salamander I thought that that was Gavin Penfold but I wasn’t 100 per cent sure in my own mind. I knew that it was the guy – that guy that I saw at Salamander was Gavin Penfold but I didn’t know if that was his name for sure.”


	
	In cross-examination, she said “the second I saw him I identified him as the second offender”. She denied that this was because she had been told that the second offender was “Gavin Penfold” but agreed it was after she had heard the rumour that this person was “Gavin”. She was dismissive of the rumour: “That’s Nelson Bay. There’s a lot of rumours about a lot of things. I never listen to what anyone says”.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Mitchell Harvey was the officer in charge of the investigation. He gave evidence that Ms Porter rang him on 14 March 2013 to advise that she now had the name for the second intruder; she said she had seen that person earlier that day. He arranged to take a further statement from her that day. Ms Porter agreed that in that statement she had said she had:
	


""heard on the grape vine in the Nelson Bay area that Gavin Penfold was the second offender with Scott McGuire who committed this offence. When I heard this it immediately came back to me and I was able to put Gavin Penfold's name to the face which was the second offender with Scott McGuire who committed this offence."" (Emphasis added)


	
	Ms Porter maintained in her evidence, however, that she had not got the full name from the grape vine, only ""Gavin"". She said that what was recorded in the statement was not what she had told the police. Detective Harvey gave evidence that Ms Porter had been given the statement to read and she appeared to read it before she signed it. She did not suggest that any changes were required.
	
	
	Later on 14 March Detective Harvey and another officer attended the appellant's home and arrested him. The appellant exercised his right to silence and his right not to participate in an identification parade.
	
	
	On 20 March 2013 Ms Penfold underwent a photographic identification procedure whereby she was shown the images of 20 men and identified that of the appellant in the 10th of the photographs displayed. Having selected that photograph she said that he was the second intruder into the house and described him as not being the ringleader but ""the backup"". She also said:
	


""He was, when we opened the door I realised it was two men who weren't allowed into my house. He's kicked the door open and helped the other intruder into my house.

He followed me around and made sure I walked to my bed so I couldn't help the other guy that was attacking my, sort of boyfriend at the time (and she was interrupted).

He was standing on the left hand side when they first got to my door.

He made sure that I sat on my bed, so that I couldn't help. After he turned around and walked back to where the other guy had my boy… my partner at the time, on the ground, I got up and walked towards them and he sort of just stood at me to make sure I couldn't and wouldn’t do anything, kind of shadowed me everywhere around the house. And also, like, attacked my partner at the time.

I don't know if he had a weapon or not at the time. I don't remember. I know the other guy definitely did.”


	
	She reviewed the remaining photographs and then had the following conversation with the interviewing officer:
	


Q. So the only person you recognise from being at your home that night is the guy in number ten?

A. Yes.

Q. Right, ok. That fellow there? (Photograph 10 was again on the computer screen)

A. Yes.

Q. So out of those 20 images you just viewed Adelaide, this is the only fellow you recognise …?

A. Definitely

Q. … as being involved in the offence that night?

A. Definitely.

Q. Definitely?

A. Yeah, I think so, yes. That look scares the hell out of me…

Q. Does he look much different in that photo to the night he came to your home?

A. Umm, not really, not too much, but then again I couldn't really see too much of him. I think he was in a dark hooded jacket at the time [she held both hands up beside her neck/lower jaw area] with the hood on. So you couldn't get too much of a look at him at the time. I suffer anxiety as well, so when people come into my house I, do you know what I mean? But, yeah, definitely like … there are those eyes … I could see the eyes, that was …

Q. Is there something particular about him that makes you think that, that makes you recall that this was the bloke there, or is it just his general appearance or are you positive that that's him?

A. I've known him for about four, five years ago, just through being local at the Bay, just running into each other. Not actually speaking or talking on any occasions really. But friends of mine would've had some association and stuff with him years ago. So, at the time I knew it was someone very familiar to me. Umm, since I've seen him and I've said that was him at my house. Since I've seen the photo [she gestured at this point with her hand towards the computer screen showing photo number 10] it was him at my house.

Q. This is definitely the fellow …?

A. Definitely the fellow that was at my house.

Q. Your ability to recall this fellow and to identify him, is it based on your knowledge of him years ago or is it based on your knowledge of him being at your house that night?

A. Being at my house that night.

Q. So, do you want to confirm him as being at your house that night?

A. Yes. It almost looks like a similar shirt he had on that same night, do you know what I mean? Like, whether it was, but, he wore clothes big for him, umm, yeah."" (Emphasis added)


	
	In cross-examination, Ms Porter said that she could not estimate the number of times she had seen the appellant in her twenty years of growing up in the area, although she could say that she saw him a lot more when she was younger; it was “at least ten times throughout my high schooling”. She finished high school at the end of 2010. Since high school she thought she had seen him “maybe once or twice around Nelson Bay, I don’t recall sorry, at all”.
	


Appellant’s submissions


	
	Mr Johnson, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that there was a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of Ms Porter’s identification of his client and, as the prosecution case relied solely upon it, there should have been a reasonable doubt that guilt had been proved.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was no real dispute that one feature of the description of the second intruder provided to police on the day of the incident was wrong: that she recognised him as being the younger brother of someone who her father taught guitar. Ms Porter modified the description in her evidence but maintained that there was some connection with her father's guitar teaching. However, there was no evidence in the trial as to whether the appellant had any such connection. The submission that Ms Porter was wrong in this aspect of her description overstates the matter but it remains that it did not serve to confirm the correctness of her identification.
	
	
	Reference was made to her statement during the photographic identification procedure on 20 March 2013 that “I couldn’t really see too much of him” and it was submitted that her description of the events on 12 October 2012 supported the correctness of that statement.
	
	
	As a general proposition, it was submitted that the series of events leading to Ms Porter's ultimate claim to identify the appellant, by name and by photograph, were such as to raise a real doubt about the reliability of her evidence in that regard.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The written submissions for the Crown contained a detailed analysis of the evidence of Ms Porter. It was submitted that it was ""perfectly open"" to the jury to accept her evidence and to reject the contention that her photographic identification of the appellant was contaminated by the rumours she had heard. It was noted that Ms Porter denied paying heed to such rumours. This was said to be supported by the fact that she did not go back to the police until months later when she was sure of the identity of the second intruder.
	
	
	It was submitted that such inconsistencies that might exist in the evidence were minor and explicable by Ms Porter's youth; her level of comprehension; her anxiety over the incident; her diagnosed anxiety disorder; and the time that had elapsed between the incident and the trial.
	
	
	In the Crown's submission, this was not a case of ""stranger-to-stranger"" identification but involved a gradual recognition over time precipitated by a sense of familiarity with the person she saw at the time of the incident. It was also noted that there was nothing to indicate that someone had suggested to her that the person she had seen on the subsequent occasions was the second intruder. To the contrary, she had recognised the person as the second intruder and then asked who it was. She then reinforced that recognition by her selection of the photograph of the appellant.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that any doubt experienced by this Court would be assuaged by having regard to the advantage enjoyed by the jury in seeing and hearing the witness in the atmosphere of the trial, citing M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494.
	


Resolution


	
	The principles concerning the determination of a ground of appeal that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, are well known. In short, the question is whether, upon independently assessing the evidence, this Court is of the view that it was open to the jury (in the sense explained by the High Court) to conclude beyond reasonable that the appellant was guilty: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493; Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 56; 191 CLR 439; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	As I previously observed, it was necessary for the jury to accept beyond reasonable doubt the identification of the appellant as the second intruder as being accurate and reliable. I have no doubt that Ms Porter would have presented to the jury as an honest witness who firmly believed in her own mind that her identification was completely accurate and reliable. Therein lies one of the recognised difficulties with identification evidence which has been described by the High Court as having a ""seductive effect"": Domican v The Queen [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 at 561.
	
	
	Section 116 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) requires a judge to inform a jury ""that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence"". The suggested direction in the Criminal Trials Bench Book published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales includes that the judge should tell the jury that special caution is required even in circumstances where a witness may appear to be impressive, even persuasive, in that he or she may present as honestly and sincerely believing that the identification is correct. The s 116 direction that trial judge gave the jury in the present case included such a warning.
	
	
	Accepting Ms Porter's honesty and sincerity, it is inescapable that the reliability of her identification on 20 March 2013 of the man she said was the second intruder in the break-in at her home on 12 October 2012 was potentially adversely affected by a number of matters.
	
	
	First, the incident was sudden in onset and took place over a few minutes in chaotic, violent and traumatic circumstances. Ms Porter was described by her partner as hysterical the whole time, crying and screaming. She included in her statement of 12 October 2012 that she suffered from anxiety.
	
	
	Secondly, Ms Porter's description to police of the second intruder included reference to the colour of his hair, yet five months later she said that he had a hood on his head. The description also included that he had some connection with a person who had been taught guitar by her father. Although her description of the connection changed over time, there was no evidence that the appellant had any such connection. In short, this aspect of the description was entirely neutral.
	
	
	Thirdly, although Ms Porter said that she was dismissive of rumours that the second intruder was ""Gavin"" and that she insisted she was not given the name ""Gavin Penfold"" before her father told her, she said in her statement of 14 March 2013 that she had ""heard on the grape vine in the Nelson Bay area that Gavin Penfold was the second offender"".
	
	
	Fourthly, the delay between the incident and the first sighting at Salamander is significant; she said the intervening period was some three or four months. And, despite her insistence to have been dismissive of rumours, the potential for her memory to have been affected, at least subconsciously, by having heard that the second intruder was ""Gavin"" or ""Gavin Penfold"" is not insignificant.
	
	
	Fifthly, a critical question is whether Ms Porter was correct in her claimed recognition of the second intruder at the Salamander shops. If there is a doubt about it, there must be a doubt about whether the person she saw on the subsequent occasions was the second intruder or whether the image of the person she saw at Salamander had supplanted his image in her memory. This, and the previous point, are variations of the ""displacement effect"" discussed by Stephen J in Alexander v The Queen [1981] HCA 17; 145 CLR 395 at 409-410.
	


Conclusion


	
	The combined effect of these difficulties, coupled with the fact that there was nothing else in the entire case that supported the correctness of the identification, led me to the conclusion that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It is for these reasons that I joined in the making of the orders, including the entry of a verdict of acquittal, at the hearing on the appeal on 3 March 2016.

		07 June 2016",2016-06-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769599,AG v R [2016] NSWCCA 102,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicant sought leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence imposed on him by the District Court at Campbelltown (Phegan ADCJ) with respect to one count of indecent assault and three of sexual intercourse involving his young daughter. The details are set out by Davies J. I agree that the applicant should have leave to appeal but that the appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons given by Davies J and for the following further reasons.
	


Circumstance of aggravation


	
	The first charge against the applicant involved an assault involving an act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). For the purposes of that count, the relevant circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was “under the authority of” the applicant at the time of the offence. [1] 
	
	
	The other three charges involved sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act. The various circumstances of aggravation for the purposes of that provision include not only the victim being under the authority of the offender, but the victim being under the age of 16 years. It was the latter (under age) circumstance which was relied upon as the circumstance of aggravation in each charge under that provision.
	
	
	The complaint raised by the applicant was that, in considering the objective gravity of the s 61J(1) offences, the sentencing judge took into account as an aggravating factor, pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Procedure Act”), the fact that the victim was under the authority of the applicant. Such a course, it was submitted, involved sentencing the applicant for an offence with which he had not been charged, in contravention of the principle established in The Queen v De Simoni. [2]  There are three reasons why that proposition cannot be accepted. The first is a matter of authority; the other two explain why the authority is correct.
	
	
	In relation to the question of authority, as pointed out by counsel for the Director, this issue was addressed in Regina v AD [3]  where Howie J stated (with the agreement of Studdert and Latham JJ):
	


“Although the only circumstance of aggravation alleged in the charge was that the complainant was under the age of 15 years, the Judge was entitled, if not required, to take into account any other matter of aggravation present. … There is only one offence provided under s 61J and the Crown has only to allege and prove one circumstance of aggravation in order to make out the offence. There is no infringement of the De Simoni principle in the court taking into account other matters of aggravation because the offender is not being sentenced for a more serious offence than that charged.”


	
	Secondly, the principle in De Simoni is not engaged by the circumstances of this case. De Simoni was charged with robbery; the circumstance of aggravation relied upon by the sentencing judge was the wounding of the victim in the course of the robbery. In accordance with the common law principle, the Criminal Code (WA) required that an offender not be punished for an aggravated offence where the circumstance of aggravation had not been included in the charge. Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Murphy JJ agreed) held that for the sentencing judge to take into account a circumstance of aggravation which had not been charged was to punish the offender “for an offence of which he has not been convicted.” [4]  As the Chief Justice further explained: [5] 
	


“However, where the Crown has charged the offender with, or has accepted a plea of guilty to, an offence less serious than the facts warrant, it cannot rely, or ask the judge to rely, on the facts that would have rendered the offender liable to a more serious penalty.”


	
	That principle is not engaged in the present case because where one circumstance of aggravation has been charged, the fact that others may be taken into account does not result in the offender being sentenced for a more serious offence, nor would the offence be different if a circumstance not included in the charge had been included in the charge. The offending is more serious, but the offence charged is not.
	
	
	The third reason for rejecting the submission is that the sentencing principles to be applied are found in the Sentencing Procedure Act, and, relevantly for present purposes, s 21A(2). The potential aggravating factors identified there which are to be taken into account [6]  include the offence being committed in the home of the victim, [7]  the offence causing “substantial” emotional harm, [8]  and the offender having abused “a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim.” [9]  (It is also a circumstance of aggravation that the victim was vulnerable, because he or she was very young. [10] )
	
	
	Section 21A(2) is subject to a qualification, namely that the court “is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” That language should be understood to refer to the offence charged, not the offence as defined in the legislation.
	
	
	It should also be noted that s 21A does not require the court to have regard to an aggravating factor “if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.” [11]  How that provision would operate in respect of a direct collision between the statute and another statutory provision or general law principle need not be considered in the present case because the only potentially relevant principle (the De Simoni principle) is not engaged.
	
	
	As was noted in the course of argument, the applicant’s submission would entail at least the following proposition, namely that a circumstance of aggravation, which could have been pleaded as an element of the same offence but was not, cannot be taken into account as an additional aggravating factor in sentencing. However, an aggravating factor identified in s 21A(2) which could not have been the subject of a charge, can be taken into account in sentencing. As a matter of statutory construction, that submission should not be accepted. The judge did not err in taking into account the abuse of a position of trust or authority in relation to the charges under s 61J.
	


Adjustment of non-parole period


	
	The applicant’s complaint in relation to the non-parole period was not that the sentencing judge did not adjust it, having made a finding of special circumstances, but that, given the nature of the finding, he did not adjust it sufficiently. Thus, it was submitted, he “reduced” the non-parole period from 75% to 66.7% of the full term of the sentence.
	
	
	Although it is common to treat the statutory ratio as requiring that the non-parole period (being the period of mandatory custody) should be 75% of the sentence, absent a finding of special circumstances, that is not what the statute says. What it requires is that the balance of the term not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, absent a finding of special circumstances. [12]  It is well-established that this provision does not require that the non-parole period be fixed and that the balance of term be adjusted according to whether special circumstances are found or not. It is accepted that sentencing may be undertaken as a one-step process, with the practical consequence that an appropriate sentence is considered and, where special circumstances are found, a non-parole period is imposed which may be less than that which would otherwise have been imposed, with the consequence permitted by s 44(2), namely that the balance of term exceeds one-third of the non-parole period. None of this is in issue, except that the submission that an insufficient reduction had been provided in the non-parole period depended upon a comparison of the proportions which the non-parole period bore to the overall sentence, before and after reduction. Thus, the reduction from 75% to 66.7% was seen to be a reduction of only 8.3%.
	
	
	This reduction was not in practical terms insignificant; it amounted to a non-parole period which was six months shorter than it would otherwise have been. However, the variation is properly assessed by reference to the statutory proportion. Thus, the statutory ratio would have resulted in a balance of term of 18 months, which has been increased by six months or 33.3%. That is not an insignificant increase.
	
	
	There are, as Davies J explains, good reasons why this Court should not intervene in the exercise of the discretionary power to increase the proportion of the sentence available to be served on parole. However, it is misleading to diminish the effect of the variation by adopting a wrong comparison.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	The applicant challenged the use made by the sentencing judge of the victim impact statement prepared by the mother. The gravamen of the challenge was that the sentencing judge preferred the statement of the mother over that of the primary victim, namely her 13-year-old (at the time of sentencing) daughter. As Davies J explains, that complaint should be rejected because there was no inconsistency. The mother explained matters from the perspective of an adult and a parent, in ways which, it may be accepted, fairly identified the impact of the offending on the victim, and in a manner which the daughter would not have been able to identify or express.
	
	
	The availability of a victim impact statement on a sentencing hearing is established by statute. [13]  Nevertheless, the status of such material cannot readily be characterised. It is not in the ordinary sense evidence, not being presented in a formal way on oath or affirmation. In that respect, it bears some comparison with the unsworn statement permitted to an accused person and regularly relied upon in past times. However, the victim impact statement stands on the other side of the proceeding; to the extent that it may form a basis for concluding that the effects on the victim were more serious than might otherwise have been supposed, that would constitute an aggravating factor, which, in the ordinary course, should be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	There was no challenge to the provision of the mother’s statement to the Court. However, there may be some doubt as to who can give a victim impact statement, where the primary victim has survived and is not “incapable of providing information for” such a statement. [14]  There is no provision which expressly requires that the primary victim provide the statement; further, the question of incapacity may be relative, so that it is open, as in this case, for both the primary victim and a person having parental responsibility, to give statements. These issues did not arise in the present case.
	
	
	Both the mother’s statement and the victim’s statement referred to the effect of the offences on the family. In a sense, it may be impossible to impose a strict demarcation between the effect on the victim and the effect on the family, because the latter will undoubtedly have repercussions for the victim. Nevertheless, the statement should be limited to “any personal harm suffered by the victim as a direct result of the offence”. [15]  Wherever possible, that limitation should be respected. Although there is no suggestion that the sentencing judge inappropriately took into account material which should not have been in the statements, there was material in each statement which might have been seen to breach this constraint.
	
	
	McCALLUM J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The applicant pleaded guilty to four offences as follows:
	


Count 1:   Aggravated indecent assault. The maximum penalty is seven years’ imprisonment.

Counts 2-4:   Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The maximum penalty is 20 years’ imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of ten years.


	
	The applicant was sentenced by Acting Judge Phegan in the District Court at Campbelltown on 20 November 2014 to an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of four years commencing 9 February 2014 and expiring 8 February 2018 with an additional term of two years expiring 8 February 2020.
	
	
	The indicative sentences were as follows:
	


Count 1:   A fixed term of 12 months.

Counts 2-4:   In each case a non-parole period of two years with an additional term of one year.


	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


1.   The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

2.   In taking insufficient account of the extent to which the appellants (sic) admissions founded the case against him

3.   As part of ground 2 failed to give sufficient weight to the penitence exhibited in the nature of the confession providing evidence not available to the prosecution, the early plea of guilty before the Magistrate adhered to in the District Court obviating the need for the complainant giving evidence.

4.   In giving too much emphasis to the victim impact statement of MG over the victim impact statement of the main victim AG when there was no evidentiary basis to accept one over the other, both being unsworn and capable of being consistent with each other.

5.   In failing to give a lower non-parole period than four years having found special circumstances, the effective difference of the 2 year additional term being so close to the one third referred to in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act between not exceeding the one third proportion for the additional term, the sentence fails to provide an effective vehicle for rehabilitation.

6.   In finding that it was ""well beyond the lowest end of the scale of objective seriousness"" and ""certainly close to the mid range and that would be the starting point""

The facts of the offending


	
	The victim of the offending was the applicant’s eldest daughter AB who was born on 28 January 2001. At the time of the offending constituted by counts 1 and 2 the victim was aged 11 years. At the time of the offending constituted by count 3 she was aged 11 or 12 years (the date of the offending is uncertain). At the time of the offending constituted by count 4 she was aged 13 years.
	
	
	The first time the applicant touched AB sexually was when she was in Year 5 in 2012 when she was 11 years of age. She was in her bedroom and after she was in bed under the blanket the applicant came into the room. He got into bed with her and touched her using a grabbing action on her vagina on the outside of her clothing. She asked him what he was doing and he said nothing at which point her brother CD walked in. AB told the applicant to do the same thing to CD but he refused and told her to say nothing else about it. This act was Count 1.
	
	
	The applicant admitted to the physical acts described and agreed that the first time anything of a sexual nature occurred between them was in August or September 2012 when he touched AB’s vagina outside her underpants. According to his version of events, however, she had complained of an itchy stomach and asked him to rub it and then moved his hand between her legs. He said that at that point he wanted to get out of the bed and she commented that his heart was beating hard. He said he tried to get away but she kept calling him into the shower and asking him for hugs. He said he told her he could not continue or he would end up in gaol at which, according to his account, AB assured him that she was not going to tell anybody.
	
	
	In the same week as the incident involved in the first count AB was in bed when the applicant came into the room and kissed her goodnight. He reached down and touched her vagina. She asked him what he was doing, he said nothing and left the room. AB did not allege that any penetration occurred and the Crown case on that element of the offence was based wholly on the applicant’s own subsequent admission. This constituted Count 2. The element of aggravation in the offence was the age of AB at the time.
	
	
	It was about this time that AB commenced sexual education at school and because of this she told police she knew what had been occurring was wrong but did not have the courage to report it to anyone. As in the case of the first offence the applicant made admissions to the physical acts. In the applicant’s version of the facts there was a degree of penetration which he described as no more than half a fingernail. According to the applicant AB called him into her bed and told him to rub her under her underpants. He said that it became too much for him, her constant calling him into her bedroom.
	
	
	The third count, the second of the aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, occurred at the beginning of 2013 when AB’s mother FG went into hospital to have a lung removed and the applicant was left in charge of the three children. After he put the boys to bed he asked AB to sleep in his bed and on the Friday night, the first occasion when this occurred, nothing of a sexual nature happened.
	
	
	On the Saturday night AB was again in the applicant’s bed, sleeping on her right side. She woke to feel her pants being pulled down and the applicant licking her vagina. She pulled her pants up and went to her own bedroom. She told police when giving an account of this occasion that she felt really scared, had a shower and put stuffed animals in her bed so it would appear as if she was sleeping in there but she went and actually slept in her brothers' room.
	
	
	Again the applicant made admissions as to the physical acts that occurred but according to him AB climbed into his bed and this made him not feel right because his wife was in hospital. According to his account AB constantly moved closer to him. He admitted rubbing her vagina and she asked him to ""kiss her bottom"". He rolled away and faced the window but a few minutes later she rolled over and pushed his head towards her vagina and asked him to do it again. He admitted pulling her pants down and putting his tongue on her clitoris for ""about a second"".
	
	
	Count 4 occurred in February of 2014 when AB was now 13 years of age. She was sleeping on her left side when the applicant entered the room. She awoke to feel the applicant’s hand inside the underwear which she was wearing at the time and his touching her breasts inside her pyjama top. She felt his body behind her and in bed underneath the covers trying to pull her closer to him. She felt something pushing against her from behind which she believes was the applicant’s ""genitals"". She shouted at him to get out.
	
	
	Again, as in the case of the second count, AB did not make any allegation of penetration and therefore that ingredient of the offence is the result of the applicant’s own independent admission. He admitted to the physical acts including, on his account, digital penetration, again by ""half a fingernail"". He said that AB was in bed with her legs spread under the blanket. He touched her between the legs three or four times, leaving the room on each occasion. He said she was gyrating towards him and he admitted having an erection.
	
	
	During the period of the offending the applicant told AB that he would physically hurt her, indicating the breaking of a neck and a closed fist, if she disclosed what was occurring.
	
	
	AB told police that the above offences were what she could remember specifically but that sexual conduct of different types occurred ""whenever he could"". She said on occasions he grabbed her hands to put it towards his penis but she'd pull her hand back. She never saw or touched his penis. The applicant admitted there had been an occasion when she had put her hand on his groin on the outside of his clothing but then pulled her hand away.
	
	
	When the applicant was asked how often events of a sexual nature occurred he said, ""One or two times a month"" and when he was asked whether it would happen a number of times a week he replied, ""In the beginning, yeah"", but he went on to say that over a period of six or seven months prior to his arrest those incidents had gotten further and further apart to the point where there was sometimes a month or more between events.
	
	
	On 6 February 2014 AB told her mother FG “on nights dad is in my bed, he touched me down there” and pointed to her vagina. She said that it had been happening since the end of year 5. The applicant was confronted and denied it. The following night FG took the children to live with her brother.
	
	
	In a telephone call between the applicant and FG on 8 February, the applicant said, “the perpetrator is the one crying. [AB] gets me to do certain things”. That same day the applicant spoke to FG and her brother. He made admissions as to the offences and said, “you’ve got to understand that I’m not the one to blame here. She is very attention seeking and wants me around all the time.” They told him that he had no alternative than reporting the matter to the police. The following day he went to the police station and told police that he had been sexually abusing his daughter.
	


Subjective factors


	
	At the time of the offending the applicant was 48 to 49 years of age. AB was the eldest of three children from his second marriage. He had a daughter aged 20 years at the time of sentence from his first marriage.
	
	
	The subjective information concerning the applicant came principally from a report from Dr Richard Furst, a forensic psychiatrist. The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. Despite that fact, the sentencing judge said he could largely accept what Dr Furst recorded as the personal history given to him by the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant told Dr Furst that he was subject to childhood sexual abuse when he was ten years of age at the hands of a neighbour, and he had been involved in an incestuous relationship with one of his sisters over a period of six to seven years. In relation to that matter his Honour said that he had reservations about accepting that the applicant was taken advantage of by his sister. In addition, the applicant claimed that his mother had sexually touched him when he was in his twenties.
	
	
	There was also domestic violence and affairs being conducted by each of his parents. His Honour was quite prepared to accept that the applicant grew up in a dysfunctional domestic situation.
	
	
	At a relatively early stage of his adult life he suffered from chronic low mood and low self-esteem. He had been in the hands of various psychiatrists for psychiatric treatment in the 1980s and 1990s. His first marriage was unstable although even at the time of his sentence he maintained a reasonably close relationship with his first wife and their daughter.
	
	
	The applicant described his second wife as a person with explosive anger who he believes used him to come to Australia – she was a Filipino. The applicant said that his second wife was jealous and aggressive and as a consequence of this he stopped loving her years before the offending. His Honour accepted Dr Furst’s analysis of the applicant’s description of his second wife as showing his own narcissism.
	
	
	Although the applicant had worked throughout most of his adult life he had financial difficulties in 2005 and then again after a business arrangement went wrong in 2010.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that Dr Furst referred to the applicant indicating considerable remorse for what he had done, but his Honour did not say whether or not he accepted that remorse in the absence of evidence from the applicant.
	
	
	Dr Furst diagnosed a major depressive disorder and a personality disorder, (narcissistic and borderline traits). He considered that the applicant needed to maintain psychiatric treatment and undertake further intervention with regard to sexual misconduct. Dr Furst thought that he had good prospects of being successfully rehabilitated if he participated in the treatment programs and psychiatric treatment.
	
	
	Dr Furst did not think that the applicant had a paraphilia (disorder deviant sexual arousal/behaviour), with the offences being largely opportunistic, involving his daughter, and having no previous history of sexual offences.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant’s counsel submitted that grounds 2 to 6 were to some extent particulars of Ground 1 although they also needed to be considered as grounds of appeal themselves. Nevertheless, counsel accepted that it would not be sufficient for the appeal to be upheld that the applicant demonstrated error on any particular ground. In that regard, counsel also accepted that for those grounds error of a House v The King type would need to be demonstrated. It is convenient, therefore, to consider grounds 2 to 6 before considering Ground 1.
	


Grounds 2 and 3:   The applicant’s admissions, and evidence not available to the prosecution


	
	These two grounds were dealt with together and might be thought to concern an Ellis discount (R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603) although that was not articulated in the applicant’s submissions.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that because he was given a full 25% reduction for the early plea the starting point was an eight year head sentence with a five year four month non-parole period. The applicant submitted that no reference was made by the sentencing judge to the fact that the applicant’s approach to the case meant not only that the complainant did not have to give evidence but that he was convicted of charges that could not, without his admissions, be proven against him and which were not the subject of complaint.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the terms in which these grounds were pleaded tacitly accept that the sentencing judge took account of the matters referred to. The Crown pointed out that the sentencing judge made specific reference to the voluntary attendance of the applicant at the police station and his admissions. The Crown drew attention to the authorities which say that no separate quantified discount should be given for an Ellis discount. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge noted and commented on the issue of remorse. However, the remorse demonstrated by the admissions was undermined by the applicant’s blaming of the complainant for the offending conduct.
	


Ground 4:   Victim Impact Statement of the victim’s mother


	
	The applicant made reference to the principles in R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 where it was said that the material in an unsworn victim impact statement cannot be given substantial weight. The applicant acknowledged that his counsel at the sentence proceedings did not take objection to the mother’s statement but suggested that that was because his Honour gave no warning that he intended to prefer the mother’s statement over the real victim’s statement. That was a matter of procedural unfairness.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that AB’s statement was insightful and powerful in showing how she felt, and that distinguished it from her mother’s reaction. In that regard the applicant submitted that the matter was compounded by the sentencing judge’s reference to a significant breakdown in the relationship between the applicant and his wife well before the offence and the negative matters referred to in relation to the wife. The applicant submitted that for the sentencing judge to accept the mother’s statement and dismiss AB’s statement and in doing so to find an aggravating factor was appellable error.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel expressly eschewed any submission that less account should have been taken of the mother’s statement because she might be regarded as being hostile towards the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the two victim impact statements were tendered and admitted without objection. No submissions were made that the use of the statements or either of them should be limited or that evidentiary weight given to them should be limited. The Crown submitted that the mother’s victim impact statement gave more sophisticated detail of the impact of the offending on AB but, in any event, it was not inconsistent with AB’s statement. Nevertheless, his Honour declined to find aggravation on the basis of the emotional harm caused.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Slack no longer represents the law in New South Wales, and made reference to what was said in R v Aguirre [2010] NSWCCA 115 at [75].
	


Ground 5:   Non-parole period


	
	The applicant submitted that, notwithstanding his Honour found special circumstances, his Honour hardly varied the statutory ratio by reducing it to 66.7%. The applicant submitted that the non-parole period should have been reduced further so that there was effective addressing of rehabilitation within increased time for supervision in the community – a necessary matter in this type of case.
	
	
	The Crown noted that there had been a variation of the statutory ratio to 66.7% following the sentencing judge’s finding of special circumstances. The Crown submitted that the extent of any adjustment to the statutory requirement is essentially a matter within the sentencing judge’s discretion. The sentencing judge was required to fix a non-parole period to ensure that the time the applicant spent in prison reflected all the circumstances of the offence including its objective seriousness and the need for general deterrence.
	


Ground 6:   Objective seriousness


	
	The applicant submitted that inasmuch as offences under s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (counts 2-4) encompassed a range of unacceptable behaviour such as full penile vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, strenuous physical coercion, the infliction or threat of infliction of actual bodily harm, offending in company or where the victim had a serious physical or intellectual disability, and where it included children much younger than the victim, it was an error to suggest that the offending was in the mid-range. The applicant submitted that the short duration of digital penetration with no complaint subsequently from the victim meant that the objective seriousness could not be close to the mid-range.
	
	
	The Crown made reference to the well-known principle that the assessment of objective seriousness is a discretionary exercise classically within the role of the sentencing judge, and referred in that regard to Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] and [46]. The Crown said that the matters to which the applicant referred as suggesting that the offence was in the lower range of objective seriousness were not the only considerations. A significant factor was the fact that the applicant was the biological father of the victim. Further, coercion need not be physical. In the present case threats against disclosure were made.
	
	
	The applicant initially submitted in relation to this ground that the sentencing judge had contravened the De Simoni principle by regarding as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the victim was under the authority of the applicant when the offence under s 61J was charged with the aggravating circumstances being the victim’s age. When the Crown drew attention to what was said in R v AD [2005] NSWCCA 208 at [22] counsel for the applicant accepted that what was said in AD “removes my analysis altogether”. I understood by that statement that counsel was withdrawing his submission.
	


Ground 1:   Sentence manifestly excessive


	
	The applicant made reference to what was said in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at [25] and then drew attention to the JIRS statistics. The applicant accepted the limitation on the use of statistics. However, he pointed out that in the statistics for consecutive and non-consecutive terms 51% had a sentence of six years or less; for consecutive terms only 34% had terms of six years or less; and for the non-parole period for non-consecutive terms 68% had a parole period of four years or less.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Judicial Commission statistics offered no guidance about aggregate sentences, making reference to Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222 and Tweedie v R [2015] NSWCCA 71. The Crown submitted that the sentences could not be said to be manifestly excessive when regard was had to the maximum penalties for the offences, the standard non-parole period for the offences in counts 2 to 4, the objective seriousness and the lack of any mitigating features. The Crown noted the lack of any complaint about the accumulation of the sentences and submitted that the sentencing judge appropriately applied the principle of totality in circumstances where the offending took place on separate occasions.
	


Consideration

Grounds 2 and 3


	
	His Honour made two specific references to the admissions by the applicant. He said (ROS 2):
	


On that same day the offender spoke with [his wife’s] brother and his wife and made admissions to the offences but said, ""You've got to understand that I'm not the one to blame here, she is very attention seeking and wants me around all the time"". They told him that he had no alternative other than reporting the matter to the police. This, in fact, he did on the following evening at about 5.30pm when he attended Narellan Police Station and told the police that he had been sexually abusing his daughter. He was arrested and in an interview with police on 10 February made certain admissions which are included in the summary of the facts contained with regard to each count.


	
	A little later his Honour said this (ROS 8):
	


There was also the element of self-reporting, that is, that it was the offender and not the victim who first went to the police although it was the Crown submission that this was only because it was in recognition of the inevitable, that is, that there had already been an indication that the matter would be taken to the police by the offender's brother-in-law, if nobody else. However, I accept what Mr Townsend had to say about that and that is there is no evidence sufficient to support the view that the only reason for self-reporting was the fear that it was going to be reported to the police anyway and therefore there is some measure of mitigation in the sense that it does reflect positively on the offender that he chose to take the matter to the police himself. And mostly importantly in that context, as I noted earlier, in his version of events it was he who revealed the element of digital penetration, for example, which had not been mentioned in the report given to the police by the victim.


	
	Finally, his Honour said (ROS 16):
	


Finally, the plea of guilty. There is certainly no question that the plea was at the earliest stage and indeed was a consequence of what I have already noted was the offender's own initiative in going to the police and reporting these offences in the first instance. He is therefore entitled to the maximum reduction, and there was no opposition to this from the Crown, of 25%.


	
	In Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 McHugh J said at [15]:
	


The statement in Ellis that ""the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency"" is a statement of a general principle or perhaps more accurately of a factor to be taken into account. It is not the statement of a rule to be quantitatively, rigidly or mechanically applied. It is an indication that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the disclosure of what was an unknown offence is a significant and not an insubstantial matter to be considered on the credit side of the sentencing process. How significant depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.


	
	Other authorities have said that there should not be a separate quantified discount in relation to such disclosure: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189 at [17] and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32].
	
	
	In my opinion, the passages in the Remarks to which I have referred show that the sentencing judge took into account the self-reporting and the admissions made by the applicant. The difficulty in the applicant’s submission is that a ground that alleges insufficient weight being given to a matter impliedly accepts that some weight was given to the matter. The extent of weight to be given to matters is a matter for the sentencing judge. It would be necessary to show error of the House v The King type. No such error was demonstrated nor was any sought to be demonstrated.
	
	
	In circumstances where the sentencing judge made reference to the self-reporting, where a quantified discount is not to be given for an Ellis discount, and where there is nothing about the sentence which suggests no leniency was extended, ground 2 must fail.
	
	
	In relation to remorse his Honour said (ROS 16):
	


That is more difficult to assess. It is more specific than the general prospect of rehabilitation and lack of offending and in this case I have to place on record the fact that the offender chose not to give evidence and therefore subject his remorse to any cross-examination. All I have in that regard therefore is what is the second-hand report of statements which he made to Dr Furst.


	
	When his Honour pointed out at the sentencing hearing that the applicant had not given evidence, the applicant’s counsel said:
	


That is true. There is some authority for that proposition that your Honour is not required to give – is required to give what weight your Honour thinks is necessary or is appropriate to what I term, self-serving statements in expert reports made by offenders, but your Honour has to assess that in terms of what the evidence is, and how it is presented, and in what form it comes to your Honour. This is a direct transcript by a psychiatrist of what his (sic) man said to him and in that sense, I would invite your Honour to give it some weight indeed as an expression of remorse.


	
	Where, as here, an offender chooses not to give evidence at the sentence proceedings, statements made to medical professionals must be given limited weight: R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425 at [4]; R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353 at [58]-[59]. All that the sentencing judge had in relation to remorse were untested statements in Dr Furst’s report and the fact that the applicant self-reported. An assessment of the applicant’s remorse had to be informed, on the other hand, by what was contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts where the applicant tended to place some responsibility on AB for what had happened.
	
	
	I would reject ground 3.
	


Ground 4


	
	This ground claims that the sentencing judge gave “too much emphasis” to the mother’s Victim Impact Statement. As with grounds 2 and 3, such a ground implicitly accepts that the sentencing judge had regard to the relevant evidence.
	
	
	The Victim Impact Statement provided by the child was, as the sentencing judge noted, in the form of a number of short statements illustrated in each case by drawings done by the victim. His Honour went on to say:
	


Understandably that victim impact statement is not an articulate description of the impact of these offences on the victim and in that regard I rely much more on the statement of the mother [FG] …


	
	Nothing was said by counsel for the applicant at the sentence hearing to suggest that his Honour should not give any weight or significant weight to the victim impact statement from FG. When no objection was taken to it there was no basis for his Honour not to give it appropriate emphasis. Self-evidently, it dealt more adequately and articulately with what AB was suffering and demonstrating in her behaviour. More significantly, it was not in any way inconsistent with AB’s statement.
	
	
	His Honour did not regard the emotional harm suffered by AB as an aggravating factor. His Honour said (ROS 14):
	


I do not propose to add to what I have said about that already, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that that applies [s 21A(2)(g)] but it is very much a consequence which is assumed as part of the offence itself and therefore while extremely serious, and in this particular case very substantial, it is not a matter which per se increases the sentence by way of aggravation over and above that which is in any case appropriate.


	
	It is necessary for the applicant to show an error of the House v The King type. Such an error is not demonstrated by assertions of undue weight being given to some piece of evidence when there is evidence capable of supporting the Judge’s conclusion.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 5


	
	His Honour found special circumstances. He said that it was the applicant’s first time in custody and he noted that experiences in custody of a sexual offender of this kind were likely to be harsher than they are for other offenders. Secondly, his Honour accepted what he described as a commitment from Dr Furst, that the applicant was committed to undertaking whatever treatment was available to him in order to assist with his psychiatric problems and also any form of counselling or other treatment with regard to sexual offending. Having done so, his Honour reduced the ratio to 66.6%.
	
	
	In Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom James and Adams JJ agreed) said:
	


… This Court has explained on many occasions that the extent of any adjustment to the statutory requirement is essentially a matter within the sentencing judge’s discretion. In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] Spigelman CJ said that an adjustment for special circumstances “raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene.” Only if the non-parole period provided is manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive should this Court intervene: Cramp at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [19].


	
	In Mitreski v R [2015] NSWCCA 137 the Court said:
	


[52]   It cannot be doubted that a determination by a sentencing Judge to adjust the ratio of the non-parole period to the overall sentence from that prescribed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act involves the exercise of making findings of fact, accompanied by an evaluative judgment to determine whether the factual circumstances found justify the lowering of the non-parole period below the statutory ratio: see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [73]; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 at [40]; Allen v R [2015] NSWCCA 113 at [33].

[53]   Section 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act records that the non-parole period for the sentence is “… the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence”. Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson at [56] noted that this express provision reinforced what the High Court of Australia had said in Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623, where, in the joint judgment, at 628 and 629, the Court said:

“… In a true sense the non-parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing Judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention.”

[54]   And, further, at 629:

“… The legislative intention … [is] to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate, once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve, having regard to all of the circumstances of his offence.”

[55]   As Spigelman CJ went on to say, at [57] in Simpson:

“The reasoning in Power indicates that it is not appropriate to determine the non-parole period primarily from the perspective of the length of the period of supervision on parole. Indeed, the primary perspective should be the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration. By enacting a provision that only works one way – requiring specific justification for a lower proportion but not for a higher proportion – Parliament has, in my opinion, reinforced this as the primary perspective. This has the effect that the scope of the considerations relevant to the determination of ‘special circumstances’, must encompass the full range of issues which are relevant to the determination of the minimum period of actual incarceration without hope of release on parole.”

[56]   The nature of the findings underpinning a finding, or rejection of a finding, of special circumstances are such that this Court is slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [27]; Piscitelli v R [2013] NSWCCA 8 at [54].

[57]   As submitted by the Crown, the mere presence of circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances is not sufficient to compel the Court to make such a finding, thereby reducing the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the whole sentence: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22].

[58]   It is also appropriate to note that at [59] in Simpson, Spigelman CJ rejected the proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely or primarily by reason of considerations of rehabilitation.


	
	The sentencing judge was required to fix a non-parole period to ensure the time the applicant spent in prison reflected all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender including the objective seriousness and the need for general deterrence. His Honour adjusted the non-parole period to take account of the special circumstances. Unless the applicant can establish that the non-parole period was manifestly excessive this ground must fail.
	


Ground 6:   Objective seriousness


	
	The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is a discretionary exercise which is classically within the role of the sentencing judge and which this Court would be slow to set aside: Mulato at [37] and [46]. It is necessary to show an error of the House v The King type.
	
	
	The sentencing judge considered submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the offences fell towards the bottom end of the scale because of the small extent of physical interference, the absence of any physical threat and the element of self-reporting. His Honour then went on to say (ROS 9):
	


However, it is important to acknowledge that in an offence of this kind the physical aspect of the offence is only one part and in some respects, and I would suggest in this particular case, a minor part of the overall element of objective seriousness. Far more significant in this case is the psychological impact on the victim which was graphically described in the letter which was written and read out to the Court by her mother.

There is in that context not only the lasting impact of the offence of a profound psychological kind on the victim but also in the act itself a gross breach of trust on the part of the very person whom the victim could reasonably have expected to protect her against this kind of conduct rather than be the perpetrator of it. When one looks at those aspects of the offence it does elevate it to something well beyond the lowest end of the scale of objective seriousness and does take it, and I accept what the Crown submitted in this respect, certainly close to the mid-range and that would be the starting point from the point of view of determining the appropriate sentence that I would adopt.


	
	Nothing is put to suggest any error of the House v The King type with regard to that assessment. The significance of the fact that the applicant was the victim’s biological father cannot be overstated. Elsewhere in his Remarks his Honour said (ROS 7):
	


He bore the overriding responsibility as an adult and a person in a position of ultimate trust with regard to his own daughter. Irrespective of her behaviour, his acts to which he himself has admitted were entirely indefensible.


	
	The position was made worse by the fact that the applicant might first have been thought to have morally blackmailed the victim by telling her that she could not tell anybody because he would end up in gaol. Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, the applicant told the victim that if she disclosed what was occurring he would physically hurt her, indicating the breaking of a neck and a closed fist.
	
	
	The finding as to objective seriousness was open to the sentencing judge. No error is disclosed. I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 1:   Sentence manifestly excessive


	
	It is necessary for the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence was unreasonably or plainly unjust. The statistics relied upon by the applicant are a blunt tool. In any event, they offer no guidance about the propriety of an aggregate sentence: Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222 at 88; Tweedie v R [2015] NSWCCA 71 at [47].
	
	
	Three of the counts to which the applicant pleaded guilty carried a 20 year maximum sentence and a standard non-parole period of ten years. It could not possibly be said that an aggregate sentence of a non-parole period of four years with an additional term of two years was unreasonable or plainly unjust for three such offences that occurred at different times in addition to an offence of aggravated indecent assault. Nor do the indicative sentences of a non-parole period of two years with an additional term of one year provide any basis for suggesting manifest excess in the overall sentence. I would reject this ground of appeal.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.

2769601,Martin v R [2016] NSWCCA 104,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hall J in this matter. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes and with his reasons.
	
	
	So far as the additional remarks of R A Hulme J are concerned, I would prefer not to express any concluded view on the matters raised by his Honour, particularly in circumstances where they were not the subject of argument, nor necessary for the disposition of the appeal. However, in considering the issue there are two matters which, in my view, tend to lead to a contrary conclusion to that suggested by his Honour.
	
	
	The first matter is that the plurality in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 (Kentwell) expressly accepted the statement by Spigelman CJ in Baxter v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at [19] as to the function of the Court of Criminal Appeal in resentencing for the purpose of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW): Kentwell at [42]. In doing so they appear to have rejected the approach of Latham J in that case to the effect that error requiring the re-exercising of the sentencing discretion was confined to those errors which are material in the sense they had the capacity to infect the exercise of the discretion regardless of whether it could be demonstrated that the error has in fact influenced the outcome: Kentwell at [40]-[42]. By contrast Gageler J expressly reserved consideration of the circumstances in which an identified error of law will be sufficient to require re-exercising of the sentencing discretion: Kentwell at [48].
	
	
	Second, the example given by the plurality of circumstances where a re‑exercise of the discretion would not be required was confined to error which had no effect on the sentence imposed and was irrelevant to the exercise of the discretion. It does not seem to me that this approach can necessarily be extended to enable adjustment to be made to only that part of the sentence which was infected by an error of discretion in circumstances such as the present case where the judge erred in failing to give effect to his finding of special circumstances by appropriately adjusting the non-parole period. The position may be different if what occurred was self-evidently a mathematical error where it could be shown there was no error in the exercise of discretion but simply a miscalculation in reaching the end result.
	
	
	However, it is not necessary to explore the matter any further in the present case.
	
	
	HALL J: The applicant, James Thomas Martin, seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by the District Court, his Honour Acting Judge Garling on 23 March 2015.
	
	
	He was charged with two offences as follows:
	



	
	Count 1: One count of aggravated break, enter and commit larceny in contravention of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. An offence under the provisions of that section carries a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and has a prescribed standard non-parole period of 5 years.
	


Count 2: An offence of assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon in contravention of s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. An offence under the provisions of that section carries a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for such an offence.


	
	On 21 August 2014, the applicant pleaded guilty to the two offences (both of which occurred on 4 February 2014), with an additional charge of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty pursuant to s 58 of the Crimes Act 1900 to be taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to Count 1.
	
	
	The circumstance of aggravation in respect of Count 1 was the fact that two people were present, although both asleep and unaware of the applicant’s presence in their home.
	
	
	In respect of Count 2, the offensive weapon was a syringe that was pointed close to the victim’s neck.
	


Sentences


	
	The sentencing hearing was originally listed for hearing on 7 November 2014. The matter was not reached and was heard by Garling A‑DCJ on 26 February 2015.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on 23 March 2015 as follows:
	


Count 1 – In respect of the aggravated break, enter and commit larceny and taking into account the Form 1: 3 years imprisonment to commence on 30 December 2014 and expire on 29 December 2017 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months to expire on 29 October 2016.

Count 2 – In respect of the assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon (syringe): 4 years and 6 months imprisonment to commence on 30 June 2015 and to expire on 29 December 2019 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months to expire on 29 March 2018.


	
	The sentencing judge backdated the sentence on Count 1 by 58 days from 26 February 2015 being the date the applicant first came before the District Court for sentencing, in order to take into account the period in custody bail refused on the subject offences from the date of arrest on 4 February 2014 until 1 April 2014 on which latter date he commenced serving a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months for an offence of assault.
	
	
	Accordingly, under the sentences imposed on 23 March 2015 the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 29 March 2018.
	
	
	The total effective sentence in respect of Counts 1 and 2, commencing 30 December 2014 and expiring on 29 December 2019, was 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months.
	


The Custodial Period in Respect of the Previous Assault Offences


	
	The applicant was taken into custody on being charged with Counts 1 and 2 on 4 February 2014 and served a custodial sentence between 1 April 2014 and 24 February 2015, imposed in respect of offences of assault committed on 17 July 2009, 19 September 2012 and 22 September 2013. The applicant being on bail at the time of the subject offences committed on 4 February 2014.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	In his Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal dated 8 October 2015, the applicant gave notice that he intended to rely upon three Grounds of Appeal, namely:
	


Ground 1: The learned judge erred in failing to correctly apply the guideline judgment on armed robbery

Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to correctly apply the totality principle and failing to give full effect to a finding of special circumstances.

Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Factual Matters Concerning the Offending


	
	Prior to the commission of the offences the subject of Counts 1 and 2 for which the applicant was sentenced, he had not served a custodial sentence.
	
	
	The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had entered early guilty pleas to Counts 1 and 2 and showed remorse in a letter tendered to the court.
	
	
	In his Remarks on Sentence the sentencing judge set out the facts in relation to each offence. These were based upon an Agreed Statement of Facts dated 26 February 2015.
	
	
	It is not necessary to set out all of the full facts contained in paragraphs 1 to 13 of the Agreed Statement of Facts. A summary of the material facts is as follows:
	


“On 4 February 2014 at approximately 10:30 pm, whilst on bail, the applicant entered a service station at Carlton, New South Wales. The only person inside the service station was the console operator, who was alerted to the applicant’s presence by the door entry buzzer. The console operator looked towards the door and saw the applicant carrying a plastic bag in his left hand and a syringe in his right hand.

The applicant approached the console operator and grabbed the sleeve of the console operator’s shirt with his left hand and pointed the syringe at a distance of approximately 20 cm from the neck of the console operator. The applicant instructed the console operator to “open the till”. The console operator backed away and then ran out the front door of the service station and activated the duress alarm. The Applicant ran out of and away from the service station store.

Between 11:00 pm and midnight on the same night (4 February 2014), the Applicant entered a house in Blakehurst by opening a garage roller door and opening an unlocked internal door. Two people were asleep in the house. The Applicant took several items including an iPad. Police, who were patrolling the area following the earlier attempted robbery at the service station at Carton, arrested the Applicant nearby. The arrest of the Applicant gave rise to an additional charge of resisting an officer in the execution of duty, charge which was taken into account on a Form 1.” (Applicant’s Written Submissions at [9]-[11])

Applicant’s Subjective Factors


	
	At the time of sentence the applicant was 33 years of age. He had a criminal record commencing in 1997, including convictions for assault and drug offences.
	
	
	As indicated above, at the time of the subject offences he was on conditional liberty (bail) in respect of the earlier assaults to which reference has been made above.
	
	
	The applicant has had a lengthy history of substance abuse, dating back to his early teens. A report from Dr Richard Furst, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist dated 31 October 2014 was tendered on his behalf at the sentencing hearing. The report contains a detailed analysis of his background and identifies the particular sources of information utilised by Dr Furst. These included medical records from St George Hospital and from Sutherland Hospital. I will refer to the applicant’s attendance at Sutherland Hospital (approximately three weeks before the subject offences were committed) below.
	
	
	Dr Furst observed that the applicant had a history of apparent learning difficulties being below average in public school and that he had behavioural issues. He was diagnosed as suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) when he was 13 years of age.
	
	
	On the history obtained the applicant was exposed to domestic violence and physical abuse in his childhood at the hands of his biological father.
	
	
	He worked in various jobs after leaving school. These included labouring work and driving trucks.
	
	
	He has a history of mood instability, taking an overdose of medication in 2007 and of suffering from chronic low mood.
	
	
	There was also a history of apparent psychosis including an episode when he was 19 years of age requiring admission to Sutherland Hospital.
	
	
	He had a further admission to that hospital at the age of 22 years when it is said he was thought to be suffering from schizophrenia.
	
	
	The applicant has been in receipt of a disability support pension since 2009.
	
	
	Dr Furst’s report includes a history of the applicant using cannabis from the age of 13 years. He used ‘ice’ (methylamphetamine) from the age of 16 years.
	
	
	From the age of 29 years he used heroin and was treated on the Opioid Substitution Program over a period of some 3 months in 2013. His prescribing doctor was an addiction medicine specialist in Campbelltown.
	
	
	Dr Furst observed that he has been admitted to drug and alcohol rehabilitation centres on five occasions including the William Booth Program in the years 2001 and 2003, and to Odyssey House in 2007 and 2011. According to the history given to Dr Furst, the applicant apparently managed to stay abstinent from drugs between 2011 and 2013.
	
	
	The applicant discontinued taking prescribed medication in relation to the lastmentioned program on 13 January 2014. According to the history given to Dr Furst he subsequently relapsed into drug use in the form of the prescription drug Tramadol (which has opiate-like properties), heroin and ‘ice’. He was reported to have continued using those drugs up to and including the time of the subject offences.
	
	
	Dr Furst recorded the applicant’s desire to return to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility.
	
	
	Dr Furst’s report set out his review of relevant documents. These included, importantly, a summary of the entries in the records of Sutherland Hospital concerning the applicant’s attendance approximately three weeks prior to the subject offences. In that respect the history recorded by Dr Furst (p 6) is as follows:
	


“16/01/14: A presentation to Sutherland Hospital was noted on 16/01/14, less than three weeks prior to the offences in question before the Court. Mr Martin described ‘panic attacks’ and felt suicidal and had ‘nothing to live for’ requesting to go to a rehabilitation facility. Problems were noted in his relationship with Kelly and involvement of child protection services. He reported feeling stressed and sleeping poorly. Mr Martin was also noted to be agitated and low in mood. He said that he heard the voices of his ex-partner telling him to ‘end it’ and that ‘the police are after him.’ However, he was not thought to be suffering from a major mental illness.” (AB at 59)


	
	The sentencing judge noted in his Remarks on Sentence (p 3) that Dr Furst had diagnosed the applicant as having a substance use disorder, recurrent episodes of drug induced psychosis and personality disorder. His Honour also noted that Dr Furst stated that the applicant would benefit from drug and alcohol rehabilitation in an appropriate centre. He noted, according to the applicant’s letter to the court, that he wanted to overcome his drug addiction and return to work and that in this regard he needed support and treatment. The sentencing judge further observed:
	


“… He has previously successfully undergone some rehabilitation treatment and wishes to further rehabilitate himself. He has expressed remorse for the offences and said he was drug affected at the time.” (ROS at p 3)


	
	Garling A-DCJ also stated:
	


“I am satisfied that there are special circumstances, in particular his need for drug rehabilitation, he has made attempts to rehabilitate himself and he really needs to be rehabilitated.” (ROS at p 4)

Grounds of Appeal

Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to correctly apply the guideline judgment on armed robbery


	
	The sentencing judge observed that in sentencing for an offence under s 97(1) (armed robbery) he was to take into account the matters set out in the Henry guideline: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.
	
	
	The guideline judgment in Henry confirmed that in cases of armed robbery, a full-time custodial sentence is to be imposed unless there are exceptional circumstances. The guideline case further established that a sentence of between 4 and 5 years for the full term of a single offence carried out by a young offender with limited criminal history was indicated.
	
	
	I note that the particular characteristics in that category of case were set out by Spigelman CJ at [162] as follows:
	


(i)   young offender with no or little criminal history;

(ii)   weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;

(iii)   limited degree of planning;

(iv)   limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;

(v)   victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;

(vi)   small amount taken;

(vii)   plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.


	
	Spigelman CJ noted in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 that the Henry guideline “should be understood to involve a late plea of guilty, for the purposes of the application of the guideline promulgated in these reasons”. That is, where there is an early plea of guilty, the Thomson & Houlton guideline effectively reduced the four to five year starting range for Henry cases by 15%, to account for Henry involving a late plea equivalent to 10%.
	
	
	Subsequent cases have clarified that a guilty plea entered late generally allows for a discount of 10% of the sentence: Speer v Regina [2004] NSWCCA 118 at [29] and R v Boney [2008] NSWCCA 313 at [25]-[28].
	
	
	Having considered the matters set out in the Henry guideline, Garling A-DCJ considered that the applicant:
	


“… is not quite young but he does not have a large criminal history, a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. There appears to be a limited degree of planning, limited if any actual violence, a vulnerable victim, a small amount, that is nothing taken and a plea of guilty. Henry provides for a head sentence between four and five years where that occurs. On his behalf it is submitted that it is low to mid-range, above low but below mid as the victim was unaware of his entry and there was no damage.” (ROS at p 4)


	
	His Honour proceeded upon the basis that the two offences, whilst occurring on the same day, were quite separate offences and that it was necessary that the sentences to be imposed should be partially accumulated. It was clear that his Honour intended to provide the applicant with a discount of 25% on the sentence otherwise to be imposed (ROS at p 5), but erroneously stated that the guideline judgment in Henry proceeded on the basis of a discount of 15%, not 10%.
	
	
	In the submissions for the applicant it was stated that the sentencing judge provided no indication that he intended to depart from the guideline. The reference to 15% discount in the Henry guideline was wrong, it being noted that in Henry the discount of 10% was stated as relating to a late plea.
	
	
	In support of Ground 1, it was submitted that had his Honour applied a discount of 15% in addition to the discount of 10% already incorporated into the Henry guideline, then the resultant head sentence would have been 4 years and 3 months. Such a term of imprisonment, it was stated, would have given effect to his Honour’s stated intention of applying a 25% discount in respect of the second count.
	
	
	Accordingly, it was contended that the head sentence of 4 years and 6 months should have been 4 years and 3 months, as 4 years and 6 months was a sentence longer than was warranted in all the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	The Crown in its Written Submissions observed that his Honour appeared to have taken the view that, notwithstanding the applicant’s age, he fell within the parameters set out in Henry. However, given his age as at the date of the offence (33 years) as well as his criminal antecedents the Crown observed that it was questionable that the applicant, strictly speaking, fitted the Henry criteria. Accordingly, the approach of applying the Henry guideline at all was said to have been one that unduly favoured the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that his Honour misstated the discount on the basis of a late plea incorporated in the Henry criteria. However, it submitted that this did not add any weight to the submission for the applicant that his Honour should have applied an additional 15% to the 10% Henry discount. To do so, it was contended, would reduce the sentencing exercise to a mere mathematical exercise which is contrary to principle: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.
	
	
	The Crown also noted the applicant’s concession that the guideline judgments are not to be rigidly applied. It submitted that the issue of calculation to which the applicant’s submissions refer, would only carry weight if the guideline was one that required rigid application.
	


Decision: Ground 1


	
	Apart from the age of the applicant, the sentencing judge was required to consider and give appropriate weight to countervailing matters set out in Henry in determining the sentence to be imposed. The countervailing factors in this case included, importantly, the matter on the Form 1 in respect of Count 1 as well as the fact that at the time the offences were committed on 4 February 2014, the applicant was on conditional liberty.
	
	
	Those matters, the Crown submitted, further distinguished the applicant’s case from the typical case to which the Henry guideline relates.
	
	
	When all matters relevant to determining the sentence are taken into account, I consider that the head sentence imposed was a sentence that appropriately reflected the criminality of the offences after allowing for the relevant factors discussed above. I do not consider that the erroneous reference to the discount implicit in Henry could be said to have had a level of significance as to have negated the sentencing judge’s overall assessment relevant to the sentencing exercise undertaken. I accept the Crown submission that the point raised by Ground 1 has not been shown to have impacted upon the instinctive synthesis undertaken by the sentencing judge: Markarian v R, supra, at 374, 379.
	
	
	Accordingly, I do not consider that Ground 1 has merit, and should be dismissed.
	


Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to correctly apply the totality principle and failing to give full effect to a finding of special circumstances


	
	The sentencing judge made a finding of special circumstances. As I have earlier observed, his Honour stated:
	


“I am satisfied that there are special circumstances, in particular his need for drug rehabilitation, he has made attempts to rehabilitate himself and he really needs to be rehabilitated.” (ROS at p 4)


	
	As noted above:
	



	
	In respect of Count 1, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months. The ratio of the non-parole and the parole period to that sentence was accordingly 61.1% of the head sentence.
	
	
	In relation to Count 2, the ratio of the non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months to the total term of the sentence of 4 years, 6 months, was also 61.1% of the head sentence.
	



	
	The effective overall head sentence was a period of imprisonment of 5 years commencing 30 December 2014 and expiring 29 December 2019 with an effective overall non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months expiring on 29 March 2018, with a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months. In percentage terms, the overall non-parole period is 65% of the head sentence and the balance of the term is 35% of the head sentence.
	
	
	Accumulated onto the custodial sentence imposed in relation to the assaults committed in 2009, 2012 and 2013, the total overall sentence is almost 5 years 11 months (or more precisely, 5 years 10 months 26 days). The total non-parole period of that effective overall sentence (including the period served in respect of the existing sentences) is 70.3% and the balance of term is 29.7%.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that although the sentencing judge did not refer to the totality principle in his sentencing remarks, his Honour must have had regard to it in fixing the commencement date for the sentences on each offence as that was the only basis upon which he could have made the sentence for the s 97(1) offence partially concurrent with the s 112(2) offence: Crown Written Submissions at [22].
	
	
	Accordingly, the Crown contended that there was no substance to the argument that his Honour did not have regard to the principle of totality.
	
	
	As to the degree or extent of any adjustment of the statutory ratio, this, the Crown argued, was a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. The Crown observed that “[c]learly the 70% overall non-parole period has come about as a result of partial accumulation of the two offences for which he was being sentenced”.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that it is not clear whether his Honour intended that the end result would be only a 5% variation in the statutory ratio. The Crown further acknowledged that his Honour did appear to give significant emphasis to the applicant’s need for rehabilitation “… but unfortunately did not specify how that rehabilitation could be better facilitated by a longer period of supervision on parole”: Crown Written Submissions at [27].
	


Decision: Ground 2


	
	The evidence before the sentencing judge established, firstly, that apart from other medical conditions, the applicant had a significant substance use disorder, that he had in the past sought and obtained rehabilitative treatment for that disorder, and that that had, at least for a period of time, resulted in improvement in his condition. Dr Furst’s report also confirms that on 16 January 2014, approximately three weeks before the subject offences, the applicant attended Sutherland Hospital specifically seeking admission to a rehabilitation facility by reason of the severe problems reported and recorded in the records of Sutherland Hospital, but that unfortunately no known treatment appears to have been given to him and no referral made for him to be assessed and/or treated elsewhere. He accordingly was not admitted to a rehabilitation facility at that time, notwithstanding his need for treatment and his attempt to receive treatment.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the sentencing judge’s assessment and findings that the applicant had a need for drug rehabilitation, that he had made attempts to rehabilitate himself in the past, and that at the time of sentencing he needed to be rehabilitated, were well supported by the evidence having regard to the material and opinions referred to and expressed by Dr Furst in his report.
	
	
	In these circumstances, although it may be accepted that the sentencing judge was mindful of the need to take into account the sentence imposed on the applicant by reason of his breach of the bonds in respect of the earlier assaults and made some allowance in terms of accumulation and concurrency in that respect, the overall or total sentence imposed did not give effect to his Honour’s conclusion and findings concerning the applicant’s need for rehabilitation and to then structure the sentences so as to allow for an appropriate parole period during which the applicant can be treated for his long‑standing substance use disorder. It is to be observed that no other circumstance was identified by the sentencing judge as a basis for the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	In summary, the essential complaint under Ground 2 is that, in spite of the finding of special circumstances, the total effective sentence, in particular, the effective non-parole period of approximately 70% did not give effect to the sentencing judge’s intention to adjust the statutory ratio.
	
	
	As stated in para [59] above, the overall sentences imposed for Counts 1 and 2 was a total of 5 years and a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months. Had no such finding been made, a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months would have been imposed. Accordingly, the sentences imposed allowed for an additional 6 months parole period and a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period.
	
	
	The combined effect of the sentences for Counts 1 and 2 together with the existing sentences and the period when the applicant was bail refused (1 month 28 days) produces a combined overall sentence of approximately 5 years 11 months. On that basis, the reduction in the effective non-parole component (together with the pre-sentence custody) was only 3 months. When so analysed, although his Honour’s sentencing for Counts 1 and 2 were intended to effect a reduction in the non-parole period of 6 months, the effect of the overall sentences and pre-sentence custody was to allow only for an additional period of 3 months.
	
	
	In CM v R [2013] NSWCCA 341, R A Hulme J observed at [40]:
	


“Where there is no adjustment of the 3:1 ratio of non-parole period to parole period reflected in the overall term, it may either reflect what the sentencing Judge specifically intended, or it may be the result of inadvertence or miscalculation.”


	
	The principles and approach to be taken where it is said that a sentencing judge did not make an adjustment to the statutory ratio he or she intended were recently reviewed in Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 25 per Hamill J with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreed. In that case, his Honour observed that where a sentencing judge makes clear that he or she is aware that the total sentence is in accordance with the statutory ratio it would be rare for this Court to intervene. However, his Honour also stated at [84]:
	


“Conversely, in cases where the finding of special circumstances was more broadly based than the accumulation itself and where the sentencing judge has not clearly indicated their awareness of the fact that the total effective sentence will remain in accordance with (or close to) the “statutory norm” the court has intervened: see R v LWP; R v Thornberry; R v Keen; R v Street; R v Heron; M v R.”


	
	In the present case the sentencing judge did not state that he intended that the effective or total non-parole period was to be 70%. This is not a case in which his Honour in making a finding of special circumstances on the basis of the medical history of the applicant and the opinions expressed by Dr Furst intended merely to adjust the statutory proportion by the small margin of 5% between the statutory ratio of 75% and that produced by the overall sentence (70%). The medical evidence strongly indicated that the applicant, who is still a comparatively young man, has a real and pressing need for rehabilitation treatment. Dr Furst expressed the opinion that:
	


“Mr Martin would probably benefit from a structured drug and alcohol treatment program, such as the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program (IDATP) at the John Morony Correctional Centre (OMMPCC). ‘Getting SMART’, ‘Getting SMART Recovery’, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) programs may also be indicated.” (p 8)


	
	I have concluded that Ground 2 has been made out and that this Court should intervene. The extent of the Court’s intervention, subject to resolution of Ground 3, is addressed below.
	


Ground 3: The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive


	
	The offence constituting Counts 1 and 2 were objectively serious offences, as indeed was acknowledged in the written submissions for the applicant. Drug addiction is not of itself a mitigating factor and, as a matter of general principle, does not automatically lead to a lesser sentence.
	
	
	The sentencing judge made findings as to the seriousness of the offences, the necessity for personal and general deterrence, and the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. No error has been established in respect of such findings. His Honour stated:
	


‘’The offences are very serious. One of the offences involves a serious break and enter where the occupants had gone to bed but were present in the house and whilst they did not see the offender he stole their property.

The other charge of armed robbery with a syringe would have been terrifying for the victim and the offender must be punished in such a way that he knows that he cannot offend in this way and if he does he will be sentenced to terms of imprisonment. But more importantly that others in the community know that if they offend in this way they will be sentenced to terms of imprisonment. There is no doubt he must be sentenced to two terms of imprisonment.

I am satisfied that there are special circumstances, in particular his need for drug rehabilitation, he has made attempts to rehabilitate himself and he really needs to be rehabilitated.” (p 4)


	
	The issue of drug addiction in sentencing has been a much‑discussed subject in many decisions of this Court: R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 (as to the relevance of an offender’s drug addiction in assessing the objective criminality of an offence and as being a relevant subjective circumstance, see in particular Wood CJ at CL at [270], [274] and [276]); Toole v R [2014] NSWCCA 318 at [4]; R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291 at [61] per Whealy J (with whom Ipp JA and Howie J agreed); Jodeh v R [2011] NSWCCA 194.
	
	
	It is accepted that the origin or extent of a drug addiction (or any attempts to overcome it) may be relevant subjective considerations where the addiction might impact upon the prospects of recidivism or impact upon the prospects of rehabilitation. The age at which an offender became addicted may be a relevant factor to be taken into account in mitigation at sentence: R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [58]; SS v R [2009] NSWCCA 114; Henry, supra, at [273].
	
	
	In the present case, as earlier noted, the applicant has a lengthy history of substance abuse dating back to his early teens, details of which were discussed by Dr Furst in his Report at pp 3-4. As there noted, the applicant discontinued his medication (Suboxone) on 13 January 2014, relapsing into drug use in the form of the prescription drug Tramadol, heroin and ‘ice’: Report at p 4.
	
	
	There is no evidence as to why the applicant discontinued his medication on 13 January 2014. Although in the particular circumstances of this case the applicant’s addiction since his early teenage years and his attempts at rehabilitation are matters to be taken into account as subjective mitigating factors, they are to be taken into account along with the objectives of retribution and deterrence: Henry, supra, per Wood CJ at CL at [269]. That said, given the nature and seriousness of the applicant’s offences there was a need to ensure that the sentences imposed gave effect to the principle of general deterrence.
	
	
	It is, of course, to be borne in mind that the maximum sentence for the offence of assault with intent to rob is a term of 20 years imprisonment. The maximum sentence for the aggravated break and enter was, as earlier indicated, 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. The offence of assault with intent to rob, the subject of Count 2, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, was serious. The sentencing judge was also required to bring into account the further matter of resist officer in the execution of his duty taken into account on the Form 1.
	
	
	In my opinion, no error in determining the head sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2 has been established.
	
	
	In determining Ground 3 it is also relevant to have regard to the fact that the sentence for Count 1 was partially accumulated on the non-parole period for the earlier offences of assault.
	
	
	In my opinion, there is no basis for Ground 3. The head sentences imposed were not manifestly excessive.
	


Resentencing


	
	R A Hulme J has helpfully reviewed in his judgment the relevant caselaw in which differing views have been expressed by members of this Court upon the issue as to what the High Court said in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42] requires. In that respect the issue in a case such as the present is whether the discretion is one that should be re‑exercised only in relation to the component of the sentence that is vitiated by error.
	
	
	On that issue I have also had the benefit of considering the Chief Justice’s observations in his judgment.
	
	
	Given the fact that, as the Chief Justice and R A Hulme J have observed, this issue was not argued in these proceedings, I proceed upon the basis that, in re‑sentencing, the Court is required to engage in a fresh exercise of discretion, in that specific error has been established under Ground 2. Accordingly, for that purpose it has been necessary to bring into account in re‑sentencing the applicant all relevant facts and circumstances including those that have arisen since the initial sentencing.
	
	
	The applicant was granted leave to rely upon his affidavit declared and affirmed 23 February 2016 in the event that this Court intervened. He is currently receiving methadone medication. He commenced year 10 studies whilst in custody but this was interrupted by the impact of his partner’s recent death. He hopes to resume his studies and has expressed his keenness to undertake relevant rehabilitation programs but none have yet been available to him in custody.
	
	
	Having regard to all relevant matters but being particularly mindful of the need for there to be sentences that are proportionate to the objective seriousness of the offences (R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 572 [15]), sentences of 3 years for Count 1 and 4 years 6 months for Count 2 are appropriate. However, intervention is warranted so as to provide for a longer parole period that will assist in supporting and promoting the applicant’s rehabilitation. That can be achieved by an alteration of the non‑parole/parole period ratio in respect of Count 2.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted in respect of the sentences imposed by the District Court.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by the District Court be quashed.
	
	
	The applicant be re-sentenced as follows:
	



	
	In respect of Count 1, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months to commence on 30 December 2014 and to expire on 29 October 2016, with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months to expire on 29 December 2017.
	
	
	In respect of Count 2 the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 30 June 2015 and to expire on 29 September 2017, with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months to expire on 29 December 2019.
	


Accordingly, the applicant will become eligible for release on parole when the non-parole period expires on 29 September 2017.


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hall J and with his Honour's reasons.
	
	
	His Honour has reassessed the sentences to be passed upon the applicant in accordance with what was said in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42]. In that case the issue was whether the entire sentence was affected by material error and in those circumstances it is perfectly understandable why the sentencing discretion should be exercised afresh by the appeal court. I have doubts, however, whether in every case in which error is found it is necessary and appropriate for this to be done. The issue was not ventilated in argument and so I am content in the context of this case for a fresh assessment to be made. However, I wish to make some observations about the issue.
	


Observations about what Kentwell v The Queen requires


	
	The plurality judgment in Kentwell v The Queen includes (at [40]-[42]) a discussion of the differing views expressed by the members of this Court in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284. It held that the analysis of Spigelman CJ should be accepted. The judgment continued with the following explanation (in [42]):
	


""When a judge acts upon a wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration [House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505], the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing [s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Act""] and the factors that the Sentencing Act [s 21A] and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be 'warranted in law'. A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not 'warranted in law' unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence.""


	
	Importantly for present purposes, the judgment immediately continues:
	


""This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.""


	
	An example was then provided of a sentence being affected by ""legal error"" by specifying the non-parole and parole periods in a sequence that is contrary to that mandated by the legislation. Such an error, without more, ""does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion"". This indicates to me that it was not held that any error in sentencing requires a fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion. Arguably, it was held that only an error that potentially had an effect on the sentencing outcome invokes that requirement. Put another way, it is what has been held to have been affected by House v The King error that should be the subject of the ""fresh exercise"".
	
	
	Some errors potentially affect the entire sentencing outcome. The error in Kentwell v The Queen was of that type and it is understandable that in such a case the entire sentencing discretion must be re-exercised. But some errors only affect a discrete component of the outcome: for example, the commencement date of the sentence; the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period; or the extent of the discount for a plea of guilty or assistance to authorities. If an error of that limited type is all that is the subject of complaint on appeal, or is the only error in respect of which an appellant is successful in establishing, it seems illogical that the Court is nevertheless required to redetermine the sentence in its entirety.
	
	
	In the present case the only error found in the sentencing of the applicant was a failure to give appropriate effect to the finding of special circumstances. No error in the assessment of the overall sentence has been found. In these circumstances it can be said that there has been no House v The King error that is held to have vitiated the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion in the assessment of the overall term of the sentence. In such circumstances, why then should this Court do more than exercise afresh the sentencing discretion insofar as it concerns the setting of the non-parole component? Kentwell v The Queen is silent on this point as it was concerned with error that affected the entire sentence rather than a discrete component of it.
	
	
	There are even more stark examples that come to mind where, in my view, it would be illogical for this Court to engage in a fresh exercise of the entire sentencing discretion. Say, for example, the sole complaint on appeal was that a judge failed to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody by backdating the sentence. Or, perhaps the judge, contrary to s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), post-dated the commencement of a sentence because the offender was serving an existing sentence but for which the non-parole period had expired.
	


Examples of this Court's application of Kentwell v The Queen


	
	The approach this Court has taken thus far when responding to an error that affected only a component of a sentence sometimes has been to re-exercise the entire sentencing discretion afresh because it has been understood that Kentwell v The Queen requires it to do so.
	
	
	In MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 the only ground of appeal was concerned with a sentence that failed to give effect to a finding of special circumstances because of a mathematical error. Gleeson JA (Johnson and Hall JJ agreeing) engaged in a thorough analysis of all factors bearing upon the total term of the sentence as well as the non-parole period before determining to impose the same overall term but with a reduced non-parole period.
	
	
	The Court also expressed itself as having to re-exercise the sentencing discretion in other cases where the identified error was confined to the non‑parole component: Hutchen v R [2015] NSWCCA 101 at [44] (Hoeben CJ at CL, Adams and McCallum JJ agreeing) (the head sentence was maintained but the non-parole period reduced) and Wakeling v R [2016] NSWCCA 33 at [58]) (Davies J, Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson JH agreeing) (the applicant conceded that no variation of the head sentence was required so the focus was upon the non-parole period)
	
	
	In Arsiotis v R [2015] NSWCCA 275 the sentencing judge was found to have made a mathematical error in calculating the reduction of the sentence on account of the offender's plea of guilty. The judge allowed a 25 per cent discount but reduced a 24 month sentence to 20 instead of 18 months. This was the sole ground of appeal. But rather than merely correcting the error the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ agreeing, at [8]) considered it ""necessary for this Court to independently exercise its sentencing discretion"". In the result, the same starting point was adopted but an 18 month term of imprisonment was imposed with a proportional reduction in the recognisance release order.
	
	
	In Marrow v R [2015] NSWCCA 282 the only error was that the sentencing judge allowed a 20 per cent reduction for an early plea of guilty which was held to have warranted a 25 per cent reduction. There was a complete re-exercise of the sentencing discretion by the Court (Adamson J, Hidden and Davies JJ agreeing) in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen which resulted in a lower starting point being adopted and hence a lesser effective sentence being imposed.
	
	
	In Alpha v R [2015] NSWCCA 225, with the agreement of Leeming JA and Price J, I (at [53]) expressed doubt about whether a complete re-exercise of the sentencing discretion was required where the sole issue was a mathematical error in reducing a sentence on account of an offender's plea of guilty and assistance to authorities:
	


""The submissions for the Crown pointed out that where an arithmetical error is the sole basis of this Court's intervention in a sentencing appeal such intervention has been confined to simple correction. Burns v R [2008] NSWCCA 260 at [34], [37] and Young v R [2007] NSWCCA 114 at [26]-[28] were provided as examples. However, the Crown submitted that after Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 it seems necessary for the Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. I am not sure that this will always be necessary; it seems to me that it would depend upon the nature of the error. However, in the present case I am prepared to carry out the task.”


	
	A more confined approach was taken in O'Connell v R [2016] NSWCCA 43. The sole complaint was that a finding of special circumstances was not reflected in the total effective sentence where individual sentences had been partially accumulated. The Crown contended that there was no principled basis for special circumstances to have been found. Fullerton J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) said (at [29]):
	


""Since the appeal is limited to the question whether the sentencing judge erred in failing to adjust the non-parole period in accordance with his conclusion that special circumstances warranted such an adjustment pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is not necessary for this Court to consider whether the non-parole period and the additional term, taken together, were affected by an error of law. The only question for this Court was the propriety of the proportion of the sentence constituted by the non-parole period. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court, in accordance with the principles in Kentwell v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 96, to independently consider the application of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to the applicant’s sentence and, in substance, if a lesser non-parole period should have been imposed, quash the sentence and pass the appropriately adjusted sentence.""


	
	Similarly, in Carroll v R [2015] NSWCCA 219 the only error identified was concerned with the application of the totality principle in sentencing for multiple offences. The Court (McCallum J; Hoeben CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) stated (at [40]) that “in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37, it is necessary to re-sentence the applicant”. However, that exercise was confined to re-determining the degree of concurrence/accumulation of the sentences and followed a concession by Mr Game SC on behalf of the applicant that “it would not be inconsistent with the principles stated in Kentwell to preserve the terms of sentence determined by the sentencing judge” but to increase the degree of concurrency. There is nothing to indicate that the concession was based upon what Kentwell v The Queen requires and I suspect it was a practical one based upon the facts of the particular case.
	
	
	Daniels v R [2016] NSWCCA 35 involved a sentencing judge purporting to make a parole order with conditions in the context of imposing a sentence of 4 years 6 months when the making of a parole order and imposing conditions is only permitted in the case of sentences not exceeding 3 years (per ss 50 and 51 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). A question was raised as to whether the error should nonetheless be characterised as a sentencing error invoking the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and thereby requiring the Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen.
	
	
	Fullerton J (Hoeben CJ at CL and RS Hulme AJ agreeing) referred to the passage of the plurality judgment in Kentwell v The Queen at [42] that I have quoted above. Her Honour then said (at [28]-[29]):
	


""In my view, the error in the sentencing exercise the subject of the second ground of appeal is an example of an error of the kind to which the High Court in Kentwell was referring. ['That is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.'] After setting aside the parole condition (it being of no legal effect being made beyond power), the sentencing judge's appointment of a non-parole period of 3 years as the minimum period the applicant is to spend in custody is unaffected. …

I do not regard the error in imposing a parole condition as part of the sentencing order as vitiating the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion in this case. I would order that the parole condition be set aside but I would not move to re-sentence the applicant.""


	
	RS Hulme AJ added (at [61]):
	


""Furthermore, while fully conscious of the decision of the High Court in Kentwell v R to which Fullerton J has referred, I am satisfied that in no way was any other aspect of the sentence affected adversely to the Applicant by his Honour's unauthorised imposition of a parole condition.""


	
	Viewed broadly, the approach taken in Daniels v R is consistent with confining the fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion to where an error as had potential impact upon the actual sentence imposed. In that case, the error was regarded as having had no potential impact at all.
	


Conclusion


	
	The purpose of my engaging in this analysis is to make the general observation that there is, in my view, a persuasive argument in favour of this Court regarding Kentwell v The Queen as requiring a fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion in relation to the whole sentence when the sentencing discretion in relation to the whole of it is vitiated by error. Where there is error that does not entail vitiation of the entire sentencing discretion, but is an error that only affects a discrete component of the sentence that could have no potential bearing on the whole, the discretion should be re-exercised but only in relation to that particular component.

2769606,AP v Burrell [2016] NSWSC 708,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By amended summons filed on 5 February 2016, AP, the plaintiff, appeals against an order made by Skinner LCM that he be required to submit to a buccal swab for the purpose of collecting a sample of his DNA. Detective Senior Constable James Burrell, the defendant, is the investigating police officer on whose application the Local Court made the order. The plaintiff’s twin brother, John, is awaiting trial by jury in the District Court for three sex offences which are alleged to have been committed in 1994 against a 13-year old girl who is now deceased.
	
	
	On 20 May 2014 Magistrate Curran, after a hearing on 28 April 2014 and 19 May 2014, refused to make an order authorising the taking of a buccal swab from the plaintiff. Subsequently, Detective Burrell made a further application, which was heard by Skinner LCM on 17 December 2015. At the conclusion of the hearing, her Honour made an order authorising the taking of a buccal swab from the plaintiff and gave ex tempore reasons for decision.
	
	
	The plaintiff sought the following orders in this Court:
	


1   Leave to appeal pursuant to s 53(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 by virtue of s 115A(1) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 as necessary in relation to questions of fact and/or mixed law and fact.

2   Appeal allowed.

3   An order pursuant to s 55(2)(a) and/or s 55(3)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, as the case may be, by virtue of s 115A(1) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000, setting aside the Magistrate’s order requiring the plaintiff to undergo the forensic procedure.

4   Alternatively, an order pursuant to s 55(2)(c) and/or s 55(3)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, as the case may be, by virtue of s 115A(1) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000, remitting the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law by a different Magistrate.

5   Costs.


	
	The plaintiff appealed (in respect of grounds 1-3), and sought leave to appeal (in respect of grounds 4-7), against the order on the following grounds:
	


The Magistrate erred in law by admitting into evidence the opinion contained in the hospital records and the assertions made on behalf of John [SURNAME INSERTED] that suggested that he and the respondent were identical twins.

The Magistrate erred in law by excluding from consideration a relevant matter, namely the applicant’s reason for bringing the application.

2A   The Magistrate erred in law in her approach to the requirements of s 24(3)(a) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act 2000.

2B   The Magistrate erred in law in her approach to the requirements of s 26(3) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act 2000.

3   The Magistrate erred in law by failing to provide adequate reasons for her decision.

4   The Magistrate erred in finding that the applicant suspected on reasonable grounds that the respondent had committed the subject offences.

5   The Magistrate erred in finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent had committed the subject offences.

6   The Magistrate erred in finding that there was additional information which justified the making of a second application for the same forensic procedure.

7   The Magistrate erred in finding that the relevant forensic procedure was justified in all the circumstances pursuant to s 24(4) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act 2000.


	
	By reason of s 115A(1) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (NSW) (the CFP Act), the appeal is to be determined as if it were an appeal against sentence under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). To the extent to which any of the grounds involves a question of law alone, an appeal lies to this Court by right: s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. To the extent to which any of the grounds involve a question of mixed fact and law, an appeal to this Court lies only by leave: s 53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	
	
	Except where otherwise indicated, all references to statutory provisions are references to the CFP Act.
	
	
	I note that s 43 imposes restrictions on publication of the name of a suspect on whom a forensic procedure is proposed to be carried out in relation to an offence. These restrictions do not apply to the reasons given by this Court. However, I consider it to be appropriate, in light of the considerations that underpin s 43, that the plaintiff be referred to only as AP, since he has not been charged with any offence, and that his twin brother be referred to only as “John”.
	


The facts

The criminal trial in the District Court


	
	On 20 November 1994 CF, a 13-year old girl, was alone in the city of Sydney. She was approached by a male, who identified himself as “John”, who offered to show her around the city. It is alleged that John attacked and sexually assaulted her. CF reported the matter to police, gave a statement and underwent an examination at the Royal Alexandria Hospital for Children with the use of a Sexual Assault Investigation Kit (SAIK). The examination detected semen inside her vagina. The semen was retained and subjected to DNA testing.
	
	
	On 15 July 2004, CF took her own life.
	
	
	On 30 November 2004, John (the plaintiff’s twin brother), who was in custody for an unrelated matter at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (MRRC) at Silverwater, was subjected to inmate testing. The profile of his DNA was uploaded and compared with “cold cases”. John’s DNA was found to match the DNA of the semen sample recovered from CF.
	
	
	On 19 December 2012 John was charged with aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 12 April 2013 a second sample was obtained from John, which confirmed the results of the first test which had been performed in 2004.
	
	
	On 29 October 2013 Detective Senior Constable Caitlin Hyde was informed by the Department of Public Prosecution that John had informed his Legal Aid solicitor that he had an identical twin brother. It was common ground that identical twins have, for relevant purposes, the same DNA profile.
	
	
	As a consequence, on 5 December 2013 Detective Burrell conducted checks at Royal North Shore Hospital, where John was born in 1965, to ascertain whether he had a brother and, if so, whether his brother was a twin, and, if so, whether his twin brother was a fraternal or identical twin. Detective Burrell ascertained that the plaintiff and John were twin brothers. There was no reference in the documents he saw in December 2013 to whether the twins were identical apart from a single reference in the medical records that the doctor “thought” that John and the plaintiff were identical twins.
	
	
	On 23 December 2013 Detective Burrell wrote to the plaintiff, in part in the following terms:
	


On the 19th of December 2012 your twin brother John [surname included] was charged with a sexual assault which took place on Sunday 20th November 1994 between 3:00pm and 5:00pm in Sydney.

I am making some inquiries into your whereabouts on Sunday the 20th of November 1994. The reason for this information is your identical twin brother John [surname included] is claiming he was not present at the time of the incident. As you are identical twins I am trying to establish your movements on that day.

I have determined that you were in the country at the time of the incident. I am seeking to know if you remember what you did that day. You are not a suspect for this incident, just a possible witness.

In relation to this, would you be willing to provide a written statement in relation to your whereabouts that day?

If you have questions or require further information, please contact me on the details below.

The first application under the CFP Act


	
	On 24 February 2014, Detective Burrell applied for an order pursuant to s 24 on the basis that the plaintiff was a suspect within the meaning of s 3. In the affidavit in support affirmed on 24 February 2014, Detective Burrell relevantly deposed:
	


[The plaintiff] is a suspect within the meaning of section 3 of the Act, namely I have reasonable grounds to suspect that he committed the listed offences, based on the matching of a previous sample of his DNA to forensic material located as a result of a SAIK examination.


	
	Detective Burrell deposed as to the matters set out above. He identified the following as constituting “grounds to believe that the forensic procedure(s) might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence(s)” (as required by s 24(1)(a)):
	


Police require a sample of [the plaintiff’s] DNA in order to conduct comparison test with the evidence gathered during the SAIK examination. This will either confirm the original result, being John [XXX]’s involvement or prove that they both have the same DNA (identical twin).   


	
	Detective Burrell’s first application under the CFP Act was heard by Curran LCM on 28 April 2014. Mr Gorman, who appeared for the applicant (Detective Burrell), relied on the affidavit referred to above. Mr Hughes, who appeared for the plaintiff, relied on the letter dated 23 December 2013 set out above, in support of a submission that the plaintiff was not a suspect. At the conclusion of that day, Mr Gorman proposed that the applicant serve further evidence in support of the application. The Magistrate acceded to this proposal and stood the matter over for a second day of hearing to 19 May 2014. A further affidavit of Detective Burrell affirmed 8 May 2014 was relied upon on the adjourned day (19 May 2014). It relevantly added the following evidence to that which was contained in his earlier affidavit:
	


8.   Investigators have obtained Expert Evidence in relation to the DNA profiles of identical twins. Dr David BRUCE has informed investigators that the DNA profiles of identical twins are an exact match and there are no tests available [that] can differentiate the two individuals. As such he is a suspect in the alleged offences as indicated by the DNA obtained from within the victim.

[The plaintiff] was offered the opportunity to provide investigators with his whereabouts on the date of the incident. To this date, he has not provided any materials to police. He has contacted police on only one occasion since December 2013. This was soon after he was served with the first Affidavit in regard to the Forensic Procedure application (24/02/2014).

Grounds to believe that the forensic procedure(s) might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence(s): s24(1)(a) of the Act

9.   Investigations into [the plaintiff’s] whereabouts indicate that he was in Australia on the date of the alleged offences. [The plaintiff] arrived back in Australia on 13/05/1994 on a Qantas Flight and departed Australia on 28/12/1996 on an Air Pacific flight. Travel records indicate he was in Australia during this whole period, which includes the incident date of 20/11/1994. Both of these travel movements were through Sydney.

10.   Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from the victim, which was located on a high vaginal swab within the victim. [The plaintiff] has been nominated as an identical twin of the male whose DNA was found inside the victim. As such if he is an identical twin the forensic procedure would tend to prove his participation in the offence; however if fraternal this would disprove his involvement in the offence.


	
	Mr Warren (who appeared for the applicant on 19 May 2014) also tendered a statement under s 177 of the Evidence Act of Dr Bruce, a Senior Forensic Biologist, who relevantly stated:
	


5.    It is expected that identical twins will have the same DNA profile in the    PowerPlexR 21 system.

6.   It is expected that non-identical twins will have different DNA profiles in the PowerPlexR 21 system.

7.   Therefore, it is expected that the PowerPlexR21 system will only discriminate between the DNA profiles of non-identical twins.


	
	The submissions recorded in the transcript for 19 May 2014 reveal that the principal issues were: whether the plaintiff was a suspect within the meaning of s 3; and, if so, whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that he had committed an offence, as required by s 24(3)(a). Mr Warren told Curran LCM that the plaintiff had provided a letter to police accounting for his whereabouts on 20 November 1994, although, as set out below, no such letter is revealed by the evidence.
	
	
	The Magistrate reserved his decision and gave oral reasons for decision on 20 May 2014, which were recorded on transcript.
	
	
	The transcript recorded that, after reciting the evidence and outlining the applicable provisions, his Honour identified the principal issue in the proceedings as whether the plaintiff was a suspect. His Honour referred to the letter from Detective Burrell dated 23 December 2013 set out above and noted the sentence, “You are not a suspect for this incident, just a possible witness.” His Honour continued:
	


Obviously, since that particular letter was written, certain further matters have been attended to and they appear to be in the nature of obtaining the document from Mr Bruce but also, perhaps more relevantly, the investigation or further reinvestigation of what transpired back at the Royal North Shore Hospital in 1965.

However, all that that further investigation established is that the two are twins. There is no evidence before me to suggest they are identical twins or, alternatively, that they are non-identical twins, in which case the evidence would not be of terribly much assistance at all, given the DNA match would not be appropriate, probably and almost likely, as far as [the plaintiff] is concerned.

However, it seems to me that the court has to have a lot more evidence before it to establish on, and I stress, reasonable grounds that [the plaintiff] is a suspect. All that I know in relation to this is that his brother has asserted that he has a twin. There is nothing before the court, for instance, by way of photographic evidence, evidence suggesting that there is a similarity in appearance between [the plaintiff] and the person who carried out the assault back in November 1994. I do not know whether [the plaintiff] bears any similarity in appearance at all to [John]. The only evidence, as I have said, that I have got is that there is an assertion by [John] that he has a twin brother and that is confirmed by the investigations of the hospital. Beyond that, there is nothing by way of investigations that would allow me to have any other grounds to refer to or base my opinion upon to establish whether or not they were reasonable or not to implicate [the plaintiff] in the commission of this offence.

…

If I do not have reasonable grounds before me to establish that he, indeed, is a suspect, then it is my view that I DO NOT HAVE POWER UNDER THE ACT TO MAKE THE ORDERS SOUGHT.

I do not believe that the present time that I have any such grounds or information before the court to allow me to form a view and to analyse the grounds to confirm whether or not they are reasonable to implicate him as being a suspect before I make the orders that are being sought.

I, THEREFORE, DECLINE TO MAKE THE ORDES THAT ARE SOUGHT.


	
	The decision of Curran LCM was not the subject of appeal.
	


The first vacated trial in the District Court


	
	John’s trial was listed for trial by jury before Blackmore AJ in the District Court to commence on 22 June 2015. The plaintiff was subpoenaed to give evidence at the trial as a Crown witness. John pleaded not guilty to all three charges. The question of DNA testing was raised as a pre-trial issue. Mr Todd, who appeared on behalf of the accused (John), confirmed that “identification will become a critical issue”. His Honour obtained confirmation from Mr Todd that John’s instructions were that he was not there at the time of the offences and that, although identification was an issue, consent was not.
	
	
	In the course of the pre-trial hearing, the following exchanges ensued:
	


HIS HONOUR: So the only question is whether or not the sample was taken from her vaginal swab which matches your client, apparently, is the only possible source of that DNA.

TODD: Yes.

. . .

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The magistrate [Curran LCM] refused the application on the basis that [the plaintiff] was not a suspect.

HIS HONOUR: I can review that. If you make the application here I can make the decision right here and now.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: As my friend has pointed out, once the issue of identical twins was raised that led to the application before the Local Court on the basis that the identical twin could have the same DNA and he therefore became a suspect.

HIS HONOUR: I should withdraw that, I may not be able to solve that. It may be a matter that has to go to the Supreme Court, but I would have thought it is a crucial issue here, it is better now if it is placed on the record formally that the instructions are that I didn’t do it, i.e., this is not a consent case, therefore you go to the Supreme Court and say – so the issue is identical, two potential people could be involved in the offence.


	
	Following the luncheon adjournment the Crown applied for the trial date to be vacated in order to permit a further application to be made in the Local Court for an order under the CFP Act that the plaintiff have a buccal swab taken for the purposes of ascertaining his DNA profile.
	


The second application under the CFP Act


	
	On 9 July 2015 Detective Burrell filed a second application for an order under the CFP Act to require the plaintiff to undertake a buccal swab and relied on a further affidavit affirmed on 29 June 2015 in support of the application. In addition to the evidence contained in his earlier affidavits referred to above (which was replicated in the affidavit of 29 June 2015), Detective Burrell deposed as follows:
	


11.   On Monday 22nd June 2015, when this matter was scheduled for trial, the defence have conceded that the issue is identification only. John [surname inserted] has gone onto the court record as pleading not guilty to the charges. He also went on record in the District Court as saying “I wasn’t there / I didn’t do it”. On this basis, [the plaintiff] is the only other person who could have committed these offences. As he is confirmed as being the twin of [John], [the plaintiff] is the only other person able to be a suspect in this investigation. This new material on record from [John], by necessary implication makes [the plaintiff] a suspect.

12   Magistrate BLACKMORE has ruled that a new application be made to the local court to obtain [the plaintiff’s] DNA. This application will have the court transcript with Magistrate BLACKMORE’s ruling along with the crown (O’SULLIVAN) and defence (Legal Aid) comments attached.


	
	The applicant in the Local Court also relied on an affidavit of Detective Burrell affirmed 23 October 2015, which contained the following additional evidence:
	



	
	Evidence of images compiled from descriptions given by CF shortly after the alleged offence, as well as evidence from the police officer who compiled the images that CF had told him that the man told her that his name was John.
	
	
	The transcript of the pre-trial hearing before Blackmore AJ on 22 June 2015 (referred to above) in which Mr Todd indicated that John’s defence to the Crown case was that he was not there.
	
	
	Hospital records obtained by Detective Burrell from the Royal North Shore Hospital, which described John and the plaintiff as twins, and which contain the following notations:
	


“Dr Collins thinks the twins are uniovular [one egg, i.e. identical twins].”

[From a histopathology report dated 9 December 1965 relating to the mother of John and the plaintiff]

“This is a large placenta. There are two umbilical cords arising from opposite edges. It would appear that the twins are uni-ovular.”

[From an admission summary sheet]

“Pregnancy delivered twins uniovular prematurely”


	
	The results of further investigations conducted as to the physical appearance of John and the plaintiff at different times, including: a charge photograph of John dated 14 November 1994; the plaintiff’s passport applications dated 24 October 1990 and 8 December 2014; and Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) photographs: one of the plaintiff dated 20 November 2012 and one of John dated 21 February 2012.
	
	
	Travel movement records which indicated that the plaintiff’s address as at 20 November 1994 (the date of the alleged offence) was a residence in Collaroy Plateau, which is in reasonable proximity to Sydney City at the time of the offences.
	
	
	The fact that, notwithstanding the representation made by Mr Warren (who appeared for the plaintiff before Curran LCM) that the plaintiff had provided a letter to police accounting for his whereabouts on 20 November 1994, Detective Burrell had not been able to locate that letter or find any record of its having been received.
	
	
	Detective Burrell explained that, at the time he wrote the letter of 23 December 2012 in which he told the plaintiff that he was not a suspect, he was in error, since the plaintiff was a suspect at that time.
	



	
	Detective Burrell deposed as to his belief and the grounds for his belief that the plaintiff is a suspect as follows:
	


36.   The primary basis for my belief is my knowledge that the DNA sample from the victim’s vaginal swab matches the DNA sample from John, and that there is evidence that [the plaintiff] is John’s twin and may be his identical twin. Dr Bruce has provided an opinion to the effect that the DNA profiles of identical twins are identical.

. . .

[reference was made to the hospital records set out above]

39.   On the basis of the medical records I believe that [the plaintiff] and John are twins and that they may be identical twins. It is therefore possible that the DNA sample from the victim’s vaginal swab may match that of [the plaintiff], to the same degree that it matched John’s DNA, if they are identical twins.

…

[reference was made to the photographic evidence described above]

41.   Having compared the photographs, it is my view that it is not possible from the photographs to say whether [the plaintiff] and John are identical or fraternal twins. However, it is my belief that both of them match the description of the male offender provider by [CF].

…

44.   The statements made by John’s counsel at the trial have strengthened my suspicion that [the plaintiff] may have committed the offences. Mr Todd stated on the record that he is instructed that John was not present at the time of the alleged assault. He conceded that DNA matching John’s DNA was matched against the DNA taken from the vaginal swab of the victim and that John has a twin brother. Mr Todd confirmed that the only question will be whether or not John is the only possible source of the DNA. The only other possible source of this DNA is an identical twin brother, and the only person this could be is [the plaintiff].

45.   I believe that it is possible to have more than one suspect (in this case, two suspects) to an offence. On the basis of the information outlined above, [the plaintiff] is the only person, other than John, who could have committed the offences and therefore he is a suspect in this investigation.

Intended use of the buccal swab sample

46.   If the Court authorises the carrying out of a self-administered buccal swab by [the plaintiff], I intend to request that the buccal swab sample be compared against one or both of the samples taken from [CF] by way of the SAIK examination. I may also request that [the plaintiff’s] buccal swab sample be compared against John’s DNA sample. If [the plaintiff’s] buccal swab sample does not match any of the other samples, I believe that would tend to disprove that [the plaintiff] committed the offences. However, if [the plaintiff’s] buccal swab sample matches any of the other samples, I believe that would tend to prove that [the plaintiff] committed the offences.


	
	Detective Burrell also deposed to technology available in Germany which is said to be able to differentiate between the DNA profiles of identical twins (who, on less sophisticated testing, are regarded as having identical DNA). He deposed that if the forensic procedure was ordered and it revealed that the plaintiff has the same DNA profile as John, he would request that consideration be given to further testing in Germany (at significant financial cost).
	
	
	Written submissions were relied on by both the applicant and the plaintiff (who was the respondent) at the hearing before Skinner LCM on 17 December 2015. Mr McGorey appeared on behalf of the applicant. Mr McMahon appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. The affidavit of Detective Burrell affirmed 23 October 2015 was relied on in support of the application, as well as other documentary evidence, including the expert certificate of Dr Bruce, referred to above, and the plaintiff’s address history with the RTA. Detective Burrell was cross-examined.
	
	
	The Magistrate heard submissions (which will be addressed in more detail below by reference to particular grounds) and delivered ex tempore reasons at the conclusion of the hearing on 17 December 2015.
	


The reasons of Skinner LCM


	
	Her Honour addressed the requirements in s 26(3) that there be additional information that justifies the making of a further application. Her Honour referred to Munro v ACP [2012] NSWSC 100 and ACP v Munro [2012] NSWSC 1510; 227 A Crim R 317, to which reference had been made in the parties’ submissions. Her Honour identified the following “additional information” that was relied upon in support of the second application as follows: the hospital records; the transcript of the pre-trial hearing before Blackmore AJ on 23 June 2015 in which John’s counsel indicated that identification was a significant issue and that his client had instructed him that he was not there; the photographic evidence referred to above; and the information as to the plaintiff’s whereabouts (living in Collaroy Plateau) at the time of the commission of the alleged offences.
	
	
	Her Honour said of the photographic evidence:
	


Since the application before Magistrate Curran, the applicant has had the opportunity to recover various photographs of both [the plaintiff] and [John] taken at different times and we have also got the Identikit that was made with respect to the offender. In my view, this is less significant regarding what happened at the time but is significant in looking at their features now in that there is an indication from similarities in their physical features that it is consistent with an assertion that they may be identical twins. Although there are dissimilarities, they are not so stark as to exclude any prospect that they might be identical twins.


	
	Her Honour then recorded her satisfaction that the threshold in s 26(3) had been met by the additional information referred to “because the additional information gets closer to grounding a reasonable belief or proof of the fact that there may be two identical DNA samples and that those DNA samples are consistent with the DNA that was found in swabs taken from the victim.”
	
	
	Her Honour proceeded to address the requirements of s 24. Her Honour specifically addressed the argument put on behalf of the plaintiff that the application was, in effect, a means of preventing John from raising the possibility that his twin brother was guilty of the offence, by deciding that she had to look at the objective facts, to determine whether the plaintiff was a suspect. Her Honour noted the parties’ concession that identical twins have the same DNA.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the requirement of the definition of “suspect” in s 3 as follows:
	


“I need to determine that the officer who swore the affidavit in support of the application has reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff has committed an offence.”


	
	Her Honour found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed the relevant offences (as required by s 24(3)(a)) and that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence (as required by s 24(3)(b)). Magistrate Skinner then addressed those matters in s 24(4) in respect of which submissions had been made in the context of what her Honour described as the “balancing act” required to be performed by that subsection.
	


Relevant statutory provisions: the nature of the application for a forensic procedure


	
	The relevant provisions of the CFP Act that govern the application in the Local Court are set out below.
	
	
	Part 5 of the CFP Act provides for the carrying out of forensic procedures on ""suspects"" by order of a Magistrate. A ""suspect"" is defined as including a person whom a police officer suspects on reasonable grounds has committed an offence: s 3. Forensic procedures are either ""intimate"" or ""non-intimate"". A self-administered buccal swab is defined as a non-intimate forensic procedure.
	
	
	Division 2 of Part 5 of the CFP Act  relevantly provides:
	


24 Final order for carrying out forensic procedure

(1) A Magistrate may order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if satisfied on the balance of probabilities:

(a) that the circumstances referred to in subsection . . . (3) exist, and

(b) that the carrying out of such a procedure is justified in all the circumstances.

. . .

(3) In the case of a non-intimate forensic procedure:

(a) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence, and

(b) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a).

(4) In determining whether or not the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances, the Magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect’s physical integrity, having regard to the following:

(a) the gravity of the alleged offence,

(b) the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed,

(c) the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence,

(d) the age, cultural background and physical and mental health of the suspect, to the extent to which they are known,

(e) in the case of a suspect who is a child or an incapable person, the best interests of the child or person,

(f) such other practicable ways of obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence as are less intrusive,

(g) such reasons as the suspect may have given for refusing to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure concerned,

(h) in the case of a suspect who is in custody, the period for which the suspect has been in custody and the reasons for any delay in the making of an application for an order under this section,

(i) such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant to the balancing of those interests.

. . .

26 Application for order

(1) An authorised applicant (but no other person) may apply to a Magistrate for an order under section 24 authorising him or her to arrange the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect.

(2) An application for an order must:

. . .

(b) be supported by evidence on oath, or by affidavit, in relation to the matters as to which the Magistrate must be satisfied, as referred to in section 24 (1),

. . . .

(3) If a Magistrate refuses an application for an order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect, the authorised applicant (or any other person aware of the application) may not make a further application to carry out the same forensic procedure on the suspect unless he or she provides additional information that justifies the making of the further application.


	
	As set out above, s 26 relevantly provides that an application for an order must be supported by evidence on oath, or by affidavit, in relation to the matters as to which the Magistrate must be satisfied, as referred to in s 24(1). Section 24 relevantly provides that, in the case of non-intimate forensic procedures, there must be reasonable grounds to believe that: (1) the suspect has committed a prescribed offence, and (2) the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the prescribed offence. Section 24(1) also requires the Magistrate to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the carrying out of the procedure is justified in all the circumstances, as to which s 24(4) provides for the matters which are to be taken into account by the Magistrate.
	
	
	Section 30 relevantly provides for the procedure that applies at the hearing of such applications as follows:
	


(6) The suspect or his or her representative:

(a) may cross-examine the applicant for the order, and

(b) may, with the leave of the Magistrate, call or cross-examine any other witness, and

(c) may address the Magistrate.

(7) A Magistrate must not give leave under subsection (6) (b) unless the Magistrate is of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should be called or cross-examined.


	
	Section 31 required the Magistrate to specify the forensic procedure to be carried out and give reasons for making the order.
	
	
	The applicant for a forensic procedure has the onus of proving any necessary belief or suspicion on the balance of probabilities: s 103. The Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies in terms to applications for a forensic procedure. The proceedings in the Local Court, although related to the suspected commission of an offence, are civil, not criminal, since they do not amount to the prosecution of a person for an offence or for committal, sentence or bail (see the definition of ""criminal proceedings"" in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act). Not being criminal proceedings, they are necessarily ""civil proceedings"" since the Evidence Act defines ""civil proceeding"" as a proceeding other than a criminal proceeding.
	
	
	The applicable provisions of the Evidence Act must be read together with the CFP Act, including s 30, which provides that persons other than the applicant may only be cross-examined with leave of the Magistrate.
	
	
	Before making an order for a forensic procedure, the Magistrate is required to be satisfied of the following:
	



	
	that the officer who swore the affidavit in support of the application suspects on reasonable grounds that the plaintiff has committed an offence;
	
	
	that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed the offence;
	
	
	that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence; and
	
	
	that the carrying out of the procedure is justified in all the circumstances.
	



	
	Before making such an order on a second application, the Magistrate is first required to be satisfied of the matters in s 26(3).
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	I propose to address the grounds which relate to the substantive application (grounds 1, 2, 2A, 3, 4, 5 and 7) separately from those that relate to the preliminary question whether there was additional information that justified the making of a second application (grounds 2B and 6).
	


Ground 1: the Magistrate erred in law by admitting into evidence the opinion contained in the hospital records and the assertions made on behalf of John that suggested that he and the plaintiff were identical twins


	
	The defendant does not oppose leave to appeal in relation to this ground, notwithstanding that it involves a mixed question of fact and law. There are two aspects to this ground: first, that the Magistrate erred in addressing the requirements of s 135(1)(a); and secondly, that the Magistrate erred in admitting opinion evidence.
	
	
	The transcript of the hearing before Skinner LCM records that Mr McMahon objected to the admission of the histopathology report and the evidence that John’s lawyer had passed on his instructions that John and the plaintiff were identical twins. The objection was made on the basis of s 135(1)(a) of the Evidence Act, namely that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to the plaintiff.
	
	
	Following the objection there was an exchange between the Magistrate and Mr McMahon in the course of which Mr McMahon accepted that the evidence was relevant to whether there were grounds for suspicion (or belief) and the reasonableness of the grounds. Mr McMahon then indicated that, in light of the Magistrate’s observations, he would “resort” to his “fall-back position in terms of weight”. The transcript records the following ruling by her Honour:
	


HER HONOUR:    Yes, I’m trying to make the distinction between where an opinion is presented to the court to prove a fact and that opinion is lacking foundation that obviously then the evidentiary rules are of greater significance because of the conclusion that needs to be drawn based on that information but here I am secondary to the conclusion that’s drawn based on that information, the decision that I come to comes via another person through those documents so I think that’s very reasonable if we can deal with it as a matter of weight and recognising those documents, I’ll treat them as admitted appropriately in the applicant’s case.

MCMAHON:      Yes.

MCGOREY:      Thank your Honour.

HER HONOUR:   I just thought that was all that we need to resolve now because the rest of it is more complicated.


	
	The plaintiff submitted that the objection was based on the proposition that, because there was no statement setting out the facts and assumptions on which the opinion (that John and the plaintiff were identical twins), the weight to be attached to the opinion could not be assessed and its prejudicial effect would therefore outweigh its probative value.
	
	
	In my view, her Honour correctly identified the relevance of the evidence objected to: as tending to prove the basis for a state of mind; and for the dual purpose of assessing the reasonableness of the grounds of Detective Burrell’s suspicion that the plaintiff had committed the offences (for the purposes of the definition of “suspect” in s 3, as well as assessing whether the Magistrate was herself satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed the offences (for the purposes of s 24(3)(a)).
	
	
	The probative value of what John said about his brother is significant, in that it was capable of leading, and did in fact lead, to a chain of inquiry which provided grounds for a suspicion or belief. What John told his lawyer, which was then communicated to the prosecutor, was not of itself of any particular significance unless it was true. If it was true then it was of great significance since it had the potential to leave open a hypothesis consistent with innocence: namely that John’s identical twin brother (who would, on that scenario, have the same DNA as had been found on CF) had committed the offence. John’s assertion led to further investigation, and to the location of the histopathology report. The histopathology report was a business record of the hospital and therefore attracted the considerations that apply to such records in terms of accuracy and expertise: see Albrighton v Royal Prince Alfred Hospital [1980] 2 NSWLR 542 at 548-549 per Hope JA. The report was capable of providing a basis for a suspicion or belief that John’s identical twin brother (the plaintiff) had committed the offences. That was its probative value.
	
	
	The material that may provide reasonable grounds for suspicion or belief need not be (and frequently is not) in the form of evidence that would be admissible to prove the fact the subject of the suspicion or belief. For example, reasonable grounds for suspicion or belief may include information that the investigating officer concerned has been told by another police officer. It can include material of a hearsay nature: see, for example, Azar v DPP [2014] NSWSC 1323.
	
	
	In these circumstances it is not to the point that the author of the histopathology report was not called as a witness. Even if the author was a witness, he or she could only have been cross-examined with leave of the Magistrate, because of the constraints imposed by s 30. Neither of these matters posed any impediment to the admissibility of the report, having regard to the purpose of its tender.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is difficult to see what the relevant prejudicial effect was, except in the relevant (and appropriate) sense of providing reasonable grounds to suspect the plaintiff. In my view, a fair reading of the transcript indicates that Mr McMahon accepted her Honour’s ruling to that effect. Moreover, the transcript ought be taken as indicating that her Honour ruled the evidence admissible over objection. It is not necessary to give reasons for every evidentiary ruling in a judgment, particularly where a debate between bar and bench has culminated (as, in my view, occurred in the present case) in an acceptance of the judge’s ruling and the basis for the ruling has already been exposed in the exchange.
	
	
	No error has been shown. The first ground has not been made out.
	


Ground 2: The Magistrate erred in law by excluding from consideration a relevant matter, namely the applicant’s reason for bringing the application; and Ground 2A: The Magistrate erred in law in her approach to the requirements of s 24(3)(a) of the CFP Act


	
	As the parties made submissions with respect to grounds 2 and 2A together I propose to address them in the same global way, although some separate consideration can be given to ground 2 first.
	
	
	The matter specifically raised in ground 2 was whether Detective Burrell’s motivation in applying for the forensic procedure was relevant, and if so, what that motivation was. The plaintiff’s contention (before Skinner LCM and in this Court) was that Detective Burrell brought the application under the CFP Act only so as to deprive John of a defence to the charges and that, accordingly, the plaintiff was not, in fact, a suspect.
	
	
	The first point is that there may be more than one suspect for any criminal offence. This is particularly, if not inevitably, so where, as in the present case, the principal issue in the criminal trial is the identification of the offender. The threshold for someone to be a suspect is low: all that is required is that a police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has committed an offence: s 3. The police officer need not believe that the person has committed the offence (belief requiring greater basis than suspicion: George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104), much less be satisfied that the person ought be charged with the offence.
	
	
	Since John had actually been charged with the three offences, he must be regarded as the prime suspect. However, the fact of his being charged does not disqualify the plaintiff from being a suspect. What makes the plaintiff a suspect is the material (including John’s assertion, the physical resemblance in the photographs and the hospital records) which tends to suggest that he and John are identical twins.
	
	
	I reject the plaintiff’s argument that Detective Burrell’s reason for making the application (to exclude a hypothesis consistent with John’s innocence) was a matter which the Magistrate was required to take into account. The CFP Act does not expressly provide that it is a consideration; nor can such an implication be made from its subject-matter, scope or purpose. In these circumstances it cannot be an error of law to fail to take it into account, even if it could be said that her Honour did fail to have regard to it: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J.
	
	
	In any event, the plaintiff’s submission contains a false dichotomy. Where the identity of the offender is in issue, the process of criminal investigation necessarily involves the identification of suspects and the exclusion, by process of elimination, of all suspects other than the accused person. John is a suspect because he has the same DNA profile as that recovered from the victim. The plaintiff is a suspect because there is material to suggest that he is John’s identical twin brother and therefore has the same DNA profile as John and as the sample recovered from the victim. The forensic procedure has the potential to exonerate the plaintiff if it establishes that, notwithstanding John’s assertion and the hospital notes, he does not have the same DNA since he is not John’s identical twin. It has the potential to further implicate the plaintiff if it establishes that he is John’s identical twin and therefore has the same DNA profile as was recovered from the victim.
	
	
	In my view, the Magistrate correctly recognised that the fact that the forensic procedure is of utility to the prosecution in John’s criminal trial neither affects the legality or propriety of the application nor undermines the plaintiff’s status as a suspect. So much is clear from her Honour’s statement in the reasons that she had to “put that to one side”.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that the Magistrate’s decision did not comply with the CFP Act because her Honour engaged in circular reasoning. Mr James QC, who appeared with Mr McMahon on behalf of the plaintiff, submitted that it was erroneous to order a forensic procedure to determine whether a person was a suspect when the jurisdiction to make such an order depended on the person being a suspect at the time of the application. He submitted that he was not a suspect unless and until a DNA test was administered to make him a suspect and that, at the time of the application, all that was available was surmise and John’s assertion that he and John were identical twins.
	
	
	Mr James submitted that:
	


“The only real evidence suggesting a possible connection to the plaintiff, is the largely unexplained assertion that the two might be identical twins and the mere suggestions that the plaintiff might have been living in the greater Sydney area as at the time of the offences.”


	
	In my view, this submission does not take adequate account of the cumulative effect of the investigations conducted by Detective Burrell.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that her Honour misapprehended the statutory requirements, except in one respect, which was immaterial.
	
	
	The provisions of the CFP Act required her Honour to determine, first, whether the respondent (plaintiff) was a “suspect”. This in turn required her Honour to be satisfied that, relevantly, the plaintiff was a person whom Detective Burrell suspected on reasonable grounds has committed an offence. Her Honour misstated the requirement, in that her Honour said that she was required to determine whether Detective Burrell “has reasonable grounds to believe” that the plaintiff has committed an offence. The reason this error is immaterial is that “believe” imposes a higher standard than “suspect”. Accordingly if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff has committed an offence, the officer necessarily has reasonable grounds to suspect that matter.
	
	
	This hierarchy of grounds to warrant particular states of mind was considered by the High Court in George v Rockett in the context of ""reasonable grounds to suspect"" for the purposes of a search warrant. As appears from the following passage, more is required for “belief” than “suspicion”. Their Honours said at 115-116:
	


""Suspicion, as Lord Devlin said in Hussien v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942, at p 948, 'in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking: 'I suspect but I cannot prove.'' The facts which can reasonably ground a suspicion may be quite insufficient reasonably to ground a belief, yet some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown. In Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees [1966] HCA 21; (1966) 115 CLR 266, a question was raised as to whether a payee had reason to suspect that the payer, a debtor, 'was unable to pay (its) debts as they became due' as that phrase was used in s.95(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 (Cth). Kitto J said (at p 303):

A suspicion that something exists is more than a mere idle wondering whether it exists or not; it is a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust, amounting to 'a slight opinion, but without sufficient evidence', as Chambers' Dictionary expresses it. Consequently, a reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence. The notion which 'reason to suspect' expresses in sub-s.(4) is, I think, of something which in all the circumstances would create in the mind of a reasonable person in the position of the payee an actual apprehension or fear that the situation of the payer is in actual fact that which the sub-section describes - a mistrust of the payer's ability to pay his debts as they become due and of the effect which acceptance of the payment would have as between the payee and the other creditors.""


	
	What amounts to reasonable grounds for forming a suspicion or belief must be assessed by reference to ""what was known or reasonably capable of being known at the relevant time"": Ruddock v Taylor [2005] HCA 48; 222 CLR 612 at [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ; see also Bain v Police [2011] SASC 228 per White J at [26].
	
	
	Having heard and seen Detective Burrell give evidence, her Honour was entitled to accept his evidence that he suspected that the plaintiff had committed an offence. As to whether the grounds for Detective Burrell’s belief (or suspicion) were reasonable, her Honour accepted that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had the same DNA profile as the sample recovered from the victim. It was accepted that, if the plaintiff and John were identical twins, they would have the same DNA profile; and that John’s DNA profile matched that of the victim. Although her Honour did not expressly find that the plaintiff was a suspect, it was apparent from the reasons that she accepted that he was a person whom Detective Burrell suspected on reasonable grounds had committed an offence, which necessarily made him a suspect, because it brought him within the definition of suspect in s 3.
	
	
	Her Honour specifically found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed the offences. This finding was open to her Honour and involved either a question of fact or a mixed question of fact and law. Her Honour’s finding fulfilled the requirement of s 24(1)(a). It also, incidentally, fulfilled the requirement in s 3 that Detective Burrell’s suspicion that the plaintiff had committed an offence was based on reasonable grounds since the grounds for Detective Burrell’s suspicion were the same grounds as those which her Honour found to be reasonable grounds for belief: see KC v Sanger [2012] NSWSC 98 at [71]–[72] per Hulme RA.
	
	
	I note for completeness the plaintiff’s submission that the question of whether or not a person is a suspect requires consideration of whether or not a police officer actually suspects that the person in question committed an offence. It therefore contains a subjective element in addition to the subsequent objective assessment as to whether that suspicion is based on reasonable grounds. The plaintiff referred to R v Hill [2012] ACTSC 17; 218 A Crim R 301, in which was said at [90] per Refshauge J:
	


“The question, though, is whether the belief was actually held, not whether it could, justifiably, have been held.”


	
	Detective Burrell deposed that he actually suspected the plaintiff. Her Honour accepted that evidence. The finding was a pure question of fact. There is no basis in these proceedings to challenge her Honour’s finding that Detective Burrell actually suspected that the plaintiff had committed the offences.
	
	
	Neither ground 2, nor ground 2A has been made out.
	


Ground 3: The Magistrate erred in law by failing to provide adequate reasons for her decision


	
	There are two aspects to this ground: the first concerns the requirements of s 24 and the second concerns the requirements of s 26(3). I propose to address the s 24 aspect first and the s 26(3) aspect later in these reasons when I address the grounds relevant to s 26(3).
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that the Magistrate erred in law by failing to provide adequate reasons for her decision regarding the requirements of s 24(3)(a) or for her decision regarding the evidence implicating John. As to the first matter, I am satisfied, for the reasons given above, that her Honour’s reasons were sufficient regarding the requirements of s 24(3)(a). Her Honour addressed Detective Burrell’s state of mind (which was relevant to the question whether the plaintiff was a suspect within the meaning of s 3) and found that the requisite state of mind was made out. Her Honour also addressed whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed the offence and made a specific finding that there were (thereby fulfilling the requirements of reasonable grounds in ss 3 and 24(3)(a)).
	
	
	There was no particular complexity about the chain of reasoning. The plaintiff was a suspect because there was information to indicate that he was John’s identical twin and would therefore have the same DNA profile of both John and the sample recovered from the victim. Her Honour’s reasons were ample to expose “the actual path of reasoning” which led her Honour to find that the requirements of s 24(a) had been met: Wingfoot Australia Partners Pty Limited v Kocak [2013] HCA 43; 252 CLR 480 at [48].
	
	
	The plaintiff’s complaint about the reasons associated with the evidence implicating John has not been made out. Her Honour referred to the evidence implicating John and specifically recognised that John was “certainly on the material the strongest or the primary suspect”. That John was the prime suspect (and, indeed, had been charged and was awaiting trial) did not make the plaintiff any less a suspect unless and until he was excluded as such. The most powerful piece of evidence against John was that his DNA profile matched that of the sample recovered from CF. The prospect that the plaintiff had the very same DNA profile because he was John’s identical twin (which was grounded in the medical evidence and the physical similarity, as well as John’s assertion) because he was John’s identical twin was what made him a suspect too.
	
	
	I accept the submission of Ms Davidson, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, that it is artificial to consider each fact individually and argue that there are explanations that are inconsistent with the belief (or suspicion) that the plaintiff committed the offence. The “facts” must be considered as a whole. That other inferences might arguably arise from the facts or that the available inference might fall short of proof, or conviction, does not of itself prevent a finding being made that reasonable grounds exists to suspect or believe that the plaintiff committed the offence: Kapral v Bunting [2009] NSWSC 749 at [44]- [46] per Howie J. 
	
	
	Ground 3 has not been made out.
	


Ground 4: The Magistrate erred in finding that the applicant suspected on reasonable grounds that the respondent had committed the subject offences and Ground 5: The Magistrate erred in finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent had committed the subject offences


	
	Ground 4 involves a question of fact (whether Detective Burrell suspected that the respondent had committed the subject offences) and a question of mixed fact and law (whether there were reasonable grounds for his suspicion). Leave was opposed.
	
	
	Mr James sought to enlarge the ground at the hearing of the appeal by contending that it was not open as a matter of law to the Magistrate to make the finding that Detective Burrell suspected on reasonable grounds that the plaintiff had committed the subject offences. Mr James’ submission was based on the proposition, which I reject for the reasons given above, that the plaintiff was not a suspect unless and until the DNA test established that he was John’s identical twin. The submission disregarded the medical evidence, the photographic evidence and John’s assertion, which are to be taken in aggregate.
	
	
	Mr James put the further submission that the evidence was insufficient to support the Magistrate’s finding that Detective Burrell suspected on reasonable grounds that the plaintiff had committed the subject offences. He submitted that sufficiency of evidence was as much a matter of law as a “no evidence” ground. I reject this submission. Whether evidence is sufficient to amount to reasonable grounds is not a question of law: Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156 and Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 356. Parliament has vested the power to make such an assessment in the Local Court. It is not appropriate for leave to be granted to permit this ground to be agitated: Kapral v Bunting at [48] per Howie J.
	
	
	Ground 5 also involves a mixed question of fact and law. Leave was opposed. For the same reasons as apply with respect to ground 4, I am not persuaded that leave ought be granted to permit this ground to be agitated.
	
	
	In any event, in my view it was plainly open to the Magistrate to find both that there were reasonable grounds for Detective Burrell’s suspicion that the plaintiff had committed the subject offences and that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed the offences, since there was evidence before her Honour which was capable of amounting to reasonable grounds.
	


Ground 7: The Magistrate erred in finding that the relevant forensic procedure was justified in all the circumstances pursuant to s 24(4) of the CFP Act


	
	The plaintiff does not complain that her Honour failed to take into account a relevant consideration or took into account an irrelevant consideration in performing the balancing exercise required by s 24(4). The Magistrate’s reasons indicate that her Honour addressed every matter in s 24(4) about which the parties had made submissions. It was not suggested that her Honour had taken into account extraneous matters or failed to apply the wording of s 24(4). Although it was, in oral submissions, suggested by Mr James that it was not open to the Magistrate to find that the forensic procedure was justified (thereby implying that the evaluative judgment, or exercise of discretion, miscarried), it was difficult to follow the basis on which the submission was made (except on the bases already addressed and rejected above). To the extent to which Mr James ought be understood to have submitted that no proper performance of the balancing exercise required by s 24(4) could have resulted in the order for forensic procedure being made, this raises a question of law. If this submission was actually made, I reject it.
	
	
	That leaves an allegation of error which requires leave. I am not persuaded that it is appropriate to grant leave. Her Honour correctly identified the relevant principles and applied s 24(4) in terms. It was pre-eminently a matter of evaluative judgment for her Honour, in respect of which no error has been shown.
	


Ground 2B: The Magistrate erred in law in her approach to the requirements of s 26(3) of the CFP Act


	
	This ground, together with grounds 3 (as to the reasons for the s 26(3) determination) and 6, concern the conditions required to be met under s 26 before a second application pursuant to s 24 can be entertained.
	
	
	Ground 2B raises a question of law. In order to make out this ground, the plaintiff must establish that her Honour misapprehended the statutory wording or misdirected herself as to the applicable principles.
	
	
	Her Honour’s reasons demonstrated an appreciation that the requirements of s 26(3) had to be met before the second application could be entertained. Her Honour referred to the parties’ written submissions and to the two decisions cited (Munro v ACP and ACP v Munro). Her Honour correctly paraphrased the effect of s 26(3) by saying that “the law enables a second application in certain circumstances, and then it is necessary for the magistrate to assess whether the additional information is of such a nature, degree and quality that it justifies the making of a further application”.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that her Honour was in error in failing to take into account “the extent to which the plaintiff had been ‘vexed’ by the prior application” and had excluded from consideration “the surrounding circumstances of the previous application”. In support of this submission the plaintiff relied on the following passage in ACP v Munro at [73] where Button J said at [73]
	


Furthermore, I am not persuaded that considerations of double jeopardy fall for separate consideration under the subsection. The structure of the subsection is that a further application may not be made (let alone granted) unless a particular precondition is made out. That precondition is a satisfaction on the part of the Magistrate that the additional information provided by a prosecutor justifies the making of the application. The word “justifies” connotes a concept of the balancing of competing considerations, in light of the fact that the primary definition given in the Macquarie Dictionary of the word “justify” is “to show (an act, claim, statement, etc) to be just, right, or warranted”. It is true that process should include a consideration of the number of previous applications and their surrounding circumstances, in determining whether the test has been made out. To that extent, I agree that the subsection calls for reflection on the degree to which a defendant has been “vexed”. But nothing in the subsection, or in the judgment of R A Hulme J, calls for an explicit, detailed discussion of the principle compendiously known as double jeopardy. It follows that I reject the primary submission of the defendant.

[Emphasis added.]


	
	His Honour’s remarks were made in circumstances where a number of orders for forensic procedures had been made in respect of ACP. ACP argued that the principle of double jeopardy applied and that another application could not be made for the same forensic procedure that had earlier been the subject of an unsuccessful application. His Honour rejected that argument on the basis that it was inconsistent with the wording of s 26(3). The words highlighted, when read without regard to their context or the facts of that case, could provide an indication that the extent to which the plaintiff had been ‘vexed’ by earlier applications was a mandatory relevant consideration. However, a fair reading of his Honour’s reasons provides no support for any such proposition.
	
	
	The wording of s 26(3) makes it clear that the focus is on whether the “additional information” is such as would warrant the making of the further application. Whether or not the plaintiff has been “vexed” by an earlier application is irrelevant; all that is relevant for the purposes of s 26(3) is that there has been an earlier application, the making of which can be assumed to have interfered with the respondent’s rights, at least to some extent: Orban v Bayliss [2004] NSWSC 428 at [30] per Simpson J. A consideration of the information in support of the earlier application is obviously required, in order to determine, and assess, the information said to be “additional” on any subsequent application.
	
	
	In any event, I note that the Magistrate specifically referred in her reasons to the following and therefore can be taken as having had regard to it (to the extent, if at all, relevant):
	


[The plaintiff] comes without any significant record if any at all, and that he has now had to fact [sic, face] two separate sets of proceedings in relation to the application for a forensic procedure order.


	
	No error in the identification or application of the relevant legal principle has been established. Ground 2B has not been made out.
	


Ground 3: The Magistrate erred in law by failing to provide adequate reasons for her decision (as regards the requirements of s 26(3))


	
	Her Honour identified and addressed the “additional information” that had been provided in support of the second application and which had not been available to Curran LCM when the first application was made. Her Honour found that the additional information comprised: medical evidence to support John’s assertion that the plaintiff was his identical twin brother; the representations made to Blackmore AJ by John’s trial counsel that identity would be a crucial issue in the criminal trial; photographic evidence of the physical appearance of John and the plaintiff at various times; and the RTA evidence which recorded that the plaintiff’s residential address was in the Collaroy area at the time of the alleged offending (whereas the evidence before Curran LCM was limited to the plaintiff’s presence in Australia, as established by Department of Immigration movement records).
	
	
	Her Honour addressed each category of additional information referred to above and assessed its forensic effect. Her Honour noted the contemporaneous medical records which recorded a medical opinion that John and the plaintiff were uniovular (identical) twins. Her Honour examined the photographs and determined that the similarities between John and the plaintiff were consistent with their being identical twins and the dissimilarities as being “not so stark as to exclude the prospect” of their being identical twins. Her Honour referred to the RTA records which placed the plaintiff much closer to the scene of the alleged offending than the information before Curran LCM had done. Her Honour said in the reasons that the additional information that tended to establish that John and the plaintiff were identical twins was a “significant factor”.
	
	
	I regard the Magistrate’s reasons for determining that the additional information was such as to justify a second application as sufficient. Her Honour addressed every category of additional information and compared it with that which was available when the first application was made. As is apparent from the narrative set out in the part of these reasons before the grounds of appeal are specifically addressed, there was significant material located and put before the Local Court in support of the second application which had not been put before Curran LCM, including evidence, such as the photographic evidence, the absence of which had been the subject of comment by Curran LCM in his Honour’s reasons for refusing the first application.
	


Ground 6: The Magistrate erred in finding that there was additional information which justified the making of a second application for the same forensic procedure.


	
	Leave is required to argue this ground. I am not persuaded that it is appropriate to grant leave. Her Honour’s determination of the s 26(3) issue was a matter of evaluative judgment. I regard her Honour’s decision as reasonably open on the evidence and, for the reasons given above in relation to ground 3, carefully and sufficiently reasoned.
	


Costs


	
	The defendant sought an order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the proceedings. I am informed by Ms Davidson that, by reason of the jurisdiction exercised in the present proceeding, the usual processes of costs assessment are not available, since the proceedings in this Court are criminal (as they are treated in the same way as an appeal against sentence). Accordingly, Ms Davidson sought a lump sum costs order and foreshadowed that the defendant proposed to adduce affidavit evidence, if he were successful, as to the amount of any such costs so that a lump sum costs order could be made. Mr James indicated that he was not prepared to deal with such an application without notice and that the appropriate course was that costs be reserved. Ms Davidson accepted that it was appropriate to reserve costs.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons set out above, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Dismiss the amended summons filed on 5 February 2016.
	
	
	Reserve costs.
	
	
	Direct that any party who wishes to apply for costs, provide to my Associate by email written submissions in support of any such application, together with an affidavit (if a lump sum costs order is sought) within seven days hereof.

2769617,Application by Petronella Boege pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 729,"Judgment

Background


	
	Petronella Boege (“the applicant”) makes application for an inquiry into her conviction at Bega Local Court on 5 January 2000 for one offence of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The prosecution case was that, following a dispute over some photo albums in the context of a marital breakdown, the applicant punched her ex-husband several times in the head in the presence of a police officer, Senior Constable van der Hout. The applicant was convicted and fined $500.
	
	
	The applicant appealed against her conviction to the District Court of New South Wales sitting at Bega. On 8 March 2001, Shillington QC DCJ heard that appeal and it was dismissed. The applicant was represented by counsel on the appeal.
	
	
	This application for an inquiry into conviction is brought under section 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“CAR Act”).
	


Previous applications


	
	This is not the first application brought by the applicant in relation to this conviction.
	
	
	On 20 October 2010, the applicant first made application to this Court for an inquiry into her conviction under s 78(1) of the CAR Act. The principle complaints made in that application were that:
	



	
	there were grave inconsistencies in the prosecution evidence, both as between witnesses and as between the different accounts of each witness, such that the applicant should not have been convicted;
	
	
	the prosecution witnesses, namely, the applicant’s former husband Mr Boege and the police officer Senior Constable van der Hout, had colluded and fabricated their evidence; and
	
	
	Shillington QC DCJ had erred in refusing to permit the applicant’s counsel to cross-examine these two witnesses again at the hearing of her appeal.
	



	
	The first application was considered by Adamson J in reasons delivered on 27 March 2012. Her Honour considered the matters raised by the applicant in some detail. Her Honour was of the view that the issues raised in the application had all been fully dealt with in the original proceedings and/or in the District Court appeal and that there were no “special facts or special circumstances” which justified the taking of further action in respect of the application. Her Honour went on to make a finding that the application should be dismissed in any event because it did not raise any doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: Application by Petronella Boege for an inquiry into conviction and sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (Supreme Court (NSW), Adamson J, 27 March 2012, unrep) at [64]-[65].
	
	
	Following the dismissal of that application, the applicant petitioned her Excellency the (then) Governor of New South Wales asking for a review of the conviction pursuant to s 76 of the CAR Act. The petition was declined on 30 January 2013.
	
	
	The applicant then made a second application to this court under s 78(1) of the CAR Act. She relied upon there being new material, not available at the time that Adamson J considered the first application, which justified a further consideration of the matter. The “new material” was transcript of proceedings before Goldring DCJ on 4 December 2000, which was relied upon as proving that there had in fact been an order under what was then s 133 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) requiring the two prosecution witnesses Mr Boege and Senior Constable van der Hout to attend and give evidence at her conviction appeal at the District Court at Bega.
	
	
	Wilson J formed the view that Goldring DCJ had not properly exercised the jurisdiction conferred on him by s 133 of the Justices Act and hence there was no valid order that bound Shillington QC DCJ to require the witnesses to attend. Her Honour noted that, as is the usual practice, the application had been dealt with in chambers on the papers and no submissions had been made by either the applicant or the Attorney-General as to that aspect of the application. In light of this, even though her Honour was of the view that there was no new material before the Court, she decided to consider the application on its merits in any event “to obviate any unfairness to the applicant”: at [62]. In detailed reasons published on 15 December 2015, her Honour concluded that she was not left with any doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt or as to any mitigating circumstances or as to any part of the evidence in the case. That application was also refused: Further application of Petronella Boege pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1925.
	
	
	On 25 January 2016, the applicant filed this third application under s 78(1) of the CAR Act again seeking an inquiry into her conviction.
	
	
	As is the usual practice, submissions have been filed on behalf of the Attorney-General pursuant to s 79(4) of the CAR Act with respect to the application.
	


Relevant legislation


	
	The relevant provisions in Part 7 of the CAR Act are as follows:
	


78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person…

79 Consideration of applications

(1)   After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a)   the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b)   the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2)   Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)   The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)   it appears that the matter:

(i)   has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii)   has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)   has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv)   has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)   the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A) …

(4)   Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5)   The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”

[emphasis added]


	
	It can be seen that this Court may refuse to deal with this application if, inter alia, it has either been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or has previously been dealt with under this Part and if the Court is not satisfied that there are “special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.”
	
	
	The relevant principles to be applied in determining an application pursuant to s 78 were considered by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 commencing at [4]. Those principles were summarised by Wilson J in Further application of Petronella Boege pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1925 (by reference to the relevant paragraphs in the judgment of Johnson J) as follows:
	



	
	The court performs an administrative act in determining such an application (at [5]);
	
	
	Determination of an application under s 78 is not intended to provide an additional avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted (at [9]);
	
	
	The jurisdiction exercised under Division 3 of Part 7 of the CAR Act is an administrative function that may be activated when the criminal justice system has run its course, frequently because additional evidence has come to light which may raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence (at [10]);
	
	
	The powers available under s 79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry, or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, there being no power to quash a conviction or sentence (at [10]); and
	
	
	The nature of the jurisdiction under Part 7 allows for flexibility in the material which may be placed before the court relevant to an application (at [11]).
	



	
	As Spigelman CJ observed in Kirk Group Holdings Pty Limited v Workcover Authority of NSW [2006] NSWCA 172 at [5]; 66 NSWLR 151 at 154, Part 7 of the CAR Act has its origins in a legislative scheme that was an innovation in New South Wales. His Honour went on to observe of the predecessor to Part 7 at [8], “…this is remedial legislation designed to overcome the injustices that sometimes arise in the course of the administration of criminal justice.”
	
	
	Johnson J recently considered the relevant principles governing repeated applications for an inquiry under Part 7 of the CAR Act in Milat, Ivan Robert Marko - Application under Section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 209. His Honour traced the legislative history of the statutory test in s 79(3) of the CAR Act, which was previously contained in     s 474E(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, and observed the following at [20]:
	


“It may be seen that the balance being struck by the provisions then contained in s 474E(3), and now contained in s 79(3), involved an appropriate remedial process for applications for a post-conviction inquiry and the need to guard against ‘the waste of judicial resources that can flow from repeated unmeritorious applications for inquiries.’” [emphasis in original]


	
	Given that there have been repeated applications to this Court for an inquiry into the applicant’s conviction, I must first consider the threshold question posed by s 79(3) of the CAR Act; namely, whether there are any special facts or circumstances that justify the taking of further action in this matter.
	


The application


	
	The applicant has prepared the application herself. It contains significant detail and numerous arguments are advanced therein. Those arguments are conveniently summarised in the submissions filed on behalf of the Attorney-General as follows:
	



	
	The applicant denies that she assaulted her ex-husband.
	
	
	The applicant asserts both that her counsel on appeal did not “put evidence” before the District Court on certain matters and that the Magistrate made a number of errors. Specifically, the applicant contends:
	



	
	that the Magistrate should not have referred to the Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) as if it were a separate matter;
	
	
	that Mr Boege’s police statement differed in certain respects from his evidence in chief on the appeal and from the evidence he gave in the Local Court;
	
	
	that the prosecution witnesses fabricated and changed their evidence;
	
	
	that the Magistrate erred in finding that there was relevant consistency as to the nature of the abuse the applicant was shouting at the time of the alleged assault;
	
	
	that Mr Boege could not have grabbed the photo albums without grabbing her. The applicant contends that rather than being the aggressor she was the victim of an assault by her ex-husband;
	
	
	that the Magistrate erred in finding that Senior Constable van der Hout did not assault her; that the applicant was not a truthful witness; and that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had struck Mr Boege to the head and face a number of times;
	
	
	that Mr Boege had been untruthful in his police statement when he said that none of the applicant’s personal property was in the house on the day of the incident. The applicant then sets out information about items of her personal property that she says Mr Boege had retained and some details of their acrimonious property settlement;
	
	
	that Mr Boege’s evidence in the Local Court was in fact consistent with her own evidence;
	
	
	that, prior to the Local Court hearing, the police officer had informed the applicant’s daughter that the applicant had assaulted the complainant; and
	
	
	that her lawyer failed to put before Shillington QC DCJ the reason her daughter did not give evidence in the Local Court.
	



	
	The applicant asserts that she could not possibly have punched Mr Boege in the manner alleged because she was holding the photo albums in her arms at the material time and because she has problems with the tendons in her arms.
	
	
	The applicant contends that the assault charge was only laid on 10 November 1999 after she “took out” an AVO on 29 October 1999.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Attorney General of NSW


	
	The primary submission of the Attorney General is that the Court should refuse to consider or otherwise deal with this application under section 79(3) of the CAR Act because the issues raised therein have all been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction, on appeal and in the previous applications under this Part and there are no special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. Although the applicant has sought to formulate her submissions differently in the present application, they are not new arguments.
	
	
	The Attorney-General points to the fact that the applicant exercised her right to appeal to the District Court against her conviction in the Local Court. The applicant was represented by counsel on the hearing of that appeal. There is no fresh evidence now raised in this application and nothing that could lead the Court to be satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. The applicant’s assertions about inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and about the sequence of events, including her assertion that Mr Boege attacked her during the incident, were all fully ventilated in both the Local Court and the District Court as well as in the previous applications.
	
	
	The Attorney-General further submits that, in any event, the application raises no doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt or any part of the evidence in the case.
	


Are there special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action?


	
	Having considered the application, the previous reasons provided by Adamson and Wilson JJ and the submissions relied upon by the Attorney General, I am not satisfied that there are any special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of any further action in this matter. I accept the submission on behalf of the Attorney-General that there are no new arguments raised.
	
	
	In addition to petitioning the Governor under s 76 of the CAR Act, the applicant has now made three applications to this Court, all of which effectively turn on the same complaint; namely, that the evidence of Mr Boege and Senior Constable van der Hout should not be accepted. As Wilson J observed in her reasons for refusing the second application at [72]-[74]:
	


“It is common in criminal matters to find differences in the accounts of witnesses as to some features of a contested event; that is a natural consequence of the stressful nature of such events, the relative perspectives of different witnesses and their respective capacity to observe events, and of the imperfection of human memory. Inconsistencies in evidence do not, of themselves, dictate that the evidence of the relevant witnesses should not be accepted.

It is always open to any tribunal of fact to accept part of a witness’ evidence and reject part of the evidence of the same witness. What is important and necessary is for the tribunal of fact to determine whether the evidence going to the elements of the offence is both accurate and reliable, and can be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

Whilst the complainant and the informant officer gave evidence which differed as to the sequence and location of the offence, the evidence was in all material matters consistent.”


	
	Both Adamson and Wilson JJ were of the view that there was a proper basis for this Court to refuse to consider the application, but each went on to find that nothing in the applications raised a doubt or question about the applicant’s guilt, any mitigating circumstances, or any part of the evidence in the case in any event.
	
	
	I note the observation by Johnson J that repeated applications to this court under s 78(1) of the CAR Act should be considered in the context of the waste of judicial resources that can flow from repeated unmeritorious applications for inquiries. The applicant has had the benefit of her application being considered twice already. I do not propose to consider the same material for a third time.
	
	
	For the reasons set out herein I refuse to consider this application.

		16 June 2016",2016-06-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769618,Singh v R [2015] NSWCCA 257,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The applicant has made a release application pursuant to s. 49 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) (“the Act”). A previous application was refused by Wilson J on 5 August 2015.
	
	
	The present application was heard by the Court on 14 October 2015. It was heard de novo: R v Kugor [2015] NSWCCA 14 at [4] per Hoeben CJ at CL. At the conclusion of the hearing the Court concluded that the application should be granted, and that the applicant should be released on the following conditions, namely that:
	



	
	he appear at the Liverpool Local Court on 21 October 2015 and thereafter as may be required;
	
	
	he reside at 7 Phillip Street, Liverpool;
	
	
	he not be absent from 7 Phillip Street, Liverpool between the hours of 8 pm and 6 am;
	
	
	one acceptable person, namely Ravenna Singh, deposit the sum of $2,000.00 and agree to forfeit that amount in the event that the applicant fails to appear in accordance with his bail undertaking;
	
	
	he present himself at the front door of 7 Phillip Street Liverpool upon being directed to do so by any police officer to confirm compliance with his curfew, such direction to only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so, having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy;
	
	
	he not approach directly or indirectly, except through his legal advisers, Rayane Gobindram or any other person whom he is notified will be called in the proceedings against him;
	
	
	he surrender his passport to the officer in charge of the investigation prior to entering bail; and
	
	
	he not apply for any new passport or travel document.
	



	
	At the time of making the orders in [2] above the Court indicated that its reasons would be published in due course. Those reasons now follow.
	


THE CHARGES AGAINST THE APPLICANT


	
	On 5 February 2015 the applicant was arrested and charged with an offence of aggravated robbery, contrary to s. 95(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence was alleged to have been committed on 4 February 2015. It carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a period of 20 years. However, as further outlined below, the Court was informed at the hearing of the application that the charge contrary to s. 95(1) had been withdrawn and replaced by a series of other charges.
	
	
	At the time of his arrest, the applicant was at liberty on bail for an offence of supply a prohibited drug for which he had been arrested on 20 December 2014. Accordingly, in light of s. 16(1)(h)(i) of the Act, the applicant must show cause why his detention is not justified.
	


THE FACTS


	
	Rayane Gobindram (“the victim”) and the accused both attended the same high school between 2011 and 2012. During that time they became friends although after the victim left school they had no further contact.
	
	
	In December 2014 the victim and the applicant again came into contact through mutual friends. At about 1:00pm on 1 February 2015, the victim received a phone call from the applicant who said to him:
	


“Give me one hundred bucks or I’ll bash you”.


	
	The victim replied:
	


“Give me a reason first and I’ll give you anything you want.”


	
	The applicant then ended the call.
	
	
	At about 4:50pm on the same day, the victim received a private message from the applicant on “Facebook”, again asking for money. The victim agreed to meet the applicant at a designated location at 6:20pm that evening. However, the victim had no intention of meeting with the applicant and only wanted him to stop asking him for money.
	
	
	At about 11:00pm on 1 February 2015 the victim was at home when he heard the applicant’s voice. He looked out his window and saw the applicant, in the company of an unknown male, standing outside. The victim heard the applicant talking, following which the applicant and the unknown male started knocking on doors of premises within the housing complex in which the victim lived, asking for the victim. The victim turned off the lights inside his premises and closed the blinds. After a period of time the applicant and the other male left the location.
	
	
	Between about 10:00am and 11:00am on 2 February 2015, the victim was at the Liverpool Library located on George Street at Liverpool, in the company of a friend, Erika Octavia (“Octavia”). The victim received a phone call and upon answering it realised that the applicant was on the phone. He terminated the call. A short time later the victim’s phone rang again, on this occasion displaying the identity of the caller as “Yasser”. The victim and Yasser were not friends but they had mutual friends. In the past, Yasser had called the victim’s mobile phone to speak with these friends. The victim did not answer the call. Several more calls were made by Yasser to the victim’s phone, none of which were answered.
	
	
	Yasser then called Octavia’s mobile phone. Upon answering the call, Yasser told Octavia:
	


“Tell Rayane he better bring the hundred dollars to Maccas on Elisabeth Drive by tonight otherwise Brendon will show me where he lives and I’ll put a bullet in his head”.


	
	The victim and Octavia remained at the Liverpool Library all day. As they were sitting out the front of the library at about 6:00pm, the applicant walked up to the victim and they had a discussion about money. The victim then told the applicant that he would go and get him the one hundred dollars for which he had asked.
	
	
	A short time later the applicant saw the victim walking with Octavia in Liverpool. The applicant said to the victim:
	


“I thought you were going home to grab the money”.


	
	The victim replied:
	


“I’m going soon”.


	
	The applicant said:
	


“I’m coming with you cause I’m sick of you playing games with me”.


	
	The victim, the applicant and Octavia then walked to Octavia’s house near Liverpool Railway Station. As the victim and the applicant were leaving that area to walk to the victim’s house, a motor vehicle began to follow them. The victim saw that Yasser was seated in the front passenger seat of that vehicle, along with two other males who were not known to the victim.
	
	
	The victim and the applicant then arrived at the victim’s house. The vehicle stopped outside and the applicant remained with it. The victim walked inside his house and called his mother. He told her that the applicant was asking him for one hundred dollars or he would bash him. While the victim was on the phone to his mother he could see the applicant talking to the males in the vehicle. The victim saw a “flash” at the vehicle, following which he terminated the call with his mother and walked outside. The applicant showed him a picture on his phone of a quantity of guns and knives contained in a black bag which resembled a laptop case. One of the guns looked like a hand gun, the other an M16. The applicant said to the victim:
	


“If I don’t get my money tonight one of the bullets is going through your head”.


	
	Whilst the applicant and the victim were still outside the victim’s premises, the police attended. Police spoke with the victim but he told them that there was no problem. On the Crown case, the victim said this because the police had spoken to him in close proximity to the applicant, as a consequence of which the victim feared saying anything to the police. Police then spoke with the applicant and obtained his details before telling him to leave the area.
	
	
	At about 3:00pm on 3 February 2015 the victim’s mother received a phone call on her mobile phone from a number recognised by the victim as that of the applicant. The victim told his mother to terminate the call and block the number.
	
	
	At about 1:45am on 4 February 2015 the victim was sitting outside Liverpool Library with Octavia and two other persons, Shelam and Waleed. Octavia received a call and about 30 minutes later the applicant arrived at the library. The applicant said to the victim:
	


“Rayane, come with me, I need to talk to you, but come by yourself.”


	
	The victim and the applicant walked to the car park which was located at the rear of the library. As the elevator was turned off, the victim and the applicant walked up the stairs to level 6 to find Yasser and another male standing at the top of the stairs. The other male had been at the victim’s house on the previous Sunday evening in the company of the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant opened the door and called out “oi”. A male voice said:
	


“Wait I’m on the phone.”


	
	The applicant then began to punch the victim a number of times using both fists all over his body. The applicant also kicked the victim to his left knee. The victim put his head down to protect himself before sitting down. At that point the applicant said:
	


“I’ve done this because you haven’t given me my hundred dollars.”


	
	The victim said:
	


“I wouldn’t give it to you no matter what cause you have no reason for it.”


	
	The applicant then leant down and grabbed the victim’s mobile phone from his right pocket, at which time the victim said:
	


“Alright you can have my phone, don’t ever touch me again. Just give me my Sim card.”


	
	The applicant then handed the victim his phone. The victim removed the Sim card and then threw the phone at the applicant. The applicant then left by walking down the stairs with Yasser, whilst the victim remained sitting in the stairwell. At about 3:45am the victim’s friends, Octavia, Shelam and Waleed, walked up the stairs and saw him. The victim told them what had happened before he was driven home.
	
	
	At about 4:30pm that day the victim attended Liverpool Police Station and provided the police with a statement. In that statement he told the police that he did not know why the applicant was asking him for money.
	
	
	At about 10:20am on 5 February 2015, the victim received a message from the applicant via Facebook. That message said:
	


“Meet me at Bigge Park, you got the $100?”

The victim responded:

“Yes”.

The applicant said:

“I am leaving my house now.”

The victim responded:

“Okay and bring my phone with you.”

The applicant said:

“I will see you soon.”


	
	At 11:29am the applicant sent a message to the victim saying:
	


“Where are you, I’m at the library”.


	
	The victim contacted police and told them that the applicant had contacted him and was at Liverpool Library wanting money for his phone. Police attended Liverpool Library a short time later and identified the applicant who was with another male. At that point the applicant was arrested and taken into custody. Police questioned the applicant about the victim’s phone and the applicant told police that it was with his friend. Police spoke with the friend who gave them the phone.
	
	
	The applicant declined the opportunity to participate in a recorded interview.
	


THE DECISION OF THE PRIMARY JUDGE


	
	The primary judge dealt with the applicant’s release application on 5 August 2015 and in an ex tempore judgment she refused the application.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that a difficulty faced by the applicant arose from the fact that the alleged offending on 4 February 2015 occurred whilst he was subject to bail for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. Her Honour concluded (inter alia) that it was likely that the conditions of bail which had been proposed to her could “adequately ameliorate the risks presented by the applicant being at liberty”. However, concluded that the evidence was insufficient to discharge the onus placed upon the applicant by s. 16A of the Act.
	


EVIDENCE BEFORE THIS COURT


	
	Filed in support of the application was an affidavit of Ravenna Singh, the applicant’s mother, affirmed on 9 October 2015. That affidavit established that the applicant is one of three children who, prior to his arrest, resided with his family. Mrs Singh expressed her support for the applicant, along with her willingness, and that of other members of her family, to support and supervise him if he were granted bail. She also confirmed that there was a surety of $2,000.00 in cash which is available to be deposited.
	


THE REVISED CHARGES


	
	At the commencement of the hearing of the present application, the Court was informed that the charge of aggravated robbery had been withdrawn by the Crown and replaced by the following charges:
	



	
	demand money (Crimes Act 1900 s. 99);
	
	
	steal from person Crimes Act 1900 s. 94);;
	
	
	intimidation (Crimes Act 1900 s. 545B); and
	
	
	common assault (Crimes Act 1900 s. 61).
	



	
	The Crown indicated that it was proposed that all matters be dealt with summarily in the Local Court. The parties agreed that the maximum penalty which could be imposed by a Magistrate in respect of each charge was imprisonment for a period of 2 years.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions on behalf of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the Crown’s decision to alter the charges against the applicant was a significant one, particularly in terms of the likely penalty. In this regard, counsel emphasised that the maximum penalty for the charge which was originally laid against the applicant was imprisonment for 20 years, and that the maximum penalty available to a Magistrate in respect of the substituted charges was only 2 years.
	
	
	Counsel accepted that the applicant was required to show cause under s. 16A. However, counsel emphasised that this onus had been imposed upon the applicant as a consequence of the fact that, at the time of the commission of the alleged offences, the applicant had been at liberty on bail for an alleged supply of 0.8g of cannabis leaf. In support of a submission that such onus had been discharged, counsel relied upon:
	



	
	the applicant’s age;
	
	
	his lack of criminal antecedents;
	
	
	his ties to the community; and
	
	
	his strong family support.
	



	
	Counsel further submitted that the likelihood of a substantial custodial sentence being imposed had been significantly reduced as a consequence of the substituted charges. Whilst counsel conceded that the delay in bringing the matter to finalisation would now be less than what would have been the case had the original charge proceeded, it was submitted that on present indications the charges would not be finalised in the Local Court until sometime in February 2016 at the earliest, resulting in the applicant having to remain in custody for a significant period of time.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant conceded that the prosecution case appeared “reasonably strong” but submitted that the prospect of a conviction would necessarily depend, at least in part, upon an assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence given by the alleged victim. In this regard, counsel pointed to the fact that:
	



	
	when the victim was spoken to by police on 2 February 2015 he indicated that there was no issue between himself and the applicant;
	
	
	in circumstances where, on the Crown case, the offending occurred between 2:50am and 3:00am on 4 February 2015, the alleged victim did not report the matter to the police until 4:30pm on that day which was more than 13 hours later;
	
	
	the Crown case disclosed no evidence regarding actual bodily harm occasioned, in circumstances where the victim alleges that he was punched with both fists all over his body and kicked to the knee; and
	
	
	there was a possible defence, to at least one of the charges, of a claim of right.
	



	
	Counsel for the applicant also made lengthy submissions in terms of assessing any bail concerns. In this regard, counsel for the applicant pointed to:
	



	
	the available family support and surety;
	
	
	the absence of any prior convictions;
	
	
	the absence of any history of violence;
	
	
	the absence of any history of non-compliance with orders of a court;
	
	
	the absence of any evidence of criminal associations;
	
	
	the necessity for the applicant to be free to prepare his case; and
	
	
	the bail conditions that could reasonably be imposed to address any bail concerns.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	In written submissions, the Crown opposed the application. In doing so, the Crown pointed firstly to the fact that the applicant was facing a serious charge carrying a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. It was submitted that in the event of being found guilty of that charge, a custodial sentence would inevitably follow, giving rise to a real risk of flight. The Crown also submitted that the case was a strong one and that there was available corroboration of the evidence of the victim. The Crown also submitted that there were real concerns for the safety of the victim.
	
	
	In oral submissions, and in light of the fact that the original charge had been withdrawn, the Crown accepted that the nature of the circumstances surrounding the application had “substantially changed”, such that “perhaps it (was) the case that the applicant’s case (had) been strengthened. Whilst the Crown made it clear that his instructions did not extend to consenting to the applicant being released, he submitted that in the event that the Court was amenable to granting the application, there were a number of conditions which should be imposed, directed towards (inter alia) ensuring that the applicant did not contact or approach the victim, requiring him to report daily to police and requiring him to conform with a daily curfew.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	Where an applicant for release is required to show cause under s. 16A of the Act, the Court must apply a two stage test. The first is to determine whether or not the accused person has shown cause “why his or her detention is not justified” (s 16A(1)). The second, which arises if cause is shown, is to assess whether or not the person’s release raises any bail concerns (s. 16A(2); s. 17(1)): and, if so, determine whether there is an unacceptable risk of those concerns materialising (s19). A bail concern is a concern that the person will fail to appear, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or interfere with witnesses or evidence (s. 17(2) and s. 19(2)). In relation to the first stage, the justification or otherwise for a person’s detention is to be determined by a consideration of all the circumstances. The unacceptable risk test requires that consideration only be given to the factors in s. 18 of the Act: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tony Mawad [2015] NSWCCA 227 per Beech-Jones J commencing at [12] (Gleeson JA and Adams J agreeing), citing Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83.
	
	
	In the present case, as the Crown properly conceded, the decision to withdraw the original charge of robbery and replace it with the charges previously outlined represents a substantial change in the circumstances surrounding the application, and serves to strengthen the applicant’s position in respect of the onus to show cause under s. 16A. Even allowing for the possibility of partial accumulation of any sentences imposed, the maximum penalty available to a Magistrate dealing with the charges summarily is obviously substantially less than that which would have been available had the original charge of robbery proceeded on indictment.
	
	
	The applicant is only 19 years of age. He has no prior convictions and finds himself in custody for the first time. He enjoys close family support. Further, although the delay in the substituted charges being finalised is likely to be less than what would have been the case had the original charge proceeded to trial, it remains the position, on the indications given to the Court in the course of the hearing, that the matters are unlikely to be finalised until February 2016 at the earliest. This would mean that the applicant would have spent 1 year in custody awaiting a hearing, in circumstances where the maximum available penalty for any one charge is 2 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Taking all of these matters into account, the Court is satisfied that the applicant has shown cause under s. 16A of the Act.
	
	
	The proposed release of the applicant does give rise to some bail concerns. Principal amongst them is a concern for the safety of the victim and other Crown witnesses. However, the Court considers that such concerns can be appropriately addressed by the imposition of a series of conditions, compliance with which will ensure (inter alia) that the applicant resides with his parents, is subject to a curfew (compliance with which can be monitored by police) and reports regularly to police.
	


ORDERS


	
	For these reasons the Court made the following orders on 14 October 2015:
	



	
	The application for release is granted.
	
	
	The applicant is to be released on the conditions set out in [2] above.

		08 June 2016",2016-06-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769625,AC v R [2016] NSWCCA 107,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Schmidt J. I agree with her Honour’s conclusions and with her reasons.
	
	
	SCHMDIT J: The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of persistent sexual abuse of a 12 year old girl, contrary to s 66EA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). On 6 March 2015, after a 25% discount for his early plea, Sweeney DCJ sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 10 years, commencing 6 February 2014 and expiring 5 February 2024. His 7 year, 6 month non-parole period expires on 5 August 2021.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal that sentence on three grounds. For the reasons which follow, I consider that while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal must be dismissed.
	


The s 66EA offence


	
	Section 66EA provides:
	


“66EA Persistent sexual abuse of a child

(1)    A person who, on 3 or more separate occasions occurring on separate days during any period, engages in conduct in relation to a particular child that constitutes a sexual offence is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.

(2)    It is immaterial whether or not the conduct is of the same nature, or constitutes the same offence, on each occasion.

(3)    It is immaterial that the conduct on any of those occasions occurred outside New South Wales, so long as the conduct on at least one of those occasions occurred in New South Wales.

(4)    In proceedings for an offence against this section, it is not necessary to specify or to prove the dates or exact circumstances of the alleged occasions on which the conduct constituting the offence occurred.

(5)    A charge of an offence against this section:

(a)    must specify with reasonable particularity the period during which the offence against this section occurred, and

(b)    must describe the nature of the separate offences alleged to have been committed by the accused during that period.

(6)    In order for the accused to be convicted of an offence against this section:

(a)    the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence establishes at least 3 separate occasions, occurring on separate days during the period concerned, on which the accused engaged in conduct constituting a sexual offence in relation to a particular child of a nature described in the charge, and

(b)    the jury must be so satisfied about the material facts of the 3 such occasions, although the jury need not be so satisfied about the dates or the order of those occasions, and

(c)    if more than 3 such occasions are relied on as evidence of the commission of an offence against this section, all the members of the jury must be so satisfied about the same 3 occasions, and

(d)    the jury must be satisfied that the 3 such occasions relied on as evidence of the commission of an offence against this section occurred after the commencement of this section.

(7)    In proceedings for an offence against this section, the judge must inform the jury of the requirements of subsection (6).

(8)    A person who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence against this section may not be convicted of a sexual offence in relation to the same child that is alleged to have been committed in the period during which the accused was alleged to have committed an offence against this section. This subsection does not prevent an alternative verdict under subsection (10).

(9)    A person who has been convicted or acquitted of a sexual offence may not be convicted of an offence against this section in relation to the same child if any of the occasions relied on as evidence of the commission of the offence against this section includes the occasion of that sexual offence.

(10)   If on the trial of a person charged with an offence against this section the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven but is satisfied that the person has, in respect of any of the occasions relied on as evidence of the commission of the offence against this section, committed a sexual offence, the jury may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of that sexual offence. The person is liable to punishment accordingly.

(11)   Proceedings for an offence against this section may only be instituted by or with the approval of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

(12)   In this section:

child means a person under the age of 18 years.

sexual offence means any of the following:

(a)   an offence under section 61I, 61J, 61JA, 61K, 61L, 61M, 61N, 61O, 66A, 66B, 66C, 66D, 66F, 73, 74, 78H, 78I, 78K, 78L, 78N, 78O, 78Q or 80A,

(b)    an offence of attempting to commit an offence referred to in paragraph (a),

(c)    an offence under the law of a place outside New South Wales that would, if it had been committed in New South Wales, be an offence referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).


	
	In Langbein v R [2008] NSWCCA 38; (2008) 181 A Crim R 378 it was observed at [115] that “[t]he offence of persistent sexual abuse contrary to s 66EA carries a maximum prison term of 25 years. It is a more serious offence than the offences which comprise the individual acts.” In sentencing an offender for such an offence, the foundational offences must be established beyond reasonable doubt (see ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [230]). In this case they were established by the agreed facts.
	
	
	The particulars of the offence to which the applicant entered his plea were:
	


“Between 11 January 2014 and 5 February 2014 at Raymond Terrace and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, did on at least three separate occasions and on at least three separate days engaged in conduct in relation to a particular child, namely [MG] that constituted a sexual offence, namely, had sexual intercourse with [MG] a person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 12 years.”

The sentencing judge’s obligations


	
	In sentencing the applicant her Honour had to take into account the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), namely:
	


“(a)   to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)   to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)   to protect the community from the offender,

(d)   to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)   to denounce the conduct of the offender,”


	
	Her Honour also had to take into account the maximum penalty fixed for the offence; the applicant’s plea of guilty; the objective seriousness of the offence, as revealed by the evidence; the applicant’s moral culpability for his offending; the specified aggravating and mitigating matters provided in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act revealed by the evidence; as well as the applicant’s subjective circumstances. Those matters all had to be taken into account when the sentence was determined by her Honour undertaking the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [37] – [39].
	
	
	Her Honour also had to determine the amount of the discount which the applicant should receive for his plea, to a maximum of 25% (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1). In arriving at that discount her Honour had to bear in mind that in some cases, even an early plea may not result in a discount, where the offence in question is so serious that no discount should be given (see Thomson at [158]). Her Honour also had to ensure that the sentence finally imposed after discount, was not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the applicant’s offence (see s 22(1A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).
	
	
	In this case, these considerations necessitated that a heavy sentence be imposed on the applicant for his serious offence.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The three grounds on which the applicant sought leave to appeal his sentence were:
	


“1.   Her Honour failed to give weight to the “victim impact statement” prepared by the complainant, MG;

2.   Her Honour failed to take into account the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, and the question of the likelihood of his re-offending, as required by s 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; and

3.   Her Honour erred in failing to consider whether to make a finding of special circumstances.”

The evidence as to the offence


	
	The agreed statement of facts included extracts from an ERISP which the applicant gave on his arrest, parts of which were also tendered by the Crown. A statement made by the victim, entitled “victim impact statement” was also tendered, as were statements made by Imam Abdelalim and Imam Khamis, who had both advised the applicant. They were not required for cross-examination. In the defence case transcripts of the victim’s interviews by police were tendered, as were two psychologists’ reports and two references from persons who had come to know the applicant at Villawood Detention Centre.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence, nor was evidence called from the victim’s father, or the Sheikh who performed the ceremony by which the applicant understood that he and the victim had become husband and wife. It was not in issue that the ceremony is not one recognised under Australian law; that the victim was not legally entitled to marry; nor that she could not legally give her consent to the sexual intercourse which the applicant had with her following that ceremony.
	
	
	The applicant was 26 years old when he committed this offence and the victim only 12 years. She was 13 years when she made her “victim impact statement”. The applicant was living in Australia on a student visa, having arrived in June 2013 to study at the University of Newcastle. He was living at Chester Hill in Sydney with his brother and travelling back and forth to Newcastle. He told Dr Rastogi that on arrival he had undertaken a course in English and that he had proposed to pursue a tertiary degree in megatronics.
	
	
	The victim lived at home with her father and siblings when she met the applicant. They were practising Muslims, attending the Wallsend mosque. Her parents were separated.
	
	
	The applicant attended that mosque, where he first saw the victim in November 2013. They did not speak, but he approached Imam Abdelalim and told him that he wanted to marry the victim. On the Imam’s statement, the applicant said that he wanted to have a stable life and family, but was having difficulty finding a match, because he had no work. He asked for the Imam’s help.
	
	
	On accounts he has given, the applicant initially thought that the victim was 17 years old, but soon learned that she was only 12. Imam Abdelalim knew the victim, who attended a class which he taught at the mosque. The applicant asked Imam Abdelalim to arrange for him to speak to her. The Imam refused, on his unchallenged statement, telling the applicant that he was not allowed and that they could find him a more suitable wife in the Lebanese community. The Imam was not approached by the victim’s father about the applicant’s proposed marriage to his daughter.
	
	
	Imam Khamis also knew both the applicant and the victim’s father. He was aware of the father’s concerns about the victim going to high school. The applicant also approached Imam Khamis about marrying the victim in late 2013. Imam Khamis’ unchallenged statement was that he told the applicant even more directly, “this is not allowed. This is illegal. It is against the law”. After this advice the applicant left the mosque, but spoke to the Imam again by telephone about a week later, when he told the Imam: “I want to marry her.” The Imam told him again: “It is not allowed, it is better to look for one which is fit for you.” The applicant did not speak to the Imam again and the victim’s father also did not approach him about the applicant’s desire to marry the victim.
	
	
	In his police interview the applicant confirmed that the Imams had told him the victim’s age; that marrying the victim was illegal here; and that he would get into trouble if he married her.
	
	
	Still the applicant had a friend approach the victim’s father to ask if he could marry the victim. They met at a prayer place at Heatherbrae, where the father told him that the victim was not interested in marrying him. At this time the victim did not know the applicant.
	
	
	Despite this advice, the applicant then began attending the Wallsend mosque, in order to meet the victim’s father. He then asked to meet the victim. Her father first permitted him to meet the victim at the end of November, in his company. Afterwards the victim told her father that she did not wish to marry the applicant, as he was too old. Despite this, her father gave the applicant her phone number.
	
	
	The applicant then pursued contact with the victim. She did not respond to the 26 text messages which he sent her on the evening of 27 November 2013, or to the 25 messages which he sent on 29 November, or the message which he sent her on 8 December.
	
	
	Some time later the applicant met the victim’s father at another mosque at Rooty Hill, where he had been invited to a meeting with the applicant. The father again told the applicant that his daughter did not wish to marry him. The applicant insisted that if she got to know him, she would.
	
	
	The applicant then sent further text messages to the victim on 28 and 29 December. On the 29th the victim replied. They then exchanged over 200 messages a day until 11 January 2014. On 12 January, with her father’s approval, she invited the applicant to her home and he gave her a $100 as a gift. The applicant and the victim’s father again discussed marriage.
	
	
	Her father then telephoned her mother and told her that the victim wished to marry the applicant and that he wanted her to meet him. Understandably, the victim’s mother did not agree with the victim marrying, but her father said that: “it was OK under Muslim law”. Still the victim’s mother disagreed and the call ended. Shortly afterwards she called the victim and told her that she did not agree to the marriage. The victim then said: “If you say I can’t do it then I can’t do it”, but her father took the phone and told her mother: “Next time you see your daughter she is going to be married” and words to the effect that he could not look after the victim forever. After that call concluded, he told the applicant and the victim that they were to be married that day.
	
	
	The applicant then made arrangements with a friend to meet Sheikh Tasawar at Mayfield mosque, because he knew that the Imams at the Wallsend mosque which the victim and her family attended, would not assist, they having previously told him that it was illegal for him to marry the victim.
	
	
	After meeting the Sheikh for a few minutes, the applicant and his friend returned to the victim’s home. There is no evidence as to what the applicant told the Sheikh about the victim, or her age. It is agreed, however, that at the victim’s home a ceremony took place in Arabic and that the applicant and the victim were then “married under an Islamic ceremony”.
	
	
	There is, however, no evidence that this ceremony was one recognised under Sharia law, as it is agreed that the applicant believes. Such a claimed belief alone cannot establish what Sharia law might provide, particularly given the agreed fact that the advice which the applicant had received from the two Imams from whom he had sought advice, who both knew the victim and her age, was that it was illegal for him to marry her.
	
	
	It is also relevant that the applicant told police that apart from the two witnesses present at the ceremony, no members of the Islamic community had attended. He later told Dr Rastogi that as the result of his offending, he had been ostracised by his community. That is also not consistent with his professed belief as to the rightness of his conduct under the faith which he shares with that community.
	
	
	After the ceremony the victim’s father told the applicant that he would take care of giving the Sheikh money. He also gave the victim $500 as a wedding gift. Later her father told her not to use any birth control pills or condoms and not to let the applicant use any kind of contraception. The applicant then drove the victim to a motel at Newcastle, which was paid for using money the victim’s father had given her.
	
	
	The first to fifth acts involved in the applicant’s offence took place that day at the motel. Over the following days the applicant and the victim stayed at a number of different motels in Sydney, having sexual intercourse three to five times a day. On the weekend they stayed with the victim’s father. The sixth and seventh acts of sexual offending took place on the weekend of 17-19 January, at the home of the victim’s father, to his knowledge. The following week the applicant and the victim again stayed at different motels in Sydney, continuing to have sexual intercourse at least twice a day.
	
	
	On the weekend of 24 - 26 January they returned to the victim’s father’s home, where he had built a queen sized bed for them to share in her old bedroom. On 28 January they moved to a rented house at Guildford West, where they had sexual intercourse. On 4 February, the eighth act of sexual offending took place.
	
	
	On 5 February the applicant attempted to enrol the victim in year 7 at Auburn Girls High School. Consistent with the advice the Imams had given him, he did not disclose the nature of his relationship with her, but told the Vice Principal that her parents were in Newcastle and he was looking after her. He was told that he needed to be registered as her guardian before she could be enrolled, and was directed to Centrelink or Family and Community Services.
	
	
	The applicant and the victim then went to Centrelink, where the applicant enquired about guardianship and claiming benefits for the victim. When asked about the nature of their relationship, he said that they were boyfriend/girlfriend and living together. He was advised that because the victim was under 16, he would need to speak to Family and Community Services. That afternoon the victim spoke to a caseworker by phone, explaining that she was living with her 26 year old boyfriend, that she wanted to enrol in an Islamic girls school, how she had met him and that her parents accepted their relationship. An appointment was made for the next day. When they attended police were notified.
	
	
	During police interviews, the victim said amongst other things that she understood that under Islamic or Sharia law she could get married at puberty; that her father had allowed her to marry immediately on learning that this was the law; that she knew the Sheikh from the Mayfield mosque because the applicant had gone to get him to marry them; that he had gone there because the Wallsend mosque would not help him; that he had paid the Sheikh for marrying them; and that they had had intercourse repeatedly, at times that she described.
	
	
	Police then spoke to the victim’s father, who confirmed his knowledge that she had married the applicant and was living with him. The applicant was then arrested.
	
	
	During his interview the applicant made numerous admissions, that is, representations contrary to his interests. They included admissions as to his repeated sexual intercourse with the victim and that he had married her. He also said that “it was the Islamic way” to marry, once a girl was bleeding, if she wanted; that they had married under Islamic law, but not Australian law, under which they were just boyfriend and girlfriend; that he was aware that she was only 12 when he had married her, but that he had not heard of the legal age of consent until that day; that he did not consider his relationship to be criminal, but holy; that it was not a crime; that it was common to give birth at, 10, 12 or 13; that birth was “nothing”; that they had had sex, after the victim had said yes and was his wife; that he did not agree that this was a crime in New South Wales; that there was no problem, because they were happy; that he had the permission of her dad; that there was thus nothing wrong with having sex with the victim, because she was his wife; that he did not agree that it was a crime because he was a Muslim and could marry her once she had her period.
	
	
	In June 2014 the applicant told Dr Rastogi that he had been raised in a very strict religious environment, with strong enforced values and practices; that in Islamic law, it was allowed to get married to girls once they attained puberty; he grew up in that environment; his sister had married at 16; that was acceptable in Lebanon; that when he married the 12 year old victim, he perceived that he was doing the right thing; and “I never thought this was wrong, I grew up in such an environment where marrying a minor was normal tradition and common occurrence as per the religion”.
	
	
	What he told Dr Rastogi was undoubtedly untrue, given the unchallenged evidence of both Imam Abdelalim and Imam Khamis and the agreed facts.
	
	
	The applicant also gave a false account to Ms De Santa Brigida. He told her that the Sheiks who he approached at the mosque that the victim attended were not of assistance, because they did not really know him; they thought he might be seeking marriage only as a means of securing residence in Australia; and that he could not marry because he did not have citizenship in Australia. He did disclose to her that he found out the victim’s age, after he first approached her father and heard her say “he is too big for me”, but, he said, marriage at that age in his faith in Lebanon was a very common practice and that young females are considered to be of marriageable age, once they have reached puberty. He also claimed not to know that what he had done constituted a criminal offence in Australia.
	
	
	The applicant also led no evidence on sentence to establish that the law in Lebanon permitted the common practice of 12 year old girls marrying, which he claimed there exists.
	


Ground 1 – the victim impact statement


	
	The victim was the “primary victim” of the applicant’s offence, as that term is defined in s 26 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. A “victim impact statement” is there defined to mean:
	


“… a statement containing particulars of:

“(a)    in the case of a primary victim, any personal harm suffered by the victim as a direct result of the offence,

…”


	
	The Crown tendered an unsigned and undated document from the victim entitled “victim impact statement”. It did not disclose that she had suffered any harm. There she said that “the law is only tring(sic) to do its best to protect me but what are u protecting me from?” She also said that she was being caused harm, because she was not “protected from the motions that go through my body and I’m not protected from the tears that burn my face and eyes each and every night”. The victim also asked for her husband back so that she could “have the happy life I deserve”. She expressed the opinion that “one happily married couple and their families do not deserve to go through the stress and pain just for an act of crime that didn’t hurt any body in anyway”.
	
	
	By its terms it is apparent that this document is not a victim impact statement as defined. It does not identify the personal harm which the victim has, in fact, already suffered as the result of the applicant’s offending. It could not be assumed that there had been no such harm and on the evidence, the harm which had already been caused included an ectopic pregnancy and it must be inferred, a miscarriage.
	
	
	In the result, this statement was not one that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account under s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as a victim impact statement, even if her Honour had considered it appropriate to do so. Section 30(3) provides that a “court may receive and consider a victim impact statement only if it is given in accordance with and complies with the requirements prescribed by or under this Division”.
	
	
	Sweeney DCJ took the view that:
	


“That the child’s father gave permission for the Moslem marriage does not excuse or mitigate [the applicant’s] offence.

   Nor does the attitude of the child. The Crown and [the applicant] disagreed about the significance of a victim impact statement prepared by the child. The Crown tendered the victim impact statement in accordance with s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which states that “a court may receive and consider a victim impact statement” but the Crown did not rely on the contents of the statement, in which the victim said she misses her husband and is unhappy about his having been taken from her.

   The Crown submitted that the view of the victim is not relevant to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. [The applicant’s] counsel submitted that that principle of law has been superseded by s 30A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which permits a victim to read out her victim impact statement in court.

   I do not read the procedural terms of s 30A as having changed or eroded the often expressed principle that the attitude of the victim cannot reflect the proper sentence for an offender.

In R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 Howie J said:

“The attitude of the victim cannot be allowed to interfere with a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. Sentencing proceedings are not a private matter between the victim and the offender.

A serious crime is a wrong committed against the community at large and the community is itself entitled to retribution.”

In R v Kershaw [2005] NSWCCA 56 Bryson J said:

“The sentencing process is not, and of course should not be, in the hands of complainants, and the merciful or relenting attitude of a complainant does not reduce the gravity of the offence and does not have much effect on the interests of justice in imposing an appropriate sentence.”

   Whether the victim is intelligent, articulate or sophisticated is difficult to discern from the transcript of her interviews and the short snippet of the recorded interview which the Crown played in court. If she is, it does not assist [the applicant] by mitigating his offence. She may be intelligent and articulate for a 12 or 13 year old girl, but she was still a 12 year old girl. Some of her answers may display a precocious attitude to what she has been taught about her faith. That she has the cultural or religious beliefs that she expressed in her interview, that girls can be married at puberty, does not excuse or mitigate the offender’s conduct towards her.”


	
	On appeal the applicant accepted that the statement was not “strictly speaking” a victim impact statement under the Act, but argued that given the sentencing judge’s obligation under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to take into account the aggravating and mitigating matters there specified, which were revealed by the evidence, that the victim’s statement had to be considered in accordance with s 21A(3)(a), which provides:
	


“The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

(a)    the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial”


	
	Both at trial and on appeal what the victim had told police in her interviews was relied on for the applicant to support the submission that despite then being aged only 12 years, she did have a level of maturity and that it could not simply be inferred from her age that she was “immature and therefore she cannot be in a position to understand the consequences of her actions”. In the result the statement she had provided for sentence in which she said that she was suffering harm as the result of the applicant’s incarceration could be accepted as relevant and taken into account by way of mitigation.
	
	
	It is correct that on sentencing evidence may be called from a victim as to the matters specified in s 21A(1)(3)(a). Whether or not such evidence will be accepted and if it is, what weight it should be given, is a matter for a sentencing judge to determine. In R v Newman; R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; (2004) 145 A Crim R 361 it was observed at [82] - [83]:
	


“82    Although victims of crimes are entitled to make a statement to the court as to the effect of the crime for which sentence is being passed upon them, they are not entitled to express their views as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the matters to be taken into account by the sentencing judge, or, their personal opinions of the offender. See R v Walsh and Sharp [2004] NSWSC 111 and s 28(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

83    This is not to suggest that there may be the comparatively rare cases where forgiveness of the accused by the victim may be a relevant fact. Most cases, where this issue has been considered, have been in the context of domestic violence.”


	
	In this case, it must not be overlooked that the statement relied on came from a child who has been the victim of extraordinary abuse.. His actions were unarguably not only contrary to her healthy development during childhood, but they exposed her to considerable risk of both physical and psychological injury. Such physical risks have in fact already materialised.
	
	
	The victim’s statement itself sheds light on the psychological consequences which have already resulted for the victim. That statement reveals that she presently considers herself more harmed by the applicant’s arrest and punishment for his admitted serious offending against her, than she does from the offending itself, notwithstanding the ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage which resulted.
	
	
	This statement explains why in R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56; (2014) 239 A Crim R 469 it was observed at [110] as to children like the victim:
	


“This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. In R v G [2008] UKHL 37; [2009] 1 AC 92, Baroness Hale of Richmond (at [49]) referred to the ""long term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do"". The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity: Clarkson v R [2011] VSCA 157; 32 VR 361 at 364 [3], 368-372 [26]-[39].”


	
	Here, it was argued, however, in written submissions on appeal, that the victim’s statement “eloquently demonstrates the additional distress, which she is experiencing due to the applicant’s incarceration” and that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take it into account “as mandated, in considering (in the absence of any contrary evidence) the lack of harm” she had been caused.
	
	
	This submission cannot be accepted.
	
	
	What, in truth, this abused child asks for in her statement is something beyond the law enacted for her protection to grant, namely, a return to the abusive relationship and sexual offending which the applicant knew to be contrary to law when he pursued it and which only came to an end as the result of his arrest.
	
	
	The victim’s letter thus cannot sensibly be understood as evidencing either maturity, forgiveness, or an account which supports the conclusion that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the applicant’s offence was not substantial. Consistent with her youth and consequent immaturity, it rather reveals a lack of real understanding of the seriousness of the assaults committed against her and the potential ongoing consequences of that abuse for her future development.
	
	
	This victim remains at considerable risk of further psychological harm materialising in the years ahead, notwithstanding what she said in this statement and what she earlier told police. From what she said in those interviews it is apparent that the victim was then not entirely honest, given, for example, what she said as to her mother’s consent to the marriage and what was agreed by the parties on sentence, as to her mother’s opposition. That interview also revealed that the victim was unaware of relevant circumstances, including the advice which the applicant had received from the Imams he had approached at the mosque she attended with her family and his knowledge of the illegality of his actions.
	
	
	In the face of all of this evidence it is surprising, indeed, that on sentence the Crown did not challenge the applicant’s case that the harm he had caused the victim was not an aggravating factor which ought to be taken into account on sentencing. That submission was contrary to the provisions made in s 21A(2)(g) which required account to be taken of the evidence that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”.
	
	
	On appeal misplaced reliance was also placed on observations such as those in Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58, where it was observed at [45]:
	


“The affidavit of Ms Pahl tendered on re-sentence is also relevant to re-sentence. To my thinking, it also permits this Court to approach the issue of rehabilitation in a most favourable light. She makes it plain that her support for the applicant is ongoing, reflected as much by what she says as by the fact that she has travelled some distance to visit the applicant to ensure the relationship with his son is maintained. She acknowledges the legal principles that warrant sentences being imposed for domestic violence offenders but impresses on the Court her assessment of the applicant’s violence on the day of the offending as being “totally out of character for him” as a man she says she has loved and lived with for seven years. She describes the applicant as a “good man and a great father and provider”. Although I am mindful of the caution that should be exercised before evidence of a victim’s forgiveness is given undue weight in a sentencing exercise, and also mindful of the observations of Simpson J in R v Glen to which I have already referred, I am persuaded in the particular facts of this case to give Ms Pahl’s evidence significant weight.”


	
	Here the evidence did not permit any favourable conclusions to be reached as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, given the false accounts he had given the psychologists who interviewed him, accounts directly inconsistent with the agreed facts.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the circumstances were analogous to those considered in R v Roche [1999] 2 Cr App R (S) 105, where family members of the victim were closely related to the offender and R v Hutchinson [1994] 15 Cr App R (S) 134, where an adult rape victim had been in a relationship and by trial the victim had forgiven the offender. In R v Hutchinson it was concluded at 137 that:
	


“It seems that the fact of forgiveness must mean that the psychological and mental suffering must be very much less in those circumstances than would be the case in respect of a woman who very understandably could not forgive such an offence as that with which we are dealing. Accordingly, some mitigation must be seen in that one factor. It is not provided by anything which this appellant has done; it is provided by the forgiveness of his victim.”


	
	Such considerations cannot be accepted as arising in this case. Here there is not even an appreciation by the victim that she has anything to forgive.
	
	
	In Roche, Lord Bingham CJ discussed the need for consistency in sentencing, but observed by reference to R v Nunn [1996] 2 Cr App R (S) 136 at 108 that:
	


“The court went on to say that the opinions of the victim or the surviving member of his family about the appropriate level of sentence did not provide any sound basis for re-assessing a sentence. If the victim felt utterly merciful towards the criminal, as some did, the crime had still been committed and must be punished as it deserved. If the victim was obsessed with vengeance, as sometimes happened, the punishment could not be made longer than would otherwise be appropriate. Otherwise cases with identical features would be dealt with in widely different ways, leading to improper and unfair disparity. The court pointed out that, if carried to its logical conclusion, the process would end up by imposing unfair pressures on the victims of crime or the survivors of a crime resulting in death to play a part in the sentencing process which many would find painful and distasteful.”


	
	After referring to commentary by the Criminal Law Review, his Honour concluded (at 109) that it is:
	


“ … a cardinal principle of sentencing that it is for the court to pass what it judges to be the appropriate sentence, having regard to all the circumstances relating to the offence and the offender. The system is not one which allows the injured party to dictate the sentence to be imposed, which must always have regard to wider considerations than the wishes of those who suffer as the result of the commission of criminal offences. Just as it is not for the injured party to call for such and such a sentence to be imposed by way of vengeance, so it is not for the injured party to prevail by calling for a sentence well below the level of sentence ordinarily passed. If the court were as a matter of course to accede to a plea for vengeance by the relatives of a deceased person, then it would be appropriate to pay regard to pleas for compassion also. But the court is not swayed by demands for vengeance and has to be very cautious in paying attention to pleas for mercy.

There is however, in the judgment of the court, this difference. Whereas the court can never ignore the public interest element of offences of this kind and can never become an instrument of vengeance, nonetheless it can in appropriate circumstances, and to some degree, become an instrument of compassion. That seems to us to be an appropriate response to this case.”


	
	The applicant was submitted to fall into a similar category, namely, an offender who should become the instrument of the Court’s compassion. That submission cannot be accepted, given the nature and seriousness of the applicant’s offending against this 12 year old child, when considered in light of the purposes of sentencing by which the Court is bound.
	
	
	No 12 year old should, as the victim was, be put at risk of disease, pregnancy, child birth, or miscarriage and the physical, hormonal and emotional consequences which they can each have, let alone the risk of motherhood and all of the lifelong responsibilities which that can bring with it.
	
	
	Not only was the victim put at risk, she in fact became pregnant and also suffered one of its complications, an ectopic pregnancy. That, even nowadays in Australia, where such victims have access to advanced medical care, can be potentially life threatening. She also suffered a miscarriage. Fortunately there is no evidence that the victim has suffered other long term physical harm, but the possibility of such harm, or indeed further psychological harm materialising in the years to come, as the result of the applicant’s offending, remains real. Despite what the victim said in her statement, compassion for her situation cannot result in a lesser sentence for the applicant.
	
	
	In the result, this ground must fail.
	


Ground 2 – prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending


	
	As discussed in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [79]:
	


“This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. If material error is demonstrated, before the Court would proceed to resentence the Applicant, the Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 720-721 [79]. It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15].”


	
	The applicant’s case was that although on sentence no submissions were addressed to the questions of re-offending and rehabilitation, the sentencing judge was obliged to assess and take into account by way of mitigation of his sentence, that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and not offending again. That may not be accepted. As discussed in Zreika at [81]:
	


“… The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13],[18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].”


	
	Given the evidence earlier discussed, it would seem that there was good forensic reason for not pursuing arguments as to the applicant’s prospects.
	
	
	It has repeatedly been observed that histories given to those who assess offenders should be approached with some caution when they choose not to give evidence (see for example R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 and TS v R [2007] NSWCCA 194 at [30]; Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [18]). That was an important consideration in this case, given all that the applicant initially told police as to his beliefs, what he told the experts and the facts which were later agreed.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence. Had he done so he would have been cross-examined not only as to the accounts he had given the experts on whose reports he relied on appeal, but also as to what he had told those who gave character references. What they said made it apparent that the applicant had also not been entirely frank with them.
	
	
	The applicant, seemingly an intelligent man with no prior record, pursued serious and deliberate offending, even though warned by two Imams who knew the victim, that what he proposed to do was illegal.
	
	
	When he was examined by Dr Rastogi and Ms De Santa Brigida in June 2014 he had not yet entered his plea. In the circumstances that he was undoubtedly then in, his plea reflected a recognition of the inevitability of his conviction. A positive assessment as to his prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of further offending, depended, however, not on a recognition of the inevitability of that conviction, but on demonstration of an alteration of the views he had held even when he was examined by the two experts, as to his right to marry the victim and to have sexual intercourse with her, despite his understanding as to her age, and that his conduct involved serious offending under the law.
	
	
	That the applicant now accepts that, notwithstanding his prior belief that he was entitled to do what he did, it was in fact criminal to pursue his desires, has not been established by evidence. In his case, given the departures in the histories he had earlier given, from the agreed facts, little weight can be placed on the conclusions reached by the experts as to his prospects of re-offending. .
	
	
	In the result, it was not open to conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and not offending further, even if such a case had been advanced on sentence. It was not.
	
	
	Accordingly, this ground must be dismissed.
	


Ground 3 - special circumstances


	
	It appears that the applicant is at risk of deportation once his sentence is served. This was not a relevant consideration on sentence, even in fixing the applicant’s non-parole period. Deportation is a matter for the Executive Government (see R v Van Hong Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 referring to Shrestha v The Queen [1991] HCA 26; (1991) 173 CLR 48).
	
	
	The ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period imposed on the applicant reflected the statutory ratio provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which relevantly provides:
	


“44    Court to set non-parole 

(1)   Unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).

(2)    The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).

(2A)   ...

(2B)   ...

(2C)   ...

(3)   The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2), (2B) or (2C) does not invalidate the sentence.

…”


	
	The section imposes a fetter on a sentencing judge’s discretion (see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [61]). A finding of special circumstances permits an adjustment downwards of the non-parole period, but that discretion must be exercised in the light of “the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence” (see R v Simpson at [63]).
	
	
	As s 44(2) specifies, departure from the statutory ratio must be explained by reasons given, by reference to the relevant facts on which the finding of special circumstances rests (see Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [28]). Simply because there are circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances, however, does not require a sentencing judge to make such a finding (see R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]). This Court is unlikely to interfere with the exercise of that discretion, unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive (R v Simpson at [73]).
	
	
	It follows that where, as here, no finding of special circumstances was sought on sentence and, in exercise of the discretion the statutory ratio was adhered to by the sentencing judge, on appeal what must be shown is that the exercise of the discretion has been infected by some error, or has resulted in a non parole period that was manifestly excessive. Adherence to the statutory ratio, of itself, cannot establish such an error.
	
	
	On appeal Dr Rastogi’s opinions that the applicant was suffering severe depression and a grief reaction, currently in denial, with a need for ongoing psychological support long term for his multiple losses, which would impact upon his self esteem, were relied on to submit that there should have been a finding of special circumstances, with the result an adjustment downwards of the non-parole period which the applicant is to serve.
	
	
	That was not, however, the applicant’s case on sentence. Then there was no submission advanced that there should have been any adjustment to the non-parole period, for this or any other reason.
	
	
	On the evidence earlier discussed, that there was any error in her Honour not having departed from the statutory ratio, given both the absence of any submission that there should be a finding of special circumstances and the problems already discussed with the opinions formed by Dr Rastogi, given the history provided by the applicant, is difficult to accept.
	
	
	The non-parole period imposed on the applicant was 10 years, after a discount of 25%. Given all that her Honour was obliged to take into account in arriving at the applicant’s sentence, that this non-parole period was manifestly excessive, has not been established. To the contrary, given that the harm which he caused the victim was not taken into account as an aggravating factor, as s 21A(3)(a) contemplated, it is arguable that the sentence was unreasonably disproportionate to the true nature and circumstances of the applicant’s offence. That, however, was not the Crown’s case and so need not be considered further.
	
	
	In the result, however, this ground must also be dismissed.
	


Order


	
	Accordingly, the orders I would propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be allowed.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.
	



	
	WILSON J: I agree with Schmidt J.

		08 June 2016",2016-06-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769631,Tregeagle v R [2016] NSWCCA 106,"Judgment


	
	PAYNE JA: On 13 August 2014, Mr Lindsay Tregeagle, the applicant, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to seven offences and was committed for sentence to the District Court. The charges comprised one charge of attempted armed robbery; three charges of armed robbery; two charges of aggravated armed robbery; and one charge of causing wounding with intent to murder.
	
	
	On 24 July 2015 a sentencing hearing took place before Berman SC DCJ in the District Court at Newcastle and the applicant was sentenced that day to an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act) with a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months, which will expire on 5 March 2030, and head sentence of 22 years imprisonment, to date from 6 September 2013, the day the applicant was taken into custody.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed. There are four grounds of appeal:
	



	
	the sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to the applicant’s prior good behaviour as a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3)(f) of the Act;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in failing to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation as a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3)(h) of the Act;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the physical and psychological harm suffered by the victims as an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(g) of the Act; and
	
	
	the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	



	
	At the hearing of this appeal counsel for the applicant, Ms J Paingakulam, described Ground 1 as essentially a particular of Ground 4. Therefore these Grounds will be addressed together. Ground 3 was not addressed at the hearing, Ms Paingakulam being content to rely on Mr Hunt’s written submissions on that issue.
	


Facts


	
	The following summary is adapted from the remarks on sentence and a statement of agreed facts signed by the applicant and tendered by consent before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	At the time of the events the subject of the counts in the indictment, the applicant was 22 years old. He was employed by Structural Concrete Industries and was also a casual employee at the Rathmines Bowling Club.
	
	
	The facts relating to each of the charges are addressed in chronological order from the date of the first offence.
	


Sequence 8 - Armed robbery of Rathmines Cellars


	
	At about 7.12 pm on 2 May 2013 the applicant entered Rathmines Cellars. He carried a “chef style” knife which was approximately one foot long. The applicant was wearing a hoodie, pulled up over his head, and a balaclava over part of his face.
	
	
	The store attendant was Susan Johnston, then aged 52. The applicant demanded money from the till. He placed the money (totalling $1,500) in his backpack. He also placed three bottles of Bundaberg Rum in his backpack. He then left the store.
	
	
	This offence, under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	


Sequence 7 – Armed robbery of Rathmines Cellars


	
	At about 7.50 pm on 27 June 2013 the applicant returned to Rathmines Cellars. The applicant was wearing a hoodie, pulled up over his head, and a balaclava over part of his face.
	
	
	The victim of the previous offence, Susan Johnston, was again working alone. The applicant carried a knife described as a carving knife which had a blade approximately 12 inches long. He demanded money. He accused Ms Johnston of hiding the $100 notes and lying to him. Ms Johnston removed the coin tray and gave the applicant some $50 and $100 notes. The applicant said “Get on the floor bitch. Put your face in the carpet”. He then left the store, taking $1,200 in cash.
	
	
	This offence was under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	


Sequence 6 – Attempted armed robbery of Blackalls Park Convenience Store


	
	At 6.15 am on 5 July 2013 the applicant entered Blackalls Park Convenience Store. The applicant was wearing a hoodie, pulled up over his head, and a balaclava over part of his face.
	
	
	The victim was Stephen Keggan, then aged 62 years. Mr Keggan had just opened the store, and was working alone.
	
	
	The applicant carried a knife with a serrated edge. The knife was approximately 30-40 cm long. He demanded cash from Mr Keggan. Mr Keggan said he had no cash and told the applicant to get out of the shop. He picked up a tomato stake and hit the applicant hard with it and yelled for help. The applicant ran out of the store and rode away on a push bike.
	
	
	This offence was under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	


Sequence 5 – Aggravated armed robbery of Blackalls Park Convenience Store


	
	At 6.10 am on 19 July 2013 (two weeks later) the applicant returned to the Blackalls Park Convenience Store. The applicant was wearing a hoodie, pulled up over his head, and a balaclava over part of his face.
	
	
	Mr Keggan was again working alone. The applicant was carrying a timber baseball bat. He hit Mr Keggan on the left leg, causing him to fall to the ground. He continued to hit Mr Keggan’s left leg and left arm, which he was holding up to defend himself. The applicant stopped hitting Mr Keggan and demanded cash. Mr Keggan gave the applicant some cash from a cash register.
	
	
	As both men moved towards another cash register in the store the applicant hit Mr Keggan again. Mr Keggan said “stop hitting me. I’m getting the cash out for you”. Mr Keggan opened the register and gave the applicant cash. The applicant demanded $50 notes. Mr Keggan lifted the coin tray to show that he had none. The applicant ran out of the shop, taking a total of $700 cash.
	
	
	Mr Keggan sustained fractures in his leg and arm as a result of the attack.
	
	
	This offence was under s 95(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	


Sequence 4 – Robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon of Network Video Toronto


	
	At about 7.45 pm on 15 August 2013 the applicant entered Network Video. Lyn Becker, aged 64, was working behind the counter. The applicant was wearing a hoodie, pulled up over his head, and a balaclava over part of his face.
	
	
	The applicant carried a knife. He pointed the knife at Ms Becker and demanded money. Ms Becker opened the till and gave the applicant cash. He asked for “the rest of it” a number of times, and Ms Becker said “there’s no more”. He also pushed Ms Becker into the back corner of the store. She sustained a cut to her left thumb and bruising to her left forearm. The applicant left the store, taking $710 cash.
	
	
	This offence was under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	


Sequence 3 – Aggravated robbery of Blackalls Park Newsagency


	
	At about 5.20 am on 30 August 2013 the applicant entered Blackalls Park Newsagency. The applicant was wearing a hoodie, pulled up over his head, and a balaclava over part of his face.
	
	
	The shop attendant was Sarah Noakes, then aged 20. Also present was Ronald Jenkins, then aged 71. The applicant carried a knife described as being about 12 inches long. He grabbed Mr Jenkins and placed the tip of the knife’s blade on the back of his neck. He demanded money from both tills. Ms Noakes emptied the tills on the counter. The applicant moved away from Mr Jenkins and took the cash on the counter. He fled the store, taking $623 in cash.
	
	
	This offence was under s 95(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	


Sequence 1 – Cause wounding with intent to murder at Woodrising Cellars


	
	At about 6.45 pm on 2 September 2013 the applicant entered Woodrising Cellars. The applicant was wearing a hoodie, pulled up over his head, and a balaclava over part of his face.
	
	
	The owner operator Mark Hamilton, then aged 50, was working alone. The applicant carried a knife. He demanded money. Mr Hamilton told him to “Fuck off”.
	
	
	Mr Hamilton was then cornered behind the counter and held his arms up in a defensive stance. He advanced towards the applicant and tried to wrestle him out of the shop. The applicant pushed Mr Hamilton over, into a display of wine bottles. During the struggle the applicant’s hoodie and balaclava were dislodged and his face was captured on the CCTV recording at the shop.
	
	
	The applicant stood over Mr Hamilton, who lay on the floor on his back. He held Mr Hamilton down and stabbed him three to four times, causing wounds in his stomach and back. The applicant started to walk away from Mr Hamilton, but then returned and thrust the knife into his torso a further three to four times shouting “Die! Fucken Die!”.
	
	
	Mr Hamilton sustained the following injuries:
	



	
	fractured left tenth rib;
	
	
	small anterior pneumothorax;
	
	
	laceration of the upper love of the lung posteriorly;
	
	
	left haemopneumothorax;
	
	
	left lobe atelectasis;
	
	
	eight stab wounds to the torso, hip and thigh; and
	
	
	knife lacerations in his hands, arms, neck and cheek.
	



	
	This offence was under s 27 of the Crimes Act which attracts a 25 year maximum sentence and a standard non parole period of 10 years.
	


Sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence


	
	The evidence before the sentencing judge comprised the statement of agreed facts and a Pre-Sentence Report. The applicant led psychological evidence from Mr Probets and character evidence from Mr Callen and Mr Costello. The applicant did not give evidence. The Crown led psychological and psychiatric evidence from Dr Banks and Dr Allnut respectively and tendered two victim impact statements.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that the applicant had “no real criminal history” and that the applicant was “abusing alcohol” and “in financial difficulties” caused by gambling.
	
	
	The sentencing judge pointed out that voluntary alcohol consumption was not a mitigating factor on sentence (s 21A(5AA) of the Act).
	
	
	The applicant’s parents had separated and applicant did not speak to his father for some time. His mother had attempted suicide on a “couple of occasions”.
	
	
	Mr Probets said that PTSD may be a factor because the applicant told him he had been sexually assaulted as a child. However, the sentencing judge noted that the applicant “did not give sworn evidence that that had occurred”. His Honour continued:
	


... in circumstances where the offender did not give sworn evidence, where he refused to be assessed and interviewed by a psychologist on behalf of the Crown, and where in at least one area he was exaggerating his responses to the psychologist who did interview him, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the sexual assault occurred.


	
	The reference to exaggeration is a reference to a Personality Assessment Inventory test administered by Mr Probets in which the applicant recorded a “negative admission management” score. This was, according to Mr Probets, indicative of “malingering” or “exaggeration”. Mr Probets also said this score was consistent with a “cry for help”, “careless responding” and “an extreme or exaggerated negative evaluation of oneself or one’s life”.
	
	
	The sentencing judge recorded that “a great deal of time ... was spent attempting to establish the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation”.
	
	
	On this issue, his Honour found that the applicant was hardworking and industrious. He had continued his industrious attitude in custody – he “has done many courses” and “obtained certificates”. The sentencing judge, however, was not satisfied that the applicant had good prospects for rehabilitation. His Honour said that these offences “were apparently committed all because of the applicant’s gambling problems” and that “I would have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was not going to do the same thing next time he was short of cash.”
	
	
	After reviewing the facts, the sentencing judge also commented on the impact of the applicant’s crimes on the victims. Mr Jenkins (Sequence 3) said he had nightmares and difficulty sleeping. Mr Hamilton (Sequence 1) had scarring, permanent pain, was easily spooked, frightened and suspicious of new customers. The sentencing judge also commented upon the impact of the applicant’s actions on the other victims (although there were no victim impact statements tendered from those victims).
	
	
	The sentencing judge expressly considered the following additional matters:
	



	
	the applicant’s expressions of remorse. There was no sworn evidence to this effect but the his Honour was “prepared to infer that he has feelings of regret”;
	
	
	the fact that the victims were vulnerable by reason of their occupation (this is an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(l) of the Act);
	
	
	the fact that the offences were committed for financial gain (this is an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(o) of the Act); and
	
	
	the applicant’s early plea of guilty (this is a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3)(k) of the Act), which the sentencing judge held entitled the applicant to a 25 per cent discount on the sentence otherwise to be imposed.
	



	
	The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to an aggregate term of 22 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months. His Honour gave the following indicative sentences as required by s 53A(2)(b) of the Act:
	



	
	Sequence 1: 12 years (8 years non-parole period);
	
	
	Sequence 3: 5 years 6 months;
	
	
	Sequence 4: 4 years 6 months;
	
	
	Sequence 5: 6 years;
	
	
	Sequence 6: 3 years;
	
	
	Sequence 7: 4 years 6 months; and
	
	
	Sequence 8: 4 years.
	


Psychological and psychiatric evidence


	
	Much of the sentencing hearing before the sentencing judge was taken up in cross-examination and submissions concerning psychological and psychiatric evidence.
	


Mr Probets’ evidence


	
	Mr Probets, a forensic psychologist, provided an assessment dated 17 November 2014. Following one consultation where three psychometric tests were conducted, Mr Probets diagnosed the applicant with three conditions: alcohol dependence, major depressive disorder (single episode, unspecified) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mr Probets said that the PTSD was “a result of experiencing sexual assault”.
	
	
	After his report had been the subject of critique by Drs Banks and Allnutt (addressed below), by email dated 23 July 2015 (the day before the sentencing hearing) Mr Probets withdrew his diagnoses of alcohol dependence, major depressive disorder and PTSD. He said:
	


In light of recently received material I have reviewed my diagnoses section contained in [the reports] ... [I]t was not intended to be a formal diagnosis and anything I said was subject to further confirmation. ... I withdraw the diagnoses but state that he was suffering symptoms of each of these three disorders.


	
	Mr Probets also said in his report that the applicant “committed these offences due to his financial situation which was caused by a combination of extreme alcohol abuse and gambling”. His conclusion about these matters, however, was based on his finding (withdrawn by the time of the sentencing hearing) that the applicant “has an addiction to both alcohol and gambling”.
	
	
	Mr Probets also opined that the applicant “presents a low risk of reoffending which would become a very low risk with the help of appropriate treatment programs”. Mr Probets recommended programs related to violent offending, anger control and abstention from alcohol and gambling. In cross examination Mr Probets agreed it was difficult to assess the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation because he did not know what treatment the applicant would receive in prison.
	


Dr Banks’ evidence


	
	The applicant declined to be examined by any of the Crown’s experts. Dr Banks, a clinical forensic psychologist, conducted a peer review of Mr Probets’ reports.
	
	
	Dr Banks cast considerable doubt on Mr Probets’ conclusions (including the diagnoses that were later withdrawn). In particular, he gave evidence that there was insufficient information to conclude that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. Using a widely administered test, and based on the results Mr Probets had reported, Dr Banks gave evidence that the applicant was in (at least) the moderate range of risk of recidivism. He gave evidence that the prospect of recidivism, including violent offences, far outweighs the possibility of good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Finally, he said there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the applicant suffered any mental illness and that it was “unlikely” that the applicant suffered gambling and alcohol addictions.
	


Dr Allnutt


	
	Dr Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist, provided a report dated 29 June 2015 commenting on Mr Probets’ two reports. Dr Allnutt expressed disagreement, in the absence of a more guided and comprehensive assessment of risk, with Mr Probets’ conclusion about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and risk of reoffending. He said there was:
	


... limited evidence to demonstrate that a particular sexual abuse episode forms the basis for a particular motivation to offend violently at a particular place and time and I would regard that argument as relatively weak.

Pre-Sentence Report


	
	A Pre-Sentence Report was tendered which stated that the applicant had been compliant and had undertaken a number of courses in custody; it discussed his family situation, his mother’s attempts at suicide, and his reported sexual abuse; it stated that the applicant had “revealed” that “prior to custody his alcohol consumption had become problematic” and admitted to being under the influence of alcohol during the commission of all of the offences; it noted Mr Probets’ diagnoses (which had not yet been withdrawn); it noted that the offences were for financial gain and that, as a result of his gambling, the applicant “could not think of alternative way [sic] of recouping his losses”; it assessed the applicant to be a medium risk of reoffending; it stated that the applicant acknowledged he was addicted to gambling; it stated that the applicant accepted full responsibility for his actions; and it stated that the applicant expressed willingness to engage in all interventions required to address his criminogenic needs (gambling, alcohol, mental health and anger management).
	


Other evidence


	
	Character evidence was given by the applicant’s supervisors at Structural Concrete Industries, Mr Callen and Mr Costello. They described the applicant’s work history in positive terms and noted his issues with binge drinking.
	
	
	Mr Hamilton and Mr Jenkins made victim impact statements. Mr Hamilton said he had permanent scarring and pain. He was easily frightened and suspicious. Mr Jenkins said he experienced nightmares and had difficulty sleeping.
	


Submissions on the appeal


	
	The applicant’s oral submissions first addressed Ground 2 (good prospects of rehabilitation), followed by Grounds 1 and 4 together (the sentence was manifestly excessive and the sentencing judge erred in addressing the applicant’s prior good character). Ground 3 (the question of taking into account victim impacts) was not addressed orally but was the subject of written submissions.
	
	
	Those submissions are addressed in the same order.
	


Ground 2 – good prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge should have found on the balance of probabilities that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, within the meaning of s 21A(3)(h) of the Act.
	
	
	The applicant points to evidence that he had undertaken courses and attended AA meetings, and that he was motivated and willing to rehabilitate himself. That evidence was primarily contained in the Pre-Sentence Report. It was submitted that his youth, and the “inexplicable reason for the offending”, both suggest that the offences were an “aberration” that was “unlikely to be repeated”. He submits that evidence of his regret should support a finding that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also submitted that the sentencing judge’s failure to be satisfied that the applicant would not commit similar offences the next time he was short of cash “ignores the deterrent effect of the applicant’s time in custody” and the fact that he would enjoy “considerable family support in circumstances where they are now aware that the applicant has a significant problem”.
	
	
	Finally, the applicant submits that the sentencing judge gave too much weight to Dr Banks’ report. The applicant points out that Dr Banks did not interview the applicant and did not have access to the Pre-Sentence Report. It was submitted that Dr Banks had adopted a negative attitude towards the applicant because he raised the possibility that the claim of sexual abuse may have been concocted. Dr Banks described the applicant as “malingering” in his report but in cross examination agreed that the applicant was more likely to be “feeling hopeless” and “wallowing” than “deliberately trying to exaggerate how bad things were for him” or “telling lies”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was entitled to reject Mr Probets’ conclusion that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation because:
	



	
	Mr Probets “accepted that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation would depend on the conditions under which he was treated”;
	
	
	Mr Probets accepted that “if the applicant was lying in the testing that was a factor against prospects of rehabilitation”; and
	
	
	the Pre-Sentence Report, which was dated after Mr Probets’ report, assessed the applicant to be a medium risk of reoffending.
	


Grounds 4 and 1 – sentence manifestly excessive and prior good character


	
	The essence of the applicant’s submission in these grounds was that:
	


... for such a young offender with no prior criminal record who had in custody begun to make real efforts at rehabilitating himself, it is submitted that the court moved beyond a reasonable exercise of its discretion in imposing the sentence that it did.

The applicant made a number of submissions in support of this argument.


	
	The applicant also made submissions referring to the Henry guideline. In R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 this Court delivered a guideline judgment in relation to the offence of armed robbery pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. Spigelman CJ said at [162]-[165]:
	


It appears from the cases that come to this Court, including the present proceedings, that there is a category of case which is sufficiently common for purposes of determining a guideline:

(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history;

(ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;

(iii) Limited degree of planning;

(iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;

(v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver

(vi) Small amount taken;

(vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.

Whilst it is possible to determine a starting point in a case of this kind, i.e. a sentence of X years imprisonment, I do not believe that the Court should do so. Rather, I propose the Court should identify a narrow sentencing range within which this Court would expect sentences in such cases to fall.

There are two principal reasons why a sentencing range is appropriate for this offence:

(i) The seven characteristics identified above do not represent the full range of factors relevant to the sentencing exercise.

(ii) Many of the seven identified characteristics contain within themselves an inherent variability, eg different kinds of knives or weapons in (ii); extent of “limited actual violence” in (iv); degree of vulnerability in (v); amount in (vi).

In my opinion sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. ...


	
	The applicant submitted that Sequences 4, 7 and 8 are offences to which the Henry guideline applied (that is, offences under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act). The indicative sentences for those offences were 4 years and 6 months, 4 years and 6 months and 4 years respectively. The Henry guideline assumes:
	


(vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.


	
	The applicant submitted that the present case should be distinguished from the situation contemplated by the Henry guideline because the applicant entered a plea of guilty early (i.e. he was not motivated by the strength of the Crown case). Therefore the sentences were “somewhat excessive or at least on the borderline of the range”. Counsel for the applicant also acknowledged that some of the offences were above the Henry guideline.
	
	
	Although the applicant recognised that sentencing is an “instinctive and not mathematical” process, in written submissions a series of calculations were advanced which, the applicant submitted, indicated that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In particular, the applicant submitted that on the basis of the indicative sentences, the degree of accumulation between each of the seven Sequences was one year and eight months. The applicant submitted that “notwithstanding the serious nature of the offences before the Court, that degree of accumulation is simply excessive”.
	
	
	On the issue of totality the applicant submitted that “it would be appropriate to have regard to the fact that the offences ... were committed over a discrete period of time, as part of a single “crime spree” constituted by similar offences”. This submission was made on the basis of Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53 at [102] in which Beazley JA (Hislop J agreeing) accepted the appellant’s argument that, since the offending occurred during a short space of time so as to be part of a relatively short crime spree, the partial accumulation of sentences should be less than would otherwise be the case. In the present case counsel for the applicant submitted orally that four months is “not an extended period”, although counsel conceded that “the duration is more substantial than of the nature seen in Qing An”.
	
	
	In relation to prior good character the applicant submitted that while the sentencing judge referred to the applicant’s prior good character, his Honour did not expressly identify that as a feature of mitigation.
	
	
	The only mitigating factors that were expressly taken into account were remorse and the pleas of guilty. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in this regard. The applicant submitted that, if the sentencing judge had given weight to good character as a mitigating factor (as his Honour should have) he could not have given the sentence that he did.
	
	
	The applicant also submitted that in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370 at [55]-[59] Johnson J had identified examples of cases in which prior good character had been given less weight. The offences in the present case are not in the class of offences frequently committed by persons of good character.
	
	
	In oral submissions the Crown emphasised the overarching principle that sentencing must reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s misconduct and that:
	


... when one comes to consider the criminality involved what’s striking about this series of crimes is that the applicant was prepared to use a degree of violence well above that which was necessary to achieve his aims.


	
	The Crown emphasised, in particular, holding a knife to the back of a 71-year-old’s neck and beating a victim (as an act of reprisal) with a baseball bat while he was on the ground.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there are a number of features which put the applicant “above” the Henry guideline in relation to a number of the offences.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that:
	


To characterise the offending as part of a “single crime spree” is to overlook the objective seriousness of each of the offences. The criminality of each of the offences is distinct, they each involved separate victims. For this reason separate and distinct punishment was warranted on each.


	
	The Crown submits that the sentencing judge was aware of and accepted that the applicant had prior good character. His Honour took it into account. He was not required to do more than that.
	


Ground 3 – taking into account harm suffered by victims


	
	The applicant made written submissions about Ground 3 but did not address them orally. As has been noted, Mr Jenkins and Mr Hamilton provided victim impact statements, but no other victims did. The sentencing judge said:
	


I have no doubt that harm was occasioned to other victims too. I have mentioned the physical harm as I went through my description of the offences but there is also psychological harm too which is an almost inevitable consequence of being the victim of an armed robbery.


	
	The applicant submits that, although not explicitly identified as an aggravating factor, these comments engaged s 21A(2)(g) of the Act (pursuant to which it is an aggravating factor that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”). This, it was submitted, was an error: R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in drawing a conclusion about the “other” victims because there was no evidence that all of the victims had suffered emotional harm. The applicant submitted the following by reference to R v Solomon [2005] NSWCCA 158 at [18]-[19]; Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41 at [45]:
	


... the Henry guideline took into account the usual effects upon a victim of an armed robbery. Thus, if a sentencing judge applied the guideline and also took into account the usual effects upon a victim, an error of double counting would occur.


	
	The Crown disputes the premise upon which the applicant’s submission was based. It was submitted that his Honour did not make any finding that the harm caused to the victims was an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(g).
	


Consideration

Relevant principles governing disposition of this appeal


	
	This was a case in which there was no dispute about the principles to be applied. The applicant submitted that “fundamentally, a severity appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal is a review of an error in the exercise of a judicial discretion: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499”.
	
	
	References were made by the applicant to the well-known principles in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; 198 CLR 111 at [130]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]; and Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42] (per French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ):
	


When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non‑parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

Ground 2 – good prospects of rehabilitation


	
	With respect to this ground of appeal, the sentencing judge did not err in failing to conclude on the balance of probabilities that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, within the meaning of s 21A(3)(h) of the Act.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence before the sentencing judge and the relevant evidence on this issue was essentially confined to psychological and psychiatric evidence and the Pre-Sentence Report.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was entitled to reject Mr Probets’ conclusion that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Probets’ conclusions rested on shaky foundations even before he gave evidence. He had retracted the principal bases of his opinion, the diagnosis of PTSD and the alcohol and gambling addictions. The position did not improve following cross-examination where his ultimate conclusion about the prospects of rehabilitation was exposed as speculation.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report, which was the only other evidence upon which the applicant relied to establish error, was dated after Mr Probets’ report. It assessed the applicant to be a medium risk of reoffending.
	
	
	The limitations inherent in the reports of Drs Banks and Allnut are also apparent, as they were not permitted to examine the applicant. Their criticisms of Mr Probets’ evidence, and his reliance upon discredited means of assessing risk were, however, compelling.
	
	
	The sentencing judge correctly concluded that on the evidence before him he could not be satisfied on balance of probabilities that the applicant enjoyed good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Ground 2 of the Notice of Appeal should be dismissed.
	


Grounds 4 and 1 – sentence manifestly excessive and prior good character


	
	To describe a sentence as manifestly excessive is to express a conclusion. In Dinsdale the High Court said (at [6]):
	


A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion. A Court of Criminal Appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and its reasons is made plain. The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case.


	
	On this critical question, the series of offences committed by the applicant are each objectively very serious and the need for a sentence reflective of the objective seriousness of those crimes is clear.
	
	
	No doubt the aggregate sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is a stern one, however, in light of the following matters, it is not manifestly excessive:
	



	
	The maximum penalties for these offences ranged from 20 to 25 years. The standard non-parole period in respect of Sequence 1 was 10 years;
	
	
	The excessively violent and escalating nature of the offences was highly relevant, particularly:
	



	
	Sequence 1 where, after initially stabbing the victim three or four times and commencing to walk away, the applicant returned and thrust the knife into the victim’s torso a further three to four times shouting “Die! Fucken Die!”;
	
	
	Sequence 5 where, as an act of revenge, the applicant returned to the Blackalls Park Convenience Store and, using a wooden baseball bat, broke the arm and the leg of the 62 year old shop assistant who had two weeks earlier resisted the applicant’s robbery attempt. During this attack, the applicant stopped hitting Mr Keggan and demanded cash. Mr Keggan gave the applicant some cash from a cash register. Both men then moved towards another cash register in the store and the applicant hit Mr Keggan with the baseball bat again; and
	
	
	Sequence 3 where the applicant placed his knife at the neck of the 71 year old shop attendant and held it there while he demanded money from a 20 year old assistant;
	



	
	The large number of very serious offences, seven, each committed in the same local area of greater Newcastle was relevant;
	
	
	The period of time during which these offences occurred, between 2 May and 2 September 2013 was relevant. These offences cannot be viewed as part of a short term crime spree of the kind addressed by the Court in Qing An. Rather, during a four month period, the offences were carefully planned and involved an escalating level of violence, culminating in the attempted stabbing murder of Mr Hamilton; and
	
	
	The vulnerability of the victims was relevant. In six of the sequences, the victim was working alone in a retail store. The one exception, Sequence 3, involved two staff members. In that case the applicant placed a knife to the back or the side of Mr Jenkins' neck. Those employees were also vulnerable.
	



	
	The sentencing judge took into account subjective factors favourable to the applicant, however, correctly concluded that the sentence imposed must reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s misconduct.
	
	
	As this was an aggregate sentence, the sentencing judge was required to announce indicative sentences for each of the individual Sequences, which his Honour did.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submissions advanced a number of mathematical calculations based on those indicative sentences from which a degree of accumulation between each of the seven Sequences of one year and eight months was derived. This degree of accumulation was submitted to be excessive.
	
	
	This submission should be rejected for four reasons:
	



	
	First, the appellant correctly accepts that if individual sentences had been imposed for each of the seven sequences, partial accumulation of those sentences would have been appropriate. These offences were each very serious and involved an escalating level of violence and, in one case, a brutal act of revenge. The degree of accumulation reflected in the aggregate sentence did not give rise to a total sentence which was manifestly excessive;
	
	
	Second, to the extent that the calculations applied the Henry guideline to the indicative sentences, counsel for the applicant also correctly accepted that a number of the offences warranted a sentence in excess of the Henry guideline;
	
	
	Third, even if correct to assert that the degree of accumulation between each of the seven Sequences was one year and eight months, that fact of itself does not indicate that this aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive. Much is concealed by the calculation of the period of accumulation of one year and eight months for each of the Sequences;
	
	
	Fourth, while, of course, the aggregate sentence must comply with the principle of totality, it is not appropriate to attempt to impute a degree of mathematical precision to the accumulation of each indicative sentence that was not part of the sentencing judge’s reasoning.
	



	
	So far as the issue of the applicant’s good character is concerned, there was no error in the approach of the sentencing judge. The sentencing judge was aware of and accepted that the applicant had prior good character – he said so explicitly - “the offender had no real criminal history” – and took that matter into account.
	
	
	A further submission made by counsel for the appellant at the hearing was that the sentencing judge appeared to treat the fact that the offences were committed “out of the blue” as a matter which was adverse to the applicant’s interests. Counsel submitted that the sentencing judge should have found the opposite: “that there was no prior indication that the applicant would commit such offences is a matter which should have operated in his favour”. As a result, the submission continues, the sentencing judge focussed on the objective seriousness of the offences without attributing any real weight to other subjective matters.
	
	
	That is not a fair assessment of the sentencing judge’s remarks. There was a difficulty in this case in the absence of cogent evidence addressing the applicant’s subjective features. The applicant did not himself give evidence. Messrs Callen and Costello gave some character evidence, which was taken into account. The principal burden of addressing the applicant’s subjective features rested with Mr Probets, whose evidence was correctly found by the sentencing judge to be unhelpful (indeed much of it was withdrawn by Mr Probets himself).
	
	
	For these reasons Grounds 1 and 4 of the Notice of Appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 3 – taking into account harm suffered by victims


	
	As noted at the outset this was a ground of appeal which was not addressed in oral submissions. The premise upon which the applicant’s written submission is based is incorrect. The sentencing judge did not find that the harm caused to the victims was an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(g) of the Act. His Honour’s language when addressing the question clearly reveals that he was not making such finding.
	
	
	Ground 3 of the Notice of Appeal should be dismissed.
	


Conclusion


	
	None of the grounds of appeal have been made out. This was a case involving seven very serious offences involving an escalating level of violence which warranted the stern aggregate sentence which was imposed.
	
	
	Leave to appeal should be granted because of the significant length of the sentence imposed and the nature of the issues raised. However, although Ms Paingakulam put the applicant’s case with care and considerable skill, the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	PRICE J: I agree with Payne JA.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with Payne JA.

2769641,Michael Augustine Porrier v Regina [2016] NSWDC 99,"Judgment


	
	Michael Augustine Poirrier (the accused) has been charged with two counts of aggravated indecent and two counts of homosexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 18 years.
	
	
	The charges arise from one alleged incident on a boat owned by the accused, during the period 13 December 1990 and 1 August 1991. The complainant’s father was an acquaintance of the accused and 14 years if age at that time. It is alleged that the accused took the complainant fishing and that during the course of that fishing trip the accused sexually assaulted the complainant.
	
	
	The Crown allege that a complaint was first made by the complainant to his sister in or about 2004. The matter was not reported to the police until 2010, when the complainant’s first statement was taken. The complainant’s second statement was taken in 2011, and an identification procedure was also completed at that time. The accused was first spoken to by police on 4 April 2012. He participated in an ERISP on 30 April 2012 and was issued with a court attendance notice on 4 July 2012. The accused was committed for trial on 4 November 2013.
	
	
	The Crown filed the indictment on 29 November 2013. The question of the accused’s fitness to plead was raised before he was arraigned.
	
	
	From about 1998 the accused began to suffer from transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) caused by arteriosclerosis. As a result the accused has suffered from transient global amnesia (TGA), difficulty with his memory and dissociative states during which his awareness of his surroundings and his behaviour is impaired. In 2004 the accused was diagnosed with prostate cancer. The prostate cancer has metastasised. In the opinion of his treating specialist, Prof Stricker, the prostate cancer is incurable but relatively stable at present, the accused has a “very, very guarded prognosis” and any should minimise any significant stress.
	
	
	It is submitted on behalf of the accused that by reason of his physical health and mental condition in combination that he is unfit to be tried and/or that the prosecution should be stayed.
	


Relevant Law

Fitness to Plead


	
	Whether an accused person is unfit to be tried is determined by judge alone on the balance of probabilities: sections 11(1) and 6 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900.
	
	
	An inquiry into fitness is not an adversarial matter and no party bears any onus of proof: sections 12(2) and 12(3) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900.
	


Purpose


	
	The common law guarantees to an accused person the right a fair trial, one aspect of which is that a trial cannot proceed unless the accused person is fit to plead: Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1 at [64].
	
	
	It is a cardinal principle of the common law that no person can be tried for a crime unless they are in a mental condition to defend themselves: R v Dashwood [1943] 1 KB 1 at 4.
	
	
	Where there is an unresolved question of fitness to be tried, or the question of fitness is not determined properly in accordance with law, there is a fundamental failure in the trial process: Eastman at [62] and Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) (2003) 214 CLR 318 at [115]-[118] per Heydon J.
	
	
	Unfitness can arise by reason of the accused’s mental health or by reason of some physical or intellectual disability, or a combination of both: R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at [284]. The condition may be entirely physical, for example, coronary artery disease. There does not need to be any underlying illness or formal diagnosis as long as there is an inpaired or disordered mental process: R v Sexton (2000) 77 SASR 405 at [46] and [54].
	


Test


	
	In determining whether an accused is fit to be tried the Court is to consider whether they meet certain minimum standards articulated in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. In order to be fit to stand trial an accused is required:
	


“…to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to that charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.”


	
	The test to determine fitness must be applied in a reasonable and commonsense way: Presser at 48; Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 at 8.
	
	
	In determining the question of fitness the judge must take into account not only the present condition of the accused, but also the likely future condition of the accused having regard to the estimated length of the trial: Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230.
	


Stay of Prosecution


	
	The Court has inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings that constitute an abuse of process: Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378, 392-3; Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23; Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75.
	
	
	The power is discretionary and will only be used to stay criminal proceedings in the most exceptional circumstances: Barton at 116; Jago at 31 per Mason CJ, at 75 per Gaudron J.
	
	
	The phrase ‘abuse of process’ encapsulates all cases in which the processes and procedures of the court may be used as instruments of injustice or unfairness: Walton at 393. The question the Court must answer is whether, in all the circumstances, the continuation of proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness: Walton at 392.
	
	
	Fairness or unfairness defies analytical judgment and involves a large degree of intuitive judgment: Jago at 57. The onus is on the applicant to show that the disadvantage or prejudice that they will suffer is unacceptable to the extent that a trial would be unfair: Barron v Attorney-General (1987) 10 NSWLR 215.
	
	
	The categories of factual situations in criminal proceedings which may warrant a consideration of the possibility of abuse of process are not closed: Walton at 393.
	
	
	A permanent stay in criminal proceedings will only be justifiable where there is a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial of such a nature that there are no measures that a trial judge can take in the conduct of the trial to relieve against its unfair consequences: Barton at 111; Jago at 34 per Mason CJ, 49 per Brennan J, and 77-78 per Gaudron J.
	
	
	The power to grant a stay must be exercised in accordance with two fundamental policy considerations:
	



	
	That the public administration of justice requires the Court to protect its functions by preventing abuse of process and
	
	
	That unless the court does so there will be an erosion of public confidence in the Court: Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 520.
	



	
	In determining the question of whether to grant a permanent stay the Court must balance the interests of the accused, the public interest of the community that those charged with serious criminal offences are bought to trial and those guilty are convicted, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice: Walton at 395-6; Jago at 33 per Mason CJ, and at 49-50 per Brennan J.
	
	
	If a trial judge finds that it would offend common humanity to require the accused to stand trial, it is open to the judge to stay the proceedings. However, it will be rare that illness, or the physical or mental condition of the accused, will lead the court to such a conclusion: Hakim v R (1989) 41 A Crim R 372 at 377.
	


Evidence


	
	Tendered before the Court on the applications were the following documents:
	



	
	Report of Associate Professor Stephen Woods (Prof Woods), forensic psychologist dated 22 July 2015;
	
	
	Report of Prof Woods dated 10 March 2016;
	
	
	Report of Dr Gary Banks, clinical psychologist dated 24 September 2015; and
	
	
	Bundle of correspondence from the accused’s treating medical practitioners.
	


Professor Woods


	
	Prof Woods was present at Court on 11 March 2016 and was cross-examined.
	
	
	In his first report, Prof Woods noted that the accused first sought treatment for symptoms of “pain over the cranium” and TGA in about 1998. By 2005, the accused’s treating doctors reported him suffering from “missing bits of memory”, vague headaches, episodes of giddiness and nausea. The accused gave a history to Prof Woods that the symptoms have become more intense, occur more frequently and involve this dissociative type states, during which he has no awareness of his surroundings or no memory of what occurred during the episode. The accused’s treating specialists believed that the episodes of TGA are caused by TIAs in response to arteriosclerosis.
	
	
	The accused gave a history that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in approximately 2004 and underwent a radical prostatectomy. The accused understood that the cancer has spread to his lymph glands and he was due to have surgery for the removal of a lymph gland in mid-June 2015. The accused reported that his cancer was incurable.
	
	
	On his initial presentation on 4 December 2014, Prof Woods opined that the accused was exhibiting symptoms of significantly impaired areas of cognitive function, in particular memory/recall, ability to formulate words, mild thought disorder, difficulty in forming words and verbal expression in general. He was suffering from elevated levels of psychomotor agitation and generally had a high level of anxiety with a depressed mood. Prof Woods noted that the accused had previously been diagnosed with Episodic Severe Depression and that an antidepressant had been prescribed, but the accused did not tolerate the medication as a result of its side-effects.
	
	
	The accused underwent initial medical examinations including a CT brain scan in 1998. Those investigations failed to detect any cause for the onset or continuation of the symptoms he was experiencing. By 2004 the symptoms had become more intense and persistent. The accused was experiencing recurrent episodes of TGA. In 2005 the accused’s treating neurologist, Dr O’Sullivan, made the diagnosis of TIAs caused by arteriosclerosis, for which there was some objective evidence of ischaemia in an MRI brain scan conducted on 18 October 2005.
	
	
	By 2011 the accused was reporting an increase in the occurrence of the TIAs and he was referred to Associate Prof Gerald Fogarty who confirmed the diagnosis given to him by Dr O’Sullivan.
	
	
	The accused reported to Prof Woods that his symptoms of TGA and episodes of impaired cognitive functioning have been more intense and occur with greater frequency since been charged with the matter before the court and since receiving advice that he had developed secondary cancers.
	
	
	The accused was reviewed again by Prof Woods on 10 January 2015. On that occasion the accused did not exhibit the same extreme level of impaired cognitive function however his mood was still severely depressed. The accused explained to Prof Woods that he had “good days” but always has some level of impaired cognitive function. The accused reported that his dissociative episodes were becoming more frequent.
	
	
	Prof Woods administered a number of neuropsychological tests. The Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale test indicated that the accused’s verbal skills were significantly depressed in relation to his other results. Prof Woods observed during the course of the testing that the accused suffered increasing difficulty in maintaining concentration, retrieval of previously learnt knowledge and the ability to verbally express himself. Prof Woods opined that the tests and his observations confirmed that the accused has specific areas of impaired cognitive functioning, for which there was objective confirmation prior to the accused being aware of the current allegations being made against him. Professor Woods administered The Test of Malingering Memory (TOMM). The TOMM failed to detect any suggestion that the accused was feigning his impaired memory functioning.
	
	
	Prof Woods was of the opinion that when the accused was first seen on 4 December 2014 that he was exhibiting a range of cognitive and emotional symptoms such that he was not fit to participate in or adequately instruct his legal representatives in a criminal trial. On 10 January 2015, when participating in the neuropsychological testing, Prof Woods was of the opinion that he had an impaired cognitive function, although not as severe as previously noted, but he was still not fit to participate in a trial.
	
	
	Prof Woods opined that the accused’s ability to verbally express himself and to understand questions put to him were significantly depressed relative to other areas of cognitive function. He also exhibited signs of mental fatigue and required frequent short rest periods. On the four occasions that the accused had been seen by Prof Woods his level of cognitive function was found to vary from significantly impaired to mildly impaired.
	
	
	In preparing his second report Prof Woods had available to him at the report of Dr Banks together with the results of testing conducted by Dr Banks and the short report from Prof Stricker, the accused’s treating urologist dated 22 January 2016. Prof Woods reviewed the accused again on 17 February 2016.
	
	
	Prof Woods reported the accused to be emotionally despondent, commenting that “it’s only a matter of time before I die”. The accused gave a history that Prof Stricker had advised him to avoid significant stress. The accused reported that he had chronically low energy levels and that he was easily mentally fatigued. The accused said that he found it necessary to have a sleep every day after lunch. The accused reported increasing concerns about the court proceedings and a growing fear that he would be unable to participate in them in any meaningful way. The accused reported that he was unable to separate the stressors in his life, being terminal cancer and the court proceedings, and that he was overwhelmed by both of them.
	
	
	Prof Woods noted that there was considerable common ground between himself and Dr Banks, to the effect that they both opined that in the absence of the stress of the court room the accused was able to satisfy the minimal requirements of the Presser test.
	
	
	Prof Woods noted that Dr Banks had conducted further neuropsychological testing on 4 September 2015. Some of that testing was conducted within 12 months of the initial testing, which gave rise to the potential of “practice effects” that may artificially inflate the results. Prof Woods was of the opinion that the testing conducted by Dr Banks was reflective of a deterioration of the accused’s cognitive function.
	
	
	Prof Woods came to the conclusion that he did not believe the accused was capable of sustained participation in a trial.
	
	
	Prof Woods gave evidence that people with TGA have an impaired memory. A common response is to engage in a process called competitive dissidence. This involves filling in gaps in the memory with something that the person thinks may have occurred or infers did occur based on other information available to them.
	
	
	Prof Woods gave evidence that the accused’s impaired cognitive function was demonstrated by him becoming easily fatigued and having a mild thought disorder characterised by having difficulty in recalling events with certain parts of history. As a result, he tended to digress from the point and become tangential leading to generalised confusion.
	
	
	Prof Woods gave evidence that the accused had deteriorated further since his second report and he did not believe that the accused would be capable of participating in a trial, in the way expected of an accused as at 11 March 2016.
	
	
	Prof Woods gave evidence in cross-examination that in his opinion the accused’s ability to participate in the trial process would be for no more than a morning at a time. He opined that the accused’s ability to participate would further decline as the trial went on day by day. In other words, the continuation of the trial would have a cumulative effect on the accused’s ability to participate in it.
	


Dr Gary Banks


	
	Dr Banks was present in Court on 11 March 2016 and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Dr Banks saw the accused once for a four and a half hour period at which time he conducted an interview and administered psychological testing. Dr Banks was of the opinion that this demonstrated that the accused was capable of concentration for a relatively lengthy period; taking into account the accused’s desire to push on and that the accused reported “good days” and “bad days” and that there may be a degree of variability depending upon how the accused felt on any given day.
	
	
	Dr Banks obtained a history that the accused had retired in about 2004 after his prostate cancer diagnosis and that since that time he occupied himself with playing golf, tennis, walking and managing his self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF).
	
	
	Dr Banks obtained a medical history similar to that obtained by Prof Woods and I will not repeat it. Dr Banks commented that during the course of obtaining this history the accused was observed to visibly struggle to recall the details of these episodes, particularly dates, the names of doctors and the results of the tests administered. Dr Banks observed that the accused closed his eyes and raised a hand to his head whilst trying to recall details. The accused told Dr Banks that he would usually ask his wife help in remembering such things.
	
	
	The accused told Dr Banks that he had more recently experienced mental gaps or blocks in his memory; for example driving his car to a destination and not being able to recall where it was parked. Dr Banks observed that the accused struggled to recall information, particularly names, dates and ages, however given time was often able to retrieve most of the information.
	
	
	Based on the history that he was given Dr Banks did not believe that the accused was evidencing symptoms sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for a Major Depressive Episode.
	
	
	Dr Banks administered a number of tests. Of note, his memory testing placed him in the low average range. His delayed recall and recognition abilities were marginally better than his immediate recall. The test indicated that he was trying to provide his best effort and was not suggestive that he was trying to embellish or exaggerate any day-to-day difficulties that he may have. Dr Banks accepted that the accused was not malingering.
	
	
	Dr Banks asked the accused a series of questions directed to eliciting information relevant to the application of the Presser criteria.
	
	
	In his consideration of the accused’s understanding as to the nature of the proceedings and to follow what is going on, Dr Banks reported that the accused did evidence some deficits in cognitive skills, particularly in abstract reasoning, auditory comprehension, associative and categorical thinking and short-term memory. He opined that these factors did not differ significantly for that typically expected of an age-related population. Dr Banks reported that his TGA and mental fatigue in combination with his anxiety was likely to make listening to questions, memory recall and being in unfamiliar environments somewhat challenging for the accused and may hinder some aspects of the proceedings. He considered the accused fit to plead but noted that the court will need to weigh carefully the issue of whether the accused is of sufficient health to be fit to sustain the challenges of a lengthy hearing.
	
	
	Dr Banks opined that the accused was likely to understand the importance of witness statements and understand expert scientific evidence presented in court in a general sense. Dr Banks opined that the accused’s assessing difficulties with auditory comprehension, simultaneous processing and abstract reasoning were likely to hinder his ability to answer questions regarding the evidence particularly in an alien and stressful environment. He reported that with appropriate explanation and time to process information the accused could manage questioning although that would be dependent upon how it was physically and mentally feeling on the day.
	
	
	Dr Banks concluded that the accused was not suffering from an apparent mental illness. He was suffering from symptoms of anxiety related to his cancer and prognosis. Dr Banks opined that the accused presented as a high functioning individual with a diagnosis of TGA. Psychometric testing showed a degree of impairment of short-term memory, and abstract reasoning in verbal concept formation which could be associated with age-related cognitive decline. The objective evidence indicated that the accused has experienced a number of short-term fluctuations in attention, concentration and memory which impacted his orientation to person time and place and those matters were within the diagnostic criteria for TGA.
	
	
	Dr Banks concluded that the accused could satisfy the criteria articulated in Presser. Dr Banks reported “[u]nder the pressured setting of the court environment, [the accused] may struggle with comprehending questions put to him whilst simultaneously processing information and recalling memories”.
	
	
	Dr Banks recommended that the accused should not repeatedly be taken through court proceedings and that he be given time to process information. In particular he should not be asked to recall specific details (e.g. names and dates) unless he has had time to prepare. Dr Banks opined that the Court will be need to be most sensitive to the additional and burden of fatigue during the course of the day’s hearing and the cumulative effect of the fatigue across multiple consecutive hearing days. It was suggested that the accused will need to be afforded multiple short breaks during the proceedings.
	
	
	Dr Banks gave evidence that the evidence of Prof Woods did not change his opinion that the accused was fit to stand trial.
	
	
	Dr Banks gave evidence that the accused was not capable of sitting through the trial process for more than half a day at a time. He accepted that a jury trial would add additional pressures to the accused’s ability to follow the proceedings. Dr Banks gave evidence that the Court would have to offer a sensitive approach to timing and scheduling, including expediting the trial to assist the accused.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Dr Banks expressed the opinion that the accused was not remotely impaired in his capacity to provide instructions. When asked what he meant by that, he qualified that answer as being a relative to the vagaries of human memory across the average population for any person to recall what happened 25 years ago. Dr Banks was then asked what he understood the accused’s defence to be. Dr Banks quoted from his notes as follows:
	


his understanding of the charges, it was a sexual assault on a 15 year old boy, six charges, and also involving a younger boy aged 10 to 12 years. The boy was on the boat that I owned, with his brother or someone else, I can’t remember, they were fishing. For the brother there was a committal hearing but he said that it is alleged that he had committed something but he said he didn’t see me, the brother, didn’t see me or the boy naked but they still proceeded with that. He went further into detail about taking the children to the boat and he went to a funeral, upon – it didn’t return from the funeral until approximately 4.30 and he said that’s when the sexual assault is alleged and that’s when he is putting forward a discrepancy of his place and those time periods and talked about sexual assault in greater detail, that it is alleged that he showered with him, that there was indecent touch. There was also a further allegation about being threatened – that he threatened with a gun the boys and that was coming from the boy but that was not pressed, he was not charged with that.


	
	Dr Banks accepted that his notes could have depicted the accused’s understanding of the allegations as they were put at the committal. Dr Banks further accepted that that part of the information that he was provided with seemed to be a recollection by the accused of a day that involved a funeral. Dr Banks did not make any enquiries to ascertain whether the funeral was relevant to the Crown’s allegations. Dr Banks accepted that it was possible the accused was confounding two entirely separate events. On the assumption that the funeral occurred on 22 January 1992, being a date outside the period in which the offences are alleged to have occurred, Dr Banks accepted as a possibility that the introduction by the accused of the funeral was an example of competitive dissidence as described by Prof Woods. Dr Banks gave evidence that he took what the accused had told him at face value in assessing whether he had a capacity to put forward a defence and he was not assessing whether that defence was good, bad or otherwise. Dr Banks accepted that the accused had difficulties with his memory based on his age, his neurological diagnosis, the stress related to his cancer and the stress of these proceedings.
	
	
	Dr Banks accepted that the accused would struggle in giving evidence in chief and being cross-examined. Dr Banks suggested that accommodation needed to be made by counsel and the Court to ask simple questions.
	
	
	Dr Banks gave evidence that he agreed with Prof Woods about the extent of the accused’s mental fatigue. He believed that the trial should be conducted in the morning only, for about two hours with a break in the middle. Dr Banks gave evidence that the accused would need to be monitored on a day-to-day basis as to the cumulative effect of the trial continuing.
	


Consideration

Fitness to be tried


	
	The purpose of the evidence of Prof Woods and Dr Banks is to provide the Court with evidence as to the accused’s cognitive functioning. It is for the Court to decide how to apply and weigh that evidence in determining if the accused is fit to be tried by reference to the Presser criteria.
	
	
	The psychologists agree that the accused suffers from impaired cognitive functioning. The dispute between them relates to the extent of that impairment, based on the psychometric testing and the cause of that impairment. Dr Banks was of the opinion that the impairment could be attributed to the ageing process and the stress attributable to his cancer and these proceedings, without reference to him suffering from TGA, although he accepts that the accused meets the diagnostic criteria for TGA.
	
	
	I prefer the evidence of Prof Woods for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, Prof Woods administered the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale test (WAIS) on 10 January 2015 in which the accused’s verbal comprehension index (VCI) was significantly depressed relative to other results. Dr Banks readministered the WAIS within 12 months, making the results susceptible to being less reliable by reason of the “practice effect”. Dr Banks did not refer to the results of the testing administered by Prof Woods or seek to explain any difference in the results, except to accept that the accused’s condition could be variable. Further, putting the concept of “practice effects” to one side, Prof Woods opined that the results of the tests administered by Dr Banks reflected a deterioration in the accused’s cognitive functioning. This opinion of Prof Woods was not disputed by Dr Banks when he gave his evidence.
	
	
	Second, Prof Woods has seen the accused on five occasions whereas Dr Banks has only seen him once. Prof Woods has carefully considered the objective evidence contained in the medical reports and has also had the opportunity to speak to the accused’s wife and has considered her observations of him. Those materials justify the conclusion that the accused’s cognitive function is in decline and that the progress of that decline has been more rapid since the diagnosis of prostate cancer and further since the accused was charged.
	
	
	Third, Dr Banks agrees with Prof Woods in a number of crucial respects namely that:
	


 


	
	Dr Banks observed the accused to struggle with recall the details of his medical investigations;
	
	
	Dr Banks opined that the accused’s day-to-day functioning varied;
	
	
	 The accused suffers from TGA. In his evidence Dr Banks opined that the accused’s mental condition could be explained by the ageing process and the stress related to his cancer and these proceedings, without reference to TGA. In my view that evidence did not give any or any adequate weight to the TGA diagnosis that was accepted by a number of the accused’s treating doctors. The reports from those treating doctors was important and objective evidence of the decline in the accused’s cognitive function at a time before he was diagnosed with cancer and prior to being charged with the matters now before the Court. Dr Banks’ ultimate acceptance of the diagnosis did not adequately reflect that the accused was already experiencing symptoms of cognitive decline prior to the introductions of the stressors that Dr Banks focused on.
	
	
	The accused will be a poor witness as a result of his cognitive impairment.
	



	
	In my view the accused’s memory is significantly impaired by reason of his diagnosis of TGA. In cross-examination Dr Banks accepted that there is a risk of competitive dissidence in the accused’s memory. In other words, the accused may be filling in the gaps in his memory caused by TGA with what he thought may have occurred or by inferring what occurred by reference to other established events. Dr Banks’ notes of the accused’s understanding of the allegations and how he answered them are indicative of this.
	
	
	Further, I am satisfied that the stressors of the accused’s diagnosis with prostate cancer and being charged with these matters has led to an acceleration of the accused’s mental decline. There may also be some element of age-related decline in his cognitive functioning.
	
	
	As a result I am not satisfied that the accused is able to give the necessary instructions to his counsel by providing a reliable version of the facts that is provided from his memory. It follows that he would not be able to give reliable evidence as to his version of the facts.
	
	
	The psychologists agree that the accused will have great difficulty in participating in a trial without modification to the ordinary sitting times and without consideration of his condition by counsel when giving his evidence.
	
	
	The psychologists agree that the accused could only follow the proceedings for a morning session for no longer than 1 hour at a time, with a break in the middle, and that the accused would need to be monitored as to his ability to cope on a cumulative basis with a likelihood that he would need a few days break after a few days of the hearing, dependent upon how he was feeling. This is likely to extend the trial for a considerable period. It had an initial estimate of 7-10 days and I anticipate that on the formula put forward by the psychologists the estimate would be about 20 two hour days with the likelihood that the trial would proceed for two or three days at a time. It is possible that the trial on that basis could extend over as much as a 7 week period. In those circumstances a trial by jury would be very impractical.
	
	
	It was conceded on behalf of the accused that if he was found to be fit to be tried that he would apply to be tried by judge alone. I am told that the Crown would consent to that application. I do not think that a judge alone trial would affect the estimate of the trial that I have set out.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the accused would be able to participate in the trial by following the evidence and providing instructions on it during the course of the trial. This would be even more so if the trial was to proceed over a lengthy period, which I think it inevitably will.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the measures suggested by Dr Banks to ameliorate the stresses of the accused when giving evidence are compatible with the reality of a criminal trial. I think that with even the best endeavours of a cross-examiner there is a real chance of unfairness to the accused, by reason of his impaired cognitive function.
	
	
	Accordingly, I find that the accused is not presently fit to be tried.
	


Stay of prosecution


	
	The accused submitted that irrespective of the Court’s decision on his fitness to be tried that a stay of the prosecution should be granted. At the end of argument, the accused relied on 3 grounds. First, that the accused’s prognosis from prostate cancer was poor and he had a limited life expectancy. This included that the stress of the continuation of the proceedings was likely to lead to the recurrence of his cancer. Second, the stress expected to be experienced from his referral to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (MHRT) was equivalent to that that could be expected from a trial. Third, that the prejudice that had been incurred by the delay in the prosecution of the proceedings could not be remedied.
	
	
	To make good the first and second grounds the accused relied on the letter from Prof Stricker dated 22 January 2016. The effect of that letter was that Prof Stricker had advised the accused to minimise his exposure to significant stress. The accused submitted that by inference the Court should accept that exposing the accused to significant stress would lead to the recurrence of his cancer and his premature death. I do not accept that submission because it involves a leap in reasoning for which there is no proper basis in the evidence. I accept that it is personally distressing for the accused to be facing these charges whilst also battling a terminal disease. At present his cancer is in remission. There is no evidence as to how long that may last for. On the present evidence I do not believe it is contrary to common humanity for the accused to be referred to the MHRT in relation to these matters.
	
	
	The third ground was developed in reply and was an in depth analysis of what was argued to be the limitations of section 165B Evidence Act 1995. The Court must proceed on the basis that a jury or a judge hearing the matter would take into account any warning given pursuant to section 165B. The warning that would be required in this matter, as postulated in the reply submissions of the accused is a significant one. The accused has clearly been significantly prejudiced by the delay in the prosecution of this matter, by reason of the matters set out therein.
	
	
	Bearing in mind that this matter is likely to proceed as a judge alone trial, if it ever does, I am satisfied that an appropriate section 165B warning would be taken into account by the tribunal of fact.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that I should exercise my discretion to stay the proceedings and the application for a stay will be refused.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I make are as follows:
	



	
	I find that the accused is not fit to be tried.
	
	
	I refer the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to section 14(a) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions Act) 1990 to determine if he is likely to become fit within 12 months.
	
	
	The matter is adjourned to 8 June 2017 before me for mention.
	
	
	The application for a stay is refused.

2769648,Ali Nasrallah v Regina [2016] NSWDC 101,"Judgment


	
	Ali Nasrallah (the accused) has been charged with one count of recklessly inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse pursuant to section 61K(a) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The charge arises out of an incident on 18 March 2014 at around 8:30am. It is alleged that the accused dragged the complainant by her shoulders, threw her on the couch, held her down by her shoulders and arms and attempted to engage in sexual intercourse with her.
	
	
	CT scans from 1998 and 2011 were interpreted to demonstrate an area of frontal lobe atrophy and on that basis the accused was diagnosed to be suffering from frontotemporal dementia (FTD); an organic form of dementia.
	
	
	It is submitted on behalf of the accused that by reason of his cognitive deficiencies and possible FTD he is unfit to be tried.
	


Relevant Law

Fitness to Plead


	
	Whether an accused person is unfit to be tried is determined by judge alone on the balance of probabilities: sections 11(1) and 6 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900.
	
	
	An inquiry into fitness is not an adversarial matter and no party bears any onus of proof: sections 12(2) and 12(3) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900.
	


Purpose


	
	The common law guarantees to an accused person the right a fair trial, one aspect of which is that a trial cannot proceed unless the accused person is fit to plead: Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1 at [64].
	
	
	It is a cardinal principle of the common law that no person can be tried for a crime unless they are in a mental condition to defend themselves: R v Dashwood [1943] 1 KB 1 at 4.
	
	
	Where there is an unresolved question of fitness to be tried, or the question of fitness is not determined properly in accordance with law, there is a fundamental failure in the trial process: Eastman at [62] and Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) (2003) 214 CLR 318 at [115]-[118] per Heydon J.
	
	
	Unfitness can arise by reason of the accused’s mental health or by reason of some physical or intellectual disability, or a combination of both: R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at [284]. The condition may be entirely physical, for example, coronary artery disease. There does not need to be any underlying illness or formal diagnosis as long as there is an impaired or disordered mental process: R v Sexton (2000) 77 SASR 405 at [46] and [54].
	


Test


	
	In determining whether an accused is fit to be tried the Court is to consider whether they meet certain minimum standards articulated in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. In order to be fit to stand trial an accused is required:
	


“…to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to that charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.”


	
	The test to determine fitness must be applied in a reasonable and commonsense way: Presser at 48; Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 at 8.
	
	
	In determining the question of fitness the judge must take into account not only the present condition of the accused, but also the likely future condition of the accused having regard to the estimated length of the trial: Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230.
	


Evidence


	
	Tendered on the application was a Crown bundle containing:
	



	
	A copy of the indictment;
	
	
	Crown case statement;
	
	
	Reports of Dr Ashkar dated 24 May 2016, 23 May 2016, 27 November 2016;
	
	
	Reports of Dr Pulman dated 20 May 2016, 10 May 2016, 6 October 2015;
	
	
	Reports of Dr Furst dated 22 May 2016, 9 March 2016;
	
	
	Report of Professor Hodges dated 10 November 2016;
	
	
	Reports of Dr Hassan dated 20 August 2012, 17 May 2012, 2 April 2012 and 29 September 2011;
	
	
	Report of Dr Allam dated 22 October 2011; and
	
	
	CT scan results dated 9 June 2011 and 2 February 1998.
	



	
	The Court also received an email from Professor Hodges dated 25 May 2015, a copy of an apprehended violence order made against the accused on 28 March 2014, an affidavit of Joanne Pollock dated 23 May 2016, an affidavit of Monika Brayovic dated 23 May 2016, and a transcript and video of the electronically recorded interview between the police and the accused.
	


Dr Richard Furst


	
	Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, was present at the fitness inquiry and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Dr Furst met with the accused and an interpreter on 8 December 2015 for around an hour.
	
	
	In December 2015 the accused was taking Seroquel, Kalma and Xanax.
	
	
	Dr Furst noted that the accused was vague with respect to personal details, reported forgetting and losing things, and regularly asked the interpreter to repeat questions. The accused reported sometimes feeling paranoid however Dr Furst noted that there were no signs of psychosis.
	
	
	Dr Furst found that there was evidence that the accused had cognitive impairment with deficits in his memory, attention, and processing speed. Dr Furst noted that the performance of the accused varied which could suggest an exaggeration of symptoms and/or questionable effort. Dr Furst was unable to formally diagnose the accused with FTD, however found that the cognitive deficits of the accused were suggestive of the early stages of dementia.
	
	
	Dr Furst opined that the accused did not have an adequate understanding of the charge against him, plea options, the role of participants in court, court processes, or the substantial effect of evidence against him. The accused would be likely to struggle to raise a defence or instruct his lawyers.
	
	
	Dr Furst determined that the accused was unfit to be tried.
	
	
	Dr Furst provided a supplementary report in which stated that viewing the ERISP of the accused did not change the opinion given in his first report.
	
	
	Giving evidence in Court Dr Furst stated that he was now less clear on the question of fitness, considering that it was borderline between whether the accused was fit or unfit. Dr Furst gave evidence that he would not exclude exaggeration or a depressive condition as the causes of the accused’s symptoms and cognitive deficiency. In Dr Furst’s opinion the inherent stresses of court would be likely to make the accused’s symptoms worse.
	
	
	Dr Furst explained that Seroquel is an anti-psychotic drug that has fatigue and sedation as side effects. Similarly, Xanax has sedation and impairment of short term memory as side effects.
	
	
	Dr Furst opined that fatigue would be an issue with the accused needing breaks after around an hour in court. Dr Furst opined that the accused would be assisted by others speaking slowly, using simple language, having the benefit of an interpreter and having a support person in court.
	


Dr Peter Ashkar


	
	Dr Peter Ashkar, forensic psychologist and clinical neuropsychologist, was present at the fitness inquiry and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar met with the accused with an interpreter on 30 October 2014 and 13 November 2014 for approximately 4 hours in total. He also met with Ms Monica Brayovic for approximately half an hour.
	
	
	At the time of assessment the accused was not fully oriented and was unable to tell Dr Ashkar the date or where they were. The accused had difficulty with spatial orientation and navigation around the office where the assessment took place. The accused had difficulty sustaining attention for more than 30 minutes and recalling instructions and information from memory. The accused performed poorly on cognitive screening tests and it was reported that his cognitive impairments interfere with his independence in carrying out daily activities. These cognitive impairments could not be explained by language/cultural factors, emotional/psychiatric factors or medications being taken by the accused.
	
	
	According to Ms Brayovic the accused began to exhibit cognitive difficulties in around 2008 or 2009. At the time of the report the accused required prompting to perform basic personal care tasks, slept for most of the day, had poor appetite, and became angry for no apparent reason. She had been taking care of the basic needs of the accused for approximately nine months at the date of the report.
	
	
	Responses of the accused to a screening questionnaire of psychological distress showed him to have extremely severe levels of depression and anxiety, as well as severe levels of stress.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar opined that the accused met the diagnostic criteria for a Major Neurocognitive Disorder, and that results on a range of tests point to probable FTD. Dr Ashkar stated that based on information provided by Ms Brayovic that the accused appeared to be at the ‘severe’ stage of functional dependence and behavioural change.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar opined that the accused could fulfil some of the Presser criteria, namely he could understand and plead to the charge, and understand generally the nature of court proceedings. However due to his deficiencies in abstract understanding and reasoning the accused would not be able to understand generally what is going on in court, put forward a defence, exercise his right to challenge, instruct his lawyers or understand the substantial effect of evidence against him.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar determined that the accused was not fit to stand trial at the time of preparing the report or at any time in the future.
	
	
	In his report dated 23 May 2016, Dr Ashkar opined that in the ERISP the accused appeared to sustain his concentration, and had reasonable recall of relevant events. The accused appeared to understand the nature of the charges against him and Dr Ashkar concluded that there was little in the accused’s behaviour that would raise concerns about his fitness to be tried.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar met with the accused again and administered tests in order to write a supplementary report dated 24 May 2016.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar concluded that there was compelling evidence that the accused was exaggerating his cognitive difficulties. The accused demonstrated reasonable comprehension and communication skills during the assessment which suggest that he would be able to follow generally the course of a trial and assist with a defence. The accused understood the nature of the charge against him when it was explained, was clear about his intention to plead not guilty and understood the consequences of adhering to this plea.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar opined that the accused has difficulties sustaining attention and suffers from cognitive fatigue. Provided that the court can accommodate for these difficulties, Dr Ashkar could not see any reason that the accused should not be tried.
	
	
	Giving evidence in court Dr Ashkar stated that the accused consistently performed within the normal limits on tests of declarative memory. [1]  Dr Ashkar opined that the accused would benefit strongly from visual aids to support his ability to understand what is happening in court and that it would be prudent for lawyers of the accused to check regularly throughout each day of trial that the accused has understood what has happened in court. Dr Ashkar agreed with Dr Furst that any symptoms experienced by the accused would likely be exacerbated by stress.
	


Dr Susan Pulman


	
	Dr Susan Pulman, forensic psychologist and clinical neuropsychologist, was present at the fitness inquiry and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Dr Pulman met with the accused on two occasions on 2 June 2015 (accompanied by his sister) and 14 July 2015 (at which an interpreter was present). Dr Pulman described the accused as being uncooperative, disengaged and disinterested in her report of 6 October 2015. For this reason it was not possible to conduct a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The accused was oriented as to time but not place. His attention and working memory was intact.
	
	
	Dr Pulman reviewed the ERISP video footage and noted that the accused was able to remember his address, and appeared to understand and respond to police questions. Dr Pulman opined that this behaviour is not consistent with the cognitive decline that would be expected in an individual with dementia.
	
	
	Dr Pulman reported that the accused stated his innocence, was able to explain the difference between guilty and not guilty, understood the role of the judge and appeared to understand the role of the prosecutor when it was explained. The accused did not understand the role of the jury.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar had opined that the accused was at the severe stage of FTD progression. However, Dr Pulman noted that it would be unusual for a patient with severe dementia to live alone or drive. Like Dr Ashkar, Dr Pulman noted that the accused reported symptoms of extremely severe depression and anxiety and moderate stress.
	
	
	The performance of the accused on tests of effort varied.
	
	
	Dr Pulman determined that diagnosis of the accused was uncertain but noted that there was clear evidence of frontal lobe atrophy and behavioural symptoms consistent with FTD. Such symptoms included socially inappropriate behaviours, apathy and wanting sweet foods. However Dr Pulman explained that patients with FTD typically do not experience much memory loss until the latter stages of the disease, experience difficulty sustaining attentional focus, lack insight, and typically do not report severe depression. The accused has reported memory problems, did not appear to Dr Pulman to have difficulties with maintaining attention, exhibited insight and has reported severe depression.
	
	
	Dr Pulman believed that the inconsistencies in cognitive ability suggest exaggeration of deficiencies. She was unable to formulate an opinion as to the fitness of the accused.
	
	
	In her report of 20 May 2016, Dr Pulman concluded that the accused was likely, on the balance of probabilities, to be fit to stand trial.
	


Professor John Hodges


	
	Professor Hodges is a Professor of Cognitive Neurology and international expert on FTD.
	
	
	Prof Hodges met with the accused, who was accompanied by Ms Brayovic and an interpreter, on 3 November 2015. The accused was found by Prof Hodges to be unable or unwilling to converse.
	
	
	The accused reported forgetting things, however denied experiencing difficulty with communication, organisation or self-care. Ms Brayovic reported noticing symptoms in the accused in around 2006. The predominant symptom of the accused was reported as apathy with the accused having minimal social contact, requiring persuasion to shower and change clothes, and exhibiting poor motivation.
	
	
	Based on Ms Brayovic’s reports, Prof Hodges noted that the accused had possible FTD. He explained this to mean that symptoms of FTD are present without evidence of brain atrophy. This is an unstable diagnostic category with only about 50% of patients progressing with the syndrome over 3 years. Prof Hodges stated that the symptoms experienced by the accused may also have been attributable to a range of serious psychiatric disorders.
	
	
	Prof Hodges noted that it would be extremely unusual for a person as ‘impaired’ as the accused when it comes to performing simple tasks to be living alone.
	
	
	Prof Hodges concluded that the balance of probability is against a diagnosis of FTD due to the presence of features not seen in FTD patients such as disorientation and poor visual-spatial function), normal MRI and inability to exclude other psychiatric disorders.
	
	
	In an email response to further questions posed to Prof Hodges it was explained that the judgment of atrophy on an MRI is subjective.
	


Dr Bassel Hassan


	
	In his report of 29 September 2011, Dr Hassan noted that the accused had suffered anxiety and low mood for at least a few years. The accused reported some symptoms of paranoia. The cognitive deficits of the accused were reported to have commenced a few years after a car accident that occurred in 2004. Dr Hassan opined that the accused’s cognitive deficits were relatively mild, but not normal and “quite worrying for early onset dementia.”
	
	
	In his report of 17 May 2012, Dr Hassan opined that the most likely diagnosis of the accused was FTD, but that he had some reservations.
	
	
	In his report of 20 August 2012, Dr Hassan, having reviewed MRI images, noted a significant amount of frontal atrophy consistent with FTD.
	


Dr Mohammed Allam


	
	Dr Allam reported on 22 October 2011, that the accused displayed symptoms of frontal lobe dementia/atrophy and required further neuropsychiatric assessment.
	


Monika Brayovic


	
	The accused’s sister, Ms Brayovic, was present at the fitness inquiry and was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	In her affidavit affirmed 23 May 2016 Ms Brayovic deposed that she noticed the accused beginning to experience difficulties with his memory in around 2010 or 2011.
	
	
	Around 12 to 18 months ago the eldest son of the accused, Hussein, moved in with the accused to assist with his care. Ms Brayovic and Hussein share responsibility for caring for the accused including paying his bills and purchasing things that he wants.
	
	
	Ms Brayovic buys groceries for the accused and cooks his lunch and dinner every day.
	
	
	Ms Brayovic deposed that the accused stopped driving around 9 months ago due to his poor concentration and tendency to get lost.
	


Joanne Pollock


	
	The solicitor of the accused, Joanne Pollock, was present at the fitness inquiry and was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	In her affidavit affirmed 23 May 2016, Ms Pollock deposed that she had had carriage of this matter since 16 April 2015 and had met with the accused on at least 4 occasions.
	
	
	Ms Pollock deposed that the accused has provided some instructions and can communicate how he intends to plead. In meetings the accused exhibited little understanding of what he was charged with, the trial process, the role of participants in court other than herself and the Judge. The accused was unable to remember concepts after they have been explained many times and has difficulty with concentration.
	


Consideration


	
	The purpose of the medical evidence is to provide the Court with evidence as to the accused’s cognitive functioning. It is for the Court to decide how to apply and weigh that evidence in determining if the accused is fit to be tried by reference to the Presser criteria.
	
	
	It is uncontroversial that the accused first sought treatment for anxiety and depression in about 2011. At that time he gave a history of suffering from those symptoms for a few years. The seeking of that treatment corresponds with his sister’s observations that he suffered psychological effects after the breakdown of his marriage.
	
	
	The accused’s treating doctors referred him for CT scans of his brain. Those scans were interpreted to reveal an organic cause of his symptoms, which was subsequently identified as FTD.
	
	
	During the course of gathering material to assess the accused’s fitness to stand trial, Dr Pulman suggested that he be examined by Prof Hodges, an international expert on FTD. Prof Hodges conducted an MRI scan of the brain. Prof Hodges was of the opinion that the MRI did not support a probable diagnosis. Prof Hodges diagnosed possible FTD, which I understand means that there is a 50% chance that he would progress to a probable diagnosis within 3 years. Prof Hodges reported that it was possible that the accused was suffering from a serious psychiatric illness (such as Major Depression or schizophrenia) the symptoms of which were mimicking FTD. Dr Furst could not find any evidence of the accused suffering from a serious psychiatric illness.
	
	
	Considering all of the medical evidence I am left with the conclusions that the accused does not suffer from FTD or a serious psychiatric illness. The psychologists agree that the accused is feigning the extent of his symptoms or deliberately not making a reasonable effort to undertake their tests.
	
	
	There is some anecdotal evidence that he has suffered from symptoms since at least 2011. I am not satisfied on the evidence that the accused’s symptoms are affecting him to such an extent that he cannot satisfy the Presser requirements.
	
	
	I have considered the ERISP that the accused participated in on 18 March 2014, which was the day of the alleged incident giving rise to the charges. It should be noted that the accused was not provided with an interpreter for the purpose of conducting the ERISP, despite the fact that he indicated he needed an interpreter on a number of occasions. There were some clear misunderstandings on the part of the accused during the course of the interview. These are adequately explained by the unavailability of an interpreter. However, the accused in my view gave a good account of his version of the allegations in a narrative form, for example A159-A164 inclusive, and could then answer specific clarifying questions on the narrative that he had given, for example A173-A185.
	
	
	I have carefully considered the evidence of the solicitor for the accused and it appears to suggest that the accused has some difficulty in understanding some elements of the procedure and concentrating for periods of time. It will probably be appropriate to make some concessions to assist the accused in the trial by taking breaks after 1 hour of hearing time, but that matter should ultimately be assessed by the trial judge at the appropriate time.
	
	
	On the evidence as it currently stands I am satisfied that the accused can satisfy the Presser criteria and is fit to be tried. The law requires the Court to assess his fitness to be tried on an ongoing basis and it may be appropriate for the Court to revisit this finding at a later time in the proceedings.
	
	
	The orders I make are:
	



	
	I find that the accused is presently fit to be tried.
	
	
	The matter is listed on 17 June 2016 to fix a trial date.

		09 June 2016",2016-06-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769653,Regina v Roxanne Carmella Brincat [2016] NSWDC 100,"Judgment


	
	Roxanne Carmella Brincat (the offender) appears for sentence to one count of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to section 113(2) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of steal property from a dwelling contrary to section 148 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The sentence proceedings are listed before me because I am part heard in the sentence proceedings of the co-offender Diana Bazzi.
	
	
	The offender makes an application that I disqualify myself from hearing the sentence proceedings on the ground of apprehended bias.
	


The test to be applied


	
	The legal test is set out in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 343 [6], where Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ stated:
	


… a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.


	
	There is a distinction between “an incautious remark or expression of a tentative opinion” and the kind of comment that would enliven a judge’s duty to refrain from hearing a matter: British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Laurie (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [140] per Heydon, Keifel and Bell JJ.
	


The fair-minded observer


	
	The fair-minded observer does not make snap judgements: Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 494 [17]. He or she is taken to be reasonable: Johnson at [12]. He or she knows commonplace things and is neither complacent, nor unduly sensitive or suspicious: Johnson at [53]; Helow v Home Secretary [2008] 1 WLR 2416 at [2], [14] and [39]. Knowledge of all of the circumstances of the case must be attributed to the fair-minded observer: Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association (1983) 151 CLR 288 at 293-4; Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1990) 170 CLR 70 at 87-8 and 95.
	
	
	Where the decision maker is a judicial officer the fair-minded observer will have regard to the fact that a judicial officer’s training, tradition and oath equip the officer with the ability to discard the irrelevant, immaterial and the prejudicial: Johnson at [12], citing Vakauta v Kelly in the NSW Court of Appeal adopted by the High Court in (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 584-5.
	
	
	In Helow, Lord Hope of Craigshead said at [2]-[3]:
	


the Observer who is fair-minded is the sort of person who always reserves judgement on every point until she has seen and fully understood both sides of the argument. She is not unduly sensitive or suspicious… Her approach must not be confused with that of the person who has brought the complaint.… The assumptions that the complainer makes are not to be attributed to the Observer unless they can be justified objectively. But she is not complacent either. She knows that fairness requires that a judge must be, and must be seen to be, unbiased. She knows that judges, like anybody else, have their weaknesses…


	
	Then there is the attribute that the observer is “informed”. It makes the point that, before she takes a balanced approach to any information she is given, she will take the trouble to inform herself on all matters that are relevant. She is the sort of person who takes the trouble to read the text of an article as well as the headlines. She is able to put whatever she had read or seen into its overall social, political or geographical context. She is fair-minded, so she will appreciate that the context forms an important part of the material which she must consider before passing judgement.
	


The distinction between predisposition and prejudgment


	
	The rule against bias, actual or apprehended, is directed to prejudgement incapable of being altered by evidence or argument. It is not directed to predisposition capable of being swayed by evidence or argument. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [71]-[72], Gleeson CJ and Gummow J said:
	


Decision-makers, including judicial decision-makers, sometimes approach their task with a tendency of mind, or predisposition, sometimes one that has been publicly expressed, without being accused or suspected of bias. The question is not whether that a decision-makers mind is blank; it is whether it is open to persuasion… Natural justice does not require the absence of any predisposition or inclination for or against an argument or conclusion.


	
	The High Court has accepted that a judge should not sit silently throughout proceedings with the result that the judge’s views about the issues, problems and technical difficulties involved in the case remain unknown by the parties until they emerged as final conclusions in the judgment: Vakuata v Kelly at 635.
	


The steps involved in applying the test


	
	In Ebner, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [8] postulated two steps as follows:
	


First, it requires the identification of what is said might lead a [decision-maker] to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a [decision-maker] has an “interest” in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision-making is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed.


	
	The last sentence of that passage suggests that there is an additional third step. In Isbester v Knox City Council (2015) 89 ALJR 609 at [59] Gageler J set out the three steps as follows:
	


Step one is identification of the factor which it is hypothesised might cause a question to be resolved otherwise than as a result of a neutral evaluation of the merits. Step two is articulation of how the identified factor might cause that deviation from a neutral evaluation of the merits. Step three is consideration of the reasonableness of the apprehension of that deviation being caused by that factor in that way.


	
	In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng at [185] Hayne J set out a related but differently expressed three-step analysis, as follows:
	


Saying that a decision maker has prejudiced or will prejudice an issue, or even saying that there is a real likelihood that a reasonable observer might reach that conclusion, is to make a statement which has several distinct elements at its roots. First, there is the contention that the decision maker has an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the particular case. Secondly, there is the contention that a decision maker will apply that opinion to the matter in issue. Thirdly, there is the contention that the decision maker will do so without giving the matter fresh consideration in the light of whatever may be the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. Most importantly, there is an assumption that the question which is said to have been prejudged is one which should be considered afresh in relation to the particular case.

Factual background


	
	The offences for which the offender is to be sentenced were committed on 20 September 2014.
	
	
	The offender and Ms Bazzi were arrested on 24 September 2014 and refused bail.
	
	
	Ms Bazzi was on parole. The State Parole Authority revoked parole and she served the balance of parole being 3 months and 23 days. She was eligible for release on 15 January 2015. She was granted bail on 15 February 2015 to allow her to be admitted to the residential rehabilitation program conducted by Odyssey House.
	
	
	On 13 October 2014 the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months for a second offence of drive whilst disqualified. On 7 May 2015 the offender was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 12 months with a non-parole period of 7 months to date from 12 February 2015 for a string of dishonesty offences. The last non-parole period expired on 11 September 2015; she was bail refused on these matters after that time.
	
	
	On 2 October 2015 I adjourned the sentence proceedings of the co-offender to 2 June 2016 for sentence. I continued her bail on condition that she continue to participate in the residential rehabilitation program offered by Odyssey House, pursuant to section 11 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offender was committed for trial in the District Court on the matters before the Court and they were listed for trial to commence on 9 November 2015. On the first day of the trial the offender pleaded guilty before Frearson DCJ.
	
	
	On 17 March 2016 the offender’s matter was listed for sentence before me. The Crown submitted on that occasion that it would be prudent to adjourn the offender’s sentence proceedings to today, so that the matters could be heard together in accordance with the line of authority in Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67. I granted the Crown’s application and adjourned both matters to 2 June 2016 to be dealt with at the same time. I referred the offender to another Judge to hear a bail application that the offender wanted to make. The offender was granted bail on that day.
	


The adjournment application


	
	In the course of that adjournment application, it was submitted on behalf of the offender that she would be prejudiced if the matter was adjourned because she was in custody and it would be unfair for her to remain in custody to see if Ms Bazzi’s rehabilitation in the community had been successful.
	
	
	In support of that submission counsel for the offender tendered the JIRS sentencing statstics and submitted that 39% of offenders did not go to gaol for the offence before the Court. The following exchange occurred:
	


HIS HONOUR:   That does not apply to your client, clearly.

BOLAND:      Your Honour…

HIS HONOUR:   You can’t be serious.


	
	In my decision to adjourn the sentence proceedings I said, after indicating that totality was an important factor in sentencing this particular offender:
	


The co-offender’s sentence is listed on 2 June 2016, which is a little over two months from today. Taking into account the seriousness of the two offences, to which the offender has pleaded guilty, and in particular the number of matters on the Form 1, I do not think that the offender will be disadvantaged in relation to being kept in custody until 2 June 2016 because I expect that any sentence imposed would involve a minimum term of at least that long. I say only at least because I am not aware of the full circumstances presented on behalf of this offender and I have not prejudged the matter in any way. But it seems to me to be unlikely in the extreme that any penalty imposed will not involve at least a non-parole period until 2 June 2016.

The e-mail correspondence


	
	On 21 May 2016 the solicitor for the offender sent an email to my Associate that was copied to Ms Ward solicitor of the DPP and to counsel for the offender in the following terms:
	


We have carriage of the sentence proceedings of Roxanne Brincat, listed in the Sydney District Court on 2 June 2016. Her co-accused Ms Bazzi, who is presently on a section 11 bond, is also listed for sentence on that day.

On the previous occasion (17 March 2016), Ms Brincat's matter was listed for sentence. The Crown made an adjournment application which was granted by his Honour. During the course of that application his Honour made certain observations in relation to Ms Brincat's likely outcome on sentence.

Given what passed in that application, his Honour considered it appropriate that he recuse himself for Ms Brincat's subsequent bail application (after he had granted the adjournment application).

As it happened, Judge Zahra granted Ms Brincat conditional bail on that day. She presently remains on bail.

We would be grateful if you could please advise whether his Honour proposes to maintain carriage of Ms Brincat's sentence proceedings.

If his Honour does intend to retain carriage of Ms Brincat’s sentence we would kindly ask that the matter be listed before his Honour this Wednesday 25 May 2016 in order for an application be made.


	
	On 23 May 2016 my Associate replied to the solicitor in the following terms:
	


It is unclear from your email if the DPP consents to you contacting me.

His Honour has asked me not to respond to your email until that matter is clarified.


	
	On 30 May 2016 the solicitor for the offender sent an email to my Associate that was copied to Ms Ward solicitor of the DPP and to counsel for the offender in the following terms:
	


I note that I have attempted today to contact Ms Ward of the DPP to notify her and seek her consent for this communication. I have not been able to reach her however she is CC’d into this communication and I understand from previous communication with her that she takes no issue with this form of communication to his Honour.

As of lunchtime today, I was notified by Mr Boland of Counsel that The CCA Registrar has listed an unrelated but urgent 5F interlocutory appeal hearing in another matter that Mr Boland is briefed in on this Thursday 2 June 2016. I am informed that the events that gave rise to this appeal only occurred last Wednesday 25 May 2016. This appeal clashes with Ms Brincat’s sentencing hearing.

As was foreshadowed previously, an application for his Honour to disqualify himself from these proceedings will be filled imminently. These are difficult applications to make, and I dislike making them. It is my every intention and effort to finalise a notice of motion and affidavit in support of this application before the close of business today.

We suggest that in these circumstances It would be especially expedient and appropriate for Mr Boland to remain in the matter. This is because he has been in the matter from its infancy, and importantly he was also counsel present on 17 March 2016—the proceedings that will be the evidentiary subject of the disqualification application.

I am aware Mr Boland is available on June: 9,16,23,30 July: 1, 14,15,21,28 and August: 4,5,11,18,19,25. If none of those dates are suitable please let me know and I can make further enquiries.

In these circumstances would his Honour be amenable to adjourning this matter to one of the above nominated dates?

If I can provide further information or assistance please contact me anytime on 0433 462 453.


	
	Later that day the solicitor for the offender sent another email to my Associate that was copied to Ms Ward solicitor of the DPP and to counsel for the offender in the following terms:
	


As mentioned in my email of earlier today, please find attached Notice of Motion, Supporting Affidavit and Annexures with regard to the application for HH to recuse himself from Ms Brincat’s sentence.

These documents will be filed with your registry tomorrow.

I note that the annexures are an unsigned copy as the file size for the scan version is very large. They are a true copy of the annexures that will be signed and filed tomorrow.


	
	On 31 May 2016 my Associate replied to the solicitor in the following terms:
	


Any application or Notice of Motion for His Honour to disqualify himself from these proceedings can be made on 2 June before His Honour.

I note receipt of the Notice of Motion and supporting material.


	
	On 31 May 2016 the solicitor for the offender sent an email to my Associate that was copied to Ms Ward solicitor of the DPP and to counsel for the offender in the following terms:
	


Thank you for your email. Further to the counsel availability issues that I raised via email yesterday, I have today ascertained that Mr Boland’s urgent and unrelated 5F appeal at the CCA is listed for 10:00 and is the only matter to be heard.

I have spoken in person today to Ms Ward, DPP solicitor with carriage, and she informed me that the Crown would not be opposed to a later marking on Thursday.

In these circumstances can I please kindly enquire if his honour would be minded to list Ms Brincat’s matter at 12.00PM or 2.00PM on 2 June 2016


	
	On 1 June 2016 my Associate replied to the solicitor in the following terms:
	


His Honour will have Ms Brincat's matter listed at 12pm.

In the event that Mr Boland is unavailable at that time, the matter will proceed. The matters were listed on 17 March 2016 and should be concluded as expeditiously as possible.

His Honour intends to proceed with the hearing of Ms Bazzi's matter at 10am, subject to the views of the DPP and the representatives of Ms Bazzi.

The offender’s arguments


	
	The offender’s arguments can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	First, that my exchange with counsel about the offender not being dealt with by way of a full-time custodial sentence amounted to a prejudgment of the application of section 5 Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 to the case.
	
	
	Second, that my judgment on the adjournment application stated that offender would not have served sufficient time in custody on 2 June 2016.
	
	
	Third, that my decision to recuse myself from hearing the bail application was determinative of the present application.
	
	
	Fourth, the email correspondence between the solicitor for the offender and my Associate was demonstrative of my unwillingness to be fair to the offender and was demonstrative that I had pre-judged this application and had no intention of recusing myself.
	


Consideration


	
	The decision to adjourn the sentence proceedings to 2 June 2016 to have the matters proceed together was based on ordinary and sound principles.
	
	
	That decision was based on the evidence tendered and the submissions made on behalf of the offender by her counsel on the application. The subjective material was limited to two letters relating to the care of the offender’s child by her father. Whilst counsel referred to a psychologist’s report it was not tendered on the application.
	
	
	I was taken to the offender’s record. The record demonstrated that the offender had been sentenced to two terms of imprisonment following her arrest on these charges. The first term of imprisonment of 9 months with a 6 month non-parole period for an offence of drive whilst disqualified dated from 13 October 2014, about 3 weeks after her arrest. The second was an aggregate term of imprisonment of 12 months with a non-parole period of 7 months to date from 12 February 2015. I say a string of offences because it is difficult to know the precise number from looking at the record. The string comprised of approximately 20 offences, most of which were dishonestly obtain property by deception. I was unaware of the facts of these offences. Mr Boland did not tell me by way of submission what the facts of those offences were or what if anything he was instructed about them. The second term was partly accumulated on the first term by 4 months.
	
	
	The first term of imprisonment was confirmed on appeal. The offender did not appeal against the second term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Based on the material before the Court on 17 March 2016 and the 6 months and 23 days that the offender had spent in custody in relation to these offences only, it was inevitable that the offender would receive a full-time custodial sentence for these offences. A suspended sentence or an Intensive Corrections Order (ICO) would have been a more onerous sentence than dealing with the matter by way of a custodial sentence.
	
	
	The matters before the Court were more serious than the matters for which she had received the terms of imprisonment. On the material before the Court, it could not have been reasonably submitted that the offender should receive a good behaviour bond or community service, because those outcomes would not have reflected the objective seriousness of the offences committed and either of those results would have resulted in an injustice to the offender.
	
	
	The fair-minded lay observer would have viewed my exchange with counsel on the statistics as the expression of an incautious remark or the expression of a tentative view. After making the remark I listened to the other submissions made on behalf of the offender. They did not persuade me from the view that the offender would not be prejudiced by the adjournment.
	
	
	The offender’s argument on this application did not expose the basis for the submission that my decision on the adjournment application could lead the fair-minded lay observer to conclude that on 2 June 2016:
	



	
	The offender would not have spent sufficient time in custody;
	
	
	I would send her back to gaol for any period, if she was granted bail on 17 March 2016;
	
	
	That I would not assess the case on its merits on 2 June 2016.
	



	
	Such exposition is required by reference to the authorities quoted in [11]-[13] above.
	
	
	Rather, the offender’s submissions relied on the assertion that the matters in [44(a)-(c)] were clearly established.
	
	
	In deciding the adjournment application I was invited by the offender to find that she was prejudiced, because she was in custody when Ms Bazzi was in residential rehabilitation. I was invited by counsel for the offender to make a comparison between the offender and Ms Bazzi, whom counsel described as ‘at liberty in the community’. That was not an accurate comparison. The correct legal position was that Ms Bazzi had been required to reside at Odyssey House and to participate in the program offered there for a period in excess of 1 year. The conditions at Odyssey House are known to the Court to be quasi-custodial and the law is that in those circumstances a form of punishment has been imposed on Ms Bazzi and she is likely to be entitled to a significant discount on penalty: R v Cartwright (1987) 17 NSWLR 243.
	
	
	On the basis of the limited subjective material put forward on the adjournment application, I decided that the offender was not prejudiced.
	
	
	Objectively viewed, my judgment on the adjournment application was only capable of being taken as an indication that had I dealt with the sentence on 17 March 2016 that the offender would have been required to serve a minimum term expiring on or after 2 June 2016 on what I knew at that point in time. That indication was qualified in 2 important respects, first that I was unaware of the offender’s subjective circumstances and second that I had not prejudged the matter.
	
	
	On the basis of that indication I believed that it would be inaappropriate for me to hear a bail application and I referred that application to another judge. That was the fair approach to the offender’s bail application. But my decision on the adjournment application could not be construed as constituting any apprehended bias beyond 2 June 2016 and I would not be dealing with the offender again, based on my own decision until at least that date.
	
	
	I must now sentence the offender on the basis that she is on bail. There is nothing in what I said on 17 March 2016 that could amount to any indication that I would send the offender back to gaol without considering all of the material available at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	In the event that the interpretation relied on by the offender is viable, which I do not believe it to be, then the fair-minded lay observer would be faced with a choice between the two alternatives. The objective interpretation that I have set out is consistent with me exercising my judicial obligations in accordance with the merits of the case and is thereby likely to be preferred by the fair-minded lay observer.
	
	
	Finally, I come to the offender’s submissions based on the email correspondence between the solicitor for the offender and my Associate. I will restate what I put on the record during the argument of this application that my Associate had my express authority to send the emails that he did. Those submissions can be rejected for two shortly stated reasons.
	
	
	First, it is clear that the solicitor for the offender did not have the DPP’s consent to communicate with my Associate about whether or not I intended to recuse myself from hearing the sentence proceedings. The communication was arguably in breach of rule 22.5 of the Uniform Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015; a provision that is reflected in rule 54 of the Uniform Barristers Conduct Rules 2015. The submission that, “[I]n the present age, it is, with respect, uncontroversial for parties to email a Judge’s Associate, and in so doing ‘cc’ other parties to the proceedings in the email” is ignorant of the ethical obligations imposed by the professional conduct rules. The rules exist to preserve the impartiality of the judiciary: Tugrul v Tarrants Financial Consultants Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1971. Accordingly, my Associate’s response to the solicitor’s email was appropriate.
	
	
	Second, the unavailability of counsel is not usually and not in this case an appropriate reason for an adjournment of proceedings. The adjournment of the offender’s sentence proceedings to 2 June 2016 was in order to join the matters together. That was ultimately frustrated by counsel’s unavailability. It was not suggested in email or in argument that counsel was in any way responsible for the situation. In the circumstances there was ample opportunity for other counsel to be briefed to appear on the application or the sentence proceedings. The offender and her solicitor chose to stay with counsel who was briefed. In any event:
	



	
	the requested accommodation was made for counsel to appear on 2 June 2016; and
	
	
	counsel managed to become free from his commitment in the Court of Criminal Appeal to appear on the application.
	



	
	The order that I make is:
	



	
	The application for me to recuse myself is refused.

		09 June 2016",2016-06-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769654,R v Gill [2016] NSWDC 176,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Often enough in sentencing offenders Judges are faced with a situation where an offender has committed a number of offences at around the same time, but is sentenced for them some considerable time apart. We have an example of that before me today.
	
	
	Patrick Gill was arrested in March 2013. He was charged with some offences. One was supplying a large commercial quantity of the drug Nexus. He was dealt with by his Honour Judge Arnott for that matter who sentenced him in April 2014 to imprisonment for six and a half years with a non-parole period of four years and three months. That was to date from the day Mr Gill was arrested, and so as matters presently stand he is entitled to be considered for release to parole on 24 June next year.
	
	
	The other two matters with which Mr Gill had been charged were offences of manufacturing a prohibited drug, namely 1-phenol-2-propanone, also known as P2P and possessing a precursor for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely 143.3 kilograms of nitroethane, that is a substance that can be used and was intended by Mr Gill to be used in the manufacture of the drug methamphetamine.
	
	
	Although those two offences should have been dealt with at the same time as Judge Arnott dealt with the large commercial supply of Nexus, because of delays in the prosecution getting its brief together the matters were separated and it was not until some significant time after Mr Gill had been sentenced that he was then made aware that the authorities were proceeding with the two matters for which he stands for sentence today.
	
	
	In such circumstances the law is clear. What I should do is attempt to work out what sentence Mr Gill would have received had all of these matters been dealt with together and impose a sentence such that that outcome is achieved. It is that which has led to me choosing the commencement date which I have chosen for these matters.
	
	
	I should note that when I sentence him for the manufacture P2P matter he asks that I take into account two other matters on a Form 1. They both related to his intention to produce methamphetamine. The first is possessing another precursor, this time 3.19 kilograms of benzaldehyde, and the other concerned some apparatus, namely a pill press and condensers, which were intended to be used by Mr Gill for the manufacture of methamphetamine.
	
	
	Mr Gill pleaded guilty to these offences at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	In attempting to work out the objective gravity of the offences for which I must sentence him there is something of a difficulty. 134.3 kilograms of nitroethane sounds to be rather a lot of that substance, but how much methamphetamine can be produced from that quantity of nitroethane I do not know. When I raised this issue with the Crown before lunch the Crown said that he would see what could be done to supplement the evidence that the Crown had already tendered over lunch. On resumption the Crown tendered statement of a forensic chemist. That statement gave me some idea of how much P2P can be produced from 134 kilograms of nitroethane. But from my reading of that statement how much methamphetamine could be produced from 134 kilograms of nitroethane is not made clear.
	
	
	When I first inquired of the Crown whether it was the Crown case that Mr Gill manufactured the P2P as a precursor itself to manufacturing methamphetamine the Crown said that it was. Mr Edwards at that stage objected saying that there was no evidence to that effect and indeed his client gave evidence that he had consumed some of the P2P that he manufactured and was intending to consume the rest. In those circumstances I will sentence him on that basis, namely that the P2P was manufactured as a stand-alone drug, not as a step in the process of manufacturing methylamphetamine to which the possession of nitroethane and the matters on the Form 1 thus relate.
	
	
	In early 2013 the offender was living at a unit in Yagoona. The unit came with a garage which was locked and secured with a single door. The person who resided in the unit and thus used the garage was not there, living instead in a healthcare facility. In late February the offender began living at that address with another man by the name of Todd Smith. There they engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture prohibited drugs by both acquiring the necessary chemicals and laboratory equipment and using the premises for the purpose of manufacturing P2P. During the process Mr Gill also provided information to Mr Smith about the manufacturing process. Conversations were recorded in which the two men, together with another unknown male, discussed matters in relation to the manufacture of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Police ultimately went to the premises and conducted a search. They found a number of items associated with the manufacture of prohibited drugs, including equipment, 134.3 kilograms of nitroethane and 3.19 kilograms of benzaldohyde, a pill press and two condensers. Police also discovered the 16.9 grams of P2P.
	
	
	Mr Gill turned 50 only a couple of days ago. His upbringing was much less than satisfactory. He was initially brought up by his grandmother but at the age of about four his mother re-entered his life. This would ordinarily have been a good thing but for Mr Gill it was not. He had become very attached to his grandmother and was suddenly expected to form a relationship with his mother who wanted to resume parentage of him. In any case she failed to adequately care for him. In particular Mr Gill’s relationship with his step-father was one where his step-father would attack him in various ways and was violent to him on many occasions. Not surprisingly Mr Gill preferred to be absent from home rather than at home in the presence of his violent step‑father. From the ages of 14 to 18 fortunately he was taken into the care of a maternal aunt. At that stage, and as he grew up, he began to become less fearful of his step-father and has since, not surprisingly, refused to have any contact with him. Eventually his mother and step-father separated and his mother has moved to South Australia in order to ensure there is no contact between her children and her former partner.
	
	
	Given Mr Gill’s rather unstable upbringing it is perhaps not surprising that he began to use drugs at a relatively early age and mixed with people who were certainly not a good influence upon him. Some years ago he joined the Rebel Outlaw Motorcycle Gang. Part of his offending as revealed in his criminal history is probably related to that time. He has since left them but his drug use has been a significant problem for him.
	
	
	He has previous convictions for drug possession, drug cultivation, possession of a precursor as well as knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of Nexus that I have referred to earlier. Before being sentenced by Judge Arnott he had already served two periods of imprisonment before. It is not surprising therefore that Judge Arnott considered Mr Gill’s prospects of rehabilitation as being guarded. I too have the same view despite the obvious improvement in Mr Gill’s attitude and behaviour which has been demonstrated in his most recent time in gaol.
	
	
	Mr Gill has been progressing well in custody. Any difficulties in him participating in work and courses and the like are not of his making. He had progress through the classification system until he was at a stage where he was serving a sentence in a gaol which had few security measures. But once these matters which I must sentence Mr Gill were reactivated he immediately went to a maximum security institution. It is notorious that those awaiting sentence experience difficulties in obtaining access to programs and work which facilitate rehabilitation. Despite that Mr Gill has achieved a great deal. He has many qualifications and Mr Edwards who appears for him today tendered certificates attesting to Mr Gill’s achievements.
	
	
	Mr Gill gave evidence and he tells me that one of his activities whilst in custody has been to work and indeed when he can, he works seven days a week. He was working on constructing pre-fabricated cells which are necessary because of the increasing prison population. He appeared to me to be quite proud of what he had achieved in that regard. He has caused no trouble to the prison authorities and certainly there is no suggestion that he has been using drugs whilst in custody.
	
	
	He has plans for the future too. He wishes to use his qualifications when he is released from custody and he has the support of a large number of family members now and I expect when he is eventually released. His family members now understand the problems that he has had with drugs over the years and are thus more able to support him then they were when he kept things from them.
	
	
	The delay in these matters being dealt with is due in no way to Mr Gill. As I mentioned as soon as the charges were laid against him he pleaded guilty. In those circumstances I will take delay very much into account in his favour. I will also take into account that one of the consequences of that delay is that his rehabilitative efforts have been interrupted through no fault of his own by him going into maximum security once he was charged again with these matters.
	
	
	It has to be recognised that at the time Mr Gill committed these offences and indeed at the time he committed the offence for which he was sentenced by Judge Arnott he was under the influence and effect of drugs to a significant degree. Mr Gill would not be the first drug user whose focus narrowed as his drug use increased to the extent that he barely thought about anything else apart from using drugs. That is precisely why offences of this type are so serious. Drugs are terrible things and they have terrible effects on many people, the families of those people and the wider community in general.
	
	
	I will explain my process of reasoning in determining the appropriate sentence. If I had been dealing with all three matters together taking into account the matters on the Form 1, and taking into account the adverse consequences for Mr Gill of the delay I would have imposed a head sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five and a half years. That has guided me as to how I should now sentence Mr Gill for these new matters.
	
	
	Were it not for the fact that I will impose an aggregate sentence I would have imposed three and a half years imprisonment on each matter. Instead I will impose an aggregate sentence which consists of a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 25 March 2016 and a head sentence of five and a half years. This means that Mr Gill is eligible to be released to parole on 24 September 2018.
	
	
	If there are any errors in the calculation then I would appreciate them being brought to my attention earlier rather than later.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Gill what I have done is I’ve increased your eligibility for parole by a year and three months for these new offences. So the minimum period that you have to serve has been increased by that much. Whether you’re released to parole on 24 September 2018 is not for me to decide. As you know it’s the Parole Authority.

2769658,Dickson v R [2016] NSWCCA 105,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt and Wilson JJ and their Honours' reasons.
	
	
	SCHMIDT AND WILSON JJ:
	


The appeal against conviction


	
	After a trial before Beech-Jones J and a jury of 12 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, between 21 August and 22 December 2014, Anthony Dickson, referred to for convenience throughout as the appellant (although he is also the respondent to a Crown appeal against sentence, as will be seen below), was convicted of two offences, being counts 1 and 6 of the indictment presented against him. As counts 2 – 5 were substantive charges brought in the alternative to count 1, no verdict was taken on those counts and they are not discussed further. Counts 1 and 6 were in the following terms:
	


Count 1: that he between about 15 November 2005 and 2 December 2011 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Michael Issakidis to dishonestly cause a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss, to a third person, namely the Commonwealth, knowing or believing that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring, contrary to s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code (Cth).

Count 6: that he between about 15 November 2005 and 26 June 2012 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Michael Issakidis to deal with property of a value of $1 million or more believing it to be the proceeds of crime, contrary to ss 11.5(1) and 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth).


	
	Count 1 involved a complex ‘tax fraud’ with net losses to the Commonwealth in excess of $100 million, whilst count 6 related to a money laundering offence wherein large sums of money were sent across the globe disguised as financial transactions, with funds later returned to Australia.
	
	
	The appellant was sentenced in relation to each offence on 20 March 2015. In relation to count 1, a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months was imposed, to date from 22 December 2014 and expiring on 22 June 2022. For count 6, a sentence of 9 years imprisonment was imposed, to date from 22 December 2016 and expiring on 22 December 2025. A single non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 22 December 2021 was fixed, pursuant to s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914.
	
	
	The appellant appeals and, insofar as it is necessary to do so, seeks leave to appeal against his conviction for each of the offences, advancing six grounds:
	



	
	The prosecution changed its case during the trial which occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The trial miscarried because there was unreasonable evidence to convict Michael Issakidis.
	
	
	The trial judge erred in deciding in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 1068 that count 6 ought not to have been stayed.
	
	
	Count 1 is duplicitous.
	
	
	His Honour failed to direct the jury in relation to count 1 that the Crown had to prove that there was a causal nexus between the element of dishonesty and the intention to cause a loss/ risk of loss.
	
	
	The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that it was an indispensable intermediate fact to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could convict the appellant that they be satisfied that:
	



	
	Neumedix did not have the intention to pay for the acquisition of intellectual property; and
	
	
	Neumedix did not have the capacity to pay for the acquisition of intellectual property.
	



	
	The Crown appeals against the asserted inadequacy of the sentences imposed upon the appellant. That appeal is addressed below.
	


The Facts of the Offences


	
	The factual circumstances surrounding the offences are complex. It is necessary to set out the details of them prior to turning to consideration of the appeal proper. Both the appellant and the Crown agreed that the trial judge provided a comprehensive summary of the evidentiary basis upon which the jury had found the appellant guilty of the two charges in his Honour’s remarks on sentence (R v Anthony James Dickson (No 18) [2015] NSWSC 268). It is thus convenient to commence with that summary, which provides a succinct account of the complex arrangements which lay at the heart of the Crown’s case.
	
	
	After noting the charges found proven and that the appellant’s co-conspirator, Michael Issakidis, had been discharged during the trial (for the reasons given in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 1595), his Honour turned to the background to the charges. He began by noting that Neumedix Health Australasia Pty Ltd (“Neumedix” or ""NHA""), of which the appellant and Mr Issakidis were the two directors, was incorporated on 9 March 2006. His Honour described the essence of the Crown case as follows:
	


“9    … [O]n count 1, as accepted by the jury, was that the offender and his co-conspirator agreed to cause NHA to make false depreciation claims in its tax returns of many hundreds of millions of dollars. The depreciation claims were in respect of the alleged cost of acquisition by NHA of certain medical technologies, even though it was agreed that no such cost was to be incurred. The offender and his co-conspirator agreed to this so as to enable NHA to avoid incurring tax liabilities on income it was deemed to have received as the owner of units in a number of trusts…

10   … [O]n count 6, as accepted by the jury, was that the offender and his co-conspirator agreed to deal with the ""proceeds of crime"" being the amounts standing in various bank accounts that represented the cash distributions from the trusts to NHA. The jury accepted the Crown's contention that these funds were the ""proceeds of crime"" because they were derived from the conspiracy the subject of count 1. This was so because, to the knowledge of the offender and his co-conspirator, the funds would not be required to meet NHA's tax liabilities as they would be eliminated by false depreciation deductions and the funds would not be required to make payments on the agreements the subject of the claims for depreciation as no genuine obligation to make those payments would be incurred (see R v Dickson (No 16) [2014] NSWSC 1862 at [19]). The offender and his co-conspirator agreed to cause the funds to be distributed offshore to various accounts controlled by entities associated with the offender and then repatriated to Australia, largely for their own enrichment.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the circumstances of the offences by reference to the facts which were either not in issue, those necessarily found by the jury, or matters of which he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and which were consistent with the jury's verdict. He commenced with count 1, describing, at [12], the “…financial transactions that generated assessable income for NHA, NHA's dealings with the inventors of medical technologies, the events surrounding the lodgment of NHA's tax returns and the audit by the Australian Taxation Office (""ATO""), and aspects of the offender's case.” His Honour found:
	


“The financing transactions

13   The offender is a highly experienced tax and finance professional. During the course of 2005 and 2006 he pursued negotiations with the ANZ to pursue a financing transaction that had the following essential features. One of the ANZ's clients sold an asset to a partnership consisting of the trustee of a unit trust, namely ANZ Investment Holdings Ltd, and the client. The ANZ provided debt financing to fund the purchase. The asset was leased back for use in the client's business. The trust generated assessable income from the lease payments although most of that income was used to pay debt, interest and fees. NHA acquired 100% of the units in the unit trust. Under the relevant taxation legislation all of the net income of the trust was to be treated as taxable income of NHA although it did not receive a distribution of those amounts as they were used to pay down the ANZ's debt. Instead NHA received a cash distribution from the trust of 9% of the taxable income of the trust.

14   The result of each such transaction was that ANZ's clients received an injection of cash from selling their asset. The client paid rent to use the asset, however those payments were tax deductible. The rental cost was lower than it otherwise would have been because NHA was effectively contributing part of its tax losses to make the transaction more commercially attractive. ANZ received interest on its loan to the trustee which was paid by the lease payments and fees for facilitating the transaction.

15   As noted, it was agreed that, in return for it acquiring the obligation to declare the entirety of the taxable profit of the trust in its tax return, NHA received cash payments representing 9% of each trust's taxable profit. In order for its participation in these transactions to make any commercial sense for NHA it had to have available to it very large amounts of tax losses to offset the taxable income it was required to declare. The offender repeatedly assured the ANZ that those deductions had been, or would be, generated by NHA assuming obligations to pay very large amounts to acquire certain medical technologies. ANZ was assured that NHA was in effect selling tax losses arising from large depreciation expenses on medical technology to acquire funding. As I will explain, the true position was that no such obligations were intended to be incurred and none were incurred. Instead the offender and his co-conspirator agreed to use the bulk of the cash distributions for their own purposes.

16   In total four such transactions were arranged involving three of the ANZ's clients, Bluescope Steel, Gunns and Incitec. The relevant trust deeds were executed on 30 August 2006, 17 December 2006, 1 August 2008 and 21 September 2009. The first cash distribution to NHA was made on 26 October 2006 when $14.3 million was sent to NHA. Overall a total of $68,405,000.00 was distributed to NHA by the four trusts between that date and 24 December 2009. As the ratio of cash distributed to deemed tax income was 9:100 it follows that it was envisaged that in excess of $750 million in assessable income would be notionally distributed to NHA and declared in its tax returns over time. As I will explain, just over $378 million was so ""distributed"" in the financial years 2007 to 2010, and declared in NHA's tax returns.

The medical technologies

17   Throughout the period of the two conspiracies NHA presented itself as a business involved in the acquisition and exploitation of medical technology. It employed staff and had office premises. The evidence revealed that the offender, his co-conspirator and other staff employed by NHA had a number of dealings with various inventors of medical technology. It was not the Crown case that the entirety of NHA's business was a facade or that the medical technologies were not genuine. Instead the Crown case concerned the means by which NHA was alleged to have acquired three particular medical technologies as they were the subject of the depreciation claims in NHA's tax returns for the financial years 2007 to 2010.

18   The first medical technology was a cancer vaccine known as ""Genvax"". It was developed by Dr Stephen Ralph. Throughout 2006 the offender and his co-conspirator met with Dr Ralph and discussed the terms upon which the technology might be acquired and exploited. At the trial a variety of executed and unexecuted agreements which purported to transfer the rights to this technology to various entities were tendered. With the exception of those that were signed by Dr Ralph, the Crown case was that it could not and did not have to demonstrate when they were executed as the offender was engaged in the process of manufacturing agreements from time to time to suit his and his co-conspirator's purposes. I will return to address this, but it suffices to state that the Crown succeeded in establishing that proposition beyond reasonable doubt.

19   On or about 9 January 2007, Dr Ralph and his company, Genvax Pty Ltd, executed an agreement assigning the intellectual property rights in Genvax to Athena Health Patents Incorporated (""Athena"") for 50% of the gross revenues on commercialisation. This is not the relevant assignment the subject of the false depreciation claims that were later made in NHA's tax returns. On or about 15 January 2007 a loan agreement was executed in which Athena agreed to lend to Genvax Pty Ltd up to $1.8million on a non-recourse basis for the development of Genvax. A project deed concerning the development and exploitation of Genvax was executed on or about the same day.

20   Athena was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It was originally named Neumedix Biotechnology International Limited but it changed its name to Athena in January 2007. At the trial there was a dispute over the origins of this company and who controlled it. The offender said it was formed by his brother, John Dickson, in 2005 and that John Dickson owned the shares. In contrast, John Dickson stated that he never negotiated for, worked for or was involved in the day-to-day management of Athena.

21   There was a sustained attack on John Dickson's credit and his evidence generally. On this issue and the other matters noted in this judgment I have no doubt the jury accepted his evidence. I am otherwise satisfied that it should be accepted. It accords with the balance of the evidence at the trial. For example on 12 January 2007 the offender sent an email to the firm in Cayman Islands that acted as the registry for Athena directing that its name be changed and that two corporate entities be added as directors. Later in 2007 the offender and his co-conspirator prepared and amended drafts of correspondence on Athena's letterhead. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at all relevant times the offender controlled Athena.

22   The assignment from Dr Ralph and Genvax Pty Ltd to Athena was executed on behalf of Athena by a solicitor purporting to act under a power of attorney executed by one of Athena's corporate directors, Flying Dragon Group International Ltd (""Flying Dragon""). John Dickson was a director of Flying Dragon but he denied that he executed the power of attorney. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not and that his signature was forged and placed on the document.

23   The second item of medical technology was a device placed on the upper part of the spine during surgery known as the ""CG Surgical Clip"" (""CGS""). It was developed in New Zealand. On or around 2 March 2007 a representative of CG Surgical Limited executed an assignment of the intellectual property in CGS to Athena in exchange for 50% of the proceeds of commercialisation. On or about the same date he signed a loan agreement on behalf of CG Surgical with Athena under which the latter agreed to advance up to NZD$825,000.00 for the development of the technology. Shortly after these documents were executed a commercial dispute broke out so that in the end result only a small portion of the funds were advanced and there was almost no further development of the CGS.

24   The third item of technology was a diagnostic test for colorectal cancer known as ""Cologene"". It was developed by Dr Jenkins from the United Kingdom. Dr Jenkins gave evidence via videolink. In his evidence Dr Jenkins was shown various assignment agreements bearing his name and the name of his company, Armedillo Health Ltd (""Armedillo"") which he produced but which were unsigned. He said that he recalled he signed various documents on or about 2 November 2007 at his lawyer's offices. I am satisfied that he signed them sometime in November 2007. Four of these documents are of particular relevance.

25   One of the agreements produced by Dr Jenkins was an assignment of the rights in Cologene from Armedillo to Athena in exchange for 40% of the proceeds of commercialisation. Another was a loan agreement between Athena and Armedillo under which an amount of up to 1.3 million pounds sterling was agreed to be lent for the development and exploitation of Cologene.

26   The other two agreements were assignments by Athena. They were not the subject of much attention in the trial but, as I am required to make some additional findings, it is appropriate to note them at this point. Under one of these agreements Athena purported to assign the rights for Cologene to NHA for the territory of Europe (other than the United Kingdom), USA, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa for a consideration of 200 million pounds sterling. Under the other agreement Athena purported to assign the rights to Cologene for the rest of the world to Neumedix Health New Zealand Ltd for 200 million pounds sterling. The significance of these agreements is that they are fundamentally inconsistent with the assignment agreement for Cologene provided to the ATO which was said to justify the depreciation claims for the purported acquisition of Cologene by NHA.

The tax returns and the tax audit 

27   NHA's tax return for the 2007 financial year was lodged on 26 February 2009. It was signed by the offender. The return disclosed $47,837,698.00 in income from the unit trusts. However this was offset by various expenses the largest of which was a claim for $76,071,054.00 in depreciation expenses. The overwhelming bulk of that claim consisted of depreciations expenses in respect of the cost of the alleged acquisition by NHA of the intellectual property in Genvax and CGS from Athena.

28   NHA's tax return for the 2008 financial year was lodged on 17 September 2009. It was also signed by the offender. The return disclosed $77,229,906.00 in income from the unit trusts but claimed $98,470,850.00 in depreciation expenses. The overwhelming bulk of the latter claim consisted of claims for depreciations expenses in respect of the cost of the alleged acquisition by NHA of the intellectual property in Genvax, CGS and Cologene from Athena.

29   The lodgement of these returns led to the automatic generation of tax assessments which accepted the claims that were made. As NHA recorded a tax loss it did not incur any tax debt. However the returns attracted the attention of officers of the ATO. The ATO commenced an audit.

30   In February 2010 the ATO wrote to NHA making a very broad request for the production of documents. On 15 February 2010 the offender wrote to the ATO seeking an extension of the time for compliance. Shortly afterwards there was a telephone conversation between the offender and an ATO officer, Mr Chris Harvey. The offender claimed he told Mr Harvey that he did not have executed versions of some transaction documents as they were overseas. He claimed Mr Harvey agreed to the offender's suggestion that the latest version of the transaction documents be printed off his computer and provided to the ATO. Mr Harvey denied this. The significance of this aspect of this conversation, if it occurred, is it provides an explanation for why the offender did not provide the ATO with executed copies of the assignment agreements and how it was that he was able to supply them in his case at the trial although there were material differences.

31   I have no doubt the jury accepted Mr Harvey's evidence. To the extent necessary I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Harvey's denial should be accepted. Amongst other matters it is supported by his file note of the conversation. The offender's version of the conversation is not supported by a subsequent email sent by him on 15 March 2010.

32   Between March and May 2010 the offender caused to be provided to the ATO fourteen folders of documents said to be responsive to the ATO's request and supportive of the amounts stated in NHA's 2007 and 2008 tax returns including the large depreciation claims. Included in this material were three unsigned agreements each of which purported to record an assignment of the intellectual property in one of the three medical technologies from Athena to NHA (the ""Genvax Assignment Agreement"", the ""CGS Assignment Agreement"" and the ""Cologene Assignment Agreement""). Each of them had a handwritten annotation on the front indicating that it represented the executed copy. I will return to address the terms of these agreements later in this judgment but the combination of the provision of these agreements with their annotations, the contents of the tax returns and various unsigned minutes of NHA that were provided to the ATO recording the entry into of the agreements, amounted to an unambiguous assertion to the ATO that NHA had acquired the three technologies on the terms set out in those agreements.

33   The ATO's letter of 10 February 2010 requested NHA provide, amongst other documents, any valuations of the relevant medical technologies that supported the amounts claimed for depreciation in NHA's tax returns. Included in the material supplied to the ATO were three documents purporting to be valuations of the medical technologies by the Karkalla Biotechnology Group (""KBG""). Those valuations stated that the value of Genvax was USD$627 million as at December 2005, the value of CGS was between USD$103 million and USD$119 million as at February 2006 and the value of Cologene was USD$2.541 billion as at November 2007. Each of the reports had a signature and underneath that the name ""Peggy Wong, President Karkalla"". Elsewhere in each document she was described as ""Peggy Wong PHD President Karkalla"".

34   The Crown contended, and the offender strenuously denied, that these valuation reports were concocted by, or at the direction of, the offender and that the Dr Peggy Wong referred to either did not exist, or if she did, she had no connection to the reports. There was a vast amount of documentary material to support the Crown's contention. This included computer records pointing to the documents and their logo being created well after the dates referred to in the reports; documents indicating that the offender controlled various companies named ""Karkalla""; the hosting of a contact email address for Peggy Wong by NHA in Australia, although it was alleged that she was based overseas; and numerous other documents allegedly signed off by Peggy Wong that inconsistently attributed to her a multitude of titles and job descriptions. In support of his case the offender gave evidence of his dealings with Peggy Wong and called two witnesses including the offender's other brother, Paul Dickson, who said they had met her. The jury clearly accepted the Crown's contention. To the extent necessary I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the reports were concocted by, or at the direction of, the offender. The use by the offender of false identities was one aspect of his modus operandi in carrying out the two conspiracies that he was convicted of.

35   On or about 17 May 2010 the offender caused NHA's tax return for the 2009 financial year to be lodged electronically. The return declared $123,841,532.00 in assessable income from the unit trusts and claimed $106,689,541.00 in depreciation expenses. On 1 September 2011 NHA's tax return for the 2010 financial year was lodged. It was signed by the offender. The return declared $129,474,513.00 in assessable income from the unit trusts and claimed $109,021,139.00 in depreciation expenses. The overwhelming bulk of the depreciation claimed in each return was referable to the alleged cost of the acquisition of the three medical technologies under the assignment agreements that I have referred to. Further, when those depreciation claims were combined with carried forward losses from prior years which were in turn attributable to depreciation claims in those years, it meant that the tax assessments that were automatically generated did not create a tax debt in favour of the Commonwealth.

36   On 15 February 2012 the offender caused NHA to lodge amended returns for each of the financial years 2007 to 2010. The income declared in the returns was $18,550,000, $77,229,906, $30,868,000 and $129,474,513 respectively. The first and third of these figures were erroneous. The correct amounts were in the order of those disclosed in the 2007 and 2009 initial returns respectively. The amount of deprecation claimed in each amended return was $76,888,893, $118,570,332, $104,042,825 and $102,825,040 respectively. The total of these amounts is just in excess of $402 million. An exhibit tendered in the offender's case attributes approximately $386 million of the total amount claimed for depreciation as referable to the assignment agreements. While there are reasons to doubt the calculations in that exhibit, the difference between that and the total of $402 million is immaterial for the purposes of sentencing. As I have stated, an amount in excess of $378 million was declared as income earned by NHA from the unit trusts.

37   In or around March or April 2012 search warrants and notices under s 263 of the income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (""ITAA 1936""), were executed on the offender's premises as well as a number of other places (see R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 1595 at [16]ff). He was arrested in April 2012. Since that time the ATO has issued amended taxation assessments for NHA, and proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) have been commenced against the offender.” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	His Honour then turned to the appellant’s evidence that he was an employee of Rand Stone Private Equity Partnership (""Randstone""), a consultant to an entity known as the ""HFAC Harmony Biotechnology Private Equity Partnership"" (""HFAC""), with HFAC standing for ""Health for all Children"". The appellant said that HFAC was a Cayman Islands based private equity partnership, originally formed between two wealthy entrepreneurs, which invested in medical technology and similar initiatives designed to improve the health of all children worldwide. He acted as HFAC’s ""steward"" for various medical technologies.
	
	
	The appellant also said that Athena had acquired intellectual property rights for the three technologies as the undisclosed agent for HFAC; that the recipient of funds from NHA, Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Ltd (""Dampier Finance""), was HFAC's nominated receiving agent for the payment of the amounts owing by NHA under the three assignment agreements with Athena; that NHA moved funds overseas in order to meet its obligations under those agreements; and that the subsequent routing of those funds, through Hong Kong and back to Australia, occurred as a result of HFAC directing him to transfer those funds, and ""invest"" them in Australia, by allegedly lending various amounts to Mr Issakidis and otherwise paying the appellant his remuneration, under his arrangements with Randstone.
	
	
	His Honour then dealt with various documents tendered by the appellant, said to evidence these arrangements, including executed versions of the Genvax assignment agreement and the Cologene assignment agreement provided to the ATO and which referred to HFAC as a party. His Honour observed, at [41], that none of the assignment agreements provided to the ATO referred to HFAC. His Honour noted:
	


“42   The Crown submitted to the jury that this evidence was false and the documents said to support it were fabricated after the offender's arrest. I will not repeat all the points made by the Crown but they included the fact that none of the documents provided to the ATO or seized during the execution of the search warrants provided any support for this evidence, save for one deed that bore the date March 2006 but which appears to have been prepared well after. Critically none of the assignment agreements between the inventors and Athena that were retained by the inventors or the assignment agreements between Athena and NHA provided to the ATO referred to HFAC. In any event the jury were instructed, inter alia, that, if there was a reasonable possibility that the version presented by the accused was true, then the Crown case failed. It follows from the jury's verdict that it rejected even the reasonable possibility that the accused's version was true and otherwise accepted that the supposedly corroborative documents were fabrications.”


	
	His Honour made further findings in relation to the assignment agreements, including noting that the jury had been given directions as to circumstantial evidence, in accordance with Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573. The jury was also directed that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the agreement, the subject of count 1, unless they were first satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that NHA ""did not incur any obligation to pay for the intellectual property assignment under at least one of the agreements ... which was the basis [for] the depreciation claimed in NHA's tax returns” (T246: 16/12/2014). His Honour also outlined the directions of law given to the jury in relation to the principles concerning sham agreements (at [44] – [46]).
	
	
	His Honour noted that the Crown case on sentence was that the Court should find that all three agreements were shams and that the appellant’s case was that the Court should find that only the CGS Assignment agreement was a sham. He concluded that having found that Athena was under the effective control of the appellant, the relevant subjective intentions to consider were those of the appellant and Mr Issakidis as they were on both sides of the transaction (at [48]).
	
	
	At [49], his Honour considered an “especially powerful part” of this aspect of the Crown case to be various handwritten and typed documents which had passed between the appellant and Mr Issakidis sometime in late 2006 and then in July and September 2007. The documents concerned the distribution of certain interest earned by NHA on amounts received from the trusts, with the underlying assumption that they had agreed to divide up the bulk of the funds received from the trusts between themselves, with a portion to be paid to a third person and to NHA, to pay its various expenses, but not the amounts allegedly required to be paid under the assignment agreements with Athena. At [50] his Honour found the significance of this material to be that:
	


“… in 2007 and 2008 a number of installments were allegedly due under those assignment agreements. The only source of funds that NHA had to pay for them was the cash distributions from the trusts yet these communications suggest that neither the offender nor his co-conspirator contemplated using them for that purpose. These communications strongly support an inference that that was so because they knew that those installments were not payable.”


	
	His Honour also observed:
	


“51   Otherwise, the Crown contended that the fundamental assumption of these documents was that NHA would not only have no tax liabilities, it would also not have any liability to pay the amounts said to be owing under the assignment agreements which gave rise to the depreciation claims that avoided those liabilities. This material was powerful evidence in support of the Crown case on count 1 because while NHA might legitimately achieve one of those aims it could not legitimately achieve both.”


	
	His Honour then noted that there were two relevant versions of the Genvax assignment agreement from Athena to NHA dated 15 January 2007. The first had been provided to the ATO and the version that included HFAC as a party had been tendered in the appellant’s case. Given his earlier findings, his Honour concluded that the second version could be ignored. The first agreement purported to record, at [52]:
	


“.... the worldwide sale of the rights to Genvax from Athena to NHA for approximately $190 million payable over five years as well as for payment of the ""fair market value"" for the period thereafter. The first three payments required were $27.15million on 13 April 2007, $2.46 million on 30 June 2008 and $12.77 million on 1 July 2008. The agreement was structured so that NHA could elect to avoid the assignment at the end of each installment period and in doing so only assume the obligation to pay the installments referable to that period.”


	
	His Honour identified six matters about this agreement:
	


“53   …First there is the point I have just referred to, namely the communications between the offender and his co-conspirator in 2006 and 2007 concerning the division of the funds distributed from the trusts point to there being no intention to pay the amounts allegedly owing under the Genvax Assignment agreement. Otherwise the amounts payable under this agreement (and the other agreements) were very large yet NHA had not even the remotest prospect of obtaining access to that level of funding in the short term while the Genvax technology was still at an early stage of development.

54   Second, clause 14.5.2 of the Genvax Assignment agreement contained a clause disclaiming any common ownership of Athena and NHA and asserting that the agreement was negotiated on an arm's length basis. This clause was clearly false, and false to the knowledge of the offender, in that he was both sides of the transaction.

55   Third, between 6 and 8 February 2007 the offender's personal assistant sent a number of facsimiles to Barclays Bank enclosing a number of agreements including a signed agreement in which Athena purported to sell to NHA the worldwide rights for Genvax for $18 million and another agreement in which Athena purported to lend $18 million to Dampier Finance. The documents were sent to Barclays because it was querying the true source of the funds that Dampier Finance had received from NHA and was reluctant to act on instructions it had received to send the funds to Hong Kong. The offender effectively represented that the funds were the proceeds of a loan from Athena to Dampier Finance and that Athena was entitled to the funds because it had sold Genvax to NHA for $18 million. Those assertions were fundamentally inconsistent with the terms of the Genvax Assignment agreement provided to the ATO.

56   Fourth, in late 2007 the offender retained Walsh & Walsh accountants to prepare accounts for NHA. A memorandum and an assignment agreement for Genvax that emanated from the offender's email address was sent to the accountants for the purpose of their preparing the accounts. [30] This material advised Walsh & Walsh that the entity that assigned the intellectual property to NHA was not Athena but another company, Karkalla International Holdings (""KIH""), and that it did so on different terms to those set out in the Genvax assignment agreement even though the latter bore a date eleven months prior.

57   The offender denied that he sent the emails. He claimed they were sent by another person in his office. His denials were unbelievable and no doubt had a devastating effect on his creditability in the eyes of the jury. The emails were clearly drafted by him. He later prepared and signed accounts for NHA that reflected the effect of those agreements.

58   Fifth, the Genvax Assignment agreement was created much later than the date stated on the agreement, namely 15 January 2007, but it was backdated. If the agreement had been created on or about the date it bore it would have been sent to Walsh & Walsh. Instead, just prior to lodging NHA's tax return for the financial year 2007, the offender caused NHA's accounts to be completely rewritten to remove the effect of the agreements previously sent to Walsh & Walsh, and substituted the effect of the Genvax Assignment agreement and the CGS Assignment agreement. This appears to represent the most likely time at which those agreements, or some draft thereof, was first created.

59    Sixth, the other findings noted above point to the absence of any intention on the part of the offender to make NHA legally obliged to pay Athena the amounts stated in the Genvax assignment agreement. In particular his submission of concocted valuations to the ATO reflects a dishonest and fraudulent intent on his part.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the CGS assignment agreement which had been provided to the ATO, which was also unsigned, observing:
	


“60 … [I]t bore the date 5 March 2007. It purported to record an assignment of the worldwide rights to the intellectual property in CGS for a total consideration of $60 million payable over four years, together with an agreement to pay the ""fair market value"" thereafter. A payment of $2.25 million was due on 15 April 2007, and a payment of $4,235 million was due on 1 July 2008. This agreement also purported to enable NHA to avoid the assignment at the end of the instalment periods. The first, second and fifth to sixth points made in relation to the Genvax Assignment agreement also apply to this agreement. In relation to the fourth point, the memorandum sent to Walsh & Walsh in November 2007 advised them that the intellectual property in CGS had been assigned on completely different terms to those set out in the CGS Assignment agreement. The combination of the material sent to Walsh & Walsh suggested that it had been assigned by KIH to NHA and not by Athena[.]

61   Otherwise I note two further points in relation to the CGS Assignment agreement. First, as noted, shortly after March 2007 when the representatives of CG Surgical signed the assignment to NHA a dispute broke out, and the development of the technology ceased. Despite this, NHA apparently continued to incur obligations to pay the instalment amounts under the CGS Assignment agreement.

62   Second, a signed agreement similar to the CGS Assignment agreement was sent to Walsh & Walsh at the time NHA's accounts were re-written in early 2009 [33]. This version did not include clause 14.5.2 discussed above. Its inclusion in the version sent to the ATO is consistent with the offender seeking to deceive the ATO into accepting that the CGS Assignment agreement was negotiated at arm's length.” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	His Honour then turned to the Cologene assignment agreement presented to the ATO, which was also unsigned and bore the date 30 November 2007, observing:
	


“63   …It purported to record an assignment of the worldwide rights to the intellectual property in Cologene for a total consideration of USD$160 million payable over a period of three years together with an agreement to pay the ""fair market value"" thereafter. The first three payments required were $5.75 million on 1 July 2008, $15 million on 15 December 2008 and $5 million on 15 February 2009. The first, second and fifth to sixth points made in relation to the Genvax Assignment agreement apply to this agreement.

64   With the fourth point (at [56]), the agreements sent to Walsh and Walsh in early 2008 included a Deed of Option dated 6 March 2007 which purported to enable NHA to acquire the intellectual property for Cologene from KIH at its election. This was inconsistent with the Cologene Assignment agreement under which NHA purported to acquire the intellectual property in Cologene from Athena in November 2008.

65   Further, included in the documents tendered on behalf of the offender was a signed version of the Cologene Assignment agreement which referred to HFAC as a party. As noted it follows from the jury's verdict that this version is a concoction. Further, it should be noted that the Cologene Assignment agreement presented to the ATO was completely inconsistent with the two assignment agreements concerning the sale of rights to Cologene previously noted (at [26]).”


	
	His Honour then turned to the loss, or risk of loss, resulting from count 1. He considered that two distinct inquiries were required to be undertaken. The first concerned the extent of the loss or risk of loss which the appellant intended to be caused in giving effect to the agreement the subject of count 1. The second concerned the extent of the loss, if any, in fact caused by the appellant’s conduct the subject of this count.
	
	
	His Honour concluded, at [68], as to the extent of the loss or risk of loss intended to be caused, that the appellant’s conviction evidenced that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he and Mr Issakidis intended to dishonestly cause a loss or a risk of loss to the Commonwealth pursuant to the agreement they had formed, and that each knew or believed that the loss would occur, or that there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring. His Honour considered that, in assessing the criminality involved in count 1, it was necessary to consider the scope of their agreement and an adoption of the hypothesis that their agreement was successfully implemented.
	
	
	As to the extent of the loss in fact caused by the appellant’s conduct, which arose to be considered on sentence pursuant to s 16A(2)(e) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), his Honour said that this:
	


“70 … involves an inquiry into the loss or damage that was in fact occasioned by the commission of count 1. As is evident from what I have stated, the completion of the agreement the subject of count 1 was ultimately frustrated by its detection by the ATO and the Australian Federal Police (""AFP""). Their actions ameliorated the occasioning of loss to the Commonwealth in that tax returns for the financial years after 2010 claiming false deductions were not lodged, amended tax assessments have been raised and some of the proceeds of the money laundering have been seized. An assessment of the loss that has in fact resulted from the commission of count 1 must take into account those facts. However those matters are irrelevant to the first inquiry…”


	
	After referring to the directions which the jury had been given in relation to the concepts of “loss”, which had reflected the applicable tax legislation and the evidence as to NHA’s tax returns, and “tax debts”, which he observed, at [72], was “…a form of property being a chose in action. If no such debt arose because of a false depreciation claim then the Commonwealth did not obtain property it might otherwise ‘get’.” His Honour went on to say that:
	


“73   The agreement entered between the offender and his co-conspirator was to claim false depreciation deductions. It follows from the jury's verdict and the above findings that false claims were contemplated in respect of the three technologies. Thus the offender and his co-conspirator intended NHA to claim false depreciation expenses in respect of those technologies, intended they would be accepted and that, as a consequence, no tax debt would arise in favour of the Commonwealth because the false depreciation expenses would be more than sufficient to offset any tax debt that might otherwise arise from NHA's deemed receipt of income from the trusts.”


	
	His Honour then noted that under the agreement the subject of count 1, between $386 million and $402 million in false deductions was claimed and that the total amount payable for the first three to five years was approximately $450 million. For reasons there given, he did not take into account further provision made as to “fair market value”. His Honour, at [74], was, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the remainder of the instalments under the assignment agreements was intended to be claimed, other than the amounts said to be payable for fair market value.
	
	
	His Honour also observed that:
	


“75   Given that the object of the conspiracy was to eliminate NHA's tax liabilities from its receipt of income from the trusts, it may be that the true scope of the intended loss or risk of loss was the elimination of any liability on the entirety of the anticipated distributions from the trusts; ie $750 million. However, in the absence of the Crown pointing to material that suggested that deductions based on either the alleged obligation to pay fair market value or other sham agreements were contemplated, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the scope of the agreement between the offender and his co-conspirator extended that far.

76   Given that the anticipated total income from the four trusts was $750 million I am satisfied that, over time, it was intended that NHA would be able to apply the entirety of the approximate $450 million in false deductions to offset declared income. As the corporate tax rate was and is 30% it follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the extent of the loss or risk of loss that was intended to be caused to the Commonwealth was 30% of approximately $450 million or approximately $135 million. Clearly the fraud sought to be perpetrated was a very large one.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the actual loss to the Commonwealth resulting from count 1, following the ATO’s issue of the amended tax assessments for NHA for the relevant financial years, which he noted NHA had objected to and could lead to a review application in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court. He concluded, at [80], that:
	


“80   Leaving aside the possibility that NHA's applications for review might yield a reduction in the size of the amended assessments, a matter I will return to, it follows that the relevant loss or damage occasioned to the Commonwealth from count 1 is a temporary delay in obtaining a tax debt of $104,152,053. The object of the conspiracy was to claim false tax deductions. False deductions were claimed and as a result no tax debt was raised in favour of the Commonwealth. The false deductions have now been reversed and the Commonwealth now has a tax debt in its favour that it was entitled to at an earlier time. Whether that delay was or will ultimately prove to be productive of an actual loss in revenue was not explored in the evidence.”


	
	After dealing with a number of other arguments as to the quantification of the loss, which it is not necessary to outline at this point, his Honour observed, at [87], that a number of the submissions made by the appellant on this topic “…were either predicated on an acceptance of the offender's case or sought to reargue it even though it was emphatically rejected by the jury.”
	
	
	His Honour then turned to count 6.
	
	
	His Honour began, at [88], by explaining the evidence as to the fate of the funds totalling $63,715,000.00, which had been transferred by NHA in five tranches to accounts in the United Kingdom and then in Hong Kong, the bulk of which were then distributed back to Australia and New Zealand. His Honour found that the funds were used to pay amounts owing to the inventors by Athena and paying NHA’s expenses, but that the bulk were used for the personal enrichment of the appellant, Mr Issakidis, and another person who had some involvement in the scheme.
	
	
	His Honour noted that while the amount distributed from the trusts to NHA was in excess of $68 million, the Crown had only sought to prove that the conspiracy which was the subject of count 6 resulted in the dealing in proceeds of crime of $63 million, for reasons explained at [89]. His Honour also noted that the jury instructions (at [90]):
	


“…identified the Crown case as alleging that the amounts standing in the various bank accounts constituted the proceeds of crime being the proceeds of the conspiracy that is count 1. [35] The basis for that contention has already been explained (see [10]). As part of those instructions the jury were told that if they acquitted the offender on count 1 then they had to acquit him on count 6. The jury were also instructed that, if they did not unanimously find the agreement the subject of count 1 was formed prior to 12 January 2007, then they had to acquit the offender of count 6. The significance of that date was that it was the date of the first movement of funds overseas by NHA being the first of the relevant dealings the subject of the conspiracy charged by count 6. If the agreement the subject of count 1 had not been formed prior to that time then the proceeds of the accounts that were distributed overseas on 12 January 2007 could not have been the proceeds of crime and there could not have been any conspiracy to deal with those monies as proceeds of crime.”


	
	At [91] his Honour explained why this aspect of the instructions were favorable to the appellant, opining that it was possible for the jury to conclude that he and Mr Issakidis had entered into the agreement, the subject of count 1, sometime after 12 January 2007 and from that point conspired to deal with a lesser amount as the proceeds of crime. His Honour said that it was not put to the jury that way principally in order to avoid an already complicated case being further complicated. He found that:
	


“91 The end result is that the jury's verdict means that they necessarily accepted that the agreement the subject of count 1 was formed prior to 12 January 2007, that all the funds moved overseas from NHA's account thereafter were the proceeds of crime and that those movements gave effect to the agreement the subject of count 6. Thus it necessarily follows from the jury's verdict that the amount that was dealt with in giving effect to that agreement the subject of count 6 was $63,715,000.”


	
	At [92] his Honour noted that the appellant had admitted that it was he who had caused the transfer of this $63,715,000.00. His Honour explained this admission, observing:
	


“92 … [T]he accounts in the United Kingdom belonged to Dampier Finance. Dampier Finance was incorporated in Samoa in July 2006 at the instigation of the offender. At the time of its incorporation the offender received assurances that the details of its ownership and control were not available to foreign regulators. The offender was the sole director of Dampier Finance for a number of years. It had an unusual ownership structure in that the owner of the company was the person that had possession from time to time of certain bearer debentures. The offender claimed that his brother, John, held these debentures. John denied that and stated that the control of the company was exercised by the offender. On that topic I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that John Dickson's evidence should be accepted.

93   The bank accounts in Hong Kong were held by two companies incorporated in Hong Kong in respect of which all the relevant legal indicia of control and ownership rested with John Dickson. However his evidence was that he would act on the direction of the offender. As I have said at least so far as the movement of the relevant funds was concerned that was not in dispute. Further it was not in dispute that instructions were given by the offender using a code and also by his using the pseudonym ""Ronnie Wang"". In his evidence the offender stated that these were all security measures designed to avoid persons such as criminal gangs becoming aware of the transfers. This was a specious assertion. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was undertaken in an attempt to avoid scrutiny by tax regulators.”


	
	His Honour then discussed the significance of a falling out between the appellant and his brother in early 2010 after NHA had filed its first two tax returns, around the same time as the ATO's audit was commencing. His Honour found, at [94]:
	


“94 … Subsequently John Dickson provided a number of documents to the Australian Consulate in Hong Kong. It was the receipt of those documents that enabled the ATO to follow the money trail after funds left Australia. Either through that source or through the execution of search warrants or both, the email communications between the offender and John Dickson became available. In the scheme of what was otherwise a sophisticated tax fraud some of those emails are amateurish in that they suggest blatant dishonesty. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender never envisaged they would become available to Australian regulators.”


	
	His Honour found, at [95], that the result of the scheme that he had described was that $19,616,966.37 had been distributed back to the appellant and entities associated with him, the jury having rejected the appellant’s evidence that these amounts represented sums invested on behalf of HFAC or his receipt of remuneration from Randstone. Some of that money had been used to make land purchases and for the purchase of a shopping centre.
	
	
	His Honour then turned to sentencing considerations, to which it will be necessary to return.
	


The Grounds of Appeal Against Conviction


	
	It is proposed to deal with each of the six grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant in turn.
	


Ground 1: The prosecution changed its case during the trial which occasioned a miscarriage of justice


	
	By this ground the appellant argues that the case that the Crown left before the jury at the close of the evidence was materially different to that upon which it opened, having “shifted” in nature and emphasis during the course of the trial. It is contended that, in opening the case at the commencement of the trial, the Crown outlined a case wherein it was accepted that legal title or property in the medical technology patents was transferred from Athena to NHA, with the “sham” being the inflated purchase price. At the close of the Crown case, the appellant argues that the case against him had fundamentally changed, in that the Crown argued that it was the assignment of the technologies, rather than the price paid, which was the sham.
	
	
	It is submitted that, because of the late change to the Crown case, evidence was admitted which should not have been admitted or which should have been limited. Additionally, evidence which may have been relevant to the issue of sham acquisition was not placed before the jury.
	
	
	The appellant relies upon both a statement of particulars for count 1 provided to him by the Crown prior to the commencement of the trial, in which reference was made to the assignment of medical technologies by Athena to Neumedix at “…falsely inflated costs of acquisition”, and to the Crown Prosecutor’s opening address, and references therein to falsely inflated costs of acquisition. The appellant additionally points to exchanges between the trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor on days 32, 33, 42, 43 and 44 of the trial concerning the nature of the Crown case as indicative of confusion as to precisely what the Crown case was.
	
	
	The Crown contends that there was no change to its case at trial, its case always having been one of conspiracy to cause loss to the Commonwealth (via the Australian Taxation Office).
	
	
	Having considered the opening address by the Crown Prosecutor, and the evidence subsequently led, we do not agree that there was a fundamental change to the nature of the Crown’s case such as to lead to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The Crown’s case, when pared back to the basic allegation, was that the appellant was part of a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth by falsifying expenses claimed in company taxation returns. The conspiracy was not alleged to rest solely in making claims based upon falsely inflated acquisition costs for the relevant medical technologies, but rather, that the assignments the subject of the claims more broadly, were a sham. The cost of the acquisitions was a particular of the conspiracy, but it was not the whole of the case alleged by the Crown.
	
	
	That conclusion is clear if regard is had to the whole of the Crown Prosecutor’s opening address – which occupied some days at the commencement of the trial – wherein there were repeated references to the overall acquisition of the technologies as an elaborate sham to dishonestly deprive the revenue of legitimate taxation through fraudulent deductions claimed against income. The Crown Prosecutor also made reference to falsely inflated acquisition prices, but this was in the context of the fraudulent nature of the assignments overall.
	
	
	The exchanges between the trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor extracted by the appellant do no more than evidence the sort of exchanges that might be expected in a trial of this nature, where the details of directions to the jury were discussed with counsel prior to being given to the jury. That such inquiries occurred does not indicate that the Crown’s case was in flux and confused, and a jury must also, therefore, have been confused. His Honour appears to have sought clarification of some points in the Crown case, clarification which was provided without any expression of concern by the appellant’s counsel at trial.
	
	
	Had there been such a fundamental shift, and consequent confusion as to the Crown case, it might be expected that trial counsel would have raised that issue before the trial judge and made some sort of complaint about it. Although the appellant was represented by experienced Queens Counsel at trial, no such complaint was made, a feature of the case to which this Court is entitled to have regard, since it suggests that trial counsel saw nothing in the conduct of the case, in this regard, to complain about.
	
	
	That the appellant’s counsel at trial did not raise any complaint about a “shift” in the Crown’s case of such significance as to affect the admissibility of evidence tendered or, conversely, not tendered, strongly suggests that counsel did not perceive there to be such a shift. It suggests that counsel understood that the Crown’s case was that it was the assignments that were asserted to be the sham, and not just the falsity of purchase prices for the medical technologies.
	
	
	The absence of any complaint by trial counsel is consistent with a conclusion that there was no change in the Crown’s case. The full detail of both the particulars provided to the appellant by the Crown, and the Crown Prosecutor’s opening address read as a whole, make it clear that the Crown’s case was never, as the appellant contends, confined to an assertion of a conspiracy based upon falsely inflated purchase prices for the medical technologies assigned by Athena to NHA. It was always more widely cast than that, and that is the basis upon which the parties dealt with the evidence placed before the jury.
	
	
	On that basis, the appellant’s contention that evidence inadmissible to the “changed” Crown case was admitted, and evidence that could have been led was not, falls away, and is not further addressed.
	
	
	This proposed ground of appeal is without merit.
	
	
	Since this ground raises questions of fact as well as law, the leave of the Court is required to advance it: s 5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). We would not grant leave.
	


Ground Two: The trial miscarried because there was unreasonable evidence to convict Michael Issakidis


	
	The framing of this ground appears to argue that, had the case against Mr Issakidis gone to the jury, it would not have been open to the jury to convict him, and any verdict of guilty would have been unreasonable. That being the case, the appellant’s trial miscarried, as this Court could not conclude that it was open to the jury to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, as to the appellant’s guilt. It is submitted that there is a significant possibility that the alleged co-conspirator is innocent and the verdicts against the appellant must therefore be set aside since, in effect, he could not have conspired with an innocent person.
	
	
	The jury was discharged with respect to the trial against Mr Issakidis, the trial judge granting his application in that regard: R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 1595. The appellant did not join the application.
	
	
	It should be recalled that there is no longer a general principle of law to the effect that a conspirator’s conviction can only stand in circumstances where the co-conspirator is also convicted. Whilst such was historically the case, that was at a time when the grounds for challenging a conviction were limited to errors on the face of the record, and the apparent inconsistency of the record showing one conspirator found guilty, and the other acquitted, was regarded as a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	This rule has been held to have:
	


“…long since outlived its usefulness and should now be swept away, together with the anomalies and absurdities from which it is inseparable.” (Director of Public Prosecutions v Shannon [1975] AC 717, at 771 per Lord Salmon)


	
	That position was considered and accepted as correct and to be applied in Australia by the High Court in R v Darby [1982] HCA 32; (1982) 148 CLR 668. At 678, Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ held that:
	


“In the light of the wealth of both academic and judicial consideration that has been devoted to this topic in recent years, we have no doubt that this Court should now redirect the common law of Australia onto its true course. It should determine that the conviction of a conspirator whether tried together with or separately from an alleged co-conspirator may stand notwithstanding that the latter is or may be acquitted unless in all the circumstances of the case his conviction is inconsistent with the acquittal of the other person. In our opinion such a determination will focus upon the justice of the case rather than upon the technical obscurities that now confound the subject.”


	
	The question for this Court then, is not whether the alleged co-conspirator is, or may be innocent, but whether the appellant’s conviction is inconsistent with the asserted innocence of Mr Issakidis and whether, upon assessing the evidence, for itself, this Court considers that it was open to the jury to conclude, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant was guilty: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 56; (1997) 191 CLR 439; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	To some extent, the Court is placed in a difficult position in conducting this assessment since the jury was discharged in relation to Mr Issakidis, and he is proceeding to re-trial. The reason for the discharge of the jury was the revelation very late in the trial of a quantity of further documentary evidence which may alter the case to be presented against the alleged co-conspirator at any further trial.
	
	
	At the joint trial, prior to the discharge of the jury relevant to Mr Issakidis, the Crown did not allege that Mr Issakidis’ role in the conspiracy was the same as the appellant’s asserted role and, consistent with the differing roles of each, the evidence led against each differed. It may further differ when Mr Issakidis again faces trial. It is a moot point as to whether this Court can properly assess the case against the alleged co-conspirator in those circumstances, in order to determine the validity of the appellant’s conviction.
	
	
	The evidence placed before the jury in the joint trial was, in our view, sufficient to establish that Mr Issakidis entered an agreement with the appellant to cause NHA to file income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses for the asserted cost of acquisition of medical technologies where no costs had in fact been incurred, to the loss of the Revenue.
	
	
	In R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 9) [2014] NSWSC 1460, which dealt with a no case to answer submission made by Mr Issakidis (and joined by the appellant) at the close of the Crown case, the trial judge, in refusing the application, summarised what the evidence against the alleged co-conspirator was capable of establishing. His Honour concluded that there was sufficient evidence to establish that:
	



	
	Mr Issakidis knowingly provided documents to Walsh & Walsh that falsely asserted an obligation incurred by NHA to pay for the acquisition of medical technologies from Karkalla.
	
	
	The documents were provided in the knowledge that they would be used to prepare financial accounts, and with full awareness of the financial accounts to be produced and their relevance to the preparation of tax returns for NHA.
	
	
	Mr Issakidis was aware that NHA would claim depreciation against the costs of the acquisitions in the context of assessment of tax payable by NHA.
	



	
	The trial judge made these findings on the basis of a considerable volume of largely documentary evidence that is clearly capable of establishing the participation of the alleged co-conspirator in the conspiracy with the appellant. The documentary evidence was capable of establishing Mr Issakidis’ knowledge of matters connected with the aims of the conspiracy, and acts done in furtherance of it, including:
	



	
	Knowledge that it was Athena which had acquired the intellectual property for Genvax and CG Surgical, and the terms on which the acquisitions were made;
	
	
	Acting to settle relevant correspondence in furtherance of the acquisition by Athena of CG Surgical;
	
	
	Knowledge that Genvax and CG Surgical were to be purportedly assigned to NHA through a Cayman Islands company;
	
	
	Involvement in the negotiations with the inventors for the acquisition of Genvax and Cologene;
	
	
	Involvement in due diligence inquiries by the ANZ relevant to the structured finance;
	
	
	Knowledge that the amount NHA was to pay Karkalla for the technologies did not represent a true value;
	
	
	Executing an assignment agreement between NHA and Athena in relation to the Genvax technology that was not consistent with the Karkalla assignment agreement;
	
	
	Involvement in the creation of a false assignment agreement of Genvax from Athena to NHA to satisfy inquiries by Barclays Bank;
	
	
	Knowledge that NHA was claiming high depreciation expenses arising from the asserted acquisition of the medical technologies;
	
	
	Knowledge that NHA was to receive substantial cash distributions in accordance with the terms of the structured finance transactions;
	
	
	Knowledge that Athena, Karkalla and KIH were all controlled by the appellant;
	
	
	Acted to sign the 2007 financial report claiming a loss of over $97 million, and later (in 2009) signed another version of the report claiming losses at in excess of $82 million, with knowledge of the connection between the reports and taxation returns to be prepared by the appellant and filed with the ATO;
	
	
	Undertook a number of the international financial transactions, moving money between NHA bank accounts in Australia, and overseas accounts;
	
	
	Participated in building correspondence about communicating with Peggy Wong and Jay Corbett, knowing each was the appellant; and
	
	
	Was aware that his participation in the scheme would provide substantial financial benefits to him, receiving monies in excess of $12 million.
	



	
	Although the Crown’s case against Mr Issakidis is a circumstantial one, there is a significant body of highly probative evidence which was (and will be) available to any jury in determining his alleged participation in the conspiracy. In our view, it is well open to a jury, acting reasonably and in accordance with proper direction, to accept the guilt of Mr Issakidis beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In his written submissions the appellant referred to the late disclosure of documents by the Crown to him and the alleged co-conspirator, and referred to error by the trial judge in allowing cross-examination of the appellant with reference to some of that material. Since there is no ground of appeal that raises the issue of late disclosure by the Crown, and the use subsequently made of the documents, it has no apparent relevance to ground 2 as framed. It is not further considered.
	
	
	Leave is required to argue this ground, as it raises questions of fact and law. We would not grant leave.
	


Ground 3: The trial judge erred in deciding in R v Dickson (No. 1) that count 6 ought not to have been stayed


	
	Prior to the empanelment of a jury to hear his trial, the appellant filed a notice of motion seeking to have count 6 of the indictment permanently stayed. It was argued that count 6 was an abuse of process because it did not raise any different allegations of criminality to those which were essential elements of count 1. Having heard the relevant evidence and submissions, the trial judge refused to stay count 6: R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 1068. The appellant contends that his Honour was in error in refusing a stay on that count.
	
	
	Citing Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 395 as authority for the argument, the appellant submits that the issue goes beyond one of whether the appellant had available to him a plea in bar, also encompassing a situation where the court’s processes and procedures are used as instruments of injustice or unfairness.
	
	
	In his judgment on the stay application, the trial judge concluded that, although there was one overarching scheme, each conspiracy dealt with a separate aspect of that scheme, and involved separate criminality. The first conspiracy was identified as the series of steps preparatory to the filing of the tax returns, and the second as the receipt and dissipation of income, including by concealing it in various transactions.
	
	
	The appellant submits that his Honour was in error.
	
	
	The Crown argues that there was no plea in bar available to the appellant in relation to count 6, as the elements of the two offences were different. Neither was there an artificial division of the conduct alleged against the appellant, as the two offences involved separate and distinct criminality.
	
	
	In determining whether a plea in bar exists, consideration must be given to those matters raised in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 (“Pearce”), and to whether the evidence necessary to establish count 6 would have been sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict for count 1: Chia Gee v Martin [1905] HCA 70; (1905) 3 CLR 649; Li Wan Quai v Christie [1906] HCA 42; (1906) 3 CLR 1125. This necessarily means considering the elements of each offence to see if there is complete correspondence between them.
	
	
	To prove count 1, an offence contrary to s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”) the Crown had to prove, beyond reasonable doubt that:
	



	
	The appellant conspired (that is, entered into an agreement) with Michael Issakidis to intentionally and dishonestly cause a loss or risk of loss to a third person;
	
	
	The appellant knew or believed that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk of loss occurring;
	
	
	The third person is the Commonwealth; and
	
	
	The appellant or Mr Issakidis committed an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.
	



	
	To prove count 6, an offence contrary to ss 11.5 and 400.3 of the Code, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that:
	



	
	The appellant conspired with Michael Issakidis to “deal with” money or other property which is the proceeds of crime;
	
	
	The appellant believed the money or property to be the proceeds of crime, or he believed it would become an instrument of crime; and
	
	
	The money or other property was valued at or in excess of one million dollars.
	



	
	“Deal with” means receiving, possessing, concealing or disposing of money or property; importing money or other property to, or exporting it from, Australia; or engaging in a banking transaction relating to money or other property.
	
	
	As that outline of the elements of each of the two offences makes clear, the elements required to be proved are different, and quite separate.  
	
	
	A plea in bar is not available to prevent a person being prosecuted for different offences arising out of the same set of facts. Its availability is confined to cases in which the elements of the offences charged are identical or in which all of the elements of one offence are wholly included in the other: Pearce at [24] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ.
	
	
	No plea in bar could arise here based upon the sameness or commonality of the elements of the offences since each of the offences with which the appellant was charged required proof of a fact which the other did not.
	
	
	The appellant’s broader argument is that the division by the Crown of the charged conduct into two offences was an abuse of process which should have led to count 6 being stayed. That argument, however, is no more meritorious than is the argument for the availability of a plea in bar.
	
	
	It is open to a trial judge to stay the prosecution of a particular charge where a separate charge on the indictment arising from the same conduct readily encompasses the criminality of that charge: Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294. In such circumstances there is a basis to conclude that the addition of a separate charge is oppressive.
	
	
	However, that is not the situation that arises in the present matter.
	
	
	In R v Dickson (No 1) the trial judge correctly concluded that there was an overall scheme put in place by the appellant, being an agreement to obtain a finance deal to derive income which would not be subject to taxation because it would be offset by false tax deductions. That conduct was reflected by count 1. Count 6 reflected the steps taken by the appellant, acting in agreement with Mr Issakidis, to conceal and “launder” the proceeds derived from the conduct the subject of count 1, by a series of involved international banking transactions.
	
	
	The criminality of count 6 was quite separate to that of count 1, and the criminality of the latter did not reflect the former.
	
	
	It is a matter for the prosecuting authority to frame charges against an accused person that adequately reflect all relevant criminal conduct, thus enabling a sentencing court to impose a punishment that fits the crime. That may involve charging separate offences carrying differing maximum penalties, albeit that each charge arises from the same set of facts.
	
	
	In Pearce, where an indictment charging offences contrary to s 33 and s 110 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), both arising from one incident, was under consideration, it was held at [31] that:
	


“There was, however, no abuse of process in charging this appellant with both counts 9 and 10. The short answer to the contention that the charging of both counts was an abuse of process is that because the offences are different (and different in important respects) the laying of both charges could not be said to be vexatious or oppressive or for some improper or ulterior purpose. To hold otherwise would be to preclude the laying of charges that, together, reflect the whole criminality of the accused and, consonant with what was held in R v De Simoni would require the accused to be sentenced only for the offence or offences charged, excluding consideration of any part of the accused's conduct that could have been charged separately.” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	The appellant relies upon the authority of Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; (2010) 201 A Crim R 150 (“Nahlous”) in support of his contention that it was oppressive to charge both counts against him, but the facts in that case are very different to those pertaining here. In Nahlous the charges were brought pursuant to the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) and related to the sale of unauthorized decoder machines. Having sold a number of machines, the applicant was arrested with the cash received from the sale in his possession. He was additionally charged with a Code money laundering offence relating to that cash.
	
	
	Factually, the offender in that case had done nothing with the proceeds of his crime other than receive the monies in exchange for the unauthorised machines. He had not taken steps to conceal the funds, or to deal with them in any way. Of that situation, the Court said (at [17]):
	


“We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty… We believe that in the circumstances of this case it was oppressive to charge the applicant with both the sale of the decoders and the receipt of the money as a result of the sale. That is because in our view the offence of sale encompassed the criminality of possessing the proceeds of the sale.”


	
	Of some significance in the present case, the Court went on, at [18]:
	


“…The Code offence was intended to punish the possession of the proceeds of crime however they are obtained and the fact that the proceeds of the crime were in the public domain and could be dealt with or passed on to others. We accept that this may be a justification for the prosecution of such an offence particularly where the source of the funds is unknown, or where the proceeds were derived from the criminal act of another person or where the person is in some way dealing with the proceeds in order to hide their source or change the nature of the proceeds…”


	
	On the evidence, the appellant was dealing with the proceeds to “hide their source or change the nature of the proceeds.”
	
	
	The conduct charged by counts 1 and 6, whilst arising from a course of conduct with a single overriding dishonest purpose, was different in terms of both the overt acts undertaken and the criminality of those acts. Count 1 is directed towards the criminality involved in the agreement to cause a loss or risk of loss of tax revenue to the Commonwealth while count 6 is directed towards the criminality involved in agreeing to conceal the property derived from count 1, and involved considerably more than simply receiving the monies obtained from count 1. Elaborate and complicated financial transactions were effected involving numerous banking and other transactions offshore, the use of persons, companies and accounts in overseas jurisdictions to hide the appellant’s role, and the creation of numerous false documents such as false loan documents and false bills of sale to disguise the true origins of the funds, and the connection of the appellant to them.
	
	
	The criminality involved in count 6 was considerably different to that involved in count 1, and it could not have been addressed by count 1, particularly by any sentencing court.
	
	
	The appellant has not established this ground.
	


Ground 4: Count 1 is duplicitous


	
	The appellant’s argument is that, although he was charged with one count of conspiring to dishonestly cause a loss, or dishonestly cause a risk of a loss to the Commonwealth, it is open to conclude that there were up to three separate agreements alleged by the Crown, and thus that the charge was bad for duplicity, as any one of the three agreements could have constituted the charged offence. The separate agreements are said to be those relating to the purchase of separate medical technologies, each of which, it is argued, must have required an agreement to claim false depreciation expenses.
	
	
	Although the trial judge gave the jury a unanimity direction, the appellant contends that the direction was incapable of curing the latent duplicity in the charge, and the prejudice to him that arose as a result.
	
	
	The Crown argues that the charge was not bad for duplicity, and distinguishes between the nature of the conspiratorial agreement and the acts done to achieve the agreement.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence, we do not consider there to be any duplicity in the charge. The appellant’s argument confuses the conspiracy, being the agreement to lodge tax returns claiming false deductions, in the form of false depreciation expenses to offset large amounts of income being received under the ANZ transactions, with the acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy, including the purchase of the individual technologies.
	
	
	The Crown alleged a continuing offence, which involved entry into a number of individual transactions, that is, a single continuing criminal enterprise: R v Moussad [1999] NSWCCA 337; (1999) 152 FLR 373, Calleija v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 37; (2012) 223 A Crim R 391, at [55].
	
	
	The Crown case was that the conspiratorial agreement relevant to count 1 was reached prior to 12 January 2007. The individual technologies were acquired after that date, as a means of implementing the agreement. There followed a course of conduct over a period of years with many individual acts done in furtherance of the agreement.
	
	
	This ground is without substance.
	


Ground 5: His Honour failed to direct the jury in relation to count 1 that the Crown had to prove that there was a causal nexus between dishonesty and the intention to cause a loss / risk of loss


	
	By this ground the appellant challenges the correctness of the directions given to the jury concerning the elements of count 1.
	
	
	His Honour gave the jury relevant directions during the course of his summing up, supplementing the oral directions with written directions. After the directions had been given, the appellant sought a further direction, arguing that the jury should be directed that, to prove the charge, it was necessary for the Crown to establish a causal connection between the agreement the subject of the conspiracy, and its achievement. His Honour declined to give the direction as sought: R v Dickson (No 15) [2014] NSWSC 1861.
	
	
	At [2] – [3] of the ex tempore judgment, the trial judge said:
	


“…[C]ount 1 is a charge under s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and that does not contain the word “caused.” It is a conspiracy count. It is directed to a person conspiring with another person “to dishonestly cause a loss”. As such it is directed to what the alleged co-conspirators agreed would be the intended result of their actions and does not require as an amount of proof that their actions in fact achieved the desired result.

This is reinforced by a s 135.5(10) which provides that a person may be found guilty of an offence under this section, including s 135.4(5), even though the obtaining of the gain was impossible.”


	
	In submitting that his Honour was in error in refusing to give the jury a causation direction, the appellant argues that s 135.4 of the Code requires that ""the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended to do the thing pursuant to the agreement"" (s 135.4(9)(b)), and that necessarily involves proof of dishonesty which must be causally related to the loss or risk of loss. An involved semantic argument about the meaning and construction of the provisions is advanced.
	
	
	With due respect to the somewhat convoluted argument advanced by the appellant (which need not be further considered), the matter is in fact quite straightforward. What was charged, and what the Crown had to prove, was an agreement to dishonestly cause a loss. The Crown did not have to prove a causal nexus between the conspiracy and the object, and no direction to that effect was necessary.
	
	
	The focus in any conspiracy is upon what the conspirators intended or conspired to bring about, not on whether or not the object was in fact achieved. A Code conspiracy is complete where the conspiratorial agreement between two or more persons has been reached, and where an overt act is undertaken pursuant to the agreement.
	
	
	The directions given to the jury by the trial judge set out in clear terms the matters of which the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, if a verdict of guilty was to be returned. The written directions (MFI 84) included the following (at AB50:14439-40):
	


“1. Has the Crown proven beyond reasonable doubt that between 15 November 2005 and 2 December 2011 Anthony Dickson conspired with Michael Issakidis to:

A    (i) dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth, or

(ii) dishonestly cause a risk of loss to the Commonwealth;

Knowing or believing either

B   (i) that the loss would occur; or

(ii) that there was a substantial a risk the loss would occur?

2. The offence on Count 1 of the indictment has been committed by the accused Anthony Dickson if and only if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that between 15 November 2005 and 2 December 2011:

2.1 He meant to enter into an agreement with Michael Issakidis to:

(a) cause Neumedix Health Australasia Pty Limited ('NHA') to lodge income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses based on the alleged cost of the purported acquisition of intellectual property by NHA where no such cost or obligation to pay had been incurred by NHA; and

(b) thereby induce the Commissioner of Taxation to accept that NHA sustained substantial tax losses.

2.2 That

(a) intentionally causing NHA to lodge income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses based on the alleged cost of the purported acquisition of intellectual property by NHA when no such cost or obligation to pay had been incurred by NHA and believing that to be so; and

(b) doing so to induce the Commissioner of Taxation to accept that NHA sustained substantial tax losses;

was conduct that was:

(c) dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people; AND

(d) known by the accused Dickson to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people; AND

(e) known by Michael Issakidis to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people;

2.3 That each of Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis intended to dishonestly

cause a loss or a risk of loss to the Commonwealth pursuant to their agreement;

2.4 That Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis knew or believed that the loss wouldoccur or that there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring; and

2.5 That either Dickson or Mr Issakidis committed an act pursuant to their agreement.”


	
	To argue that causation had to be established is to overlook or ignore the provisions of s 135.4(10) of the Code, which specifically provides for a finding of guilt even where the object of the conspiracy was impossible:
	


“(10)   A person may be found guilty of an offence against this section even if:

(a) obtaining the gain, causing the loss, causing the risk of loss, or influencing the Commonwealth public official, as the case may be, is impossible; or

   (b) the only other party to the agreement is a body corporate; or

   (c) each other party to the agreement is a person who is not criminally responsible; or

(d) subject to subsection (11), all other parties to the agreement have been acquitted of the offence.”


	
	There could hardly be a causal nexus in a conspiracy with an impossible object.
	
	
	The direction sought by the appellant was not required, and the trial judge was correct to decline to give it. There has been no miscarriage of justice in that regard.
	
	
	This ground has not been made out.
	


Ground 6: The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that it was an indispensable intermediate fact to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could convict the appellant that they be satisfied: (a) Neumedix did not have the intention to pay for the acquisition of intellectual property; and (b) Neumedix did not have the capacity to pay for the acquisition of intellectual property


	
	The appellant contends that the jury should have been directed that, before a verdict of guilty could be returned, there had to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that NHA had neither the intention nor the capacity to pay for the acquisition of intellectual property. It is submitted that this was required because the Crown’s closing address to the jury, in which it was submitted that the agreements and assignments were a sham, was an argument that tended to undermine the appellant’s evidence that he and NHA had both the intention and the capacity to pay for the technologies.
	
	
	The direction given by the trial judge and impugned by the appellant as inadequate is as follows (at AB50:14403):
	


“2.1   He meant to enter into an agreement with Michael Issakidis to:

cause Neumedix Health Australasia Pty Limited ('NHA') to lodge income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses based on the alleged cost of the purported acquisition of intellectual property by NHA where no such cost or obligation to pay had been incurred by NHA; and

thereby induce the Commissioner of Taxation to accept that NHA sustained substantial tax losses.

2.2   That

intentionally causing NHA to lodge income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses based on the alleged cost of the purported acquisition of intellectual property by NHA when no such cost or obligation to pay had been incurred by NHA and believing that to be so; and

doing so to induce the Commissioner of Taxation to accept that NHA sustained substantial tax losses.”


	
	As with ground 5, the additional directions that the appellant asserts should have been given to the jury would have had the effect of adding a layer of proof beyond that which was required to establish the charge. The appellant's argument in support of ground 1 involved a concession that the Crown's case at the end of the trial was that the relevant agreements were shams (we have rejected the appellant's argument that this involved a departure from the way the case was put earlier in the trial) and the appellant has not contended that the trial judge did not adequately explain this case to the jury.  
	
	
	The matters referred to in the present ground of appeal were relevant to that case but not essential to be proved before the jury could find that the case had been established beyond reasonable doubt (see Shepherd v R at 578-586).
	
	
	Whilst the capacity to pay was a relevant feature of the matter for the jury to consider in determining whether the Crown had proved its case, it is not essential to proof of the offence. An individual or company could have considerable capacity to meet an obligation to pay without having a corresponding intention to do so.
	
	
	Nor could the intention of a company be a critical intermediate fact to proof of the charge. The relevant consideration was the state of mind of the conspirators and his Honour’s directions to the jury properly addressed that aspect of proof of the charge. The state of mind of the company, assuming a company could have such a thing, was not a determinative feature.
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint made by this ground as framed is concerned with the directions to the jury. However, a significant part of the submissions in support of the ground go to a purported failure to adequately put the appellant’s case to the jury. Although it has some factual relationship to the argument in support of ground 6, it should have formed a separate ground.
	
	
	Insofar as it is relevant to ground 6, we are unable to agree that the trial judge failed to adequately put the appellant’s case, and specifically, to adequately summarise the evidence of Dr Randerson. The complaint is that his Honour “paid scant attention” to the appellant’s case that he had both the capacity and the intention to cause NHA to pay for the various technologies.
	
	
	There is no obligation on a trial judge to summarise any or all of the evidence given before the jury: s 161 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). As was held in Aravena v R [2015] NSWCCA 288, at [109]:
	


“The question ultimately is whether the trial judge put an accused’s case in such a way as to allow a jury to properly consider the issues raised on the accused’s behalf: R v Malone (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Blanch J, 20 April 1994, unrep). There is no standard formula against which the instructions given in any particular trial may be measured. As was stated in Cleland v The Queen [1982] HCA 67; 151 CLR 1 by Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed on this issue) at [10],

‘It is clear in principle that a trial judge, when directing a jury in a criminal trial, must hold an even balance between the cases of the prosecution and the accused and must fairly direct the consideration of the jury to the matters raised by the accused in his defence. In what manner, and in what detail, this should be done must of course depend on the circumstances of each case.’”


	
	In his summing up, the trial judge specifically told the jury that he proposed only to summarise those aspects of the evidence which were relevant to the “sharp disagreements” that had emerged during the trial. He gave the jury the standard direction to the effect that the fact that he referred to a particular aspect of the evidence did not mean the jury should give it any greater weight or emphasis than the jury considered to be warranted.
	
	
	His Honour set out for the jury an outline of the Crown’s case and an outline of the appellant’s case. He referred to the appellant’s capacity to discharge the payment obligations incurred under the assignment agreements, and supplemented this aspect of the summing up following a request for further directions.
	
	
	His Honour said (at AB15:SU159-167):
	


“Thank you members of the jury. I am now up to section 4.10 in the index that I handed out yesterday. One point relied on by the Crown as part of its overall contention that the assignment agreements were shams, a concept I will explain a bit later in the summing-up, and in particular did not give rise to any genuine obligation on the part of NHA to pay those large amounts for the patent rights consideration, is the Crown says that it was known to all that NHA did not and never would have the financial capacity to pay those amounts. The Crown says it was for that reason that documents were created that falsely suggested that NHA had secured a line of credit facility from Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited to pay the amounts owing under the assignments.

Now the Crown Prosecutor referred you to exhibit 1D40 which shows that the financial obligations of NHA in respect of all nine technologies exceeded $1.5 billion. In respect of the three technologies the Crown pointed to the large amounts that it agreed to pay for an assignment for only periods of time compared with what the Crown says was the early stage of commercial development of the patents and the relatively small amounts that Athena had paid for the same technology at the same time and I will address some of evidence and some of the submissions on those contentions in this section and the next.

The financial accounts of NHA that were provided to the ATO were the first tax return included a note number 4. That note referred to NHA receiving a line of credit facility from ""an Asian based funding syndicate managed by Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited, an Asian based financier"". That could be used to fund the company's acquisition of intellectual property. Volume 8A, page 2999 at 3105. One document that was given to the ATO as part of the audit was an unsigned loan agreement which referred to Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited as agent for the Dampier Finance Partnership Number 318. It bears the date 15 January 2007, volume 3, 997. It is for a maximum of a $100 million.

Now the Crown submitted that those documents were provided to the ATO to persuade the ATO that at least one method of funding the acquisition of the intellectual property by NHA, the subject of the depreciation claims, was the use of that loan facility. The Crown submitted that that unsigned agreement and that reference in the notes were fictitious. The Crown suggested that the loan statements from Dampier which are found at volume 3, 1016, were also fictitious and again made up to bolster the idea that somehow NHA had a source of funding to pay those amounts. The Crown said that the only funds that were ever available to NHA were those that it had got from the ANZ structured finance deal.

The Crown contrasted the note in the accounts sent to the ATO which described Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited with the note in the earlier description in the first set of accounts prepared by Walsh & Walsh and signed by Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis which described Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited as ""Asian based merchant bank"", volume 4, page 1562. The Crown pointed to the evidence of Mr Compton where he said he created the loan statements after he commenced in 2009. Transcript 2132. The Crown pointed to various aspects of the loan agreement that was provided to the ATO such as the notation that it bore bearing a copyright 2003 of Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited did not exist and said the loan schedules had basic errors that one would not expect from an organisation that agreed to lend $100 million. The Crown also point the to the evidence of Michael Harper that did he did not know about the facility, transcript 1696, and the Crown says he should be expected to know because he was helping NHA prepare for a float or at least some form of institutional public offering.

In relation to Michael Issakidis the material referred to by the Crown included those two versions of the accounts which he signed. Now the Crown also contends that from his handwritten notes and his dealings with Jay Corbett, a matter that I will come to later in the summing-up, that Mr Issakidis knew that Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited was holding the funds that NHA had obtained from ANZ, and that they were doing so to distribute back to himself and Mr Dickson and with some to Mr Harper but was not holding funds ready to drawn down under any loan facilities.

In his evidence-in-chief Mr Dickson explained that there were two facilities with Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited for NHA. One he said was the line of the credit facility noted in the accounts which he said was to fund NHA's working capital. He said it was a $100 million line of credit. He also said there was another facility and that ""we took $120 million of the money owing to HFAC and we put that in a separate facility"". And he said: ""Pre-GFC we were told, and I had confidence that we would be able to sell that discreet facility down"". He called that the securitisation loan facility with Dampier Finance Asia Pacific as agent for ""I think it's called the Dampier Finance Partnership Number 318"".

Now in cross-examination Mr Dickson was asked about the agreement provided to the ATO at volume 3, page 997 which is for the maximum $100 million. He said it was executed on 15 January 2007 and the executed copy was with his lawyers. Transcript 3250. He said he signed it for both parties Transcript 3252. He said he believed the facility limit, that is the maximum amount in the executed version, was the same as the one given to the ATO, that is $100 million. Transcript 3250. In relation to the accounts statements at page 116 and which appear to start at page 1022 he said they related to the securitisation loan, not the line of credit which was only drawn down for $8 million. Transcript 3253. He said the phrase ""C2003"" related to DFG, that is Dampier Finance Group overall, not Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited, because he said Dampier Finance Group predated the incorporation of Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited. Mr Dickson said that he had asked Mr Compton to clean up existing loan account statements as they were drab looking. Transcript 3255.

Now in relation to the securitisation facility Mr Dickson stated at transcript

3254:

""No, no, moneys were drawn down under this loan facility. What this is, this is a substitution so NHA owes money to HFAC so instead of owing that money to HFAC it was shifted to being owning to this Dampier Finance Group partnership.""

Now a signed loan agreement with Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited dated 15 January 2007 which appears similar to the one provided to the ATO was tendered in re-examination as exhibit 1D52. However that has a maximum limit of $120 million, not $100 million as is the case with the unsigned agreement supplied to the ATO.

Now one other matter of potential significance on the Crown case, and a matter upon which it placed great reliance, was the unsigned letters from Athena to Michael Issakidis dated 30 November 2010 which are found at volume 11, page 4388, 4390A, and 4391. Those letters include a statement that NHA had failed to make any payments of instalments due under the assignment agreements. And according to the Crown that is very different to saying that the funds paid to Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Limited were in fact for payment of the patent rights consideration as the receipts at red tab 14 state, or that moneys had been drawn down under a securitisation facility to pay for the patent rights consideration.

Michael Harper said he drafted those letters. He was asked this at transcript 1849:

""Q. In that letter, just going back to 4388A, you say there, when I say you, the letter says at the end of the third paragraph on page

4388 'NeuMedix has failed to make any payments of instalments due under the terms of Schedule 2 do you see that?   

A. Yes.   

Q. Who told you that?   

A. Anthony Dickson.""   

Mr Anthony Dickson was asked about this at transcript 3479 and his answer

was:

""Q. You told him there will be no payments made under it, is that right?   

A. No I told him that $63 million had been paid in accordance with the cash that had gone off shore and in accordance with the    receipts received from HFAC but there was a delay in NHA being able to pay.""

The resolution of that dispute in the evidence, members of the jury, is a matter for you and you alone. Can I just say one thing about these letters; the Crown referred to them in the context of developing Michael Issakidis' involvement because the letters are addressed to him. You should note that in answer to a question posed in cross-examination by Mr Byrne Michael Harper said that to his knowledge Michael Issakidis was not aware of the letters and he never spoke to Michael Issakidis about them. (T 1855)

While I am still dealing with this topic of the capacity of NHA to pay these Patent Rights Consideration can I remind you on Wednesday morning Mr Gross took you in some detail to the evidence of Anthony Dickson concerning the efforts made to pursue various funding sources for HFAC. You recall you were taken to the business plan at tab 1 of the yellow book and that included a very long list of potential funding sources for a business like NHA. You were read in detail parts of Mr Dickson's evidence explaining those sources.

The Crown submitted that the business plan was recently concocted. During the cross-examination of Mr Dickson he pointed out that one part of ATO's very long audit letter dated 10 February 2010 had requested ""Full details of your business plan"". That is at p 4029. Mr Dickson was asked about that and he agreed it was not given but he said he was not required to provide it. [T 4061]. Otherwise you recall yesterday I addressed this issue concerning the production of documents to the Australian Tax Office and the seizure of documents by the Australian Federal Police.

Mr Gross then referred you on Wednesday to the evidence his client gave about efforts made to in fact obtain funding which included approaches to various Governments and Foundations. Mr Gross submitted that notwithstanding the event of the Global Financial Crisis his client was still able to secure what was described as inertia funding from ANZ as well as the line of credit, the securitization facility which I have referred to, and the companies were proceeding to list, that is, pursue institutional public offerings both in the United Kingdom and Australia.

With those listings Mr Gross took you to the Draft Business Plan of the IP for the United Kingdom at Exhibit 1D29 and for Australia 1D35. Whether and if so how money raised under those floats might have been used to pay amounts under the Assignment Agreements was not explored in the evidence.

What do you think members of the jury? Has the Crown satisfied you that NHA did not have the capacity to pay the Patent Rights Consideration for the various loans and the facilities referred to were fictitious. Are you satisfied that Mr Dickson told Mr Harper to write that no payments had been made by NHA? Were Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis pursuing sources of funding not just for NHA but specifically to pay off the Patent Rights Consideration that NHA had apparently agreed to under the Assignment Agreements. Do you accept Mr Dickson's evidence on this or has he at least left you in doubt on this question? These are all matters of fact for you and you alone.

A further related point that was put by the Crown is that even though NHA had apparently agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars for the Patent Rights Consideration for the three technologies according to the Crown there were ""no steps towards commercialisation in the years that followed."" The Crown submitted that the technologies were all in the preclinical stage and they needed further funds to get to phase one.

At one point in the submissions the Crown submitted the inventors were and are in limbo land, not just because of the arrest of the accused and Mr Issakidis, but they were in that state before then. The Crown submitted that if Mr Issakidis and Mr Dickson had truly committed NHA to paying amounts of money they were said to have done under the Assignment Agreements then they would have continued funding the development of the patents beyond the amounts specified in the loan agreements and they would have taken other efforts [...]”


	
	After the request for further directions, his Honour added (at AB15:SU334-336):
	


“The second point I need to supplement concerns part 4.10 of the summing-up in which I discussed NHA's ability to pay the patent rights assignments. When I addressed that section I addressed the contention of the Crown which was that it was known to all involved that NHA did not and never would have the financial capacity to pay the patent rights assignments. That is a matter Mr Dickson strongly disputes.

I am not going to repeat the discussion but I will mention two matters that were arrested by Mr Dickson in his evidence on that issue. The first was what he described at transcript T 2942 where he said that he resolved to adopt a strategy of ""investing in a diversified portfolio of technologies"". He said that they ""built a portfolio, we wanted it up to 20 but got to nine technologies with that in mind."" He said having ""eliminated the risk that our whole investment would be lost with someone else's better technology"" and that ""when you have a portfolio or basket of technologies one kicks, it will pay for the whole basket. So it is good economics to do that. That is why that approach was adopted by us."" And he reiterated that if one the technologies ""would take off and take care of our liabilities and then there would be profits for stakeholders in NHA."" There is a reference to this approach in the file note at yellow Tab 6.

The second point on this topic that I wanted to remind you of was that

Mr Dickson also referred to the effects of the global financial crisis on what he said were his efforts to source financing from NHA. At transcript T 2927 he described the position prior to the global financial crisis as follows. He said:

""In the five years pre GFC, we saw massive amounts of funds being invested in companies and entities that did not have sufficient cash flow at that time to service that debt or repay the principle of the debt so they were betting on future cash flows to be generated from medical technologies. So it was a very vibrant market at that time.""

And you will remember on Mr Dickson's case the assignment agreements with all the patent rights considerations and obligations were entered into by NHA during the year 2007 and prior to the time that he identified being the GFC.

The third point I want to supplement just concerned Count 6. You will recall yesterday I outlined how the Crown put its case on Count 6, that is the conspiracy to launder money. In particular I described how the Crown put its case in respect of the allegation that Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis meant to enter into an agreement to deal with property that was the proceeds of crime, that each of them believed it to be the proceeds of crime, and the value of which was $1 million or more. At this point I am just going to repeat what the Crown says and then outline what is said on behalf of the accused in respect of that aspect of Count 6.

The Crown case is that by entering into the agreement that was subject of Count 1 Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis had agreed to ensure that NHA would not have any tax liability because they planned to lodge tax returns falsely claiming depreciation deductions to eliminate its tax liabilities. The Crown says they then planned to deal with the funds obtained from the ANZ financing deal because they both decided it would not be needed to meet NHA's tax liabilities nor any obligations on the part of NHA to pay for patents because of their plan to make false depreciation claims.

Thus the Crown alleges that by no later than early 2007 Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis knew the money received from the trust was wholly derived from the agreement, the subject of Count 1, and that they each believed it to be the proceeds of crime, that is money derived from their agreement or their plan which was the subject of Count 1.

Now on behalf of Mr Dickson it is contended that the moneys paid out of

the ANZ trust to NHA were simply paid pursuant to the arrangements for each to receive trust distributions, that they were the proceeds of that arrangement and they were thus not the proceeds of crime. He contends that after NHA received the funds it was NHA's money and it was lawfully entitled to pay or direct their payment for whatever legitimate commercial purpose it chose. Mr Dickson says that NHA paid the funds shown in exhibit S to HFAC and that thereafter they belonged to HFAC, and this it was entitled to pay or direct payment of those funds and that he, that is Mr Dickson, was entitled to and obliged to make payments to those funds in accordance with HFAC's directions.

On that basis it is submitted that the money standing in the accounts was either the proceeds of the distribution from the ANZ deal or HFAC's money and was not the proceeds of crime and not believed by any of Mr Dickson or Mr Issakidis to be the proceeds of crime. As I have said with all of the other aspects of the case the resolution of this is a matter you and you alone.”


	
	The appellant himself gave evidence as to the capacity to pay and the trial judge referred the jury to that evidence.
	
	
	The directions in this regard fairly presented this aspect of the appellant’s case.
	
	
	The appellant has failed to establish this ground.
	


The crown’s appeal against sentence


	
	On 20 March 2015 Beech-Jones J sentenced the appellant as follows:
	



	
	Count 1, the offence contrary to s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), for which the maximum penalty was 10 years, a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months, to date from 22 December 2014 and expiring on 22 June 2022.
	
	
	Count 6, the offence contrary to s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, a sentence of 9 years imprisonment was imposed, to date from 22 December 2016 and expiring on 22 December 2025.
	
	
	A single non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 22 December 2021 was fixed, pursuant to s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914.
	



	
	The overall term was one of 11 years imprisonment: R v Anthony James Dickson (No 18) [2015] NSWSC 268 at [140] – [142].
	
	
	The Crown appeals against that sentence as manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The Crown’s appeal raised three grounds:
	


“1.   The sentence imposed in respect of the section 135.4(5) charge was manifestly inadequate.

2.   The sentence imposed in respect of the section 11.5(1) and 400.3(1) charge was manifestly inadequate.

3.   The overall effective sentence was manifestly inadequate by reason of insufficient accumulation.”


	
	In written submissions the appellant took no issue with the facts which his Honour found on sentencing, in so far as they were consistent with the jury’s verdict. It was thus accepted that it was open to find that his role had been extensive; that he was the predominate player and the moving force behind the conspiracy the subject of count 1; that Mr Issakidis was not subordinate to him, in a hierarchical sense; that they had both agreed to perpetrate a tax fraud for their own benefit by agreeing to pretend that NHA was investing in three medical technologies at a level above the true amounts; and that they had diverted funds from that purpose to themselves.
	
	
	Despite not himself having appealed the sentence, the appellant contended that his Honour had failed to take into account relevant considerations in arriving at his sentence. It was thus submitted to have been relevant that the amount of a tax debt was not quantitatively the same as the amount of tax that could be recovered. In this case that was argued to have been only the 9 cents in the dollar receivable by NHA, on some $68,405,000.
	
	
	It was also submitted to be relevant that, given the intervening audit by the Tax Commissioner and its consequences, and that absent the lodgement of a tax return with substantial depreciation claims being claimed, the loss the appellant was said to have dishonestly caused could not have materialised. Further, it was argued that assessment of the extent of the loss, or risk of loss, which he had caused should have been limited to what the jury was required to find in convicting him, namely, only one of the medical technologies which formed the basis of the false depreciation claims.
	
	
	The correctness of the sentencing judgment cannot be challenged by the appellant absent an appeal or notice of contention. These submissions may be advanced, however, on re-sentence, if the Crown’s appeal is upheld.
	
	
	For reasons which follow, the sentence appeal must be upheld and the appellant re-sentenced.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	It was the appellant’s submission that the sentencing judgment provided a useful summary of the basis on which he had been found guilty of the two charges which he had defended. It has been earlier referred to.
	
	
	At trial the appellant had admitted that it was he who had caused the transfer of five tranches of funds totalling some $63,715,000 by NHA, to accounts in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, with the bulk being transferred back to Australia. His Honour explained the basis on which he came to be “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender never envisaged they would become available to Australian regulators” (see at [94]). The amount distributed to the appellant and entities associated with him was found to be $19,616,996.37, the jury having rejected the appellant’s evidence that these amounts represented sums invested on behalf of the entity HFAC, or his receipt of remuneration from Randstone.
	
	
	His Honour considered the nature and circumstances of the two offences. He concluded as to count 1 (at [98]) that “this case falls into the worst category of offences under s 135.4(5)”. The features identified were the extent of the loss (at [99]); the level of sophistication and planning involved, the appellant having applied his considerable expertise and business acumen in dealing with various entities, as well as documenting the arrangements necessary to implement a very large fraud in the revenue (at [100]); the use of numerous indicators of deceit (at [101]); the appellant’s extensive role in the conspiracy, it being he who possessed a detailed knowledge of the tax system and the professional skills necessary to implement aspects of the conspiracy; and his motivation, namely greed (at [102]).
	
	
	As to count 6, his Honour considered factors identified in R v Ly [2014] NSWCCA 78, where the respondent had also been charged with offences under ss 400.4(1) and (2) of the Code. They included the extremely large sum involved in the appellant’s offending, his Honour noting that none of the cases brought to his attention had involved an amount of that size (at [105]); the number of transactions and periods involved, namely some 110 transactions involving the movement of funds from and to Australia via companies that he secretly controlled, false identities and codes and, in some cases, disguising the nature of distributions as loans or investments; and the amount dealt with, some $19.6 million (at [106]). His Honour noted, however, that there was no suggestion that the appellant or his co-conspirator contemplated using the funds for any illegal purpose (at [107]).
	
	
	In the result his Honour concluded at [108] that:
	


“The circumstances of count 6 and the offender's conduct warrant a conclusion that this case represents a very serious example of an offence under s 11.5 in so far as it incorporates s 400.3(1).”


	
	His Honour did not find that the formation and adherence to the conspiracies involved a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts, but rather that those acts were the implementation of the conspiracy. Co-operation was not found, given the false documents supplied to the ATO.
	
	
	His Honour also took into account the appellant’s personal circumstances, including his age, background and family circumstances, but could not conclude that the hardship which his conviction would cause, satisfied the requirements of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) as to exceptional cases. While it was accepted that the appellant had previously been of good character, his Honour concluded that was of less significance than it might otherwise have been, given that his qualifications, experience and good standing provided him with the opportunity to commit these offences. His Honour concluded (at 116] – [117]) that:
	


“116   During the course of sentencing submissions the offender's Counsel provided to the Court a forty-five page document written by the offender entitled ""Mr Dickson's submissions on sentence"". Large parts of those submissions sought to reargue the case put by the offender to the jury which they rejected. In that part of the submissions that addressed personal deterrence the offender repeated his bitter complaints about the actions of the ATO and the prosecuting authorities in laying charges. In that part of the submissions that addressed his prospects of rehabilitation, the offender stated ""Mr Dickson has learned that he should avoid doing business in Australia"". These contentions do not assist the offender in obtaining a favourable assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and the absence of a need for personal deterrence.

117   Nevertheless I will proceed on the basis that the prospects of the offender committing an offence of a remotely similar nature in the future are very low. It is inevitable that a substantial custodial sentence will be imposed. The offender realises that his professional career and reputation are destroyed, although he wrongly blames the actions of others rather than himself. The likelihood that upon his release the offender will be in a significant position of trust seems low. However, even if he is, he is highly intelligent and I expect the scars of this prosecution and imprisonment will operate upon his decision-making processes.”


	
	His Honour was referred to comparable cases. He dealt specifically with R v Dunn (No 9) [2014] WASC 61 and Chen v R [2009] NSWCCA 66, after noting the limitations as to the assistance which such comparisons can provide. He gave them the weight discussed in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [53].
	
	
	His Honour then turned to questions of totality and accumulation, concluding that there was an overlap between the elements of counts 1 and 6, as in R v Dunn (No 9), so that on sentencing “care needs to be taken in imposing a penalty for each offence and structuring the overall sentence to ensure that the combined effect of all the sentences reflects the total criminality of the offender's conduct” (at [132]).
	
	
	In arriving at the sentences imposed, his Honour finally observed (at [133] – [136]):
	


“133   In Milne v R [2012] NSWCCA 24 (""Milne"") at [297] the Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised the need for sentences in cases of serious revenue fraud to reflect ""denunciation, general and personal deterrence"". Those tempted to engage in large scale tax fraud constitute a class of offenders who are inherently likely to be swayed from offending by the prospect of prosecution and incarceration for a substantial period of time.

134   Otherwise the authorities binding on this Court require the imposition of substantial custodial sentences for large scale tax fraud of the kind attempted to be perpetrated in this case (Hili at [63]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Hamman (unreported, 1 December 1998); R v O'Connor [2002] NSWCCA 156; Milne id). Thus, in Milne at [297] the Court of Criminal Appeal stated:

""There is a high community expectation that serious tax fraud will be properly punished and offenders, no matter their business acumen and high status in the commercial world, will be dealt with sternly and appropriately.""

135   These observations apply with all their force to the offender. Having regard to its size, scale, timespan and tactics his offending falls into the worst category of cases under s 135.4(5).

136   I have already referred to the principles governing the imposition of sentences for money laundering. The maximum penalty of 25 years for an offence under s 11.5(1) and s 400.3(1) represents an emphatic statement by the legislature of the seriousness with which such offences must be treated. As stated, count 6 represents a very serious example of this offence.”

Principles applying to Crown appeals


	
	There is no issue as to the principles applicable to a Crown appeal on a sentence such as this.
	
	
	In brief, they are that the primary purpose of a Crown appeal is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts, not the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges (see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [36]). The “limiting purpose” of Crown appeals is thus to establish sentencing principles and achieve consistency in sentencing (see Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; (1977) 137 CLR 293 at [53]).
	
	
	An appeal as to manifest inadequacy requires consideration to be given to all of the matters that are relevant to fixing a sentence (see Hili at [60]).
	
	
	It is thus relevant to consider other sentencing decisions, but intervention on the ground of manifest inadequacy is not warranted unless, having regard to all of the relevant sentencing factors, including the degree to which the impugned sentence differs from sentences that have been imposed in comparable cases, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle (see R v Pham [2015] HCA 39; (2015) 90 ALJR 13 at [28]; Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; (2014) 253 CLR 58 at [61]).
	
	
	On appeal the Court cannot, however, discard the sentencing judge’s factual findings if they are not challenged. The Court may only interfere in a sentence where error, either latent or patent, is established (see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [61]; Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58]). On a Crown appeal, a House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 error in the exercise of discretion must be established.
	
	
	Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts (see Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282). The Court can, however, form a different view from the sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of an offence, where the only House v The King error found is that the sentence is “plainly unjust” (see Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; (2009) 254 CLR 259 at [24]).
	
	
	If the Court is satisfied that the discretion miscarried, resulting in a sentence which was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence, consistently with sentencing standards, it must still consider whether the Crown appeal should, nonetheless, be dismissed in the exercise of the residual discretion under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (Cth) not to interfere on sentencing (see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [24] [55] and CMB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 4; (2015) 317 ALR 308 at [54]). The onus is on the Crown to negate any reason why the residual discretion should be exercised (see CMB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 317 ALR 308 at [34], [66]).
	
	
	Absent specific error being found, the Court may intervene only if it concludes that the sentence falls outside the permissible range of sentences for the offender and the offence (see Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [35]).
	
	
	If the Court re-sentences, it must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, taking into account the purposes of sentencing and any other applicable Act or rule of law (see Kentwell at [42]).
	


Ground 1:   The sentence imposed in respect of the section 135.4(5) charge was manifestly inadequate.


	
	Section 135.4(5) provides:
	


“(5)    A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a)    the person conspires with another person to dishonestly cause a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss, to a third person; and

(b)    the first-mentioned person knows or believes that the loss will occur or that there is a substantial risk of the loss occurring; and

(c)    the third person is a Commonwealth entity.”


	
	Contrary to the appellant’s written submission, Beech-Jones J concluded at [98] in relation to this offence, that “[t]here are a number of features of the offence and the offender's conduct that warrant the conclusion that this case falls into the worst category of offences under s 135.4(5)” (see also at [135]). It was the second conspiracy, the subject of count 6, which was considered to have been a very serious example of such an offence (at [106]).
	
	
	Section 16A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act requires that on sentence, the nature and circumstances of the offence be taken into account.
	
	
	The appellant’s case was that while his Honour had found that between $368 and $402 million in false depreciation deductions had been claimed in tax returns lodged in the tax years between 2007 and 2010 and that total income from the four trusts was $750 million and $450 million in false deductions had been claimed to offset the declared income, with a risk of loss resulting of approximately $135 million, those findings had to be assessed against the intervening tax audit, which his Honour had failed to take into account.
	
	
	This offence was concerned, however, not only with losses, but also risks of losses.
	
	
	What his Honour found, to recap, was that NHA, which had been incorporated in 2006, entered into sham agreements to purchase medical technologies from Athena, another entity controlled by the appellant, purportedly for $410,000,000.
	
	
	The false depreciation claims were made to offset income flowing to NHA from structured finance arrangements negotiated with ANZ and its clients. The result was that some $68,405,000 was distributed to NHA by four trusts between October 2006 and December 2009. The conspiracy was continuing at the time of the appellant’s arrest, with the result that it could not be fully implemented.
	
	
	The loss his Honour found was a temporary delay in obtaining a tax debt of $104,152,053 (at [80]). The intended extent of the loss or risk of loss was found to be $135 million (at [76] and [99]). The appellant’s actual personal gain was found to be some $19,616,996.37 (at [95]).
	
	
	There was no error in these findings, notwithstanding the consequences of the tax audit and other matters advanced for the appellant.
	
	
	It is correct that in Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204; (2007) 70 NSWLR 89, where a money laundering offence was dealt with, that it was observed at [120]:
	


“120    With offences that are so wide ranging in their scope it becomes somewhat difficult to imagine an offence falling within the worst category of its kind against which any particular offence can be measured. It might be thought that dealing with money that is to be used for the purposes of terrorism might be within the class of the most serious offences encompassed by the sections in the Division. But it is perhaps not so difficult to conceive of offences that will form the bulk of conduct falling within the scope of the Division that would come before the criminal courts. The most obvious will relate to money obtained as a result of drug activity and that is being dealt with in order to make it more difficult to track or identify as the proceeds of a particular crime. It may also be money that has been legitimately earned but is to be dealt with in such a way as to disguise its source in order, for example, to defraud the taxation office.”


	
	It does not follow, however, that if the money the subject of a conspiracy such as that involved in this offence, is not proven to have been used for purposes such as terrorism, that the offence cannot be found to fall into the worst category of such offending.
	
	
	This conspiracy involved very sophisticated, complex offending.
	
	
	There was no error in his Honour’s unchallenged conclusion that this offence fell into the worst category of cases under s 135.4(5), given the nature of the appellant’s offending; its scale; the sophistication and planning involved; the way in which and time over which it was pursued and implemented; and the appellant’s role in this conspiracy, which depended on his detailed knowledge of the tax system.
	
	
	His Honour was bound to have regard to these matters in assessing the objective seriousness of this offence. The appellant accepted that it was open to his Honour to find that his role in the offence had been extensive; that he had been the predominant player and motivating force behind the conspiracy, even though Mr Issakidis was not subordinate to him; and that the amount of money involved had been a highly significant consideration on sentence. He submitted, however, that the absence of another illegal purpose for the money was also a relevant consideration. Of itself that does not compel a departure from the conclusion which his Honour reached.
	
	
	The appellant’s subjective circumstances were also correctly taken into account. They were not, however, such as could have warranted any significant reduction in his penalty. To the contrary, it was the appellant’s education, background and personal circumstances which enabled him to devise and pursue this serious offending as he did, offending which unarguably required that both general and specific deterrence feature in the sentence imposed upon him.
	
	
	In arriving at the appellant’s sentence, the maximum penalty fixed for the offence had to be taken into account, as a sentencing “yardstick” (see Elias v The Queen; Issa v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; (2013) 248 CLR 483 at [27]). The reasons for paying attention to the maximum penalty include that “they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time” (see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [31]). In some cases the inevitable outcome of such a comparison will be a conclusion, as his Honour here correctly came to, that the particular case falls into the worst category of such offending.
	
	
	In such a case, the result of the exercise of the sentencing discretion, by way of the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian v The Queen at [51], when all relevant considerations must be taken into account, may be that a sentence at, or close to, the maximum penalty must be imposed on the offender. The Crown contended that this was such a case.
	
	
	The appellant’s case was that the sentence of 7 years and 6 months, when the maximum penalty was 10 years, was an adequate sentence, in all of the relevant circumstances which his Honour considered. In the result, that sentence could not be found to have been unreasonable or plainly unjust, or outside the available range.
	
	
	There may, of course, be relevant considerations which will result in a sentence being imposed which is well below the maximum, even in a worst case. This may be the case where discounts are given for a plea or for assistance, for example, or where the offender’s particular subjective circumstances warrant mitigation of the sentence which would otherwise be imposed. Nothing of that kind arose for consideration in the appellant’s case.
	
	
	Schedules of comparative cases for both tax fraud and money laundering offences were addressed both on sentence and appeal. While there are limits to the assistance which such comparisons can provide, the Crown’s case that overall less serious offending than that which the appellant had committed has resulted in greater punishment must be accepted, albeit the comparative cases available are somewhat limited.
	
	
	His Honour referred to Dunn where the sentence imposed after trial was imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years, for an offence under s 135.4(3) of the Code, where the maximum penalty was also 10 years. That offender was the principal in devising and implementing a scheme to offset tax payable by claiming false tax deductions the purpose of which was to inflict a loss of $7.2 million, which was not achieved because the conspiracy was detected.
	
	
	His Honour concluded at [125] that the appellant compared unfavourably to the offender in Dunn, given that the intention of the conspiracy was to inflict a far higher amount of loss by a scheme that was far more sophisticated. The sentence imposed upon the appellant, however, was 7 years and 6 months.
	
	
	On appeal particular reference was made to El-Chaar v R [2007] NSWCCA 16, which involved premeditated tax fraud involving false claims for Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) refunds, which had been committed between 12 March 2003 and 20 February 2004. That fraud had involved the use of what was found to be a sophisticated modus operandi, with assistance from an officer of the ATO. The 13 offences involved dishonestly obtaining property by deception contrary to s 134.1(1) of the Code and one offence of attempting to obtain property by deception contrary to ss 11.1 and 134.1 of the Code. The total amount involved in the dishonestly obtaining property by deception offences was $1,000,688.33, whilst the amount involved in the attempt offence was $62,500. The maximum penalty for each offence was 10 years imprisonment and the total sentence imposed after entry of a plea was 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The appeal against the severity of this sentence was dismissed.
	
	
	In O'Meara v R [2009] NSWCCA 90, the appellant’s appeal from an overall sentence of 8 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months, imposed for one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception under s 134.2 of the Code and four counts of attempting to obtain a financial advantage by deception under ss 11.1 and 134.2, after conviction at a jury trial, was also dismissed. The maximum penalties in that case were also 10 years.
	
	
	Those offences also involved Goods and Services Tax fraud, resulting from false claims for refunds of GST in Business Activity Statements submitted to the ATO in the names of companies controlled by the appellant. Those statements contained false information concerning alleged purchases claimed to have been made that incurred GST. They falsely claimed that the companies had made (usually) capital purchases and that they were entitled to a refund of the GST component. The total amount of GST claimed to be the subject of a refund in all charges was $64,450,896. In respect of each purchase, with the exception of one count, it was the appellant who created false documentation showing that the purchases were made from another company, or from the himself, using a business name.
	
	
	That his Honour’s conclusions as to the nature and seriousness of the appellant’s offence was reflected in the sentence of 7 years and 6 months, even though that is, as the appellant submitted, a “significant sentence”, or in the aggregate sentence finally imposed, is thus difficult to accept. That is the more so, given the absence of subjective circumstances which might have warranted significant mitigation of the penalty imposed upon him.
	
	
	In the result it must be concluded that this ground was made out.
	


Ground 2:   The sentence imposed in respect of the sections 11.5(1) and 400.3(1) charge was manifestly inadequate.


	
	Count 6 involved a conspiracy to commit a s 400.3 (1) money laundering offence. It provides:
	


“(1)    A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a)    the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)    either:

(i)    the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or

(ii)    the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and

(c)    at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more.”


	
	In Ly it was observed at [86]:
	


“The federal money laundering offences in the Code have in recent years been considered in a number of cases. Whilst each case, of course, turns on its own facts, it is useful to set out relevant considerations before determining the ground of appeal in the present proceedings.

“1.    The statutory scheme has a graduated series of offences varying in gravity depending on the value of the money or property and the offender's state of mind: R v Li at [17]-[19], [41].

2.    The offences are broken down into the mental element of the offender: belief/intention or recklessness or negligence. The prescribed maximum penalty depends upon the culpability of the offender's mental state concerning the source of the money for offences involving proceeds of crime or what is to become of it, for offences involving an instrument of crime: R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370 at [28].

3.    The amount of money involved is a highly significant matter and is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence: R v Huang; R v Siu at [34]; R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89 at [122]; R v Li at [41].

4.    The number of transactions and the period over which they occurred are also significant matters as they indicate the extent of an offender's criminality. Generally speaking, a number of transactions involving small amounts of money will be more serious than a single transaction of a larger amount, for the latter may be seen as an isolated offence: R v Huang; R v Siu at [35].

5.    The offences are not only concerned with the source of the money or property dealt with, but also its ultimate use. The offences cover money obtained illegally or to be used for illegal purposes or dealt with in a manner that is illegal: Sentencing Bench Book, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, at [65-205].

6.    The serious criminal activity of money laundering warrants severe punishment not the least in order to reflect general deterrence of a very significant degree. When the activity is engaged in for profit over a significant period of time and with a large number of transactions, the prior good character of the offender is of less significance than might otherwise be the case: R v Huang; R v Siu at [36].

7.    Knowledge as to the illegality of the conduct is clearly a matter that increases the seriousness of the offence.”


	
	Given these considerations, it is apparent that this offence also involved very serious offending, as his Honour found. The sentence imposed was 9 years. The maximum penalty was 25 years.
	
	
	Before January 2007 the appellant and Mr Issakidis had agreed to deal with $63,715,000.00, knowing that these funds were the proceeds of crime, albeit not contemplated to be used for other illegal purposes. At [105] his Honour observed that none of the cases drawn to his attention had such a large amount. His Honour took into account the appellant’s control of the movement of these funds and that the money which finally came to him, the predominant conspirator, as the result of the steps pursued for his personal enrichment, was $19,616,996.37.
	
	
	His Honour thus rightly concluded that this was a very serious example of a s 400.3(1) conspiracy offence under s 11.5.
	
	
	His Honour also considered the circumstances of Chen v R [2009] NSWCCA 66 where, although $20 million of stolen funds were transferred to an account, the fraud was discovered and the funds were not released. Some $3.5 million was otherwise lost through the fraud. The offence under s 11.5(1) and s 400.3(2) of the Code there involved recklessness as to the fact that the money was the proceeds of crime. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 12 years. The applicant entered a plea and was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months, after a starting point of 8 years and a 25% discount. The sentence appeal was dismissed, it being observed:
	


“33    His role in the conspiracy involved making arrangements for access to over $20 million in stolen funds. The Judge found that the applicant was aware that the activity in which he was involved related to “a very large sum of money”. In R v Huang and Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259, this Court said:

[34] The amount of money involved is clearly a highly significant matter because the legislation uses it as the principal means of dividing the offences into categories and it is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence. The only difference between an offence falling within s 400.3(a), and carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years, and an offence falling within s 400.4(a), and carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years, is the amount of money or the value of the property with which the offender dealt.

34    There was no suggestion that the Judge erred in finding that the offence was above the middle range of seriousness, and I would have thought that it was well above. It has been made abundantly clear by the decisions to which I have referred that this type of activity is to be considered as serious criminal conduct whatever the role undertaken by persons involved in it. Where, as here, the offender is “at mid level in the organisational hierarchy of the conspiracy” to deal with these funds, the criminality warranted a very severe sentence having regard to the amount of money involved and what the applicant did in an attempt to make the funds available to the persons involved in its theft.”


	
	His Honour concluded at [126] that the appellant’s offending compared unfavourably to the offender in Chen v R [2009], given the higher maximum penalty which applied to his offending; the absence of a plea; the larger amount agreed to be laundered; the larger number transactions involved; the more sophisticated scheme; and that the offence had involved belief, rather than recklessness.
	
	
	Chen v R [2010] NSWCCA 224 was also referred to by his Honour at [124], but its circumstances were not considered. This case, the Crown submitted on appeal, was an appropriate “yardstick” for comparison in this sentencing exercise, particularly given the magnitude of the appellant’s profit from his offending.
	
	
	There an appeal against sentence was dismissed, the offender having been found guilty of an offence under s 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) and s 400.3(1) of the Code, committed between about 14 January and 4 November 2003, when the offender dealt with $3,088,311, intending that the money become an instrument of crime. The maximum penalty was 25 years and/or a fine of 1500 penalty units. The offender was sentenced to 16 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months.
	
	
	A difference to the appellant’s offending was that in Chen v R [2010], the money was intended to become the instrument of a crime, rather than already being proceeds of crime, and so the sentencing judge could not say what benefit had flowed to the offender, for his involvement. Here, of course, the huge personal gain which the appellant achieved was established.
	
	
	The sentence imposed for the appellant’s offence was, however, 9 years. That was 7 years and 6 months less than that imposed in Chen v R [2010], where the maximum penalty was also 25 years, but three years more than the head sentence imposed in Chen v R [2009], where the maximum penalty was only 12 years.
	
	
	When these comparisons are considered together with the aggregate sentence imposed on the appellant of 11 years for his offending as reflecting the totality of conduct, it must be accepted that this ground of appeal has also been established.
	


Ground 3:   The overall effective sentence was manifestly inadequate by reason of insufficient accumulation.


	
	The appellant’s case on sentence was that the evidence revealed a unique combination of features which called for a sentence below the norm to be imposed upon him.
	
	
	While his Honour did not accept this submission and concluded at [132] that a significant degree of accumulation in the two sentences was warranted, he came to the view that the sentences had to be made largely concurrent, lest they otherwise have a crushing effect on the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant’s case on appeal, that this approach was open as a matter of discretion, may not be accepted. The result of such an approach here to accumulation, concurrency, and totality was an overall sentence which was manifestly inadequate, given the criminality found to have been involved in the appellant’s offending.
	
	
	The sentence did not achieve the stated purpose of ensuring that the combined effect of the sentences reflected the total criminality of the appellant’s conduct (at [132]).
	
	
	Care unarguably had to be taken in the application of the totality principle, to ensure that a crushing sentence was not imposed on the appellant, that is, one which would induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release (see R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [97]). That undoubtedly required the imposition of some concurrency (see Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]).
	
	
	Application of the totality principle also had to result, however, in a sentence reflective of the overall criminality involved in the appellant’s entire offending, one which ensured that there was no suggestion that there had been a discount for multiple offending (see R v MAK at [18]).
	
	
	The appellant contended, nevertheless, that his Honour’s conclusions involved no error, given the approach discussed in authorities such as Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; (2009) 198 A Crim R 135 ; Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; (2010) 77 NSWLR 463; Schembri v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 149; (2010) 78 ATR 159; Redfern v R [2012] NSWCCA 178; Subramanian v R [2013] NSWCCA 159 and Dela Cruz v R [2010] NSWCCA 333. These, however, are considerably different cases to this one.
	
	
	In Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 159 it was observed that the money laundering offences there in question (at [34] – [36]):
	


“34   … came within the type of ""highly technical"" category of this offence that was identified by Howie J (Campbell JA and Rothman J agreeing) in Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294 at [31]. As in Thorn, the applicant was doing no more than ""merely transferring the money obtained by the fraudulent claims from the company accounts to [her] personal account ...... so that [she] could use it to [purchase property]. [She] was doing nothing to hide the source or to change the nature of the funds. [She] was simply gaining access to them.""

35    The criminality represented by the money laundering offences was of a low order for this reason and there ought to have been very little, if any, accumulation on the sentences imposed for the obtain benefit by deception offences in groups (ii) and (v). It is not possible to say whether that occurred or whether the sentence for the offences in (vi) added materially to the sentence for group (ii) and/or (v).

36    It is appropriate in my view to approach re-sentencing on the basis that the obtain financial benefit offences involving the transfer of funds of a similar order ought be grouped together. The greater the amount comprehended by each group of offences, the greater the penalty, both with respect to each offence within the group and with respect to the aggregate sentence for the combination of offences. The penalties for the money laundering offences ought be wholly concurrent with the sentences for the s 178BA offences. This does not signify that there is no additional criminality inherent in the money laundering offences (albeit at the low end of the scale), but it recognises that partial accumulation of the sentences imposed for each of the proposed groups is sufficient for the purposes of totality.”


	
	Subramaniam involved a string of offences involving the fraudulent transfer of money used to purchase properties, which were the subject of the money laundering offences.
	
	
	In Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294, sentences imposed for one count of dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Code, 11 counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage contrary to s 134.2(1) of the Code and one count of attempting to obtain a financial advantage arose to be dealt with. There it was observed that (at [30] – [31]):
	


“30    In sentencing for the money laundering offence the Judge referred to a number of decisions of this Court including Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89 and R v Huang and Sui [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370. But those cases involved money laundering of a completely different character to that involved in the offence before his Honour. Ansari concerned persons who were intimately involved in dealing with money that was the result of some other person’s criminal activity so as to hide its source. That is money laundering in the true sense of that term and clearly the type of activity that the legislature had in mind in creating the offence. Similarly Huang and Sui were involved in money laundering as it is generally understood but at a lower level of criminality than in Ansari. They were involved in taking sums of money at the behest of another and depositing it in various accounts under false names to hide the source of the funds.

31    But here the applicant was merely transferring the money obtained by the fraudulent claims from the company accounts to his personal account or drawing it from an ATM so that he could use it to gamble. He was doing nothing to hide the source or to change the nature of the funds. He was simply gaining access to them. The activity came within the scope of the offence under s 400.4, because the offence is so widely drawn. But it was a highly technical version of the offence.”


	
	The appellant argued that in the result in his case, “it is appropriate to impose a sentence substantially cumulative upon the predicate offence of fraud when the very money laundered involved concerns the gaining of access to the funds the product of the fraud.”
	
	
	Each case must turn on its own facts. While, as his Honour found, there was an overlap between the elements of counts 1 and 6, the result of the successful conspiracy that was the subject of count 1, which the appellant and Mr Issakidis first pursued in relation to the funds involved of over $63 million, was that they were put in the position where they were able to pursue the other sophisticated steps the appellant largely devised, in order that they could implement the second conspiracy, which was the subject of count 6. Thereby the appellant was able to achieve the result that he and those associated with him came into possession of over $19 million.
	
	
	Offending of such a significant nature cannot justly be sentenced on the basis that the second offence involved “merely gaining access” to the funds obtained as the result of the first offence, or a conclusion that the penalty for that further offending, which attracted a maximum penalty of 25 years, could be substantially subsumed in the penalty imposed for the first conspiracy, which carried a maximum penalty of only 10 years.
	
	
	The Crown has met the onus falling upon it to demonstrate that the overall sentence imposed resulted from the errors earlier discussed and that, in the circumstances which arose for consideration in this sentencing exercise, the overall sentence imposed was unreasonable and plainly unjust.
	
	
	In the result this ground of appeal must also be upheld. As discussed in Hili at [58] - [62] appellate intervention is warranted, because misapplication of principle has been established.
	


Residual discretion


	
	The Crown has also established that the Court’s residual discretion not to interfere in the sentence should not be exercised.
	
	
	The overall sentence imposed on the appellant reflects error in principle. Given the serious offences for which the appellant was being sentenced, the nature of the errors identified, and their result, it is necessary for this Court to intervene to correct the sentence in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind.
	
	
	The appellant must thus be sentenced afresh in order that “principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons” may be given (see Griffiths v The Queen at [54]).
	


 Re-sentence


	
	As his Honour observed, sentences imposed in cases of serious revenue fraud such as this must reflect the need for denunciation, as well as general and personal deterrence (see Milne v R [2012] NSWCCA 24 at [297]). There reference was made to Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Gregory [2011] VSCA 145; (2011) A Crim R 147 where the Victorian Court of Appeal explained at [57]:
	


""A sentence imposed for fraud upon the taxation revenue is intended to re-affirm basic community values that all citizens according to their means should fairly share the burden of the incidence of taxation so as to enable government to provide for the community, that the revenue must accordingly be protected and that the offender should be censured through manifest denunciation. When these considerations are not reflected in the responses of the courts, the criminal justice system fails to achieve its objectives.""


	
	The appellant’s criticism of his Honour’s approach to fact finding on sentencing cannot be accepted. A sentencing judge may form his or her own view of the facts, so long as it does not conflict with the jury’s verdict (see Savvas v The Queen [1995] HCA 29; (1995) 183 CLR 1 at 8). While facts found must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt, there is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender (see Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14]).
	
	
	As earlier discussed, no error in his Honour’s fact finding has been established.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that on re-sentence account would be taken of the fact that any fraud after the 2010 tax year depended on NHA exiting the tax audit notified in 2010 without the depreciation claims being assessed as being based on shams. That did not happen given what the Commissioner came to know. However, this consideration would have been obvious to his Honour and, no error has been shown in his Honour’s finding as to the extent of the loss.
	
	
	The appropriate sentence for the s 135.4(5) offence is one of 9 years, and for the offences under s 11.5(1) and s 400.3 of the Code, 12 years. The overall sentence which is of a severity appropriate for the appellant’s offences and provides a minimum period that he must spend in custody appropriate to all the relevant elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of his offences and his subjective circumstances is 14 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 9 years and 3 months.
	
	
	This means that the appellant’s sentence will commence on 22 December 2014 and will expire on 21 December 2028. The non-parole period will expire on 13 March 2024, the appellant’s earliest date of release on parole. If released on parole the appellant will then spend the balance of the sentence in the community, subject to conditions then imposed upon him by the relevant parole authority, which may later be amended or revoked. If the appellant fails, without reasonable excuse to comply with such conditions, his parole may be revoked, in which event he will be returned to custody to serve the balance of his sentence.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons given, we propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal in relation to grounds 1 and 2 of the conviction appeal is refused.
	
	
	The conviction appeal is otherwise dismissed.
	
	
	The sentence appeal is upheld and the sentences imposed by Beech-Jones J are set aside.
	
	
	The appellant is re-sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For count 1, being an offence contrary to s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code, the appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years, commencing on 22 December 2014 and expiring on 21 December 2023.
	
	
	For count 6, being an offence contrary to s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code, the appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years, to date from 22 December 2016 and expiring on 21 December 2028.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 the Court fixes a single non-parole period of 9 years and 3 months, expiring on 21 March 2024.

2769665,Pleasance v R [2016] NSWCCA 113,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Wilson J. I agree with her Honour's reasons and proposed order.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Wilson J. 
	
	
	WILSON J: On 24 October 2014 sentence was imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The drug supplied was heroin, in an amount of 28.80 grams. The maximum penalty specified for such an offence is a term of imprisonment for 15 years, or a fine of 2,000 penalty units, or both. When sentence was imposed for that offence the Court took into account, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) two further offences, being one count of participating in a criminal group contrary to s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and one count of concealing a serious indictable offence pursuant to s 316 of the same Act.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, to date from 21 October 2013 and expiring on 20 July 2017, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. The non-parole period expires on 20 July 2016. The sentence reflects a discount of 25% on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, to recognise the early plea of guilty.
	
	
	Having filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal (out of time) on 9 March 2016, the applicant seeks an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon her. She seeks to advance four grounds of appeal:
	



	
	The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending behaviour;
	
	
	The conduct of the sentencing judge prevented him from properly assessing the applicant’s credibility, and the applicant from properly presenting her case;
	
	
	The sentencing judge ought to have admitted the letter from the applicant’s mother; and
	
	
	The sentence was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.
	


The Proceedings before the District Court


	
	The applicant was charged on 25 July 2012 with the offences for which she ultimately faced sentence. She entered a plea of guilty to the charge of supply prohibited drug 20 months later on 26 March 2014 and was committed for sentence to the District Court. She subsequently adhered to her plea and the matter came on for sentence before his Honour Judge Colefax SC DCJ sitting at the Parramatta District Court.
	


The Facts of the Offences


	
	The Crown tendered and relied upon a “Statement of Agreed Facts”, which was not disputed by the applicant. The following account of the applicant’s crimes is drawn from that evidence, which was accepted by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	In March 2012 a police investigation into the supply of prohibited drugs in north western Sydney commenced. A number of individuals were identified as the principal members of a group responsible for the supply of drugs in the area. The applicant was one of those individuals.
	
	
	The group operated from a “granny flat” at the rear of residential premises in South Wentworthville, and had a large client base. The applicant frequently stayed at the flat, and both took orders from customers for prohibited drugs, and delivered orders to customers.
	
	
	One such customer was an inmate of the Emu Plains Women’s Correctional Facility who, on 15 June 2012, placed an order with a member of the applicant’s group for prohibited drugs to be delivered to her. The customer contacted the group via a particular telephone service used by its members, and her order was filled by members of the group passing drugs to her through the perimeter fence of the correctional facility late that night. Although not personally involved in this transaction, the applicant was aware of it. This was the offence the applicant concealed, reflected by one of the charges before the sentencing court on a Form 1 document.
	
	
	After this transaction, police obtained a warrant permitting them to intercept communication to and from the telephone service used by the applicant and her co-offenders when supplying prohibited drugs. Between 16 June 2012 and 25 July 2012, almost six thousand calls made to and from that service were monitored, as members of the group negotiated and finalised arrangements to supply heroin to their numerous customers.
	
	
	Members of the group and their customers used coded conversation, referring to the price of heroin and amounts of money as “paper”, “a thirty/fifty/seventy/hundred”, a “hunge”, and “four-eight”. Weights of the drug to be supplied were referred to as “a G”, a “small one”, a “big one”, a “quart”, a “half”, “one”, a “half ball”, a “ball”, and an “ounce”. Terms for the drug included “China white”, “hectic white one”, and “pearl”.
	
	
	Prices fixed by the group ranged from $30 for 0.10 grams of heroin, to $1,200 for 3.70 grams of heroin.
	
	
	Investigators frequently followed group members, including the applicant, to locations where a meeting with a purchaser had been arranged, and watched as an exchange occurred. On those occasions when the purchaser was subsequently stopped and searched, the individual was found to be in possession of heroin.
	
	
	The applicant’s participation in this criminal group was reflected by the second charge on the Form 1 document, taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	During the period when police intercepted the group’s telephone service the applicant was involved personally in some 75 individual transactions for the supply of heroin, involving her in discussions where she agreed or arranged to supply heroin, or negotiated price and other matters. The quantity of heroin she personally supplied was estimated to be not less than 28.80 grams.
	
	
	On 24 July 2012 a search warrant was executed on the premises used by the offenders in South Wentworthville. The grounds were secured with a padlocked gate, chains and barbed wire, and the windows of the flat were covered with steel sheeting, and heavy bolts were fixed to the doors. The applicant and a number of her co-offenders were present when the warrant was executed.
	
	
	On searching the premises police found a number of items associated with the supply of drugs, including a number of mobile telephones, two sets of digital scales, a quantity of small resealable plastic bags, and a bag containing a cutting agent.
	
	
	After her arrest, the applicant was interviewed by investigating police. Whilst she made some admissions, notably to concealing a serious offence, she claimed that she had not willingly participated in the supply of drugs from the South Wentworthville premises.
	


Other Evidence in the Crown Case


	
	The Crown tendered a statement of the applicant’s criminal antecedents, which showed that she had been before the criminal courts since the age of 17. The applicant had entries against her before the Children’s Court for driving and dishonesty offences, including robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, that is, a firearm. Before the Local and District Courts the applicant had been convicted of further driving, drug, and dishonesty offences, and she had frequently served custodial sentences. She had been referred to the Drug Court in 2012, and was subject to sentences of imprisonment for serious dishonesty and other offences which were suspended pursuant to s 7(3) of the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW), at the time of the commission of the current offences.
	
	
	A Corrective Services custodial history showed that, since her admission to custody following her arrest for these matters, the applicant has incurred a number of institutional punishments for offences including possessing a drug implement and failing urine tests.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report set out some information as to the applicant’s background and circumstances, gleaned from the applicant herself, the Police Facts and Criminal History, and Corrective Services and Justice Health records and personnel.
	
	
	The report noted that the applicant had been subject to a number of parole orders since 2004, but had breached every order to which she had been subject (AB 86).
	
	
	The applicant told the author of the pre-sentence report that she had been removed from her mother at age four, due to her mother’s abusive behaviour and drug use, and placed with an adoptive family (AB 87). With her adoptive family the applicant experienced a stable and supportive upbringing until she was about 13 or 14 (AB 87). At that time the applicant’s adoptive parents separated, and the applicant was the victim of a violent sexual assault. She began using drugs (AB 87).
	
	
	Despite her difficult circumstances the applicant continued her schooling until Year 11, achieving excellent results, and having been an active sportsperson (AB 87). After leaving school, she completed a number of courses through TAFE but has been largely unemployed because of her drug use (AB 87). The applicant was again sexually assaulted at the age of 19.
	
	
	The applicant told the author of the pre-sentence report that drug use had been a problem for her since she was 13 years old. Whilst she acknowledged a need for assistance to help her address her long-standing addiction, the applicant said she was not interested in undertaking residential rehabilitation at that time (AB 88). The applicant was receiving psychological counselling in custody, directed to both her drug use and her history of self-harm, and she was on a methadone program in custody (AB 88).
	
	
	As to the circumstances of her involvement in the crimes before the sentencing court, the applicant said she was unable to support her substantial daily heroin habit without dealing in drugs (AB 88). She also sought to justify her involvement in supplying drugs by reference to her asserted vulnerability after a relationship break-up, and her involvement with one of her co-offenders, Mark Younis, a man she described as violent and abusive and whom she feared would “hunt her down” if she left him (AB 88).
	
	
	The pre-sentence report concluded pessimistically:
	


“Community Corrections' records have detailed that the offender has been given numerous opportunities in the past to address her ongoing issues however she has continually failed to do so and as a result of non-compliance and re-offending has routinely been returned to custody. Despite acknowledging the seriousness of her drug use, her motivation to abstain entirely from such is questionable given her urinalysis results since being admitted into custody and also her statement that she is not willing to engage in residential rehabilitation at this stage.

In relation to her offending behaviour, she has openly described her actions as ""wrong"" however somewhat justified her behaviour citing her drug use as her main motivating factor in addition to apparent fear of the co-offender involved."" (AB 89)


	
	A report from the State Parole Authority dated 2 August 2013 set out the circumstances of breaches of parole by the applicant relating to parole consequent upon sentences passed by the Drug Court, and the subsequent revocation of parole, to date from 15 July 2013 (AB 90-91). The report noted that the applicant had, during the period of parole, failed to accept the supervision of the Parole Service, failed to reside at an approved address, and failed to be of good behaviour (AB 92). That report also concluded with a pessimistic assessment:
	


“Ms Pleasance has demonstrated that she has negligible regard or capacity to comply with her major conditions of reporting and approved residence.” (AB 93)


	
	An Alcohol and Drug Report from Corrective Services was also before the sentencing court. It referred to the applicant’s long standing drug addiction, and her previous failure to engage with supervision and support directed to rehabilitation (AB 100-101). Whilst acknowledging the applicant’s expressed desire for assistance with drug rehabilitation, the report concluded that the applicant is “somewhat side-stepping” the benefits of a long-term residential rehabilitation programme (AB 101).
	


The Subjective Case


	
	Tendered on behalf of the applicant to the sentencing court on 21 August 2014 were a report from a forensic psychologist, Mr Borkowski, and a letter from the applicant’s adoptive mother, Ms Amichi.
	
	
	The applicant, who was aged 31 at the time of sentencing, was called to give evidence before the court during proceedings on 21 August 2014.
	
	
	She told the sentencing judge that, during the period of her involvement in the supply of heroin, she was living with one of her co-offenders, Mark Younis, in a granny flat at the rear of his parent’s South Wentworthville home, from which heroin was sold (AB 138). She said that she originally encountered Mark Younis when she went to his flat “to score” (AB 139:18), and stayed on, helping him supply to others in exchange for heroin, and entering a sexual relationship with him (AB 140:1-2).
	
	
	The applicant deposed that, when she arrived at the flat in February 2012 she had with her only her handbag containing her phone, wallet, make-up, medication and keys. At some stage she said that her phone “mysteriously disappeared” (AB 141:19). Other than a short period when she went into custody, the applicant asserted that she remained at the flat eating only take-away food provided by her co-offender, without any change of clothing, and with access only to a bucket and cold water hose for washing.
	
	
	She said that she was “mostly kept in the granny flat at the back” and “wasn’t allowed out” (AB 141:31). Her evidence continued:
	


""Q. But you could've left if you wanted to?

A. Well I find that very hard when the gates are bolted with - I don't have a keys and I can't go through the front house.

Q. But there were several occasions when you were out and about doing deals?

A. Mm-hm.

Q. And you could've gone to the police?

A. I'm a heroin addict."" (AB 141:34 -43)


	
	The applicant described her role in the supply of heroin from the flat as supportive of that of Younis. She said she or her co-offenders would take telephone calls from persons seeking drugs, agree an amount and weight, and then her co-offender would weigh and package the purchase (AB 142). The applicant said she would sometimes meet the purchaser and deliver the drug, accepting cash in exchange, which she took to her co-offender (AB 142-144).
	
	
	The applicant described her time in South Wentworthville with her co-offender as “hellish” (AB 145:3), and her relationship with him as “a real demented one” (AB 145: 6). She said she slept with him in exchange for drugs, as she had no other way of obtaining heroin (AB 145:16). She estimated her habit as consuming heroin to the value of $1500 per day at one point (AB 145:30).
	
	
	She went on to describe some distressing times in her life, including when an adoptive half step-sister was murdered (AB 147).
	
	
	In custody, the applicant had undertaken a number of courses, including pottery and events management (AB 147:44-45). She had also initiated a program to assist other women endeavouring to withdraw from drugs following admission to custody (AB 148-149).
	
	
	As to the offences, the offender said that she felt disgusted by herself for destroying her own life, and for destroying the lives of others by her involvement in the dissemination of heroin (AB 146:38-39) . She said that she had reached a point in her life where:
	


“I’m finally asking for help, which I’ve knocked back all these years.” (AB 146:46)


	
	In cross-examination, the applicant sought to diminish the activities of the group with whom she was supplying heroin, and her own role within the group.
	
	
	She refused to accept the characterisation of the group of individuals involved in the supply of drugs as a gang or syndicate, insisting that each was simply a heroin addict doing what was necessary to support an addiction (AB 152-153). She described her own role as restricted to that of a “girlfriend”, just answering phones, and claimed never to have left the granny flat alone (although later referring to a trip alone to visit her mother) (AB 154-159). In contrast to what she had said to police in interview, the applicant suggested that she had only limited knowledge of the supply to an inmate at Emu Plains (AB 160 – 161).
	
	
	The sentencing judge queried the applicant’s request to have an offence of concealing a serious crime taken into account, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, because of her evidence on that aspect of the matter (AB 162), and also queried her evidence as to her ability to leave the granny flat (AB 162 -163), given her inconsistency on that point.
	
	
	Towards the end of the applicant's evidence the sentencing judge asked the applicant:
	


""Q. Was it your intention to give me the impression that you were being held in those premises more or less, against your will, was that your intention to convey that impression?

A. No, not at all. I was telling the -"" (AB 169: 26-29)


	
	The matter was adjourned part heard at the end of the day, with his Honour warning the applicant (through her legal representative),
	


""HIS HONOUR: I want to read the transcript of her evidence in chief Mr Rajalingham, very, very carefully. Because the impression I am currently working under and I say it to you openly, so that in due course, you will have time to address. That I have the very strong impression that I was not through you, but through your client, I was sought to be misled about the nature of her domestic arrangement not least because not one word of it was said to any of the authors either the authors of the presentence report, or the psychologist report, it is inherently improbable, and at the moment my current thinking and this if for you to think about, is that that was a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court and I am going to - if I adhere to that view it will be reflected in the sentence."" (AB 170:1-11)


	
	When the matter again came before his Honour, on 24 October 2014, the applicant was called to give further evidence in re-examination and, by leave, in chief. She resiled from her previous evidence about being unable to leave the granny flat, stating that her evidence about the gate being kept bolted and locked was not “completely accurate” (AB 173:30-21). She asserted that, in fact, the gate was left unlocked “a few times a day” (AB 173:37) and, when she chose to leave, she was able to simply walk out (AB 174:33). She acknowledged that when she returned to the South Wentworthville flat on the same day as she left it, it was because she wished to maintain her access to heroin (AB 175:42ff).
	
	
	As to her evidence of 21 August 2014 the applicant said,
	


“Your Honour, I’m very sorry. I didn’t wish to give the Court or you that impression [that she was being held against her will at South Wentworthville] and I’m sorry about that.” (AB 176:25-26)


	
	Correspondence from the agency which had arranged the applicant’s adoption as a child, Barnados Australia was tendered. The author of the document, Ms Moggach, had been the caseworker for Barnados at the time of the applicant’s adoption at age four, and had facilitated the adoption, remaining in contact with the applicant and her adoptive family thereafter (AB 120).
	
	
	Ms Moggach stated that the applicant first came to the attention of the Department of Family and Community Service when she was about two months old, having been admitted to hospital for a number of serious non-accidental fractures (AB 120). She was made a ward of the State, and was subsequently placed in a number of foster homes, or briefly with her natural mother, until she was placed with her adoptive parents in October 1988 (AB 120-121).
	
	
	She experienced a stable home environment with her adoptive parents, until they separated when she was about 13 or 14 (AB 121). The applicant remained living with her adoptive father, and later with him and his new wife and step-daughter, although that relationship was somewhat fraught (AB 121). Her adoptive mother continued to be supportive of her (AB 121).
	
	
	Contact over the years with her natural parents was problematic, with neither her natural mother nor father able to maintain regular positive contact (AB 121).
	
	
	Ms Moggach regarded the applicant as a woman with great potential whose life had been derailed by early abuse, and later drug use (AB 122).
	
	
	Jewish House had been asked by the applicant’s adoptive mother to assist the applicant prior to her release from her last period of imprisonment, and had accepted her in their crisis accommodation facility (AB 125). Whilst she was regarded as “on the right track” (AB 125) during her residence at the centre, the applicant had left after only a few weeks and staff of the centre had no further contact with her. Correspondence to this effect from Jewish House was tendered to the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The applicant additionally sought to tender a further letter from her adoptive mother, but the tender was objected to by the Crown and rejected by the sentencing judge. The refusal of the sentencing judge to admit the letter is raised by the applicant as the proposed ground 3.
	


The Proposed Appeal

Ground One: The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending behaviour.


	
	In a judgment delivered ex tempore on 24 October 2014 the sentencing judge set out the agreed facts of the applicant’s crimes, and concluded that,
	


“In terms of its objective seriousness this offence falls below the mid-range of objective seriousness, but is certainly not at the bottom of the range as was submitted by the offender’s counsel. It is closer to the mid-range than the bottom of the range.” (AB 14)


	
	The applicant takes issue with this assessment, contending that she was no more than a “runner” within the group of individuals involved in the supply of prohibited drugs from the South Wentworthville property, and that the seriousness of her offending behaviour should have been assessed as significantly lower than it was.
	
	
	This ground is advanced notwithstanding the frequent dicta of this Court that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence falls squarely within the role of the sentencing judge, who exercises a broad discretion in that regard: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]-[47]; Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35, at [33].
	
	
	Specific complaint is made by the applicant about the following sentence in the judgment, which the applicant contends is not supported by evidence:
	


“She was not a runner, she was not a street supplier – she was a significant participant in the syndicate.’ (AB 14)


	
	The applicant submits that, as she received no monetary reward for her involvement, and played no role in setting prices or determining to whom sales would be made, it was “wrong” to describe her as anything more than a “runner”.
	
	
	It is firstly noted that the agreed facts upon which his Honour in part based his assessment of the gravity of the applicant’s crime stated that, between 16 June 2012 and 25 July 2015 the applicant:
	


“…entered into agreements to supply, made offers to supply and carried out negotiations for the supply of heroin on 75 occasions.” (AB 34)


	
	The applicant took no issue at first instance with this statement, and did not seek to do so at the hearing of the application before this Court. In light of that evidence, it is difficult to see how the applicant can complain that his Honour was in error in concluding that her role was more than that of a mere runner. A “runner” within the context of a drug supply operation is someone who does no more than deliver prohibited drugs to a purchaser on behalf of the supplier, and return the payment received to that individual.
	
	
	The applicant did much more than that, as she accepted before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Although it is true that there was no evidence of the applicant receiving a monetary reward for her role in the syndicate, the applicant’s submission draws a somewhat artificial distinction between cash payments and the substantial payments that the applicant received in kind, being large quantities of heroin. During her residence at the South Wentworthville property the applicant was using heroin valued at between some hundreds of dollars each day, to heroin valued at well over $1,000 per day.
	
	
	There is a difference between a person supplying for cash profit and one who supplies for drugs to feed a habit, the former involving criminality of a higher order than the latter, but the distinction does not, in the circumstances of this case, negate the conclusion of the sentencing judge that the applicant was more than a mere “runner”. The amounts of heroin received by the applicant in payment for her role in the group’s criminal activity went beyond what might be expected by way of payment for an individual doing no more than delivering a package of drugs.
	
	
	The applicant was intimately connected with the group’s criminal activities. She was a resident at its base of operations and actively involved in many of the aspects of those operations, from taking “orders” from customers to making the actual sales and deliveries. That she did not decide who to sell to or fix the prices to be charged does not dictate a conclusion that she was nothing more than a “runner”.
	
	
	Others, including Mark Younis, clearly had a greater role in the activities of the syndicate. That heightens the gravity of the crimes committed by those individuals. However, it does not lessen the gravity of the applicant’s crime. It was well open to conclude, as the sentencing judge did, that the applicant was more than a mere “runner”.
	
	
	This ground cannot be made good and, particularly having regard to the applicant’s acceptance before the sentencing judge of the agreed facts, which set out a role much more involved than that of a “runner”, I would not grant leave to advance it.
	


Ground Two: The conduct of the sentencing judge prevented him from properly assessing the applicant’s credibility, and the applicant from properly presenting her case.


	
	By this ground, the applicant complains that the sentencing judge unduly interfered in the sentencing proceedings, to such an extent that the applicant could not fully put her case.
	
	
	Reliance is placed upon the decision of Ellis v R [2015] NSWCCA 262, a decision that post-dates the applicant’s sentence hearing, and which differs significantly from the present case, to submit that his Honour descended into the arena of adversarial proceedings, thus occasioning a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	At the heart of the complaint is the conclusion of the sentencing judge, raised by him as a consideration for the parties during sentence proceedings, and referred to in the remarks on sentence, that the applicant’s evidence during the proceedings was unreliable. In her written submissions, the applicant has extracted a portion of his Honour’s remarks, categorising it as “a mistaken conclusion”. The impugned passage is as follows:
	


“Before turning to that evidence [of the applicant on sentence], I should observe that in the offender’s lengthy criminal history there are a number of offences of dishonesty. Having regard to those histories of dishonesty, and to my assessment of the offender in the witness box, I approach with caution any exculpatory evidence that she advances.” (AB 13)


	
	It is clear that his Honour formed an adverse view as to the reliability of the applicant’s evidence on sentence, and that, having formed an adverse view, he treated her evidence with a degree of circumspection. The applicant contends that his Honour was not entitled to draw the conclusion he did.
	
	
	There is no dispute that the applicant has a number of entries in her criminal antecedents for offences of dishonesty and his Honour’s comment in that regard is no more than a simple statement of fact, well open to him. It is a lengthy criminal history, which commenced when the applicant was 17 years of age, there are about 20 entries for offences involving dishonesty (excluding entries for take and drive motor vehicle which can be charged, and treated, as larcenies).
	
	
	The view that the sentencing judge formed as to the veracity of the complainant’s evidence, whilst more impressionistic than a recitation of criminal antecedents, was similarly in my view, well open to his Honour.
	
	
	The sentencing judge had the considerable advantage of seeing the applicant as she gave her evidence, an advantage that would have informed his assessment of her testimony. This Court can do no more than consider a transcript of that evidence. Even on the basis of the transcript, however, the origins of the concern expressed by the sentencing judge is plain.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence was internally inconsistent, and contradicted evidence with which she had taken no issue, such as the contents of an interview she had with police. Her evidence additionally appeared in some respects to be wholly implausible.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence as to the conditions in which she lived when at the granny flat, and particularly her claims in her evidence in chief to being kept locked in the flat and prevented from leaving it, had an air of unreality, and were squarely contradicted by both the agreed facts and other parts of the applicant’s evidence. The applicant herself conceded in evidence that what she had said about her circumstances at the flat was not accurate.
	
	
	In oral argument before this Court on 13 May 2016 counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge had, mistakenly, formed the view that the applicant was suggesting that:
	


“…she had been somehow, at least to a significant extent, held captive at the premises from where the drug dealing, in essence, took place…” (T1:46)


	
	The nature of the “mistake” asserted to have been made by his Honour was said to rest on the fact that the evidence was not led by the applicant’s counsel on sentence (not the counsel who appeared in this Court) to suggest quasi-duress, but rather to expose the nature of the relationship that the applicant found herself in with Mark Younis.
	
	
	That may well have been the intention of counsel at first instance, but that intention could hardly bind his Honour, even if it was clear that that was, in fact, the purpose for which the evidence was led.
	
	
	As the tribunal of fact it was open to his Honour to consider the whole of the evidence adduced by the parties, to make an assessment of the reliability of evidence which was in dispute between them (such as the applicant’s claims about being unable to leave the flat), and to determine the facts upon which sentence was to be imposed.
	
	
	The applicant gave oral evidence which was inconsistent with the agreed facts, inconsistent with other aspects of her own evidence, and inconsistent to a degree with common sense. The sentencing judge was entitled to ask questions in an attempt to resolve those inconsistencies.
	
	
	I do not regard his Honour’s intervention in this regard as reaching the level decried in Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 at 20, and as described in Ellis v R at [57] – [65].
	
	
	It is not the law that a sentencing judge is not entitled to ask questions of an offender who gives evidence, or question some aspect of the case presented by an offender. Such questioning will only become unreasonable where there is unfairness to the offender. Determining whether that point has been reached requires an evaluation of the whole of the circumstances of the case, and the nature and extent of any questioning.
	
	
	Although the applicant complains that his Honour raised with the parties the issue of the applicant’s evidence and what he was to take from it, relying upon this aspect of the matter as an indication of the extent to which the sentencing judge had descended into the arena, his Honour was, in fact, obliged to raise it.
	
	
	In giving her evidence as she did, the applicant appeared to traverse aspects of the agreed facts. Since the sentencing judge was obliged to find the facts of the crime, it was appropriate to raise with the parties the perceived inconsistencies between the applicant’s evidence and other evidentiary material, including agreed facts: R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335 at [37]; Zammit v R [2010] NSWCCA 29 at [26] – [27].
	
	
	Importantly, in the present case the sentencing judge sought clarification of matters over which the applicant’s evidence had drawn a cloud of uncertainty and, having done so, squarely raised his concerns for the consideration of the parties. His Honour invited further evidence and, ultimately, submissions on the point.
	
	
	There can be no unfairness where the applicant was given every opportunity to clarify her evidence (in chief, cross-examination, re-examination, and further evidence in chief with leave), and invited to address the sentencing court about her evidence and what should be drawn from it.
	
	
	This matter is readily distinguished from that pertaining in Ellis v R, where the applicant was not able to complete his evidence, and compelled to withdraw the evidence that he had given before the sentencing judge intervened.
	
	
	The questions asked by the sentencing judge of the applicant about her assertions as to the circumstances surrounding the commission of one of the offences taken into account, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, were also clearly intended to clarify what appeared to be evidence that undermined her earlier acknowledgement of her guilt of that offence. Such questioning was also open to his Honour.
	
	
	The applicant contends that, because the sentencing judge formed an adverse impression of the applicant’s credibility, he assessed her “objective involvement” as greater than that outlined in the agreed facts, or in the applicant’s evidence, and unfairness has resulted. That submission should be rejected, since it suffers from the same misconception as does the submission advanced in support of ground one, that the agreed facts described the applicant as no more than a “runner”.
	
	
	As the tribunal of fact, the sentencing judge was entitled to consider and assess the evidence. He was not obliged to accept the applicant as a credible witness, simply because she was advanced as such, even where the Crown accepted some parts of her evidence. The question is whether it was open on the evidence for his Honour to reach the conclusion he did. In my view, it was entirely open.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground Three: The sentencing judge ought to have admitted the letter from the applicant’s mother.


	
	This ground can be quickly dealt with since it is wholly without merit.
	
	
	The disputed evidence was sought to be tendered by the applicant on the second day of proceedings on sentence, 24 October 2014. Although unsigned, the document was said to be a letter from the applicant’s adoptive mother, Ms Amichi. Objection was taken to it by the Crown, and the sentencing judge rejected the tender, marking the document for identification.
	
	
	The transcript records the attempted tender as follows:
	


""RAJALINGHAM: Your Honour there's a further reference from Ms Pleasance's adoptive mother but it's unsigned because she is currently overseas. In the context of the evidence that came out on the last occasion, it's the best my instructing solicitor has been able to obtain from her, in relation to the circumstances of her knowledge, what was going in Melissa Pleasance's life at the relevant time. I understand my friend doesn't have an issue with the authenticity. There might be an issue in relation to procedural fairness in terms of the mother not being here.

KNOWLES: It's not a reference your Honour. It's a matter that touches on the factual matters before your Honour and I'm in no position to test it. That's the basis for the objection. I have no doubt that they've received this from the mother.

HIS HONOUR: If it goes to the factual matter and the author is not here, it's objected to and is rejected.

RAJAL1NGAM: Your Honour I just add in relation to that—

HIS HONOUR: Do you want it marked for identification?

RAJALINGHAM: Yes your Honour. It does touch upon the meeting at David Jones but I understand the position. (AB 177-8:19-21)


	
	Although it does not appear that the sentencing judge read the document, it was available to this Court as MFI 1.
	
	
	The applicant frames her complaint about the rejection of the tender, at [59], in her written submissions in the following terms:
	


“Given these were sentence proceedings, and there was no issue that the letter had indeed come from the mother, the sentencing judge was in error in refusing to admit the document.”


	
	No authority was cited for that proposition and, presumably, it rests upon the operation of s 4 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which relevantly provides:
	


“4   Courts and proceedings to which Act applies

(1)  This Act applies to all proceedings in a NSW court, including proceedings that:

(a)  […]

(b)  […]

(c)  […] or

(d)  subject to subsection (2), relate to sentencing.

(2)  If such a proceeding relates to sentencing:

(a)  this Act applies only if the court directs that the law of evidence applies in the proceeding, and

(b)  if the court specifies in the direction that the law of evidence applies only in relation to specified matters—the direction has effect accordingly.

(3)  The court must make a direction if:

(a)  a party to the proceeding applies for such a direction in relation to the proof of a fact, and

(b)  in the court’s opinion, the proceeding involves proof of that fact, and that fact is or will be significant in determining a sentence to be imposed in the proceeding.

(4)  The court must make a direction if the court considers it appropriate to make such a direction in the interests of justice.”


	
	No direction was sought or made for the application of the Evidence Act during the proceedings. Although in oral argument the applicant sought to rely upon s 65 of the Evidence Act (for the admission in limited circumstances of evidence of a previous representation where the maker is not available) as a basis for the document to be admitted, the applicant’s submission appears to be that, because the Evidence Act did not apply, the document should have been admitted.
	
	
	That submission overlooks basic questions of procedural fairness which operate irrespective of whether the Evidence Act is given application.
	
	
	Even accepting, despite its unsigned character, that the document was written by the applicant’s mother, its contents went to matters to be determined by the sentencing court as part of the fact finding exercise. That being the case, where the contents of the document were in issue, as they were here, it would have been procedurally unfair to the Crown to admit the document into evidence in circumstances where the Crown would have had no opportunity to test its contents.
	
	
	The applicant contends that the sentencing judge should have permitted the matter to be adjourned until such time as the author of the document, who was said to be overseas, could give evidence, but no application was made to his Honour for the matter to be adjourned. His Honour can hardly be in error for not permitting a course he was never asked to allow. Nor, despite the submissions of counsel for the applicant before this Court, was there any “duty” on the sentencing judge to adjourn proceedings for that purpose on his own motion.
	
	
	The applicant additionally complains that the sentencing judge should have admitted the document but attributed less weight to it. There could have been little or no purpose in such an exercise. Where one party objected to the evidence, both as to relevance and reliability, the sentencing judge could not have afforded it any weight in the absence of sworn evidence and an opportunity for the Crown to test the evidence in cross-examination.
	
	
	In any event, the contents of the document do not, in the absence of consent to the tender, appear to be such that weight ought to have been given to the document. In it, the applicant’s adoptive mother recounted things she had been told by the applicant about the nature of her relationship with Mark Younis. The only independent observations the author made were that, on an undated occasion when she met the applicant for coffee, she noted the applicant to receive a number of telephone calls and text messages that she believed were from Mark Younis and, also, that the applicant had an infection to her hand on that day. The observations as to telephone communications was not capable of advancing any aspect of the applicant’s case on sentence, and the applicant had given unchallenged evidence herself about an infection to her hand. The balance of the two and a half page document contained nothing more than hearsay.
	
	
	Whilst hearsay evidence is routinely admitted in sentence proceedings, such as evidence that an offender had expressed remorse to another person, that general practice does not establish any rule that requires a sentencing judge to uncritically accept evidence of that nature over objection, and where the party taking objection cannot test the evidence.
	
	
	The letter from Ms Amichi, on its face, appears to contain little more than self-serving statements by the applicant to her adoptive mother, which could not be adequately tested. In my view, his Honour was correct to refuse to admit the document, and this proposed ground of appeal is wholly without merit.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground Four: The sentence was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive


	
	This ground relies in large part on ground one being made good. For the reasons set out above, I have concluded that ground one is misconceived, and has not been made out. Necessarily, the applicant’s contentions in support of this ground are significantly undermined by that conclusion.
	
	
	The applicant additionally asserts that the sentence imposed upon her was manifestly excessive because general and specific deterrence should not have been given “elevated” consideration; that there should have been a finding of special circumstances; and that insufficient weight was given to the applicant’s heroin addiction and the extent to which it drove her conduct, and to her subjective case more generally, including what are asserted to have been her prospects of achieving rehabilitation.
	
	
	A ground asserting manifest excess is one which invites this Court to consider whether the length of the sentence imposed is demonstrated to be outside the range of a sound sentencing discretion, and thus unfair and unjust. It should not be advanced as a means of raising other asserted errors that could have been addressed by a specific ground. Ordinarily, a ground asserting that a sentence is manifestly excessive should be advanced only where specific error of the type identified in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, at 504-505, cannot be identified, or as an alternative to grounds raising specific error.
	
	
	The sentence here imposed was one of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment, to date from 21 October 2013 and expiring on 20 July 2017, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months specified. That sentence was to reflect the principal offence of supply prohibited drug, and the two further offences of participating in a criminal group and concealing a serious offence.
	
	
	In determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive it is necessary to examine the result from the perspective of the maximum prescribed penalty, which in this case is 15 years imprisonment, or a substantial fine, or both (for the principal offence); the place which the criminal conduct occupies on the scale of seriousness of offences of the kind in question; and the personal circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	The sentencing judge assessed the gravity of the offence as below the mid-range, but not significantly so. That assessment was open to him on the agreed facts before the court.
	
	
	His Honour summarised the applicant’s subjective case in the sentence judgment. He referred to the terrible circumstances of her earliest years, and to her subsequent adoption, where she was welcomed into a loving family environment and given every support in her education, including enrolment in a prestigious private school. The sentencing judge referred to the later breakdown of family life, to the sexual assaults to which the applicant had been subjected as a teenager, and to her subsequent descent into drug use. Although his Honour said that he was “…unimpressed with the evidence that could be seen as non-exculpatory duress” (AB 14), he was still prepared to give the applicant the benefit of a conclusion that she had expressed remorse to a degree (AB 16). He noted that the applicant was afflicted by psychological disorders. His Honour did not overlook any relevant feature of the subjective case.
	
	
	The sentencing judge regarded general and specific deterrence as of considerable importance and, although the applicant complains about that conclusion, I can see no error in that regard.
	
	
	The applicant had a long standing drug addiction and, whilst she had not previously been convicted of supply offences, she had numerous entries against her for drug offences and drug-related crime. She had also been given numerous opportunities to address her addiction, including through the Drug Court, but had failed to take advantage of the assistance offered to her. In those circumstances, specific deterrence had a role to play in the determination of sentence.
	
	
	General deterrence is ordinarily an important feature when sentencing an offender for supplying prohibited drugs, and this Court has regularly said as much:  R v Collin [2000] NSWCCA 236 at [15]; R v Ha [2004] NSWCCA 386 at [20];  R v Sciberras [2006] NSWCCA 268; (2006) 165 A Crim R 532 at [48]. In R v Collin the Court (Adams J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Newman J agreed), said at [15]:
	


“In my view, his Honour erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the considerations of general deterrence which apply to this crime. Although the respondent's involvement was almost at the lowest level, a very substantial superstructure of extremely dangerous criminal behaviour rests upon the willingness of people like him to sell in small quantities but over lengthy periods of time, to a wide range of people the prohibited drug. The amounts of money collected go to finance criminals who are ruthless and dangerous. No society can long survive if it permits persons to make profits out of breaking the law. The social consequences of the criminal trade in prohibited drugs are very substantial indeed, including corruption, the undermining of legitimate businesses and a serious level of violence, including murder, these coming in the train of the trade in which the respondent played a minor but necessary role.”


	
	There was nothing raised in the evidence before his Honour such that general deterrence should have been given less weight.
	
	
	Although there was evidence that would have justified a finding of special circumstances, his Honour was not required to make that finding, particularly given the applicant’s refusal to engage with residential drug rehabilitation programs, and her earlier failures to take the opportunities offered to her, notably through the Drug Court, for support and counselling.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances to justify a reduction in the non-parole period is warranted where there are significant positive signs to demonstrate that, if allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful: R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 at [20]. As in R v Carter, there was little reason to conclude in the applicant’s case that her achievement of rehabilitation if allowed an extended period of parole was any more than “a pious hope” (at [19]).
	
	
	Sentencing is not an exact science of mathematical application of formulae; it is a discretionary exercise. In the applicant’s case, the sentencing judge took into account all relevant features, including two offences before the court on a Form 1 document, and arrived at a sentence which, in my opinion, was neither unjust nor unfair.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to advance this ground.

2769667,"R v Davis, Smith and Charnock [2016] NSWDC 130","sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Matthew Darrol Davis, Rebecca Joy Smith and Daniel Keith Charnock appear today for sentence in relation to offences which I will outline in a moment. Unfortunately, I cannot sentence Mr Charnock today. The proceedings relating to these sentence matters started yesterday, sometime after 10.30, after I had given a judgment in another case, and they proceeded throughout the day, up until 4pm. There was a great deal of material provided to the Court, not only as to the Crown case but as to the defence cases. In fact, I took the opportunity, having viewed some CCTV footage, to undertake a view at the location of the offences for which the prisoners are to be sentenced. I have reflected upon the matter overnight and I have concluded I can sentence Mr Davis and Ms Smith today but, for the reasons which I outlined to the learned counsel for Mr Charnock and learned counsel for the Crown, as well as the other two learned counsel, I cannot proceed with Mr Charnock’s matter today. Because there is so much of the case concerning Mr Charnock interconnected with the cases of the other two people, particularly Mr Davis, having regard to the evidence including the facts that have been tendered, many of the remarks I make now are obviously relevant to and will be considered in the sentencing of Mr Charnock at a later time. In due course I will be adjourning Mr Charnock’s matter to obtain the remarks of her Honour, Judge English. Even if I got them today, I would still have to sit down and read them and think it through. I probably could not sentence Mr Charnock even later this afternoon.
	
	
	There is one other feature of the matter that I need to point out. In circumstances I will outline in a moment, one of the victims particularly has suffered, what was said from the bar table at one point, “catastrophic” injuries. It is important to appreciate in the sentencing of offenders, whether it is for this type of offence or for motor vehicle offences that cause death or grievous bodily harm to victims, that the sentence imposed upon a particular person for a particular crime, whilst it is required to consider the objective facts of the matter, must, as the law provides, take into account many other matters in addition to the objective facts. Some of which may mitigate what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence. As anyone listening to my remarks on sentence now will soon appreciate, the area of sentencing with which we are concerned is a very, very complex area and I would be doing a great deal of disrespect to the legislation that relates to sentencing and the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal that touch upon this matter, and the High Court for that matter, if I did not refer to particular matters, sometimes at some length. It would be a disrespect, too, to the cases that have been conducted by the Crown and the learned counsel for each of the accused and their very helpful submissions. A good example of that is the bundle of submissions provided by Mr Glissan QC which runs to 22 pages but deals with many, many topics which I am required to take into account. The fixing of the sentence, ultimately, is not a reflection only of the Court’s view of the consequences of the conduct of the respective prisoners.
	
	
	Matthew Darrol Davis, who I will refer to hereinafter as Davis, with no disrespect to him, pleaded guilty at an earlier sittings of the District Court at Queanbeyan to two charges. Count 1 was that he on 9 August 2014 at Queanbeyan in the State of New South Wales, did recklessly wound Michael Hancock. This is an offence contrary to s 35(4) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment and has a standard non-parole period of three years imprisonment. He also pleaded guilty to a charge alleging that, on the same date and at the same place in the State of New South Wales, in company with Daniel Keith Charnock and Rebecca Joy Smith he recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to Andrew McInnes. This was an offence contrary to s 35(1) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. This charge is a common charge to that alleged against Daniel Keith Charnock. The charge brought against them in this respect is identical. Mr Charnock faces one charge, that is, the charge relating to the victim Andrew McInnes. Obviously, the charge to which he pleaded guilty carries the same maximum penalty and standard non parole period.
	
	
	There is, in the context of the plea entered by Ms Smith, to my mind some inconsistency or tension between the respective pleadings and, in fact, having paid very close heed to the evidence and viewed the video and examined the plan of the scene, having attended the hotel where all the relevant events occurred over a period of a few minutes at the most, I am quite convinced, ultimately, that the aspect of Ms Smith being in company with the other two offenders, in respect of the conduct to which they have pleaded guilty, is somewhat problematic. But, ultimately, it is a matter that will be reflected in my fact finding.
	
	
	Rebecca Joy Smith pleaded guilty to a charge alleging at the same time and at the same place she did cause grievous bodily harm to Andrew McInnes with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. This is a crime contrary to s 33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years.
	
	
	So far as Mr Davis is concerned, he has effectively spent no time in custody. He was arrested on 20 August. One day of custody is his entitlement, as I understand the coversheet.
	
	
	Likewise in relation to Ms Smith she was arrested, as I understand the matter, on 20 August according to the Crown’s “Sentence Summary”, and that amounts to, effectively, although it was no doubt less than a day, one day in custody.
	
	
	Mr Charnock, who is not for sentence today, appears from custody. The other two offenders appear from bail. The reason Mr Charnock is in custody is that although he was arrested, as I understand it, on 21 or 22 August and charged in relation to the current matters, he was then on bail in relation to drug supply charges and related matters for which he was sentenced at the Queanbeyan District Court on 14 December 2015. The sentences imposed upon that offender exceed six years and he is currently serving an effective non-parole period of four years, to expire in 2018. As I have already explained, I will have to deal with Mr Charnock at a later time.
	
	
	I turn to the facts of the matter. To put the matter in some context, Ms Smith was in a domestic relationship with her victim, Mr McInnes, for a number of years. I will go into the detail of their relationship when I deal with the evidence, particularly from the report relating to Ms Smith’s psychological circumstances. They separated, as I understand it, in early 2013 and Ms Smith entered into a relationship with Mr Davis at about that time or some time shortly afterwards. Mr Davis and Mr Charnock, as I understand it, are both friends. Mr Davis, at the time of commencing his relationship with Ms Smith, was separated from his partner and, as I understand, was the father of four living children, although from what I understand of his ex-partner’s reference he had a child who died as an infant.
	
	
	Mr McInnes and Mr Hancock were aged 40 years. They apparently were friends who had known each other for a lengthy period of time. I should point out, in passing, it was a matter of no moment in the submissions, that a man called Joshua McMahon, who is the brother of Ms Smith, was charged in relation to his involvement in this matter. I believe I have identified him, although he was not particularly pointed out to me in the course of the conduct of the case, from the video evidence that I have seen. He was dealt with for an offence of hindering the apprehension of Mr Davis and received a s 9 bond. No issue of parity obviously arises in relation to the sentencing of Mr Smith. He was dealt with in a different jurisdiction. The issues of parity and disparity have been discussed in many cases and I will refer to the issue of ‘parity’ as it relates to Mr Davis and Mr Charnock later in the judgment and also inferentially in the relationship of Ms Smith to this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	There were, it was said in the statement of facts and was clear from the history given by the complainant McInnes, some “tensions” in the relationship between Mr McInnes, Ms Smith and, as I understand it, Mr Davis since their separation. One of the background matters is that Mr McInnes had custody of the two daughters of the relationship with Ms Smith. As I understand the matter, at the relevant time of these events, they were in their early teens or perhaps 11 or 12 years of age, but there were no apprehended violence orders in place.
	
	
	I have made mention of the fact that I viewed exhibit E, which is the disk of a closed-circuit television of events occurring at a hotel in Queanbeyan called Walsh’s Hotel. That is the hotel that I visited in company with counsel yesterday to undertake a view. As I have said, I have viewed, both in court and out of court, the CCTV footage. I was given what was called, or what I described as, an aide memoire. Apparently this was prepared by the police officer in charge of the matter, which I marked for identification 2. I did not read it in detail when it was provided to me and my attention to it really was drawn when I came to privately view the relevant recordings. There is one matter that ought be observed about this aide memoire.
	
	
	It is of little assistance to me in terms of forming views about what I can see on the CCTV footage in relation to the relevant events occurring sometime after 11.49pm when Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes entered Walsh’s Hotel before they were attacked. It was helpful in sort of synthesising, as I would call it, the various camera angles. Some camera angles of course I was not shown in court. When it comes to the critical incidents giving rise to the attacks upon Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes the document is, for want of a better description, highly deficient in detail. This very much confirms the point that Mr Glisson made in submission that, apart from incidents occurring at the very beginning when Mr Hancock was, to use an expression, king hit and knocked to the floor by Mr Davis and then Mr Davis was pulled away struggling with security, then Mr Charnock attacked Mr Davis and then later when Ms Smith on at least three occasions kicked the victim McInnes on the head when he was completely defenceless, laying on the ground, it is very, very difficult to, with precision, identify the actions of various people beyond the fact identifying Mr McInnes being rendered helpless, Mr Davis continuing to struggle and attempt to fight as with Mr Charnock. The statement of facts I have is not an agreed statement of facts although the matters of dispute or the matters in issue, about which I am required to form my own view, turn out to be relatively minor.
	
	
	I shall deal with one aspect of the statement of facts and its deficiency for my purposes later. The statement of facts states that Ms Smith claimed that Mr McInnes was not allowing her to see her daughters. The eldest daughter apparently did not want any contact with her and she, Ms Smith, was only able to see the youngest daughter in the care of Mr McInnes from time to time. The facts state that Ms Smith blamed Mr McInnes for the children’s attitude towards her. Mr Hancock as I said, was a good friend of Mr McInnes and was also known to Mr Smith. Mr McInnes and Mr Hancock on the evening of 9 August attended a school reunion and the facts state that they were at particular places, a hotel and then a registered club, socialising with other people. Sometime after 11.30pm they decided to walk to Walsh’s Hotel in Queanbeyan in the main street. Mr Hancock had worked there as a barman until recently and wanted to catch up with his former workmates. One of the things one notices from the video is Mr Hancock embracing or ‘high fiving’ one of the staff in the forefront of the view from camera 3. A woman called Corrine Dagwell contacted Mr Smith about the victims’ approach to the hotel. Whether she was at the hotel or not was not drawn to my attention from the video. She was a close friend of Ms Smith and was aware of the animosity between Ms Smith and Mr McInnes. One thing is clear immediately from the facts I am outlining, that there seemed to be no preordained plan on the part of Mr Hancock or Mr McInnes to go to Walsh’s Hotel at any particular time. Ms Dagwell was aware that Ms Smith was socialising with Mr Davis and others at Walsh’s Hotel and she notified Ms Smith via a text message that Mr McInnes and Mr Hancock were on their way, so the facts are, and it is not disputed, that apparently Ms Smith and Mr Davis at least were aware that McInnes and Hancock were coming to the hotel.
	
	
	As the video evidence from the CCTV camera coverage shows, Mr McInnes and Mr Hancock entered the hotel through the main doors on Monaro Street at the front of the hotel and walked into the front bar where they met a man who we have seen in the film by the name of Jason Webster. There are only a couple of patrons in the front bar harmlessly walking around. In what I would describe as the ‘back bar’, the two bars separated by a bar which forms a type of island between the front bar and the back bar, there is a side bar that connects the two bars and the area is quite open. In the back bar there was a band playing and I watched video of people dancing and enjoying themselves. At the rear of the hotel there is a beer garden area which is of really no moment in this case.
	
	
	I wish to come to what the Crown facts state in one respect which requires particular comment, because the drafting of the facts seems to have a complete misunderstanding of what a trial judge’s responsibility is in finding facts in respect of matters adverse to the prisoners or aggravating the offence. This is an area where the facts are the subject of ‘objection’ from Mr Glisson QC particularly and, as I understand it, taken up by the other counsel. The facts state that the CCTV footage “Indicates that Davis sees the two victims enter and advises Charnock and Smith of that fact”. That may be so I pause to say, I have watched that very closely. There is no sound on the CCTV footage and it is very difficult to lip read from a distance of about 30 metres from where people are standing or talking. The Crown asserts that the footage further shows the three offenders commence discussions between themselves and the offender Smith’s brother McMahon at the time. “The Crown further asserts that the correct inference from the footage is that the discussions is concerned with the arrival of Hancock and McInnes at the hotel”. I pause for a moment to point out that it might be well for the Crown to submit that it is “correct inference”, but the issue is that it relates to pre-planning in this matter, or pre-meditation as to the acts the subject of the charges, would require a finding of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. Anyone who knows anything about the law knows that if one is going to find an inference beyond reasonable doubt it must be the only reasonable, rational inference to be drawn.
	
	
	In my view it is not the only reasonable, rational inference to be drawn that discussions that may be seen particularly from, as I would understand it, the view in camera 11 are necessarily only directed at the arrival of Hancock and McInnes at the hotel. They may be, given subsequent events within a short period of time, but there may be other discussion taking place. It seems to me quite clear having regard to the fact that the arrival of McInnes and Hancock on their part is not planned, that the notice of their arrival from Ms Dagwell’s very unhelpful intervention was a matter occurring only a limited time before. The limited time between the arrival of Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes and the attacks upon them reflect upon the finding I make that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crimes that were committed were planned or particularly pre-meditated crimes.
	
	
	There is one matter I need to take up by reference to what the statement of facts reveal. The statement of facts state;
	


“It is the Crown case that about 11.50pm Davis made his way to where Hancock and McInnes were enjoying a drink together in the front bar. At the same time Charnock appears to make his way around the front bar from another direction”.


	
	There are two issues that relate to that. Not only did Mr Davis make his way towards where Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes were standing but, it is to be fairly said, the video footage shows he rushed towards them. I would conclude that he certainly caught them by surprise. There is one matter that arises however from the evidence of Mr Davis that needs to be included in the consideration of the facts. Mr Davis gave evidence to me that he was standing in the bar area and looking towards where Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes were standing in the front bar, he being in the back bar. He believed that he could see them making gestures and smirking and in some way antagonising him by their manner and what appeared to him to be their discussion of him or their discussion about him and perhaps Ms Smith, or directing comments in their direction. I have seen the bar area and it is quite clear that in the position Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes were standing one can see through to the back bar and can see the, if I can call it, the bar that is available for service in the back bar. The island is an open area. There are no walls to obscure the vision. However, on a careful viewing of the video footage from camera 11 it is quite clear that the movement of Mr Davis and Mr Charnock from where they were in the back bar to the area where Mr Davis attacked Mr Hancock reveals that the accused could not have been standing at the bar in the manner that he described when he claimed, to use my words, that Mr McInnes and Mr Hancock were making fun of him. One camera angle, from camera 3 does show Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes apparently having a laugh amongst themselves. But they seem to be in pretty good spirits when they arrived as I have earlier indicated, and I could not see anything in their manner that indicated that they were pointing particularly at Mr Davis. He certainly cannot be seen from camera angle 3. Mr Davis and Mr Charnock in fact came to confront the two men from an area at the far side of the back bar from where camera 11 is shown. Thus, I cannot accept the evidence of Mr Davis about what he said “precipitated” the confrontation.
	
	
	There is one other point to be made about that. It was quite clear based upon even his own version that whatever he took offence at could not constitute provocation. He has indicated in the pre-sentence report and in his evidence in this court that it was a case of, to use my words, “punch first” or get in quick with one’s “retaliation”. This is not revealed to be the case from the video evidence.
	
	
	So far as the assertion in the statement of facts that the Crown case is that Mr Charnock was cutting off any exit from the front bar for Hancock and McInnes I cannot accept that. It might be one inference that might be drawn from Mr Charnock’s movements. But the truth of the matter is that such was the way in which the matter unfolded in a freewheeling, unstructured manner over the next minute or two, I could not conclude that Mr Charnock had any expectation whatsoever that necessarily Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes were going to flee from the front bar area.
	
	
	The facts state, and this is not objected to, that Mr Charnock was heard to say words to the effect of “It’s fuckin’ on”, which suggests that he anticipated there was going to be trouble. Self-evidently there was going to be trouble when one watches the video because Mr Davis moved very swiftly to attack Mr Hancock, striking him once with a clenched fist to the head. Mr Hancock was in fact knocked unconscious by that one blow and fell heavily, striking his head and right elbow on the tiled floor. He did not regain consciousness for the remainder of the incident. That is the essence of what was done to constitute count 1 in the indictment in relation to Davis. As I understood it there was some concern or objection to the assertion that neither victim appears to see Davis approach. I cannot draw a conclusion one way or the other but Mr Davis did come so quickly that one would not be surprised that neither Mr McInnes or Mr Hancock had any time to react and the fact that Mr Davis was able to strike Mr Hancock with a heavy blow to the head without him being able to take evasive action confirms that fact.
	
	
	If I could just move ahead to Mr Hancock’s injuries, just for the moment. He was treated by ambulance officers at the hotel and conveyed to Canberra Hospital. Mr Hancock suffered two lacerations to his top lip, one required numerous sutures and later plastic surgery, a laceration to the top of his head as a result of impacting with the tiled floor, a further graze to the top of his head. Injury to his right elbow also from impact from the floor, bruising to his brain which did not require medical intervention, thankfully for him, and he was discharged from hospital on 13 August 2014. After approximately six months he made a full recovery from his physical injuries. I shall come back to the victim impact statement later, it requires consideration of some legal principles.
	
	
	Mr Hancock was very fortunate if I be so bold to say so, that he did not suffer more catastrophic injuries. It is to be understood of course that this sentencing occurs in the context of a large number of publicly known cases involving people being felled by either opportunistic or unprovoked attacks where very, very sadly by falling to the ground and striking their head, those victims have not recovered. It should be said that in the context of sentencing these offenders the issue of general deterrence looms very large, as do the other purposes of sentencing. The public is just sick and tired of having to read that these events occur in hotels and our streets. It certainly is, fairly said, to be very cowardly, as one sees in these video renditions of these events, to attack somebody in this way.
	
	
	With regard to count two, concerning Mr Davis, and Mr Charnock, as the video evidence reveals, after felling Mr Hancock, Mr Davis turned his attention to Mr McInnes. It is quite clear in the forefront of the camera 3 angle one can see Mr Davis strike Mr McInnes to the head causing Mr McInnes to fall backwards. The facts say he fell to the ground. He did regain his feet fairly quickly.
	
	
	Davis was retrained by the man, McMahon, and dragged away. It is the Crown case that Davis continued to thrash around attempting to continue the assault. Certainly he was not finished with his concern with Mr McInnes, as later events demonstrated and he certainly struggled with the attempts of security to try to subdue him to prevent any further damage being done.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any immediate injury to Mr McInnes, at this particular point. One cannot see the bleeding which is self-evident in the photographs that I have seen of him taken shortly after the event.
	
	
	Mr Charnock, it is acknowledged in the facts, initially stepped in between Mr Davis and Mr McInnes, and he pushed Mr Davis away. He went back to the melee involving Mr Davis, as the video makes clear, and was involved in that from which Mr McInnes was somewhat separated for a period of time. Mr Charnock lurched forward towards Mr Davis and Davis pushed him away. Charnock then immediately turned around and turned his attention to Mr McInnes, and he struck Mr McInnes in the head a number of times forcing him backwards.
	
	
	It is stated in the facts that at about this time Mr Davis broke free from the security officers and “ran”, I would suggested more stumbled, towards McInnes, joining Mr Charnock in the continuing assault on the victim, Andrew McInnes.
	
	
	Mr McInnes attempted to move away but was followed by Mr Davis and Mr Charnock. The statement of facts asserts that Mr Davis tackled Mr McInnes to the ground and the Crown “asserts that both Davis and Charnock attacked him while he was on the ground”. This is not entirely clear from the video evidence because, as the aide memoire (MFI 2) demonstrates in its paucity of detail, the camera angles show a group of people struggling amongst one another. There is, at least, three or four, maybe more hotel staff struggling with the men at this particular point.
	
	
	It is at this point I would wish to just quote from some of the statements that were tendered at the request of Mr Glisson, particularly from the statement of Trent Miller, who was the licensee of the hotel and, in fact, is still the licensee as I noted yesterday when I attended the hotel. He wanted to talk to me about the case. I told him I could not talk to him.
	
	
	In his statement, given to police on 14 August 2014, he said that he observed various events trying to break up the altercation. He saw Mr Hancock struck, he saw Mr McInnes struck, and his version of that aspect of the matter is consistent with the CCTV footage. He said, at this point, Mr Hancock was unconscious on the ground. He remembered other people arriving at the scene, he said:
	


“At this time, Andrew— (McInnes)”

(This is after Mr Davis had started to strike him and Mr Charnock had struck him):

“--did not appear to be injured.” Meaning, ‘I didn’t see any blood on him’.”


	
	He claimed that he saw Mr Charnock, the name is misspelt in the statement of Mr Miller, “Advance on the victim and throw an elbow or right forearm at his head connecting with the victim’s jaw area following that with a flurry of punches”.
	
	
	He remembered the victim being on the ground with people on top of him and he was trying to pull that person away when he saw Ms Smith, “Start ... to kick McGuinness (sic)”. He saw him kicked in the head region by her. In fact, it was while the melee was occurring with Mr McInnes on the ground, Davis and Charnock are nearby, that Ms Smith joined in and commenced kicking McInnes to the head as he was lying on his back on the ground. She was wearing boots. She kicked at the head of Mr McInnes many times with full force. As the video records she advanced on him on, at least, three separate occasions and kicked him to the head numerous times on each occasion.
	
	
	I point out that when the reference is made to, “numerous times”, my viewing of the video, very closely, suggests three perhaps four kicks on each occasion. Perhaps there are others I did not see.
	
	
	On each occasion Ms Smith was forced back by the staff. She would break free and then sometimes after talking to someone else nearby, returned to continue kicking Mr McInnes in the head. The facts state that as she kicked him his blood seemed to be, “splashing all over the place”. The photographic evidence shows him shortly after the event bleeding very freely.
	
	
	The facts state at one point Smith was moved away and hugged by a female patron metres away from Davis and McInnes. Why this occurred I do not know.
	
	
	During the melee Mr McInnes’ head comes into clear view as he is laying on the ground and a female patron sought to intervene by trying to hold Smith’s arm and pull her back. But she broke away and again violently kicked the head of Mr McInnes with her right foot connecting with his facial area. The statements that were tendered at the insistence of Mr Glisson confirm the video evidence and what is in the statement of facts in this respect. McInnes sought to protect himself but it must be said that he was on the ground, there were other people on top of him, and as I said earlier he was effectively defenceless.
	
	
	Ms Smith, during the period of kicking Mr McInnes, also kicked the arm of Mr Webster. This is an offence of assault which is on a Form One matter in relation to her. Ms Smith watched the melee for a period of time. Eventually the security staff were able to control the situation, and Mr McInnes was able to get to his feet. As I said he was bleeding heavily from the head.
	
	
	The injuries that he suffered on the facts available to me were that he had two breaks to his lower jaw, he lost a tooth, he suffered significant bruising and swelling to his face, and he suffered a stroke during the days following his hospitalisation. He is now legally blind in his left eye as a result of the stroke. This is a permanent condition. He has ongoing headaches. He will remain on the blood thinner, Warfarin, for the remainder of his life and has a cognitive impairment including short term memory issues. When he tires, which is fairly frequently, he drags his right leg and he suffers continuing discomfort from jaw realignment. In relation to Mr McInnes I have read the victim impact statement. I will come back to that shortly.
	
	
	The Crown asserts in relation to the matter that by her actions Ms Smith intentionally inflicted grievous bodily harm on Mr McInnes. “Mr Davis and Mr Charnock are quite liable for the injuries caused to (Mr) McInnes on the basis of the joint criminal enterprise in that they realised the possibility of grievous bodily harm being inflicted, however, they did not foresee the possibility of intention infliction of grievous bodily harm.” The facts reveal this is a different criminal enterprise than that alleged against Ms Smith.
	
	
	It must be fairly said, bearing in mind the differing pleadings, that on the evidence in the case, of the actions of Mr Davis and Mr Charnock it could not be said that their specific actions infer a contemplation of the possibility of the exact or the particular grievous bodily harm that was actually suffered. I think it could be fairly said of Ms Smith that although her kicks to the face and head show a clear intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, I could not conclude, in fact, it would be totally irrational to conclude, that it was an intention on her part to leave the victim with a permanent cognitive impairment, blindness in his eye and the like, that has arisen from the stroke. This has a causal connection to the various actions of the offenders but which occurred in circumstances that were - it would seem on the evidence to me - not foreseen by the prisoners.
	
	
	There is evidence relating to the investigation and arrest in the facts that suggest that Ms Smith sought to avoid her responsibility, denying to one of her daughters that she was responsible for the obvious injuries of which the daughter was aware at that time. She, when arrested on 20 August, declined to give an account of herself. Since these events she has had no contact with her daughters and has been on bail. Mr Davis was arrested on the same day. He likewise exercised his rights to silence. Mr Charnock, as I have indicated, was arrested on Friday, 22 August. He declined the offer to participate in an electronic interview and his bail was revoked in relation to drug matters for which he was then currently charged.
	
	
	In relation to the matters raised by Mr Glisson concerning the conduct of Mr Davis, and what specific harm was caused by his blows to Mr McInnes, the other statements he referred me to were generally in support of the account given by the publican who was, one would have expected, sober and attentive to the detail of what was occurring. What the licensee of the hotel said in his statement was clearly consistent in material respects with what I can see for myself in the video recording.
	
	
	With regard to matters on a Form 1, Mr Charnock has one too. There is no need for me to deal with that at the moment.
	
	
	It could be fairly said, from what I have said of the facts as I find them, that whilst the offences committed were not planned, and were largely not premeditated, the extent of any premeditation on the part of Mr Davis, who started this whole affair, was limited to a matter of a minute or so at the very most. But it is clear from watching the video that as he rounded the bar and rushed towards the victims, firstly striking Mr Hancock, he was intent on striking a heavy blow to that person and showed that he was intent on striking Mr McInnes with heavy blows as well at that particular time.
	
	
	Mr Davis’ actions really precipitated what followed, and whilst the conduct of Mr Charnock was in a sense somewhat contradictory, at one stage he was trying to separate people, and at another stage he was joining into the action, he was clearly a willing participant.
	
	
	It must be said of Ms Smith that whilst I could not conclude any premeditation on her part, she could not plan for the fact that ultimately Mr McInnes, with the weight of bodies upon him including security staff, would be prone on the ground, she opportunistically but repeatedly sought to extract what I take to be some revenge upon him whilst he was unable to defend himself, for what she regarded as the frustrations or the slights that had been suffered arising from a separation from her children and her inability to have access to her children, or limited access to her children, or perceiving that their father had turned her children against her.
	
	
	In that respect, in the context of the psychological report, and the history given by Ms Smith, I was provided with a copy of a number of text messages, which apparently passed between Mr McInnes and Ms Smith in the period late 2012 and early 2013. This is, of course, some considerable time before the events with which I am concerned. But the flavour of the text messages that I have read paints a very different picture from the one that the prisoner Smith sought to paint for the purposes of the preparation of a psychological report.
	
	
	Mr McInnes in those messages, if I be so bold to say so, offered conciliation, friendship, empathy on a number of occasions in text messages. Obviously there was a strain in their relationship. Obviously from her own text messages, Ms Smith needed a change. I am not suggesting for a moment that she wanted to be away or separated from her daughters. But clearly it would appear from the text messages that her departure from their relationship was a voluntary decision made by her to sort her own life out and Mr McInnes, at least in those early stages of the relationship, would appear to be very supportive.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Davis, when he gave evidence before me he spoke of the relationship with Ms Smith. He said that he had never been in any violent confrontation before in his life, and that is confirmed by his criminal history. He has no prior criminal convictions.
	
	
	It is a feature of this case, which is very baffling and rather disheartening that three people, with no history of violence, should involve themselves in this sort of conduct. One would expect this sort of violent conduct, albeit over a short period of time unplanned as it was but sustained, would be more likely to come from people who had a history of acting in this particular way.
	
	
	I accept, from his evidence and the references he has produced to the Court, that Mr Davis has been an industrious young man since leaving school. He left school at the end of Year Seven. He is a young man who has grown up in considerable difficulties. His mother has written about this and I have got other material before me to show that he has not had the best of upbringings. Then again, to his credit, many young people with disadvantaged upbringings, come before our Courts time and time again, charged with drug offences, and stealing, and robbery matters. He does not have any suggestion of a ‘conduct disorder’, as it is described, or any antisocial attitudes or activities, notwithstanding his disadvantages. He expressed his regret for his conduct.
	
	
	As I said, I do not accept his version of being taunted in some way and certainly the physical movement of him from the place he was in the rear bar towards the victim is inconsistent with the evidence he gave before me. I do not doubt, of course, that there may have been, as the facts state, tensions between he and Mr McInnes. He may have sided with whatever version of events Ms Smith was giving him. This is a natural thing in relationships. New partnerships start, one partner listens to the other partner and accepts what they say because of the character of their relationship. But it may be that he was not being told the truth about the true relationship between Ms Smith and Mr McInnes. There had been no suggestion of any ill will in a physical sense between Mr McInnes and Ms Smith and/or Mr Davis before these events.
	
	
	I accept, common to all three prisoners, although Mr Charnock has been in custody since August, particularly in relation to Smith and Davis, that over the two years, effectively since these events, there have been no further troubles. Of course, they have been restrained, I would assume, by Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders and breaches of those orders would be prosecuted by the police I am sure.
	
	
	They have, no doubt, been restrained, too, by bail conditions. Courts expect people will comply with the orders made restraining conduct to keep the peace. But I take into account the delay in the matter coming to Court, albeit that part of that delay was in the context of maintaining pleas of not guilty when it could be fairly said, firstly, in relation to count one concerning Mr Davis, the evidence against him was completely overwhelming and no issue of self-defence could reasonably be said to arise from the video evidence, and having regard to the fact that Ms Smith has ultimately, albeit when the matter was listed for trial, pleaded guilty to a charge with which she was originally charged from the beginning. There could be no doubt, looking at the video, that she must have known, no matter how much alcohol that she drank, that she had repeatedly, if I could use the expression, laid the boot into Mr McInnes when he was completely unable to defend himself or protect himself even from the savage kicks that she rendered to him. She did not show him any mercy on that night, that is for sure.
	
	
	However, dealing with Mr Davis’ subjective matters, I read the references from his employers. He has had employment with the one firm for as I understand it, ten or eleven years. He has worked in the industry for a lot longer than that. He is well regarded as a competent, hardworking leader of his team. He is valued to the point where his employment is offered to him when these proceedings are over. He has expressed remorse to his employers for his conduct and the respective employment references from two separate businesses that apparently have a connection with one another, or have had a connection with one another, are very positive about his industry, his honesty, and his dedication to his work.
	
	
	I found the letter from his former partner most moving. She did not give oral evidence and I did not have an opportunity to see her, but she provided some detail about his background over a number of years of their relationship, the fact that they had children when he was very young, he was seventeen, as I understand it, she was eighteen at the time of their first child. They, as I understand it, have four children. In 2004, the prisoner lost his brother suddenly and by the time that they were twenty-one or twenty-two they had two or three children.
	
	
	They lost a child in infancy, as I said, and ultimately they had four children from the relationship. They separated, it would appear, in an amicable separation. There is no suggestion in the reference from Ms Davis of any violence on the part of the prisoner, or any irrational behaviour as we see in relation to this matter. Their agreement to separate was taken with a view of the best interests of their children and it is a shame that the separation between them, as amicable as it was, did not provide some template for the separation of Ms Smith from Mr McInnes.
	
	
	Ms Davis speaks highly of the prisoner’s character, as to his industry, his support for his family, the affection he has for his children, the regret he has for his conduct, the way in which he would wish his conduct could be, to use the expression, taken back. But unfortunately it cannot.
	
	
	There are other references from other people who have known the prisoner over a period of time. A land owner in the district and another woman of substance, speak of his finer qualities and I accept from all the character evidence that the prisoner’s conduct on this occasion was entirely uncharacteristic, almost inexplicable. The prisoner sought to explain it by suggesting that it was some sort of pre-emptive strike for fear of his own safety but that really does not explain what happened and certainly is not supported by the objective evidence.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report from Community Corrections in relation to the prisoner Davis reflects upon his turbulent childhood, his father’s violence towards his mother and the alcohol difficulties of his parents, the death of his older brother from a brain haemorrhage eleven years ago, to which I have referred, the amicable relationship with his partner, his industry, and employment since he was fourteen years of age, despite having limited education. In fact, he told the Community Corrections Officer that he actually taught himself to read after leaving school. He has completed a number of industry specific courses that are detailed in the report. I accept all that to be true.
	
	
	He has had some long term mental health concerns, particularly around the time of his marriage breakdown. He undertook a Mental Health Care Plan for a period of time and had fifteen sessions with a counsellor, but was unable to continue that program because of the cost of it. He also took some medication but that affected him to the point where he thought it was inappropriate for his employment and his ability to care for his children.
	
	
	His attitude to the offending, so far as the Community Corrections Service was concerned, was that he was not in agreement with the police facts claiming “omission of facts throughout”. He claimed that the offence occurred, “after a lengthy period of provocation on the part of the victim”, and stating that he “believes there was no other possible outcome in this situation”.
	
	
	In his evidence before me he had an opportunity to give greater detail about what is said to be “a lengthy period of provocation” but gave no evidence about that only speaking of the events on the night in question.
	
	
	He is regarded as being at medium to low risk of reoffending, and it is assessed that he is a young man comparatively, now aged as I understand it, thirty-two, being born on 14 October 1983, who has done much in his life to overcome the difficulties of his childhood and other issues arising from his relationship with the mother of his children breaking down.
	
	
	The assessment of him states that while he was “cognisant” of the inappropriateness of his actions, he believed there was no other outcome in the situation. I am not sure that he believes that now. Certainly it could not be true, but I take into account from all of that that there are many positive things to be said generally about his character beyond the fact that he has no prior criminal convictions and he has much potential for the future.
	
	
	Of course, the victim, Mr McInnes’ potential for the future is significantly inhibited as a consequence of the combined actions of Mr Davis, and the other two people.
	
	
	Ms Smith was born on the 6 May 1976, she is now aged forty. As I would understand it she was thirty-eight at the time of the offending. She has no prior criminal convictions. With regard to her background, I mentioned the fact that there was a psychological report relating to her from Danielle Clout. That report is dated 3 May 2016. It attracted some comment in the course of the proceedings.
	
	
	Whilst Mr Davis gave evidence, Ms Smith did not give evidence. The Crown did not specifically object to the psychologist’s report, but the Crown properly pointed out to the Court that it was not subject, in its detail of history from the prisoner, to the test of cross-examination and thus the factual foundation for some of the opinions expressed has not been suitably established.
	
	
	In relation to that aspect of the matter, I have referred to the issues concerning the relationship with the victim with her husband. That is set out in a section under the heading, ‘Relationship History’, at paragraphs 21 to 27.
	
	
	It must be said that she gives a detailed account of Mr McInnes, if I could use the expression, emotionally or otherwise abusing her. She paints a picture of deprivation of contact from her children, engineered by Mr McInnes, and that there was conduct of Mr McInnes that could be said to constitute some provocation that might have explained her actions or, at least, explained her mental state at the time that the events that I am concerned with occurred.
	
	
	The difficulty with many of her assertions, as I said earlier, is that there is objective evidence to contradict the account she gives as to the circumstances of the break up and, at least, the early attitude of Mr McInnes towards her. In the context of her not giving evidence and not being cross-examined, clearly her account of the relationship history must be approached with considerable circumspection. One would have great difficulty accepting it.
	
	
	It is to be said, as one of the authorities referred to in the various submissions I received point out, this is not the Family Court of Australia and the sentencing Judge in a domestic violence situation or a case involving violence arising out of a relationship between people, is not equipped to make final conclusions about the character of the personal relationship of people, particularly people that have had children between them. Of course, there is insufficient evidence, even allowing for the detail of the account given by Ms Smith, to reach any concluded view about the matter of their relationship. But the facts are, as the authorities make clear and as is acknowledged in the written submissions that I received, the fact that there is a family dispute between partners is not an excuse for violence or physical retribution.
	
	
	Of course, most domestic violence situations involve men abusing women and the shocking toll of domestic homicides in our country is a matter of great shame and embarrassment and regret. It is not of any moment in explaining serious violence against another that the victim of the violence has, in some way, acted in a manner which has frustrated, annoyed or even hurt the feelings of the person perpetrating the violence. It is because I cannot accept the account the prisoner gives of her relationship with the victim that I cannot act upon some of the opinions that have been expressed by the psychologist.
	
	
	Although the prisoner did not give evidence there is other material of history which I am prepared to accept in a general way, the background of some disadvantage, that she, as a child had, she moved a number of times, she had lost contact with her father for a long period of time after he had left the family when she was three years of age. She has a stepbrother and a half-brother from her mother’s re-partnering. She, in the history she gave to the psychologist, reported, “an extensive history of exposure to violence in the home” when she was living with her mother. Her stepfather was “a raging alcoholic” and was frequently violent to her, her sister and her step-brother. This may be true and in part this may provide some context for what I am concerned with here, but the prisoner, as I said earlier, has herself no prior history of violence to others.
	
	
	She has been industrious. She did go to Year Twelve at school. She trained as a hairdresser. She was a below average student but she apparently has worked in various hairdressing businesses for a long period of time, subject to having children and the like. She opened her own business in 2010 but that business shut in January 2016. Her financial difficulties are referred to in the Pre-Sentence Report relating to her. I will come back to that in a moment.
	
	
	With regard to the medical history and her psychiatric history, she has had a history of postpartum depression after the birth of both of her children, worse thing after the birth of her second child in 2002. She received some medical assistance in relation to that.
	
	
	She reported that in the months prior to the offence “her mental health had deteriorated in response to increasing threats from Mr McInnes and reduced contact with her two daughters”. She described “missing her children intensely” which had an effect upon her mood and thoughts of self-harm and suicide. This could well be true. She attended the Queanbeyan Mental Health Unit and was kept overnight for observation and support but I have not been given any particular detailed evidence about that. She had taken some medication to overcome her distress and expressed current symptoms of depression at the time of her assessment. This may well be, of course, reactive to her current circumstances.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of threats by her partner, in the relationship history, the psychologist in her assessment saw the conduct of Mr McInnes as being concerned with what the psychologist assessed to be her mental state functioning at the time of the offence.
	
	
	I cannot conclude that there is any mental illness or mental disability that is causally connected to her conduct. I note in relation to the history that she gave of the incident involving her former partner, at paragraph 48 of the report, she claimed that “started kicking Mr Davis telling him to get off Mr McInnes”. She said that when she saw Mr McInnes, “still lying there, she ‘panicked’ about Mr McInnes stopping her contact with her daughter due to the fight and she just wanted him to get up”. Ms Smith reported that she then kicked Mr McInnes “one” time in an attempt to force him to get up. She stated that she “wasn’t in her body” at this time and she just desperately wanted him to get up so he “would not distance her children from her further.”
	
	
	That piece of history, as it is materially relevant to the psychologist’s assessment of her mental state at the time of the offending, is materially untrue. She did kick Mr McInnes more than one occasion. I am prepared to accept the fact that she was continuing to be distressed about being separated from her children and that she resented Mr McInnes for that. But it seemed to me, with respect, that her multiple actions, her repetitive actions, were more consistent with her wanting to hurt Mr McInnes, as her plea of guilty reflects, rather than wanting him to “get up” and that she acted, if she acted out of frustration with vigour and with determination.
	
	
	That having been said, the possibility of her having what she describes as an “out of body” type experience may be partly true. There was some ingestion of alcohol but as a background to this matter on the part of all the offenders intoxication has not been raised by them as being particularly relevant. In fact, ultimately it is a matter of no moment.
	
	
	With regard to the assessment of the psychologist, she concluded:
	


“that the prisoner met (what are described as) DSM No. V diagnostic criteria for Adjustment Disorder, which was likely triggered around June 2013 when her separation from Mr McInnes became increasingly hostile and he began threatening her and withholding her access to her children. Ms Smith’s vulnerability to experiencing an Adjustment Disorder, at this time, is likely heightened by exposure to domestic violence perpetrated by her stepfather and then the reported long history of abusive and controlling behaviour by Mr McInnes during their marriage.”


	
	She also says:
	


“It is possible that at the time of committing the offence Ms Smith may have suffered from major Depressive Disorder rather than Adjustment Disorder. However, due to the retrospective nature of the clinical review establishing the time specifies required for the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, it is difficulty, given the period of time that has elapsed since August 2014.”


	
	Firstly, that last comment is self-evidently true. But, also, the assessment of the psychologist about her state of mind at the time is very dependent, in my view, upon accuracy of the history that she has given.
	
	
	Now I appreciate, of course, that she gives a history of a deterioration in her relationship with Mr McInnes in mid-2013, a period not covered by the text messages that the Crown tendered in its case in reply. But on the other hand, as I said, there were elements of the text messages which showed on her part, and Mr McInnes’ part, a relationship or a situation at the time of the separation somewhat different from that claimed by the prisoner.
	
	
	The psychologist, in her report, discusses what an Adjustment Disorder involves:
	


“It involves the development of clinically significant emotional behavioural symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, and can be a serious mental health condition, leading to impairments in functioning across a range of domains.”


	
	I am not satisfied, on balance, that such a condition materially affected the prisoner. As I said I am prepared to accept that her conduct was motivated by her resentment or dislike of Mr McInnes. That is self-evidently so from her actions, but I could not ultimately conclude that it was as a result of a substantial mental illness or disability.
	
	
	I note the current condition of the prisoner. That assessment of her requiring less dependence upon the history that she has given, seems quite appropriate in the circumstances of the matter. I certainly could not conclude that she suffered a major depressive disorder at the time of the offending. The psychologist, as I said earlier, only sees it as a possibility.
	
	
	I note the prospects of rehabilitation and the prospects of not re offending are commented upon favourably by the psychologist. This would, to my mind, be self-evidently so having regard to the personal history of the prisoner, a lack of criminal history and events since the offences with which I am concerned. I have noted the opinion of the psychologist as to the effect upon the prisoner of being in custody. Obviously this would have a substantial affect upon her. In part that is the purpose of imposing a term of imprisonment in one sense, not to cause any mental distress or exacerbate existing conditions, but to emphasise the need for general and personal deterrence.
	
	
	With regard to the Pre-Sentence Report it sets out matters of history that I have already commented upon. Ms Smith, like Mr Davis, does not appear to have had problems with drugs or alcohol. There is reference made to treatment for post-natal depression. I appreciate that persons with post-natal depression could be more amenable to depressive symptoms in other circumstances of stress. As I said earlier, I accept that she was in a degree of distress, at least, in terms of her relationship with her children.
	
	
	As to her attitude to the offending, reported to the psychologist, the report says:
	


“The offender reported a disparity between her recollection of the events and those detailed in the agreed Police facts. Ms Smith stated that she had initially attempted to break up the altercation, however, had ‘mentally lost it and caused injury’ to the victim while attempting to kick the co-offender’”.


	
	This is similarly an assertion, as I would understand it, that she was endeavouring to kick Mr Davis rather than her partner. I cannot accept that account. She, on repeated occasions, kicked the victim as the evidence reveals. Both the video evidence and the evidence of bystanders. If she was attempting to kick Mr Davis, her failure to connect with him and connecting with Mr McInnes on repeated occasions, sometimes separated by walking away, is entirely inconsistent with what she claims.
	
	
	She is assessed at being at low risk of reoffending but she had a number of issues that need addressing, including her relationship with her family, her relationship with her partner, her personal and emotional needs and the like. She does have some physical injuries of long standing. She has some injuries to her right arm and back that are reported by her General Practitioner.
	
	
	She was co-operative with the psychologist and co-operative with the Community Corrections Officer. The assessment of her was that apart from disputing the police facts, she sought to assert that she was defusing the altercation, that she was suffering mental health issues at the time, and that her decision to engage in the melee arose from those circumstances, “irrespective of her intentions”. She is currently engaged in mental health treatment and had an appropriate management plan. The Parole Authority and the Correctional Services will need to address the issue of her mental health whilst in custody quite closely. She needs assistance on community release through a mental health treatment plan and counselling for emotional management and conflict resolution, taking that material into account.
	
	
	I have some references from friends of her. Again they speak of her industry, her loyalty to her friends, the devotion that she had to her children. She is a committed person in the workplace. She is regarded by one of her former employers as “kind, loving, caring and gentle” and has made a contribution to her community previously.
	
	
	She said that the prisoner was “devastated and grief stricken over these matters”, and “deeply affected by what has happened”. It seems to me, with respect, that a great deal of that may well be reflecting upon her own circumstances rather than that of Mr McInnes. But it is said that the conduct that is alleged against her is uncharacteristic and I accept that to be so. That is the evidence relating to her.
	
	
	The submissions on behalf of the prisoner, Mr Davis, by Mr Glisson QC, I have referred to in general terms. He provided very helpful detailed written submissions. I have dealt with the issues so far as fact finding is concerned, relating to those matters raised by Mr Glisson. It does require me, however, in the context of my attention to the submissions of the parties, which I do not propose to repeat because everything that has been submitted has been taken in to account and is reflected in my reasons, that I turn to the issue of the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. One reason for that is because each of the offences with which I am concerned carries with it, as I said, a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Section 54A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, provides:
	


“For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to this division that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness.”


	
	Section 54B(2) provides:
	


“The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a Court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.”


	
	This Division of Part 4 of the Act also provides that:
	


“Where there is a standard non-parole period the Court must, irrespective of what other orders the Court makes, fix a non parole period.”


	
	I just pause for a moment. I have been going for about an hour and 20 minutes. Does anyone want a break? Does anyone need a break? Do any of the prisoners need a break? Anyone want to go to the toilet or anything like that? No, all right, I will keep moving along.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Davis, in the submissions made by Mr Glisson QC, he conceded that the attack upon Mr Hancock was within the middle range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	I would place the offence at the lower end of the mid-range of objective seriousness, bearing in mind that it has been said that the middle range of objective seriousness may not necessarily be a “narrow band”.
	
	
	In coming to this conclusion, in relation to count one, I take into account the following matters. Firstly of all, naturally the character of the injuries upon the victim. The unannounced character of the assault. The striking of the victim in circumstances where he had little or no time to defend himself. I bear in mind that the assault was unprovoked and the victim, as I said, was largely unaware of what was to happen. But, as well, there are these other factors to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending in the manner in which I do. Firstly, any premeditation in my view was slight. True it is that the prisoner came from the back of the hotel some distance of, he said, 15 metres. I would estimate it to be perhaps greater, up to 20 or 25 metres from the rear of the rear bar to confront Mr Hancock. He obviously was intent on striking him. But the extent of premeditation, if there was any, was limited to a minute or less.
	
	
	I accept that there was no planning of this. The presence of Mr Hancock and Mr McInnes in the hotel, that was notified apparently to Ms Smith, was not necessarily anticipated by any of the prisoners. The prisoner did not use a weapon, he used his fists, although as we can see in this case and other cases, they can cause serious injury. He was not disguised. The events happened very quickly within a matter of seconds.
	
	
	With regard to the second count in the indictment, concerning Mr McInnes, I have already indicated that the specific harm suffered by Mr McInnes was not that intended. The Crown has indicated in the facts that the pleas were accepted on the base of the acceptance that there was a reasonable possibility foreseen by the prisoners in the course of a joint criminal enterprise that there would be grievous bodily harm, but not serious bodily harm that was lifelong.
	
	
	This offending, just isolating Mr Davis and Mr Charnock at the moment although I am not actually sentencing Mr Charnock today, I would place again in the low level of the ‘midrange’ of objective seriousness. In this regard I take into account concerning Mr McInnes the various injuries he suffered as best as I can identify from the actual blows of the prisoners.
	
	
	I note the fact that the accused Smith inflicted separate blows at a time when what she did, in my view, did not form part of the joint criminal enterprise between the prisoner and Mr Charnock. But the facts of the matter are Mr Davis started this melee. He was the first one to strike Mr McInnes, and he was anxious to continue the struggle as the video makes clear. He was in-company with Mr Charnock, although Mr Charnock initially was not directly involved in the striking of Mr McInnes.
	
	
	I have noted the submissions made by Mr Glisson QC about the limitation of the extent of the joint criminal enterprise, the distinction that may be drawn between being in-company, as the prisoner has admitted, and a joint criminal enterprise. But it is clear that Mr Davis was set upon doing what he wanted to do and Mr Charnock joined in to what Mr Davis was doing, even if Mr Davis was relevantly oblivious to what Mr Charnock had achieved being - I hasten to say as the video makes clear - entirely pre-occupied for a large part of the melee by being restrained by security guards.
	
	
	There is no evidence from which I could conclude that the prisoner or Mr Charnock were aware, encouraged or approved, of what Ms Smith did. Mr Davis and Mr Charnock had no weapon. Their blows were punches. I have already made comment upon the evidence of the absence of injury at various times when blows were struck, at least, by Mr Davis.
	
	
	The assaults on Mr McInnes were not planned and had even less premeditation, if any, than that involved by the assault by Mr Davis upon Mr Hancock. The events happened over a short period of time and, of course, many of the blows struck after the initial blows by the prisoner, Mr Davis, and the initial blows struck subsequently by Mr Charnock, were blows struck in a wild but random melee.
	
	
	I say in favour of Mr Charnock that I have taken into account the fact that he did not start this attack, although he was there willing to assist, as he demonstrated, and I have noted the separation of Mr Davis from Mr McInnes at a particular time. He has similar features to Davis, absence of planning, no intention to cause the specific harm, no weapon, no premeditation.
	
	
	With regard to Ms Smith’s conduct, I place the objective seriousness of her offending in the context of the considerations of Part 4 Division 1A of the Act in the middle of the midrange, perhaps slightly to the lower side of the middle of the midrange. In this regard, as with the other matters I am required to consider for Ms Smith and Mr Charnock, I take into account the injuries suffered by the victim immediately at her hands. It is clear that her kicking to the head and the face substantially contributed to the immediate injuries suffered by the victim.
	
	
	There was no planning, no premeditation. Her crime was clearly on the video evidence, in my view, opportunistic, even if she did hold a grudge against Mr McInnes. But her conduct was also repeated and deliberate and targeted. She also should have appreciated, given the nature of the footwear and the like, that her kicking, as she accepts, would cause grievous bodily harm if not the specific grievous bodily harm that arose. I also note on the facts that her striking of the victim was at a time, as I said earlier, when he was on the ground and completely defenceless.
	
	
	In relation to the matters that I am required to take into account, in respect of the prisoners on the basis of the legal issues that were raised in the submissions, I note, firstly, I am required to have regard to all the ‘purposes for sentencing’ under s 3A of the Act. There is a need for adequate punishment, a need to prevent the prisoner and others from committing similar offences. I believe, on the basis of their past criminal histories, and the context of this offending, that personal deterrence is not as significant as general deterrence. I do not believe on the evidence available to the Court that I need to protect the community from the offenders. I need to promote their rehabilitation but also make them accountable for their actions to denounce their conduct and recognise the harm done to the victim by the crimes they have committed.
	
	
	With regard to the victim impact statements, if I may come back to that material, I have read the victim impact statement of Mr Hancock, I have read the victim impact statement of Mr McInnes. Mr McInnes’ victim impact statement is very detailed. It does contain a great deal of detail that has not been included in the facts and there is some medical material that, in my view, properly should have been brought to the attention of the Court in medical reports, with no disrespect to Mr McInnes, not based upon his assertion or leaving him with the responsibility of detailing the full extent of his injuries. As I said, the facts themselves speak of the catastrophic affect of him of these events and the life of pain and suffering he will have. I have already concluded, although he might not see it that way because what happened to him is consequent of the combined actions of the three, that I do not accept that the prisoners intended that he a suffer permanent injury but clearly Ms Smith intended that he suffer grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Hancock’s victim impact statement, which only relates, of course, to Mr Davis, I have had regard to those matters that are in accord with the fact. Issues relating to the personal relationship with his partner and the break-up of their relationship are not matters that I can properly or reasonably take into account directly referable to these prisoners.
	
	
	With regard to victim impact statements, of course, they are matters relevant to the assessment of s 3A and s 21A of the Act. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, at Part 3 Division 2, has the relevant provisions between ss 26 and 29. I am mindful of those statutory provisions and the fact that the legislation permits the Court in its discretion to take account of the contents of such statements.
	
	
	There are a number of decisions, however, that discuss the evidentiary status and use of victim impact statements at sentence. A decision to which I was referred in the helpful submissions of Mr Glisson was Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8, particularly at [52] - [76]. The Court of Criminal Appeal, as Simpson J pointed out, had not reached a “consensus” as to what was the value of victim impact statements. They are tendered usually without the need for cross-examination. As I understand it there was not an objection by the relevant parties to relevant victim impact statements, Mr Hancock’s, of course, only being relevant to Mr Davis. But there were concerns about matters that went beyond the scope of the facts presented by the Crown.
	
	
	As Basten JA in a case of Thomas, from 2007, pointed out it was a shame that the legislature has not helped us in this regard.
	
	
	Simpson J in 2005 in the decision of Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219, stated at [25]:
	


“Victim impact statements are a particular species of evidence available to a sentencing Judge. Special provision is made for the admissibility of victim impact statements ... a Court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after it convicts but before it sentences an offender.”


	
	Notwithstanding that by subsection (4):
	


“A Court must not consider a victim impact statement unless it has been given by or on behalf of a victim to whom it relates or by or on behalf of the prosecution.”


	
	In Thomas the decision to which I referred of Basten JA, he noted, the weight to be given to it is not necessarily clear. He said that:
	


“It will often be appropriate to give weight to a victim impact statement where the conduct of the offender is otherwise established, beyond reasonable doubt, and the statement is restricted to subsequent affects upon the victim.”


	
	I have taken the victim impact statements into account insofar as they accord with the facts upon which the prisoners are to be sentenced. It is conceded that, particularly in relation to Mr McInnes, the consequences are serious and lifelong and that is self-evident from the material available to the Court.
	
	
	With regard to other matters required to be taken into account, if I may turn to s 21A of the Act, there are no aggravating factors relevant to Mr Davis or Ms Smith other than those pleaded in the charges. I am mindful of the fact in relation to Mr Charnock he was in breach of conditional liberty, but I will say more about that, of course, when he is to be sentenced. It is a matter that could be said to distinguish him substantially from the person with whom he has a common charge, that is, Mr Davis. That means distinguishing him adversely in comparison with Mr Davis. But then again there are matters in the objective facts relating to Mr Davis that place his conduct at a more serious level than Mr Charnock. Ultimately these matters may even out.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of the maximum penalties, of course, they are relevant matters to take into account in assessing the seriousness of conduct. I particularly note, in this regard, the submissions of the Crown, I think adopted by Mr Glisson in his usual realistic fashion, as to the importance of giving weight to the extent and nature of the injuries, the seriousness of the conduct by reference to the maximum penalty. Such a case is Zang ([2004] NSWCCA 358) but there are many decisions along that line.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to the state of mind of the relevant parties as best as can be devine. I am mindful of what was said in Zamagias about the degree of harm intended in a particular case may make the absence of premeditation less significant. I have already dealt with the issues of premeditation and what was contemplated by the parties, at least, established beyond reasonable doubt or not. Although I note the particular authority identified by the learned Crown in Zamagias ([2002] NSWCCA 17) is a leading judgment by Howie J on the proper approach to imposing terms of imprisonment that are suspended.
	
	
	I have already made acknowledgement of the Crown’s submissions in relation to the role of domestic violence in acts of violence and the like. I have already commented upon matters of premeditation, planning and the lack of provocation.
	
	
	With regard to the Crown’s submissions concerning the ‘s 33’ offence (concerning Ms Smith) the Crown said it was: “aggravating factor where the offence was committed in company”.
	
	
	The conduct of Ms Smith giving rise to the count affecting her, as I said earlier, in my view is independent of the conduct of both Mr Charnock and Mr Davis. I do not believe that they were necessarily aware of, or appreciative of if I could use that expression, her involvement in the matter and I would not conclude that they were necessarily “company” with her in respect of the conduct that she pleaded guilty again. I get back to what I see as some inconsistency in the way in which the matter has been pleaded. They are said to be in company with her for an offence that has no specific intention as an element of that count and with which she is not charged. This was discussed yesterday.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating facts that arise under s 21A(3) of the Act, the mitigating factors between Mr Davis, and if I may say so Mr Charnock and Ms Smith are largely the same. There are some differences in degree.
	
	
	Firstly, I accept the offending of Ms Smith and Mr Davis was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. Neither offender had any record of previous convictions. I point out Mr Charnock did have a finding of guilt and he was an unconvicted drug supplier at the time of the commission of the offence but Ms Smith and Mr Davis had no criminal history. I am prepared to accept that both offenders were persons of good character, that the prisoners are unlikely to reoffend, that Ms Smith and Mr Davis have good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I cannot conclude that they are relevantly remorseful. They have expressed remorse for their actions and I accept that that is so. But their accounts of their involvement in this matter, particularly Ms Smith’s attempt to minimise her conduct, reflect to my mind that she has not taken full responsibility for her actions, only partial responsibility. The pleas of guilty of the two offenders are mitigating factors.
	
	
	With regard to the standard non-parole period in each case, of course, I bear in mind as s 54B(2) provides that having determined the objective seriousness of the offending, one must turn to the other matters including the mitigating factors and the strength of those mitigating factors in the sentencing process. Good character, for example, may be established, but it may have greater or lesser weight depending upon the objective facts and other factors. Here the good character of the offenders, Smith and Davis, is a matter of some significance. Their conduct is uncharacteristic.
	
	
	In effect, the legislative regime reflects what the High Court determined in the decision of Muldrock that was referred to in the written submissions of Mr Glisson and Mr Winch for Mr Charnock. Also, in assessing the non parole period, relevant is the issue of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act. In each case I have determined that there are special circumstances warranting a substantial adjustment of the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of sentence. There are many reasons for this. The fact that these are first time terms of imprisonment for the two prisoners is not of itself a special circumstance, but in my view both prisoners will need considerable professional assistance to adjust to community living, they will need direction and counselling and assistance in relation to their personal relationships. In the case of Mr Davis, anger management, albeit that this conduct is uncharacteristic. It is clear that Ms Smith has, at the moment, ongoing mental health issues to some extent. That will require professional counselling. The Pre-Sentence Reports identify a number of those matters that are crying out for attention by the Community Corrections Services.
	
	
	With regard to the discounts for the subjective cases for the two prisoners, Smith and Davis, they are very strong. Of course, a strong subjective case does not displace serious objective offending. A person convicted of murder, who has prior good character, can expect to spend a very substantial period of time in custody and good character ultimately bears little weight.
	
	
	With regard to the discounts for the pleas of guilty I was ably assisted by the learned Crown Prosecutor with some history of the matter, and this was a matter of submission from Mr Glisson and Mr Doig for Ms Smith, and Mr Winch for Mr Charnock.
	
	
	Assessing the appropriate discounts was a difficult matter. There was much common sense, if I be so bold to say so, in Mr Glisson’s submissions concerning the particular counts affecting Mr Davis and Mr Charnock. Insofar as, firstly, the matters that they pleaded to were negotiated at the time the trial was to start when the two men were facing more serious charges, the facts concerning the contribution of Mr Davis and Mr Charnock to the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Mr McInness particularly, were confused, there were statements made by eye witnesses that might have been drawn in comfort by Mr Davis particularly. The video evidence in some respects, as I have pointed out, is inconclusive or difficult to divine with accuracy. So there was, in the context of the possibility of a large number of civilian witnesses giving evidence, notwithstanding a committal for trial which I understood was a paper committal although I have not been given any information about that, a considerable period of time saved. Thus, in my view, the pleas of guilty by Mr Davis and Mr Charnock to the common charge they share had very considerable utilitarian benefit and for each of those offenders in respect of that common charge, count two for Mr Davis, the sole count relating to Mr Charnock, I am prepared to give each of them, in due course for Mr Charnock, a discount of twenty per cent.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Davis in respect of count one, I was told by the Crown very helpfully that there had been a change in counsel, who took a different approach to the original counsel. Originally there had been a suggestion of “self-defence”, which would have been easily negatived by the Crown. But my understanding is ultimately that Mr Davis pleaded guilty to the same charge to that for which he had been committed for trial. It seems to me, with respect, that Mr Davis could have pleaded guilty to his assault upon Mr Hancock at an earlier time. A claim of “provocation” is no defence. It is a matter that goes to the issue of assessing objective seriousness of offending not to whether there should be a plea not guilty. But, on the other hand, I have also borne in mind the intimate relationship of the facts relating to the assault upon Mr Hancock with the assault committed upon Mr McInness.
	
	
	I have concluded, in Mr Davis’ case, in relation to count one, that he should receive a discount of fifteen per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence. The differentiation between that and count two in his case being simply that the Crown case against him in relation to count one was far clearer notwithstanding it is obvious that he did assault Mr McInness. The reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm may have been difficult, in itself, to establish given the conduct of Ms Smith.
	
	
	With regard to Ms Smith, I bear in mind what Mr Doig, who skilfully represented her, put on her behalf. Ultimately I concluded she should receive a discount of fifteen per cent, given the saving of time, notwithstanding she pleaded guilty to the committal charge.
	
	
	The Crown’s position in relation to all offenders was that the discount should, to reflect what was said in Thomson and Houlton, be ten per cent. But, as I have pointed out. there are a large number of other considerations here. There were negotiations that led to a change in the initial indictment. There were question marks, that may be said on the video evidence at least, as to specifically who did what to whom, particularly in the case of Mr Davis and Mr Charnock. I am putting aside the situation of Mr Hancock for the moment.
	
	
	In the case of Ms Smith, of course, what she did was clear. She still seems to be, as I have pointed out, in denial as to the reality of what she did. I hope when she has watched the video she reflected upon what was clear for all to see. But, on the other hand, she was also charged with another matter in relation to Mr Hancock. There are tactical considerations that sometimes arise as to the timing of a plea of guilty. It may not be seen to be appropriate to plead to one matter but strongly or strenuously defend another and the like. I have concluded that she should receive a discount of fifteen per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence.
	
	
	With regard to the sentencing of Mr Davis, I have had regard to the issue of totality of criminality. Because I am sentencing him for two offences that are inter-related. The two offences taken together increase the totality of the criminality, there is no doubt about that. But the accumulation, in my view, should be a partial one in the manner I will outline in a moment.
	
	
	In Mill v R [1988] 166CLR 59, particularly at 62 to 65 of the judgment, the Full Bench then sitting in that judgment, led by Wilson J in that case, reflected upon the principle of totality. Specifically, at page 63, the Court noted that:
	


“The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer, who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is ‘just and appropriate’”.


	
	There are other observations made including adoption of the English proposition:
	


“At the end of the day as one always must, one looks at the totality and asks whether it is too much?”


	
	We do not have Texan sentencing in Australia. We do not impose upon people consecutive life sentences where life sentences are appropriate. The totality principle recognises the ultimate or inevitable compression of sentences that may be appropriate for individual cases. There is the decision of the High Court in Pearce v R ((1998) 194 CLR 610), particularly at [45], where the majority of the High Court dealing with a conviction appeal in its obiter remarks, but taken up in many other decisions by the Court of Criminal Appeal since (such as Hammound from 2002) reflected upon the need in determining sentences for offences to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then turn to the issue of totality of criminality as discussed in cases like Mill and the like.
	
	
	With regard to the psychological evidence relating to Ms Smith, I have had regard to the decision of DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, particularly what was said by McClelland CJ at CL at [177] - [178]. I am very mindful of the fact that there is a proven causal connection, even for a minor mental illness or disability, that can impact upon sentence in a range of way diminishing perhaps the need for general deterrence or it may require, as was held in Engert, a greater emphasis to be put on general deterrence. The circumstances of a person’s time in custody will need to be taken account. I have not been able to find any causal connection. Mr Doig did not particularly address me on this matter in direct terms. I am mindful of the fact that there was an emotional element in all of this contributing to the offending. But not such of a character to be described as a mental illness or a mental disability, bearing in mind, as I said, that part of the retrospective analysis of the psychologist is based upon the reliability of the prisoners history. That is shown to be, in material respects, unreliable.
	
	
	With regard to Ms Smith, there is a matter on a Form 1. I bear in mind the guideline judgment, Attorney-General’s Application No 1 of 2002 [2002] 56 NSWLR 147, particularly the various observations as I understand it of the then Chief Justice, Chief Justice Spigelman at [18] - [44].
	
	
	In this matter, the matter on the Form One is a minor matter. It is a matter involving the pulling, or brushing, or pushing of somebody in circumstances entirely, in my view, incidental to the primary offence. It is an offence of assault, in any event, that can be dealt with summarily.
	
	
	Of course, it is correct that matters on a Form One may require a Court to impose a longer sentence or alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. It is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial as anyone in the criminal law knows. If you are sentencing someone for an armed robbery and you have to take four armed robberies into account on a Form One, then the sentencing for the principal offence will involve a somewhat different dimension and a much greater sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	This is not that case. I have taken into account all that the Court of Criminal Appeal said about that matter. It is not a matter that, in my view, substantially alters the sentence for the principal offence.
	
	
	With regard to both offenders, Mr Davis particularly, but to some extent to Ms Smith, I am mindful of those remarks of the South Australian Full Court in Yardley v Betts [1979] 22 SASR 108 at 112-3 where the then learned Chief Justice King made observations that have been approved on number cases, particularly R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 (at [44]) in these terms:
	


“The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others that have no developed settled criminal habits.

If a sentence had the affect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an order(sic) to avoid offending in the future the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists only for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm.”


	
	As I said, I have had close regard to the various submissions of the parties, I have perhaps not done justice, particularly, to the diligence of Mr Glisson. But the various issues that he has identified I have taken into account and either expressed or implicitly referred to.
	
	
	Likewise Mr Doig’s skilful oral submissions, on behalf of his client, were limited to particular areas. I believe all the issues that he raised as well as the Crown raising with me have been taken into account.
	
	
	The Crown’s ultimate position is that full-time custodial sentences must be imposed. Clearly that is so in this case. Again, within the community, there is no acceptance to be had of people attacking other people, wherever that may be, whatever the personal grudge may be, and one must always bear in mind, although one can never compensate it nor properly measure it, the catastrophic affect that the combined conduct of the prisoners ultimately had had upon particularly Mr McInness.
	
	
	I am not, in any way, denigrating the serious bodily harm suffered by Mr Hancock. I appreciate, in making that comment, of course, as I have acknowledged, there were different contributions one to the other. Whilst the prisoner, Mr Davis, is not to my mind personally responsible for the conduct of Ms Smith, the truth of the matter is if Mr Davis had not bothered to go around that bar and attack Mr Hancock and then lay into Mr McInness then I do not believe Ms Smith would be before today. If Mr Davis had not got involved, Mr Charnock would not have got involved. But then again Mr Charnock, although I am not sentencing him today, had an opportunity not to get involved but chose to get involved. Their respective involvements led ultimately to the circumstance where Mr McInness was lying on the floor and Ms Smith had the opportunity to kick him in the way in which he did. Thus, we have this time been taken up at community expense to try and render some form of justice both to the prisoners, both to the victims and to the community which is a very difficult task. Particularly in circumstances where one is dealing with people who have acted uncharacteristically and are being sentenced to terms of imprisonment for very serious offending. That does not seem to reflect the manner in which they have conducted their lives in the past and probably does not reflect the way in which they will conduct their lives in the future.
	
	
	Mr Davis could you stand up, please? It has taken me a long time, as you know. It has taken two hours, I did not expect it to take that long, but there is a lot of material to cover. One of the things you should understand, as with Ms Davis, is that the Parole Authority reads my remarks on sentence and if I do not try to address all the material and the legal issues in front of me then the Parole Authority does not have really anything to work upon when they finally make the determine one way or the other as to whether you should be released to parole.
	
	
	In relation to count one, the charge, if I might call it, of ‘reckless wounding’, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non-parole period of one year. That will commence from today, 10 June 2016 and expire on 9 June 2017. The balance of the sentence, with the discount I have calculated, will be one year six months. That will expire on the 20 January 2019, the total period of imprisonment is two years six months. I have made a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	In relation to count two, you are convicted. This is the ‘recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm’ in-company count. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of one year to commence on 10 June 2017 and to expire on 9 June 2018. The balance of the sentence will be two years and two months and that will expire on 9 August 2020. The total sentence of imprisonment is three years two months. I find ‘special circumstances’. You will be eligible for release to parole on 19 June 2018. Thank you, you can take a seat.
	
	
	I cannot direct that you be released to parole. That will be a matter for the Parole Authority.
	
	
	Ms Smith, could you stand up, please? In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty, taking into account the matter on the Form One, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non-parole period of two years one month. That will commence on 10 June 2016 and expire on 9 July 2018. The balance of the sentence will be two years and two months. That will expire on 9 September 2020. The total sentence of imprisonment is four years and three months. I make a finding of ‘special circumstances’. You will be eligible for release to parole on 9 July 2018. You can take a seat.
	
	
	Again, in your case, it will be a matter for the Parole Authority as to whether you are released to parole at the expiry of your non-parole period. That will depend upon your behaviour and the like. The Parole Authority will have regard, I hope, to my remarks on sentence.
	
	
	With regard to both of you, all the backup charges on the s 166 certificates are withdrawn and dismissed and, of course, there are the orders I make. You have rights of appeal, the Crown has rights of appeal. It may not be the final orders made by the Court.
	
	
	Now, Mr Crown, are there any technical matters from you?
	
	
	CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I didn’t get your appearance, I am apologise.
	
	
	SHARMAN: If the Court pleases, Sharman.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: How are you sir? Nice to meet you, you are appearing on behalf of Mr Davis is that correct?
	
	
	SHARMAN: Yes, your Honour, could I just ask you to, for the benefit of my note, the commencement date for the sentence in relation to the reckless infliction and the grievous bodily harm?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, in-company?
	
	
	SHARMAN: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The second sentence is to commence on the 10 June 2017.
	
	
	SHARMAN: The Court, pleases, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It is accumulative to the extent of one year upon the sentence I imposed in relation to the assault upon Mr Hancock.
	
	
	SHARMAN: That is what I took it to be--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: And it is accumulative on the non-parole period I fixed in relation to the sentence I imposed on Mr Hancock.
	
	
	SHARMAN: Yes, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: So the total sentence is just in excess of four years, with a non parole period and in your client’s case two years.
	
	
	SHARMAN: Yes, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I must say I did not specifically mention this before, except in passing. Although they are charged with different offences, one of the issues in this general sentencing exercise is an issue of parity, to some extent, albeit that Ms Smith is charged with separate offending and a separate offence with a greater maximum penalty. Of course, parity will involve, in the context of Mr Charnock, consideration of a maxim that “alike shall be treated alike and the unalike shall be treated unalike to the extent of their un-alikeness” in accordance with what are called Aristotlean principles of “equal justice”, or equality, as discussed by Rothman J, in a case of Jimmy from 2010.
	
	
	Is there anything else from you sir? Now, Mr Doig anything else from you?
	
	
	DOIG: No.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you very much for your attendance. You are excused. Ms Smith you will have to go with the custodial officers, as will you, Mr Davis and you Mr Charnock. You know the story.
	
	
	I am pleased that you sat through that. Not because I am pleased you had to sit there for two hours, I am not pleased that it takes so long to go through all the matters I need to. But it was important that you heard what I had to say, because many of the comments I made concern you as well and I am not going to repeat them the next time. I will focus entirely upon the matters that concern you in the context of the way I have resolved the matter as best I can, in the time available to me,.
	
	
	The practical problem that I raise with your counsel becomes more focused. I think he now will appreciate the issue that I am concerned with so you are concerned, thank you, Mr Charnock. You will have to go, thank you.
	
	
	Mr Charnock, don’t leave us I am sorry, I apologise, I have to fix a date for you. What is that going to be - do you know when we can get English Js - sit down, Mr Charnock? When are we going to get English Js remarks
	
	
	WINCH: We are just making some attempts I do not know how long it is going to take, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: They might even turn up this afternoon. I mean, I have not endeavoured to track them down but we need to fix a date. Assuming that her Honour has revised them--
	
	
	DISCUSSION AS TO SUITABLE DATES
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I will put the matter in for mention at 9.30am and I direct a s 77 order and I will hear the matter at some point when I am available during that day if that is convenient. Is that suitable to you, Mr Crown?
	
	
	CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 15 July 2016?
	
	
	CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: All I need is the remarks in relation to Mr Charnock, if there are other submissions to be made. I have raised the problem and the real problem is now in sharper focus in light of my orders. I am simply saying that I will do the best that I can on the 15th if we have got the judgment. That is all I can do with what I have got.
	
	
	You are excused, Mr Doig, thank you very much for your assistance, thank you.

		12 July 2016",2016-06-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769670,Tieu v R [2016] NSWCCA 111,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: In March 2014 the applicant, Andrew Tieu, pleaded not guilty before a jury on an indictment with five counts. Three counts involved robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely, a shotgun; two counts involved attempted robbery while armed with the same weapon. Two of the charges occurred on 10 May 2012 and three on 11 May 2012.
	
	
	As the prosecutor explained to the jury, the prosecution case was not that the applicant was alone, nor that he entered any of the premises. Rather, he was said to be the getaway driver. The person who physically entered, or attempted to enter the premises (in one case he was unsuccessful), was one Christopher Hibbard. Mr Hibbard gave evidence for the prosecution which implicated the applicant in each of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant was convicted by the jury and was, in due course, sentenced to a total term of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his convictions. He needs leave for two reasons: first, the sole ground pursued on the appeal did not involve a question of law alone, for the purposes of s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and, secondly, the points identified in that ground were not taken by counsel at trial, thus engaging r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	
	
	For reasons which will be explained below, this case provided a paradigm for the operation of r 4: the trial might have been run in a different way if objection had been taken in a timely fashion, but without any clear basis for supposing that there might have been a different result. Further, the failure to take the objection was not due to some misunderstanding or oversight on the part of counsel for the accused, but rather was an accepted consequence of the strategy adopted in the face of the incriminating evidence of the co-offender. Overall, the Court should not be satisfied that, even had objection been taken, the result involved a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, for the reasons explained below, leave to appeal should be refused in respect of the sole ground pursued on the appeal.
	


Proposed ground of appeal


	
	The sole ground pursued at the hearing of the proposed appeal was that the trial had miscarried because the prosecutor embarked on cross-examination of the applicant on his criminal record, in the absence of leave granted by the trial judge. What in fact happened was that the prosecutor had foreshadowed his proposed course, but had actually embarked upon it (without objection) prior to the judge granting leave. The matter was sought to be rectified following the next adjournment and the judge delivered an interlocutory ruling. Although the challenge was said not to extend to the matters considered in those reasons, they were criticised in oral submissions and it will be necessary to refer to them to provide a complete picture.
	


Outline of prosecution case


	
	The prosecution case, based largely on the evidence of Mr Hibbard, was that he, Hibbard, and the applicant were both users of methylamphetamine (“ice”). They had an earlier acquaintance, but had re-established contact in early 2012. The applicant was not only a user, but a supplier of the drug. He was also a gambler.
	
	
	When Hibbard and the applicant first met in 2012, Hibbard was carrying out armed robberies with the assistance of another man, Daljit (variously spelt in the evidence) Singh, as driver. The applicant told Hibbard that he would like to participate in robberies and would use his car. According to Hibbard, it was the applicant who suggested that they rob Charlie Chan’s Bar in Haymarket, which was open early in the morning. On 10 May 2012 the applicant and a cousin, Randy Tran, drove Hibbard to the bar. Hibbard entered the bar at about 5.50am, wearing a scarf over his face and a hoodie over his head and armed with a shotgun. Although he approached at least two persons seeking money, his demands were unsuccessful and he eventually fled. These events constituted count 1, involving a charge of attempted armed robbery.
	
	
	Early on the afternoon of the same day, at about 12pm, the applicant drove Tran and Hibbard to the Lansvale United Sports Club. Hibbard entered the club alone, carrying the shotgun. Hibbard demanded money from an employee behind the bar and was given an amount of $2,000. He then ran from the club and got into the car driven by the applicant. That activity was the subject of count 2.
	
	
	According to Hibbard, the shotgun which he had taken on the first two robberies was not in working condition, nor did he have cartridges. Before committing the robberies on the evening of 11 May, Hibbard said that he had obtained parts to complete the shotgun and had also been given a cartridge by the applicant.
	
	
	The next three counts all occurred within two hours on the evening of the following day, 11 May 2012. Tran did not accompany the others on these occasions.
	
	
	At about 7.50pm on Friday evening, 11 May 2012, Hibbard entered the bar of the Villawood Hotel and demanded money from an employee working behind the bar. She handed him the money in the till, which was a little under $400 and, as was shown on the CCTV footage, removed the drawer from the gaming till to show him that only change was left. Mr Hibbard took the money, ran out and was driven away by the applicant. Those events constituted the armed robbery the subject of count 3.
	
	
	The pair then drove to the Golf View Hotel at Guildford, which was about 10 minutes’ drive away. However, the hotel staff had been warned and the front door was locked. Hibbard approached the door and rattled it, but realising that it was locked returned to the car and the applicant drove away. That constituted the charge of attempted armed robbery, the subject of count 4.
	
	
	Approximately an hour later, at about 9.45pm on the same evening, Hibbard entered the Chester Hill Bowling Club, wearing a black balaclava and carrying the shotgun. He approached the bar attendant and told him that it was “a real gun” opening it to show a cartridge in the chamber.
	
	
	In the course of the robbery an amount of cash was handed over which was later discovered in the centre console of the applicant’s car, being a bundle of $10 and $5 notes totalling $505. As Hibbard was trying to leave the club, he was tackled by patrons and a struggle ensued in the course of which the shotgun discharged. Hibbard then ran out of the back door and again entered the car driven by the applicant. The armed robbery was the subject of count 5 on the indictment.
	
	
	The police were alerted in the course of, or shortly after, the robbery and were given the registration number of the Toyota Cressida driven by the applicant. When the applicant realised that he was being followed, he tried to outrun the police car, crossing the median strip of Fairfield Street, Fairfield, and eventually, apparently when trying to cross back, crashed into a traffic light pole. Hibbard and the applicant both fled from the car, but were quickly captured. Hibbard had thrown away the shotgun in the course of his flight, but that too was recovered.
	
	
	Hibbard was spoken to by police on Saturday, 12 May 2012 and again on 16 May at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre. On the same day, the police obtained a warrant and searched a unit in Fairfield where the applicant lived.
	


Case for the accused at trial


	
	To a significant extent, the applicant’s case at trial confirmed the account given by Hibbard. Thus he agreed that he used ice, and sold drugs, the sales providing the income to support his own drug use and gambling.
	
	
	He also agreed that he had met Hibbard in about 2010, having a common interest as both were users of ice, as was his cousin, Randy Tran.
	
	
	The appellant confirmed that he had re-established contact with Hibbard in late April or early May 2012, at which time he claimed that Hibbard had told him that he (Hibbard) worked for a trucking company and did debt collection work.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he had been kidnapped in late February or early March 2012 and held captive for about two weeks, as a result of an alleged drug debt. When he was released an acquaintance gave him a rifle for protection, which was found on the wall of his unit when the police searched the unit on 16 May 2012. The Toyota Cressida which he agreed he had driven on 11 May was not registered in his name but he said had been given to him by a friend in payment of a drug debt, although he also denied sole ownership, saying it was “like a community car” [1]  which he lent to a lot of people. In particular, he said that he lent the car to Hibbard on 9 May 2012, it being returned in the afternoon or early evening of 10 May. That evidence constituted a denial of any involvement in the activities the subject of the first two counts in the early hours of 10 May and at about midday on 10 May.
	
	
	The applicant gave an account of his movements on 9, 10 and 11 May. Much of the activity involved collecting and supplying drugs. He explained a variety of text messages between himself and Hibbard in the early afternoon of 11 May as involving arrangements to meet. When they did meet, he said that Hibbard asked him to drive him to see a mate and that he believed it was part of Hibbard’s debt collection business. He said that Hibbard offered to pay him a “commission” and a couple of hundred dollars for the loan of the car on the previous day. [2]  In relation to the first two incidents on the evening of 11 May, the applicant gave an account of driving Hibbard at the latter’s direction and picking him up, on each occasion without seeing Hibbard wearing any covering over his face and without seeing the shotgun.
	
	
	With respect to the third incident, at the Chester Hill Bowling Club, he said that Hibbard told him to drop him (Hibbard) off and, if he were not back in 10-15 minutes, to leave without him. As he was about to drive off, he heard a shout and turned the car around to pick Hibbard up. He said that Hibbard appeared to be injured and was carrying the shotgun. That was the first occasion on which he claimed to have seen the shotgun; Hibbard told him to “drive”. [3]  The applicant said that he saw a police car following him and proposed to pull over to allow the police to pass, at which point Hibbard pointed the gun to his head and told him to keep driving. He said that he panicked, accelerated and swerved across the median strip into oncoming traffic and crashed into a set of traffic lights. He said that he then got out and ran because he had drugs in the car and also because he wanted to get away from Hibbard. [4] 
	


Challenge to cross-examination as to credit: statutory scheme


	
	It was apparent from the jury’s verdict that they were satisfied that (a) the applicant was the driver of the car on both days; (b) he was fully aware of the purpose of the visits to particular places and (c) knew that Hibbard was carrying a shotgun. In broad terms, the jury must have believed Hibbard’s account and disbelieved the applicant. There is no doubt that the credibility of each was in issue at the trial.
	
	
	Questions of credibility can be raised in various ways. Indeed, the term “credibility” can cover a range of different matters. Where there is a disputed fact of which a witness gives evidence, the other party will usually suggest in cross-examination (and indeed may have to do so to comply with Browne v Dunn [5] ) that his or her account is the true account, not that of the witness. That will involve a direct challenge to the evidence of the witness, which may, directly or by inference, suggest unreliable perception, forgetfulness, or even fabrication.
	
	
	Further, a witness may volunteer evidence which is discreditable. For example, in the present case, both the applicant and Hibbard proffered accounts of their mutual involvement in the use of ice; Hibbard agreed that he had been involved in armed robberies and the applicant accepted that he was a supplier of illegal drugs and specifically ice. Hibbard was cross-examined at length about his illegal activities, at least in part to persuade the jury he should not be believed when he implicated the applicant.
	


(a)   Evidence Act, Pt 3.7


	
	There are detailed provisions in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) protecting an accused person who gives evidence from cross-examination as to credit. So far as relevant to the circumstances outlined above, they need to be addressed.
	
	
	In the Evidence Act the term “credibility” of a witness is defined to mean “the credibility of any part or all of the evidence of the witness, and includes the witness’s ability to observe or remember facts and events about which the witness has given, is giving or is to give evidence.” [6]  (It is not necessary to explore the vexed topic of the extent to which the definition covers the reliability of the evidence.) The term “credibility evidence” is defined (in s 101A) primarily as evidence that “is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness”. (The second limb of s 101A may be disregarded as it was not relied on in the present case.) In s 103(1), the Act speaks of evidence which “could” affect the assessment of credibility or (in ss 103 and 104) “tends to prove” [7]  untruthfulness. In assessing admissibility it may be assumed that it is the capacity of the evidence which is addressed by s 101A.
	
	
	Evidence is not irrelevant “only because it relates only to… the credibility of a witness”. [8]  However, it will not be relevant unless it could, at least indirectly, affect the assessment of a fact in issue. [9]  While credibility evidence may be relevant in this sense, that is not the sense in which “relevant” is used in s 101A.
	
	
	The Act then provides (s 102) a “credibility rule”, namely that “credibility evidence about a witness is not admissible.” The use of the connector “about” is awkward here, as it is in other contexts. [10]  As is clear from a number of exceptions to the rule, the prohibition on admissibility covers both evidence which is led, or sought to be led, from another witness and cross-examination of the witness whose credibility is in issue. Thus, s 103 provides:
	


103   Exception: cross-examination as to credibility

(1)   The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.

(2)   Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:

(a)   whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and

(b)   the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.


	
	The rule is awkwardly formulated with respect to cross-examination, because it is the answer which is the “evidence” and until the answer is known, one can only speculate as to whether it will affect the assessment by the jury of the credibility of the witness. Further, in some cases the question will cause more prejudice than the answer. There are aspects of the exceptions which could have been more comfortably located in Chapter 2 – “Adducing evidence”.
	
	
	Broadly speaking, cross-examination has two purposes, namely to elicit evidence favourable to the cross-examiner’s case and to undermine the credibility of evidence adverse to the cross-examiner’s case. Questioning directed to the latter exercise will fall within the credibility rule, if it is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness. There is an exception with respect to “evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness” if the evidence “could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.” [11]  Again, the wording is awkward: the apparent intention of ss 101 and 103 is to exclude questions as to discreditable conduct which would not have a substantial effect on the credibility of the witness in giving evidence as to the matter in issue. However, they are not expressly limited in that way and could be engaged by cross-examination which seeks to undermine aspects of the testimony as to matters in issue. [12] 
	
	
	Thus, to fall outside the prohibition on credibility evidence generally, the cross-examination must be such as could “substantially affect” the assessment of the credibility of the applicant. It is not necessary to explore the precise scope of s 103: the argument in the present case focused on the operation of s 104, which is concerned specifically with cross-examination of an accused in criminal proceedings.
	


104   Further protections: cross-examination as to credibility

(1)   This section applies only to credibility evidence in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section 103.

(2)   A defendant must not be cross-examined about a matter that is relevant to the assessment of the defendant’s credibility, unless the court gives leave.

(3)   Despite subsection (2), leave is not required for cross-examination by the prosecutor about whether the defendant:

(a)   is biased or has a motive to be untruthful, or

(b)   is, or was, unable to be aware of or recall matters to which his or her evidence relates, or

(c)   has made a prior inconsistent statement.

(4)   Leave must not be given for cross-examination by the prosecutor under subsection (2) unless evidence adduced by the defendant has been admitted that:

(a)   tends to prove that a witness called by the prosecutor has a tendency to be untruthful, and

(b)   is relevant solely or mainly to the witness’s credibility.

(5)   A reference in subsection (4) to evidence does not include a reference to evidence of conduct in relation to:

(a)   the events in relation to which the defendant is being prosecuted, or

(b)   the investigation of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted.


	
	The operation of this provision is by no means self-evident at first glance. The credibility rule, in its application to cross-examination, based on a combination of ss 102 and 103(1), allows credibility evidence if it could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness. That meant, as occurred in the present case, that Hibbard could be cross-examined (and was cross-examined without objection) as to his criminal record. Cross-examination of an accused, without leave, is limited to those situations identified in s 104(3). A person accused of a serious crime of which he or she is guilty, will always have a motive to be untruthful. However, the prosecution is entitled to put its case to an accused in order to establish that the accused is guilty and thus has a motive to be untruthful: such questions would go to the ultimate issue and would not be relevant only to the assessment of the accused’s credibility. Arguably, they would therefore be relevant to an issue, not inadmissible and, accordingly, not within the definition of “credibility evidence” in s 101A. Section 104 applies only to credibility evidence in a criminal proceeding. [13]  The provision may be directed in any event to extraneous motives, but it is not necessary to explore further the operation of s 104(3), it not being contended that leave was not required. In particular it is not necessary to consider the scope of s 104(3)(a) about which there has been remarkably little written.
	
	
	Once it was accepted that leave was required, it was necessary for the prosecutor to fall outside the prohibition on the grant of leave under s 104(4), on the basis that each limb of the exception was engaged. The prosecutor contended that the accused had cross-examined a prosecution witness (Mr Hibbard) to establish his tendency to be untruthful and which was relevant to his credibility in giving evidence against the applicant. Thus, it was submitted, both pars (a) and (b) of s 104(4) were satisfied. The evidence in question did not fall within the exclusion to the exception in s 104(5).
	
	
	The applicant challenged both this analysis of what occurred and the failure of the trial judge to deal with the “gateway” issue, before addressing the discretionary power to grant leave.
	
	
	There are other considerations which operate with respect to a grant of leave. Section 192(2) prescribes certain matters which are to be taken into account in determining whether to give leave, in terms which are non-exclusive. They include unfairness to a party or to a witness. [14]  To similar effect, the court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to a party (s 135) and, in a criminal case, must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused (s 137).
	


(b)   whether consideration of s 137 mandatory


	
	There was a general assumption made in the present proceedings that ss 135 and 137 applied once it was concluded that the discretionary power to allow cross-examination of the applicant was engaged. The issue was potentially significant as, in a manner which will be further explained shortly, counsel for the applicant did not address the judge on factors relating to prejudice which might have raised an issue as to how the balancing process was to be addressed. However, in submissions directed to the ground which was abandoned at the hearing, the prosecutor submitted that, “[s]ubject to the overriding obligation to ensure a fair trial according to law, there is no obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence of his or her own motion where no objection is taken and the accused is legally represented”. [15] 
	
	
	There is, as the prosecutor rightly noted, a significant line of authority in this Court for the proposition that s 137, although in mandatory terms, need not be considered in relation to particular evidence unless objection has been taken. That approach was clearly and deliberately articulated in FDP. [16]  The contrary view had been taken a few months earlier in Steve v R, [17]  based on a statement by Heydon JA in R v Le at [90]. However, Heydon JA’s statement that “[i]ndependently of whether the parties raise the question, account must always be taken of s 192 and, in criminal cases, of s 137” was made in the context of an exercise by the trial judge of a discretionary power to allow the prosecutor to question a prosecution witness in relation to an earlier statement, pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act. The reasoning in Le was based in part on the mandatory language of s 137 and further, on the express terms of s 190 providing that the court may, if the parties consent, dispense with the application of various provisions of the Act, the identified provisions not including ss 192 and 137.
	
	
	In Penza and Di Maria v Regina, [18]  Hoeben JA noted “a difference of opinion” as to whether the provisions of s 137 are “mandatory” so that a trial judge “has an obligation not to admit evidence coming within the section, even though no objection was taken to that evidence at trial.” [19]  Hoeben JA sought to address that issue because in Chand v R [20]  he had upheld a ground based on s 137 even though no objection had been taken to the evidence at trial. Having read FDP, he recanted, accepting the correctness of the reasoning in FDP and stating that “on this issue, Le and Steve should not be followed.” [21]  However, rejection of the reasoning in Steve, with respect to the application of s 137 where no objection is taken to the evidence, does not necessarily undermine the reasoning in Le, which concerned the application of a discretionary power.
	
	
	As noted by Macfarlan JA in Poniris v R, [22]  both Campbell J and Button J in Penza expressly reserved their opinions with respect to s 137, the point not requiring resolution and the Court not having had the benefit of full argument. What was not noted, however, was that Le did not involve a “no objection” issue, but rather the acknowledged requirement for the exercise of a discretionary power. As noted above, the rejection of the reasoning in Steve did not require the rejection of Le. Nor did the reasoning in FDP require the conclusion that Le should not be followed.
	
	
	Poniris was a different case again: there the appellant had objected to the evidence on the ground of relevance but had not expressly (nor, it was said, implicitly) invoked the balancing exercise required under s 137. He nevertheless contended that the trial judge had erred in failing to undertake that exercise. In Poniris the Court held [23]  that although objection had been taken, but on a basis other than s 137, the reasoning in FDP was “equally applicable” and “arguably an a fortiori case because it is clear in such a situation that defence counsel … has turned his or her mind to the admissibility of the evidence and, it can be inferred, has decided to confine the objection to one of relevance.”
	
	
	Given that an objection based on relevance is unlikely to be raised if the evidence is not seen to have a potential for prejudice, and because relevance requires reference to how the evidence may rationally affect an issue and thus have probative value, the idea that such an objection is subject to an implicit limitation may not be available in all cases. The relevance of Poniris in the present case is that although there was clearly an issue as to whether the discretionary power to allow cross-examination of the applicant should be exercised, there were no submissions put in terms of s 137 considerations as to why it should not. Nevertheless, the reasoning in Le not having been addressed and departed from in any of the cases in this Court, it should be followed. Accordingly, and subject to two further considerations, the trial judge was obliged to consider whether the probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice [24]  and the extent to which a grant of leave would be unfair to the accused. [25] 
	
	
	The two qualifications are as follows, namely (a) a failure to object imposes on the applicant a requirement to obtain leave of the court to raise the issue as a ground of appeal, and (b) it is necessary to consider whether s 137 was engaged, according to its terms.
	
	
	The need to apply r 4 was not in doubt on the appeal: its application will be addressed below. Similarly, the operation of s 137 was not raised either at trial or on appeal and, because the trial judge in fact undoubtedly had regard to it, it is not necessary to consider whether it was engaged. Nevertheless, it is convenient to note the reason why it may not have been. Section 137 requires a balancing between the “probative value” of the proffered evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice. The phrase “probative value” is defined to mean “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” [26]  This definition uses the language of s 55, relating to the concept of “relevant evidence”, without expressly adverting to the effect being either direct or indirect. While, in a literal sense, these provisions can apply to credibility evidence, s 101A draws a clear distinction between credibility evidence which is relevant “only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness” and evidence which is otherwise relevant to a fact in issue, such as a recounting of the perceptions of the witness of a particular event. The reason for thinking that s 137 may not operate with respect to credibility evidence is that it raises a different issue, namely the “probative value” of the evidence, rather than an assessment of the credibility of the witness. The credibility of the witness is not a fact in issue; the witness may have low credibility, but there may be reasons for thinking that the evidence adduced from the witness as to facts in issue is entirely credible. This distinction is implicit in the exception to the credibility rule (namely that credibility evidence is not admissible) in s 103(1) which asks, not whether the evidence has probative value, but whether the evidence “could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.”
	
	
	Prior to 1 January 2009, s 103(1) stated that the credibility rule did not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination “if the evidence has substantial probative value.” An amendment operating from 1 January 2009 reflects a point raised by Hunt CJ at CL in Regina v RPS. [27] 
	


“S[ection] 103 of the Evidence Act limits cross-examination as to credit to adducing evidence which has ‘substantial probative value’. The ‘probative value’ of evidence is defined in the s 3 Dictionary as meaning ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’, but both the context in which that phrase appears and the subject matter of s 103 indicate that that definition does not apply. [28]  That is made clear by the terms of subs (2), which demonstrate that the evidence must have probative value in relation to the credit of the witness. Evidence adduced in cross-examination must therefore have substantial probative value in the sense that it could rationally affect the assessment of the credit of the witness. Such an interpretation accords with the intention of the Law Reform Commission. [29] ”


	
	The amendment made by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (NSW) adopted the language of Hunt CJ at CL in RPS. [30] 
	
	
	The specific amendment gives support for the proposition that there are two different exercises (weighing the probative value of the evidence and weighing the credibility of the witness), thus casting doubt upon the application of ss 135 and 137 in the exercise of the discretionary power granted by s 104(2). The point was not, however, addressed in argument and it is not necessary to reach a final view as to the operation of these provisions.
	


The course of the trial


	
	The trial required careful navigation of a number of issues. First, in relation to Mr Hibbard, there was the fact that he was giving evidence for the prosecution, having obtained a discount on his sentence, both for past and future assistance to law enforcement authorities. That fact was addressed in a conventional manner and there is no issue arising from it. Secondly, there was the relationship between Hibbard and the applicant, which centred upon both being ice users and the applicant being a supplier. Thirdly, Hibbard was involved in armed robberies which were not the subject of the proceedings against the applicant. Fourthly, Hibbard had convictions for offences unrelated to the armed robberies. Each of these matters was the subject of cross-examination by counsel for the applicant.
	
	
	There were matters relating to the applicant which constituted circumstantial evidence relevant to his involvement with the alleged offending. Various items were located and photographed when the applicant’s premises were searched. These included a rifle, exposed on the wall of the premises, the existence of which was used in cross-examination of Hibbard. Although there was a separate ground in the notice of appeal (ground 2) relating to evidence about the rifle, that ground was abandoned.
	
	
	Most of the other material involved a wallet belonging to Hibbard and the applicant’s own wallet and its contents. Photographs of various items were tendered; in addition two driver’s licences, two “rewards cards” and a membership card for Canley Heights RSL and Sporting Club were also tendered.
	
	
	After the prosecutor opened to the jury, counsel for the applicant outlined briefly the nature of the defence. Amongst other things she said:
	


“Christopher Hibbard is an armed robber, Christopher Hibbard got a big discount for pleading guilty, telling the police who he said was involved and also he gets another discount for coming along to court and giving evidence. He’s already given some evidence against another person called Daljit Singh and he’s going to give evidence against my client Andrew Tieu.

Now what I would ask you respectfully to do is to look at Christopher Hibbard, listen to what he says, [watch him?] because body language is important and, and the issue is, as my friend Mr Crown has quite fairly put to you, can you trust an armed robber because you will hear very soon that this man did 14 armed robberies, this is 14 armed robberies with a shotgun and you will hear at the end that a shotgun actually gets discharged at the end, he’s the one going in doing this. So this is a man who has done 14 armed robberies ….” [31] 


	
	Counsel also identified the relationship between the applicant and Hibbard as one of “ice, they did ice together”. [32]  She summarised the defence as being that the applicant “wasn’t in the car for the first day but he says whilst he was in the car on the second day he did not have an agreement with Christopher Hibbard and he did not know he was doing armed robberies.” [33] 
	
	
	Mr Hibbard was called by the prosecutor. Mr Hibbard gave evidence in chief that he had done other armed robberies, involving Mr Singh. It was led in chief because it formed part of the matters for which he was sentenced and received a discount for the plea of guilty. He said that he got the shotgun from Singh. [34] 
	
	
	At the completion of his evidence in chief, there was a discussion as to what the jury should be told with respect to the details of the sentence and the discount; rather than have that material extracted from Hibbard, possibly incompletely, the judge gave a summary to the jury. Cross-examination then commenced. It continued over more than 160 pages of transcript. Many questions were asked on topics which went beyond his direct involvement with the five offences identified in the indictment, covering the two day period in May 2007 and involving the applicant. He agreed that he and Singh had smoked ice at their workplace; [35]  he was taken through details of robberies he did with Singh, [36]  which included showing in court CCTV footage of the robberies occurring; he was asked about details of his recruitment of another fellow worker to be involved with armed robberies, [37]  further detail of the robberies involving Singh, [38]  and detail, perhaps curiously, as to his belief that Singh was ripping him off and he was sick of working with him. [39] 
	
	
	Mr Hibbard was also cross-examined as to a statement that he never took money from “people”, meaning from individuals rather than from clubs and companies. It was put to him that he had taken money from people in the past and that he had been sentenced for “larceny type matters”. [40]  He was asked if he had had “a larceny matter” at Penrith District Court in 2002 and received a s 9 bond for three years, with which he agreed. [41]  It was also put to him that he had a charge of “enter building with intent to commit indictable offence” in 2002, a break and enter in September 2003 and a larceny in 2008. [42]  He was asked if he maintained the position that he had never hurt anybody in any of his crimes and replied, “I did once, but not in the armed robberies.” [43]  He was asked if that was an offence in 2010 of “assault occasioning” against his wife. He agreed. [44] 
	
	
	In going through various telephone records, he was asked if he was “internet browsing”, to which he said “Ok” and was asked further “What are you looking at?” to which he answered “probably porn or something I don’t know”, which counsel pressed asking “Pornography?” to which he said “Yeah probably.”
	
	
	In the course of cross-examining on the telephone records, counsel obtained agreement that he was purchasing drugs from a dealer other than Tieu. [45] 
	
	
	To return to the operation of s 104, the prohibition on the grant of leave to cross-examine an accused is lifted where the accused has adduced evidence (including by cross-examination) tending to prove that a prosecution witness “has a tendency to be untruthful”, and the evidence is relevant “solely or mainly to the witness’s credibility.” However, such evidence is not to include evidence of conduct in relation to events for which the accused is being prosecuted, or in relation to “the investigation of the offence for which the accused is being prosecuted.” [46] 
	
	
	As counsel made clear in her opening to the jury, the primary (if not sole) purpose of the cross-examination of Hibbard was to persuade the jury that he should not be believed on his oath in his account of the applicant’s involvement in the five offences with which the applicant had been charged. In so far as the cross-examination related to those offences, it did not form evidence which could lift the prohibition in s 104(4). Counsel for the applicant submitted that the extensive cross-examination in relation to other armed robbery offences in which the applicant was not involved also fell within the exclusion in s 104(5) because those offences were dealt with as part of one investigation which included, but was not limited to, the offences for which the applicant was prosecuted. That submission should not be accepted. No part of the investigation of the offences committed by the applicant related to those other offences: there was a chronological connection only. There was, no doubt, one investigation so far as Hibbard was concerned, but a separate investigation in relation to the applicant. To the extent that Hibbard was cross-examined at length about those matters, it was undoubtedly to seek to persuade the jury that this was a man who could not be trusted on his oath because of his willingness to do whatever was necessary in order to satisfy his own needs and interests. It was evidence that he had a tendency (or more) to be untruthful and it was evidence which went mainly (if not solely) to his credibility.
	
	
	Although the evidence was less extensive, the same analysis must apply to evidence of his drug use with Daljit Singh, including at their common workplace, his recruitment of another person for involvement in armed robberies and the otherwise irrelevant questioning as to what he was viewing on the internet, which turned out to be pornography.
	
	
	The evidence as to his convictions for larceny and break and enter were designed to demonstrate that he was lying when he said he did not steal from people. The cross-examination about his conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm on his wife was designed to establish that he was lying when he professed an unwillingness to harm people and asserted that he carried the gun only to keep people at a distance.
	
	
	The prosecutor applied “for leave to cross-examine the accused about matters that might be seen as going to his credit.” [47]  The application was squarely put on the basis that the cross-examination of Hibbard was designed to suggest that his evidence was unreliable. Although there was no reference to s 104(4) of the Evidence Act, it is clear that the application was based on that provision, not least in acknowledging the need for a grant of leave. The discussion covered more than three pages of transcript, without any specific reference to the terms of the Act and without any significant resistance from counsel for the applicant. Acknowledging that she had “cross-examined their main witness as to his character and credit” and “gone into his criminal record because of certain things that he raised” (saying that he had never hurt people and never stole from people) counsel merely said, “[o]f course, it is a big issue to cross-examine an accused about his record but nevertheless your Honour, the issue with this trial is the jury already know my client is involved in the dealing of drugs.” [48] 
	
	
	The judge, in the course of exchanges with counsel appeared, like counsel for the accused, to assume that there would be cross-examination about prior convictions. The following exchange then took place: [49] 
	


“HIS HONOUR: Look at the moment, I think the Crown’s probably entitled on that basis.

ORMAN-HALES: Yes, unfortunately, your Honour, I have to agree but it is the unusual nature of this case because unfortunately everybody has issues, if I can put it that way, but it is the nature of this case. It’s not otherwise, it’s not your typical case where you may try to keep the accused’s character out of it.

HIS HONOUR: Well, I don’t know about the accused’s priors, and I presume he’s got priors for drugs?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I wasn’t particularly going to – talking about raising his criminal record.

ORMAN-HALES: I see.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: But I will just check what is the situation.

HIS HONOUR: What are you talking about raising?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, in terms of cross-examination going to his credit, just the general proposition that people who are involved in drug use and particularly drug supply become practiced at deceiving but it is an essential part of the life of a drug user and particularly a drug supplier.

HIS HONOUR: That’s a problem – I mean, that is an essential part of your case.

ORMAN-HALES: It is. I don’t have--

HIS HONOUR: If that’s as far as it goes I will give you leave but you might like to think about that further and see how much further you want to go?

…

HIS HONOUR: --the extent to which you want to cross-examine, beyond what you’ve said. I think what you’ve proposed at the moment is entirely--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, I figured that it was something that I was forced to seek leave for so I now have your Honour’s leave.

HIS HONOUR: Right. But at this stage you are not proposing to go into any prior record?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Not at this stage, no.

HIS HONOUR: If you do you’ll let me know? Perhaps at the morning tea break. I don’t think – you’ll be in-chief until, at least, morning tea?

ORMAN-HALES: I think so, your Honour, as far as I can tell, yes, thank you.”


	
	The applicant submitted, with respect to the application, that at this stage (a) it was only a foreshadowed application, (b) there was no finding that the gateway had been opened, (c) there was no grant of leave and, in any event, (d) a grant of leave was not justified.
	
	
	It is true that the application proceeded in a fairly haphazard manner, with neither party identifying with clarity the issues and their respective submissions. However, it appears that that was because neither party, nor the judge, thought there was any real disagreement and it was, therefore, largely inevitable that the prosecutor would be given leave to cross-examine the accused on matters going to credit. On the other hand, there was no doubt that, at that stage, the prosecutor was expressly eschewing any application to cross-examine on a prior criminal record. That issue was left open, with the prosecutor indicating an intention to consider further what steps might be taken in that regard. As anticipated, the evidence of the applicant in chief took until the morning tea adjournment. [50] 
	
	
	The prosecutor took a further step at the adjournment, in the absence of the jury and witness, noting that Mr Tieu had given evidence “about the reason for leaving his wallet at home” and that the wallet contained two driving licences. The prosecutor continued, stating that he had “got four previous charges of having an item like a driver’s licence with intent to deceive and also other offences of dishonesty.” [51]  He continued:
	


“Whilst I may have reconsidered my position anyway, particularly the evidence about the driver’s licences because the Crown proposes to submit to the jury and to cross-examine Mr Tieu about the significance of the wallet being left behind. … the Crown seeks leave to cross-examine about the previous convictions. I think there’s dishonestly obtain property by deception and deal with property suspected proceeds of crime. … So, indeed, in terms of, generally, his credit, he’s undertaking all of these drug supply activities at a time when he’s on a good behaviour bond but also coupled with those offences, again possess thing like Australian driver licence with intent to deceive, two counts. It goes to the believability of his explanation that that’s the reason he left his wallet behind and it also goes to his credit, in more general terms, the offences of dishonesty.”


	
	The judge then turned to counsel for the accused who said that the application was “not unexpected” and continued: [52] 
	


“ORMAN-HALES: Your Honour, we’ve never shied away in this trial from the fact of what we do. We’ve always done that. It’s been led, that’s the lifestyle we were living. Your Honour, the issue in this case is that we’re dealing with drugs, that’s what we say we did. We don’t shy away from that but we say we were obviously going about our drug business, we’re not involved in other things. I see where my friend is going. It’s not unexpected. There are two driver’s licences there. Your Honour, he can - if your Honour sees fit to grant him leave to cross-examine my client. I don’t believe my client has ever said that he was honest, so that may be an issue about--

HIS HONOUR: No, but he certainly attacked the Crown witness on that basis, did he not?

ORMAN-HALES: Yes, that’s true.

HIS HONOUR: And continues to.

ORMAN-HALES: Certainly, yes. Certainly. Your Honour, this is an unusual case. This is a case where none of us come to this table with clean hands and it’s just how it is. It is a robust case.

HIS HONOUR: It’s really all or nothing.

ORMAN-HALES: Pretty much, yes, that’s it.

HIS HONOUR: Well do you want to say anything further about why the Crown can’t cross-examine as to these matters?

ORMAN-HALES: Well, your Honour, I don’t think I can say anything further, apart from the prejudice to the accused. But, as I said, it’s a robust case. It would be difficult for me to shy away from those issues. There’s no doubt that he has had those two driver’s licences. My client does have a criminal record, he was dealing in drugs and even on me really opening and - sorry, not opening but leading the evidence that he is into drugs would entitle my friend to start going into his record, I would have thought. But, as I said, it’s a robust case, it’s an all or nothing case. I don’t wish to say anything further, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I just want to review this. You wouldn’t be getting to that until lunchtime anyway, I wouldn’t have thought. I just want to have a look at - there’s a section in Cross on Evidence about prior attacks on credit and I just want to double check that. You might like to have a look at some authorities yourself. I think I’m with you at the moment.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour.”


	
	Further examination in chief of the accused continued after that exchange, following which the prosecutor commenced his cross-examination. The applicant agreed that he was selling ice to support his habit (drug use) and also to support his gambling habit. [53]  He said he considered the drug trade “as a business” and it was “a flow of income.” [54]  He agreed that it was necessary to take steps to avoid telephone intercepts and to take steps to avoid being caught. He was asked whether people who used drugs are “deceptive” and said that, “some people are, yes.” [55]  He agreed in similar terms that some people who use drugs are dishonest. However he did not agree with the suggestion that through his experience with using and selling drugs he was experienced in deception and with being dishonest. [56] 
	
	
	He was then taken to the contents of his wallet, as shown in the photograph in evidence, and agreed that there were two driver’s licences. He agreed one was a fake driver’s licence. [57]  The following exchange took place:
	


“Q. … you’ve told us your driver’s licence was suspended?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that your evidence, your driver’s licence was suspended?

A. Yes.

Q. You went out and got a fake driver’s licence, didn’t you?

A. From memory, I don’t remember where exactly this came from but I have had dealings with fake licences, yes.”


	
	The licence was tendered and he then agreed with the proposition that he had been charged with fraud and had on two separate occasions been charged with possessing items with intent to deceive. [58]  It was suggested that he had been charged with a matter that went to court in Newcastle and later another matter at Burwood Local Court. The cross-examination continued for well over a page without objection at any stage. The cross-examination continued: [59] 
	


“Q. … when you [were] stopped by the police at Newcastle you were charged with dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime?

A. That’s what I was charged with, yes.

Q. And you received ultimately a three year good behaviour bond in relation to that?

A. Yes.

Q. That was in March 2012 you got the three year good behaviour bond?

A. Yes.

Q. You had $29,254?

A. Yes.

Q. In a black shoulder bag?

A. Yes.

Q. And there was a further $3,855?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was the money that was - you were convicted of dealing with property suspected being the proceeds of crime?

A. That’s what I’ve been charged with, yes.

Q. But you were convicted of it?

A. Yes.

Q. And you got a three year good behaviour bond for it?

A. Yes.

Q. In May 2012 when you [were] selling drugs you knew that that was in breach of your good behaviour bond didn’t you?

A. I assume so, yeah.

…

Q. But during April and May 2012 while you were subject to that bond you were selling ice?

A. Yes.

Q. The charges at Burwood Local Court also related to dishonestly obtaining property by deception, two attempted counts?

A. Right.

Q. You were convicted of that?

A. Right.

Q. So it’s fair to say isn’t it you have convictions in relation to offences of dishonesty?

A. I used a fake credit card to buy a laptop.”


	
	Shortly thereafter, the Court adjourned for lunch. On return, the judge raised the following issue in exchange with counsel (omitting interruptions where there appear to have been difficulties with hearing what was said the transcript read as follows): [60] 
	


“Mr Crown I didn’t know you were going on to deal with those matters of his convictions before lunchtime, we had that exchange before.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’m sorry your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I wanted to think about that over lunchtime, I did indicate that I was tentatively with you at that time and I think I still am, but I think I need to give a direction to the jury about it. This is a little unusual situation because the - it’s the accused himself Ms Orman-Hales.

…

HIS HONOUR: It’s the accused himself who has raised the issue of his prior convictions and his character I suppose.

ORMAN-HALES: That’s right yes, that’s right.

HIS HONOUR: What I need to do is to make sure the jury understand that this evidence goes only to his credibility, it doesn’t go to any propensity or tendency or anything like that.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

ORMAN-HALES: Yes your Honour thank you.”


	
	The judge then gave an ex tempore ruling in which he noted that the cross-examination had proceeded “in relation to the accused’s prior convictions in particular in relation to offences of dishonesty including specifically possessing a thing like an Australian driver’s licence on two occasions”. He continued:
	


“What makes this germane is that it is relevant to the finding in the accused’s flat of two either fake or false motor vehicle licences and membership cards of various sporting and other social clubs in fake names utilised by the accused.

The Crown proceeded to cross-examine the accused on that basis at an earlier stage than was anticipated.

In my view cross-examination of that aspect can only go to matters of the accused’s credit.

It is somewhat complex here in the circumstances because the accused has raised his own character – not only his own credibility, but his own character – by saying that as an essential part of his own case that he is not only a drug user but also a drug dealer.

…

It is clear that a Judge should not normally constrain cross-examination on matters of credit - as was said in R v Aldridge (1990) 20 NSWLR 737 - unless they are clearly of no material weight. Here this matter is of some weight.

Prior convictions may be relevant to credit … as was said in R v Hanson [2005] 1 WLR [3169]. Here the cross-examination was going essentially to the capacity to show a propensity to be untruthful.

The danger in all these cases is of course the issue of the danger of propensity or tendency thinking by a jury. For that reason I am proposing to give a direction to the jury along the lines of the same direction I gave about the presence of the gun. …

I have raised with counsel the difficulties inherent in such a case – as it is with the flight of the accused with Mr Hibbard following the police and Polair chase – in terms of the accused having to lead evidence which essentially discloses his past. Those difficulties were dealt with to some extent by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52. But here the other activities of the accused – and his actions as a result of them – is a central part of the accused’s case. That has been apparent since the commencement of the trial that his drug dealing and usage were the reason why he was present in his house, and subsequently his car, with Mr Hibbard.

Accordingly I will give that direction when the jury returns.”

Legal analysis of the course of the trial


	
	The applicant was critical of the course the trial took in several respects. First, he said it was wrong for the prosecutor to proceed to raise the issues of convictions for dishonesty without obtaining the leave of the Court in advance. Secondly, when the judge did raise the issue himself, and gave an ex tempore ruling, he did not actually grant leave, even at that stage. Thirdly, to the extent that the ruling involved an implicit grant of leave, there was a failure to address the requirements of s 104(4) and s 137.
	
	
	It is convenient to address these issues together. First, while it is true that the ruling contained no express reference to a grant of leave, no complaint was made in that regard at the time, for the obvious reason that everyone in the court understood that, as had been foreshadowed prior to the cross-examination, it was likely leave would be granted. In other words, had objection been taken at that stage to the cross-examination continuing without a grant of leave, the judge would undoubtedly have corrected the record, by expressly granting leave, without demur from counsel for the accused.
	
	
	Secondly, although the sections of the Evidence Act were not addressed in express terms, it is likely that the judge, by saying that the cross-examination “can only go to matters of the accused’s credit” and that the matters were of some weight, had some provisions in mind. However, the reference to the case of Aldridge [61]  was inapt, that case being concerned with an earlier provision in terms materially different from s 103(1).
	
	
	The reference to the cross-examination going “to the capacity to show a propensity to be untruthful” could be read as a paraphrase of s 104(4)(a). However, the reference to Hanson suggests that the judge was concerned with use of the prior convictions of the defendant as a basis for cross-examination by the prosecutor, whereas the gateway created by s 104(4)(a) is concerned with cross-examination by (not of) the defendant. Nevertheless it is clear from other passages that the judge had formed the opinion that the gateway to cross-examination, with leave, had been opened.
	
	
	Thirdly, although it was submitted on appeal that the balancing exercise required by s 137 was not undertaken, it was clearly in the judge’s mind. Cook, referred to by the judge both in the course of discussion when the issue of leave was first raised and in his ex tempore ruling, was a case involving the application of s 137. Further, the following morning, when a different issue was raised by counsel for the accused, the judge referred again to Cook noting that it was a case dealing with flight, “the CCA there through Justice Simpson was talking about whether the exercise of a discretion under 137 was appropriate given that that would inevitably raise or require the accused to raise his own prior convictions/criminal behaviour.” [62]  As the judge and counsel recognised and as was reflected in the discussion on a number of occasions, the case run for the accused revealed in uncompromising terms his own involvement with illegal drug use and at least a level of dishonesty. The most serious of the prior offences which resulted in conviction was the proceeds of crime offence, which, it would reasonably be inferred, related to his drug dealing activities. Accordingly, as recognised by his counsel, the unfair prejudicial effect was much more limited than might otherwise have been the case. In short, where both the principal Crown witness and the accused were drug users who obtained money either by armed robbery or by dealing in illegal drugs, the credibility of each was very much at risk on the basis of activity willingly acknowledged by each.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the principal complaint of the applicant must be that first raised, namely that the prosecutor had opened the question of convictions without a grant of leave.
	
	
	The course taken by the prosecutor was undoubtedly mistaken. He should not have proceeded as he did without a grant of leave. Nevertheless, no objection was taken by counsel for the accused and it is, thus, a case in which r 4 applies and the applicant must demonstrate a miscarriage warranting a grant of leave to raise the matter on appeal.
	


Failure to object to evidence

(a)   scope of rule 4


	
	Although both parties to the appeal acknowledged that leave was required under r 4, in considering whether leave should be granted it is desirable to identify more precisely why that is so. The Criminal Appeal Rules are expressed in the following terms:
	


4   Exclusion of certain matters as grounds for appeal etc

No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.


	
	For some purposes a distinction may be drawn between procedural rulings and rulings as to the admissibility of evidence. Thus, in Milakovic it was held that, for the purposes of determining whether an interlocutory appeal is available under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, a refusal to allow the prosecutor to cross-examine a prosecution witness who was said to be “unfavourable” for the purposes of s 38 of the Evidence Act, did not constitute a decision or ruling “on” the admissibility of evidence, so as to allow an interlocutory appeal under s 5F(3A). [63]  The reasoning of Sperling J included reliance on s 38 being found in Ch 2 of the Evidence Act, dealing with rules for adducing evidence, as compared with questions of admissibility, which arise under Ch 3. [64]  That reasoning would suggest that a different answer might be given with respect to the application of ss 103 and 104, which are contained within Ch 3.
	
	
	The subsequent decision of this Court in Shepherd v R [65]  is succinct. The application of r 4 arose with respect to two grounds concerning evidence of an admission made by the accused to a prosecution witness. The first alleged error in granting leave to the prosecutor to cross-examine the witness to elicit evidence of the admission; the second challenged the admissibility of the evidence. The Court held that, no objection having been taken at trial, leave was required under r 4 with respect to the second ground, but that r 4 did not apply to the first ground which was said to be “a decision not as to the admissibility of evidence but as to how evidence could be adduced”. [66] 
	
	
	This conclusion was reached without analysis of the language of r 4, or consideration of its purpose. It may have been assumed that the opening words (“[n]o direction, omission to direct”) referred only to directions given (or not given) to the jury and that those words did not cover a ruling as to how evidence was adduced. Further, the words “decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence” must also have been held not to include a ruling as to whether a particular question could be asked.
	
	
	The phrase “as to” refers in r 4 to a connection or relationship between a decision and the admission or rejection of evidence and is equivalent to “with respect to”. The nature of the connection or relationship thus indicated will depend upon the statutory context. In the present context, the question is whether the decision must be one based on the nature of the evidence (that is, whether it is hearsay, for example) or whether it extends to cover limitations on the kind of questioning which can take place at a trial. Having regard to the purpose of the rule, a flexible construction is to be preferred to a narrow construction. As explained by McHugh J in Papakosmas v The Queen. [67] 
	


“There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling.”


	
	Although Gaudron and Kirby JJ disassociated themselves from McHugh J’s opinion with respect to r 4, they did so on the basis that this Court should not adopt “a rigid approach”; they did not expressly take issue with the proposition that a judge does not err in failing to make a ruling which has not been sought. [68] 
	
	
	The dichotomy adopted by McHugh J (error of law and otherwise a miscarriage of justice) reflects the language of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That provides three bases of appeal of which the first, a verdict which is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, does not depend on any specific error or ruling at the trial and therefore does not engage r 4. The second basis, a “wrong decision of any question of law”, is not to be given a narrow construction in s 6(1); the operation of r 4 should reflect the scope of the available grounds under this head in s 6(1). The third basis is a miscarriage of justice on any other ground.
	
	
	A similar conclusion may be reached by having regard to the functions of the judge in the course of a trial. The jury is required to decide a case, (a) on the evidence before it, (b) having regard to any directions as to how the evidence should be considered and (c) applying the law as directed by the judge. Thus, it is the function of the judge to rule upon the evidence which the jury may hear and give directions as to how that evidence should be considered. What rulings and directions are required will depend upon the evidence sought to be adduced by each party and such objections as may be taken by the other. In this context, it is reasonable to read a reference to “decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence” as encompassing all decisions which have as their direct and intended consequence an effect on the evidence adduced before the jury.
	
	
	Like Milakovic, Shepherd was concerned with a ruling as to whether a witness was “unfavourable” for the purposes of s 38 of the Evidence Act. Without considering the precise scope of s 38, it is (in colloquial terms) directed to circumstances where it appears that a witness is not giving the evidence sought to be adduced to the best of his or her ability. The three elements listed in s 38 relate to the qualities of the witness, not the admissibility of the evidence. The present case is concerned with the nature of the evidence which may be adduced in cross-examining the accused. Milakovic and Shepherd are therefore distinguishable.
	


(b)   nature of failure to object


	
	The circumstances of the present case were, as already explained, unusual. The need to satisfy the requirements of ss 103 and 104 of the Evidence Act, albeit without reference to the terms of those provisions, was acknowledged by the prosecutor before the impugned cross-examination was undertaken. At that stage, no occasion for objection had arisen, although the response of counsel for the accused, which may fairly be characterised as muted opposition, was important. The judge was mindful that a ruling would be required before the prosecutor embarked on the subject matter which required leave.
	
	
	The stage at which objection should have been taken was when the impugned cross-examination commenced, at which point the precise scope of the application had not been articulated, nor had the judge ruled upon it. It was at that stage that counsel for the accused could, if she had intended to pursue her opposition, have objected and stated the legal basis of the objection. Although, in the circumstances outlined above, the trial judge did deliver a brief interlocutory judgment, he did not in terms grant leave, nor did he address the relevant elements of ss 103 and 104 which should have been considered in ruling on the admissibility of the cross-examination. It is tolerably clear from the ruling in fact given, [69]  that the trial judge was focused on the potential prejudice which might flow from the jury treating the evidence of prior convictions as some kind of propensity or tendency evidence. That was a legitimate concern and no counsel suggested otherwise.
	
	
	Furthermore, neither counsel expressed the slightest concern as to the nature of the ruling after it had been delivered. Following a brief and inconsequential exchange with counsel, the jury returned and the judge gave a direction in the terms foreshadowed, namely: [70] 
	


“The evidence that you heard in the same bracket of questions in the cross-examination about the accused’s prior convictions goes only to the questions of his credibility. It cannot be used by you as indicative of any kind of tendency or propensity to commit crimes. It is only introduced to you for that limited purpose of assisting you in assessing his credibility, generally.”


	
	In summary, the following steps occurred:
	



	
	the prosecutor raised the need for leave in order to allow him to cross-examine the accused as to credit;
	
	
	there was some discussion as to the basis and circumstances of the application;
	
	
	no ruling was given at that stage;
	
	
	the prosecutor embarked upon the cross-examination based on prior convictions;
	
	
	no objection was taken by counsel for the accused;
	
	
	the judge raised the issue in the absence of the jury, in terms which suggested that there was no real issue between the parties, with the result that leave should be granted;
	
	
	counsel for the accused concurred in that assessment;
	
	
	the judge gave an interlocutory ruling, not in terms dealing with the issues relevant to leave;
	
	
	neither party made any further submissions or took objection in respect of the ruling.
	



	
	It follows that r 4 is engaged and leave is required.
	


(c)   whether leave should be granted


	
	The circumstances set out above have a marked similarity to those identified by Heydon JA in R v Button; R v Griffen. [71]  First, because the issue had been squarely raised, it cannot have been “simply overlooked”. Accordingly, as Heydon JA explained, it is necessary to look for an explanation elsewhere. The course identified above reveals that both prosecutor and counsel for the accused accepted that a grant of leave was (in the view of the prosecutor) appropriate and (in the view of the accused) inevitable. The judge accepted that approach: indeed, he may have thought that no formal ruling was required. The judge did, however, consider that misuse of the evidence was a real concern and addressed that (with the consent of both parties) by a direction, to which no objection was taken, nor any challenge raised on appeal.
	
	
	It follows that there was no error of law. The question, therefore, is whether there was otherwise a miscarriage of justice. That was a matter for the applicant to establish.
	
	
	The truth is that there was no miscarriage of justice, for any one or more of a number of reasons, which fully explain why no objection was raised at trial.
	
	
	When the prosecutor first raised the question of cross-examination as to credit before the accused was called, counsel for the accused clearly anticipated that the application included cross-examination “about his record”, describing it as a “big issue” but nevertheless an issue which was already with the jury in this case. [72]  The judge had already indicated his view that the Crown was “probably entitled” to cross-examine on that basis and counsel for the applicant had agreed, before the prosecutor noted that he had no current intention of raising the criminal record. [73] 
	
	
	Again, there was a further opportunity, part way through the examination in chief of the accused, when the prosecutor expressly identified an intention to cross-examine on the criminal record and the nature of the material he proposed to put to the applicant. Counsel responded that she could see where the prosecutor was going and that it was “not unexpected.” [74]  She described the defence as “a robust case”, to which the judge replied, “it’s really all or nothing” and counsel for the applicant agreed. In the passage set out above, the judge expressly invited her to put anything further about why the prosecutor could not cross-examine as to those matters and apart from a reference to the “prejudice to the accused” she in effect accepted that there was nothing further to put. Finally, when the judge himself raised his concern that the prosecution had moved to cross-examine on these materials before he had made a ruling, counsel raised no objection at all, but agreed with the course of giving an appropriate direction to the jury about how the material could be used and how it should not be used.
	
	
	This was not a case where cross-examination as to a criminal record came out of the blue: there was ample forewarning. Accepting that even with forewarning, counsel may be reluctant to intervene in cross-examination in a manner which requires a jury to be sent out, that was not this case. Had it been, there was ample opportunity for counsel to identify the difficulty when the judge raised the matter; the fact that she said nothing of that kind is a good indication that no such reticence affected her silence. In any event, if an issue of admissibility arises at a trial, non-objection cannot be excused on some generic basis, such as reluctance to aggravate or annoy jurors, or r 4 might as well be repealed. The fact is that, when the running of the trial is viewed as a whole, it is clear beyond doubt that counsel was entirely resigned to the fact that the course taken by the prosecutor would have been taken (with leave) in any event and no avoidable harm was done by way of prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that s 104 was not engaged because the cross-examination “was not an attempt to show a tendency on [Mr Hibbard’s] behalf to be untruthful, and nor was the evidence of Mr Hibbard’s prior convictions relevant solely to his credibility.” Rather, the submissions continued, “the questions about Mr Hibbard’s criminal record were attempts by Defence counsel to rebut suggestions by Mr Hibbard that he wouldn’t hurt or assault people, and that he wouldn’t take money from people.”
	
	
	These submissions are without substance. The sole purpose of the cross-examination on these topics (which had no direct connection with the elements of the offences) were solely directed to demonstrating that Mr Hibbard lied in asserting the contrary. They sought to demonstrate a tendency to be untruthful. And were solely directed to his credibility (although, perhaps curiously, the criterion in s 104(4)(b) refers to evidence which is “relevant solely or mainly” to credibility). If there were any doubt about the matter, it should be resolved against the applicant because counsel present at the trial, who were in a better position to assess such evaluative criteria, clearly took the view that the gateway in s 104(4) was wide open. The next question was whether the cross-examination of the accused (by reference to his past convictions) “could substantially affect” the assessment of his credibility. The applicant made no clear submission to the effect that the criterion in s 103(1) was not satisfied. He did submit that neither the prosecutor nor counsel for the accused referred to the criminal record of the accused in final addresses, “nor to any substantial degree, his credit or character.” The trial judge dealt with the matter in a short passage, namely: [75] 
	


“He was taken to his credibility in cross-examination. It was put to him that he had been dishonest, taken to the contents of the wallets and the two driver’s licences, the different names that were used, as well as the different names on the various cards. He said and agreed that he had the prior matters referred to and again, I want to emphasise that you should not be prejudiced against the accused in those particular circumstances, just by reason of those matters.”


	
	In assessing this issue, it is not insignificant that, although the opportunity to put submissions in this regard was not adopted by counsel for the accused before the evidence was given, there was ample opportunity to raise the issue after the evidence was given and demand that there be a direction, not merely a warning against using the evidence as to tendency or propensity, but to the effect that it should be disregarded entirely, because it was insignificant and had no substantial effect on his credibility. That step was not taken. Rather than focus on the criterion in s 103(1), the thrust of the applicant’s submissions was that significant prejudice was caused by the cross-examination, which should have led to the questioning being rejected pursuant to s 192(2) or s 137. The applicant submitted that “such evidence was not ‘important’ for the Crown case, other than for its credibility purpose. There was no rational, probative connection between the offences to which the applicant had been convicted and the robbery offences.”
	
	
	Section 192 of the Evidence Act deals generally with factors which are to be taken into account in any consideration of leave, permission or direction under other provisions of the Act. One such factor is “the importance of the evidence”, which explains the use of the term “important” in the submission. However, the distinction drawn in the submission is between importance to the issues in the case and questions of credibility: there was no submission that this material was not significant in relation to questions of credibility.
	
	
	The applicant made no submissions in relation to the directions given by the trial judge, which had two features of critical significance for present purposes. The first was that the judge was at pains, on more than one occasion, to ensure that evidence which might have been used prejudicially to the accused was not so used. Secondly, no further directions were sought at trial, nor was any complaint made in this Court as to the directions given. Where evidence is given going to the credibility of the accused, without objection being taken to the evidence and without there being any suggestion at the trial that unfair prejudice had been caused to the accused, it will not be easy for an accused to demonstrate in this Court that there has been a miscarriage of justice. To the extent that the task was assayed at all, it did not succeed.
	


Conclusions


	
	In these circumstances, the proper course is to refuse leave to raise the ground now relied upon, under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. It follows that, no other ground being pressed, the application for leave to appeal must be refused.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Basten JA in draft. I would respectfully not share his Honour’s conclusion as to the determination of the appeal.
	
	
	The only ground of appeal sought to be maintained is:
	


“The applicant’s trial miscarried by reason of the Crown Prosecutor cross-examining the applicant on his criminal record in the absence of a consideration of leave, or the credibility and character provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). No objection was raised.”


	
	In noting that “no objection was raised”, the applicant evidently intended to acknowledge a requirement for leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules before that ground could be allowed as a ground of appeal. In my view, however, it is doubtful whether the rule applies.
	
	
	Rule 4 provides:
	


“No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.”


	
	As framed, the applicant’s single ground of appeal is not directed to any direction, omission to direct or decision given by the trial judge but rather contends that the trial miscarried at the point when the prosecutor cross-examined the applicant as to his criminal record without having given the prior notice he had said he would give and in contravention of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Unfortunately, as Basten JA has noted, the application proceeded in a haphazard manner and neither counsel identified his or her submissions as clearly as might have been the case. The Crown opened the issue by seeking leave “to cross-examine the accused about matters that might be seen as going to his credit”. Counsel appearing for the applicant at the trial, Ms Orman-Hales, responded to the application (at T524.20) in terms suggesting acceptance of the proposition that some cross-examination relevant only to the assessment of the applicant’s credibility could properly be allowed. However, it is by no means clear that her position at that point comprehended acceptance of the proposition that the occasion had arisen for the accused to be cross-examined about his criminal record.
	
	
	In any event, the prosecutor made plain in a subsequent exchange (at T525.20) that he was not at that stage seeking to raise the applicant’s criminal record. He said the cross-examination as to credit would raise “just the general proposition that people who are involved in drug use and particularly drug supply become practised at deceiving but it is an essential part of the life of a drug user and particularly a drug supplier”. The judge said “If that’s as far as it goes I will give you leave but you might like to think about that further and see how much further you want to go?” (at T 525.29-T525.40).
	
	
	The exchange concluded (at T526.33) with the prosecutor noting that he had leave and the judge specifically confirming that the prosecutor was “not proposing to go into any prior record” at that stage. Although there was no specific reference to the provisions of the Evidence Act, it may be taken that, at that point, the prosecutor had leave under s 104(2) of the Act to cross-examine the applicant about being “practised at deceiving” in the context of his involvement in the use and supply of drugs. The leave did not extend to cross-examination as to prior criminal convictions. The judge specifically asked the prosecutor to let him know in the event that he did propose to go into the applicant’s record, suggesting that he give that indication “perhaps at the morning-tea break” (T526.41).
	
	
	Before the morning tea break the Crown did seek that leave, referring specifically to “four previous charges of having an item like a driver’s licence with intent to deceive [in fact I think there were only three] and also other offences of dishonesty”. The application was expressly made on the basis that, during the evidence after the first application, Ms Orman-Hales had led evidence from the applicant that the reason he left his wallet at home on the night he was alleged to have committed the robberies with Mr Hibbard was that he knew he didn’t have a licence or that his licence was suspended, so he “didn’t want to bring any ID” with him (T539.40). Although the Crown’s application for leave to cross-examine as to the prior convictions was specifically said to be based on that evidence, the connection was not well articulated. The prosecutor identified the relevant topic as “the significance of the wallet being left behind”. As best I am able to understand the prosecutor’s submissions (as informed by the subsequent cross-examination), the proposition appears to have been that prior convictions for “possess thing like Australian driver licence with intent to deceive” were relevant to “the believability of the explanation for leaving the wallet behind” (not wanting to have ID because he knew his licence was suspended) because the applicant was practised in the use of fake licences and could have used one if pulled over that night. However, the submission was also put, more broadly, that offences of dishonesty unrelated to the issue of fake licences (two counts of dishonestly obtaining property by deception (attempted) and two counts of dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime) went “in more general terms” to his credit.
	
	
	Even more tenuously, the prosecutor also flagged reliance upon the fact that the applicant was supplying drugs at a time when he was on a good behaviour bond for the proceeds of crime offences as a matter going to his credibility as a witness (at T569.32). The submission equated disobedience with dishonesty; in my view, they are quite different.
	
	
	Although Ms Orman-Hales appeared to accept that the Crown may be entitled “to start going into his record”, the judge reserved his ruling, wanting to review the issue and, in particular, to consider a particular passage in Cross on Evidence, adding that the Crown “might like to have a look at some authorities” himself. The judge noted his anticipation at that stage that the prosecutor would not get to that point of his cross-examination until lunch time anyway; the prosecutor accepted the position as outlined by the judge (at T570.39).
	
	
	Apparently forgetting the outcome of that exchange, the Crown cross-examined the accused about his prior convictions before the lunch adjournment without adverting to the need for a ruling from the judge. At that point (at T590.34 and following), the cross-examination contravened s 104(2) of the Evidence Act. It is that contravention which is sought to be allowed as a ground for appeal.
	
	
	The position is complicated by the manner in which the issue was subsequently determined. As noted by Basten JA at [73]-[74], the applicant’s submissions entail criticism not only of the course taken by the prosecutor in proceeding to raise the criminal record without first obtaining leave but also of the ex tempore ruling given after that occurred. In particular, the applicant submits that the judge did not, even then, actually grant leave and did not address the requirements of s 104(4) and s 137 of the Evidence Act. I accept (as stated by Basten JA) that it is convenient to address those three issues together and that the position adopted by Ms Orman-Hales is significant in that determination.
	
	
	However, I do not think r 4 excludes the ground of appeal as framed. The rule applies to grounds for appeal as to the trial judge’s conduct of the trial (in giving directions, or not, and in making decisions as to the admission or rejection of evidence). The proposition that a judge does not err in failing to make a ruling which has not been sought does not cover the field of possible failings in respect of the conduct of a trial. The trial judge bears ultimate responsibility to ensure that the trial is fair and is conducted according to law. The content of that responsibility is not determined only by reference to the rulings sought by counsel.
	
	
	The ground of appeal here is that the prosecutor cross-examined an accused person in breach of an express prohibition in the Evidence Act. The prosecutor had a responsibility not to do so and, with respect, the trial judge had a responsibility to stop it, at least until the issue of leave was determined. Certainly, the accused’s counsel could have objected too. I accept that her failure to do so is relevant in determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. But I do not think the failure to object triggers rule 4. At the point at which the conduct allegedly causing the trial to miscarry occurred, the responsibility to seek a ruling rested squarely on the Crown. To invoke the application of rule 4 in that circumstance is to visit upon defence counsel the burden of guarding the fairness of the trial.
	
	
	The submissions in this Court proceeded on the premise that leave is required under r 4 and accordingly neither party addressed the requirement for leave in respect of a ground of appeal that involves a question of mixed law and fact: s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act (1912) (NSW). In my view, the fact that the cross-examination contravened the Evidence Act and overlooked the indication the prosecutor had given to the judge (albeit apparently due to inadvertence) would warrant a grant of leave under that section.
	
	
	I accept it is possible, as Basten JA apprehends, that although the ruling given by the judge contained no express grant of leave, the judge would have regarded that as a formality and would have granted leave without opposition from Ms Orman-Hales had the point been taken at the time. My reservation in that respect is that, as explained below, I am not persuaded that the judge had in fact traced through the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act at that point. Had he turned up the section in response to a request to “correct the record”, there might have been further debate at that point.
	
	
	In any event, it is clear, in my view, that the judge did not turn his mind to the requirements of s 103 of the Evidence Act. The judge said:
	


“It is clear that a judge should not normally constrain cross-examination on matters of credit – as was said in R v Aldridge (1990) 20 NSWLR 737 – unless they are clearly of no material weight. Here this matter is of some weight.”


	
	In my respectful opinion that passage reveals that, far from having the provisions of s 103 in mind (specifically, the fact that the trigger to the exception to the credibility rule requires a determination that the evidence “could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness”), the judge applied the wrong test. Aldridge was concerned with the exercise of the discretion under s 56 of the Evidence Act 1898 to disallow a question directed to the credit of a witness if, in the opinion of the judge, “the matter [suggested by the question] is so remote in time, or of such a nature that an admission of its truth would not materially affect the credibility of the witness” (at 741D per Hunt J). The principles stated in Aldridge thus related to a very different test and one which was abrogated by the Evidence Act 1995. The test under the 1898 Act for allowing a question suggesting a matter relevant to the witness’s credit was whether the truth of the matter suggested would materially affect the credit of the witness. It may be accepted, as explained below, that the test in s 103 of the Evidence Act was probably met in the present case; the point I am presently making is that the judge’s remarks reveal his Honour did not turn his mind to that test.
	
	
	Further, I would respectfully not share Basten JA’s confidence (at [76]) that the trial judge did address the question whether the gateway to cross-examination, with leave, had been opened. The judge said:
	


“Prior convictions may be relevant to credit it was said as was said (sic) in R v Hanson (2005) 1 WLR at 169. Here the cross-examination was going essentially to the capacity to show a propensity to be untruthful.”


	
	The reference to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Hanson is obscure; that decision was concerned with an application by the prosecution to rely upon prior convictions to establish a propensity on the part of the accused to commit offences of the kind charged. In my view, it is clear that the judge was referring to the cross-examination of the applicant, whereas s 104(4)(a) is concerned with cross-examination by a defendant tending to prove that a witness called by the prosecutor has a tendency to be untruthful (the establishment of which is one of the requirements in the absence of which leave to cross-examine a defendant about matters relevant to the assessment of his credibility “must not be given”).
	
	
	Indeed, the judge’s reference to the decision in Hanson tends to confirm the applicant’s contention that the judge’s ex tempore ruling was not a retrospective grant of leave under s 104(2) of the Evidence Act or, at the very least, that even if it was, the judge did not address the relevant requirements of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions have persuaded me that, in the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice. The cross-examination pre-empted the judge’s ruling and contravened s 104(2) of the Evidence Act. The fact that the evidence had come out in the presence of the jury raised an awkward problem but it had to be addressed in an orderly way. The cross-examination having proceeded without leave, the first task was for the judge to make a determination as to leave. With great respect to the trial judge, I do not think his Honour made any such determination in accordance with the requirements of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Had the provisions of the Act been considered in the present case, it is difficult to imagine that the cross-examination as to prior convictions would have been allowed. The applicant concedes, correctly in my view, that his prior convictions for offences of dishonesty were capable of substantially affecting the assessment of his credibility so as to fall within the exception to the credibility rule provided for in s 103 of the Act. The applicant submits, however, that the further protection provided by s 104 should have applied in his favour. Specifically, it was submitted that Ms Orman-Hales’ cross-examination of Mr Hibbard did not tend to prove “a tendency to be untruthful” but rather was directed more narrowly to rebutting specific assertions he had made in his evidence. On that basis, it was submitted that the requirements of s 104(4) were not met, with the result that leave to cross-examine as to the record could not be granted.
	
	
	It was further submitted that, even if that is wrong, the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, such that the evidence was inadmissible under s 137 of the Act.
	
	
	In my view, there is force in those submissions. The connection between the prior convictions for possessing fake licences and the believability of the applicant’s explanation for leaving his wallet behind was tenuous at best. The point was not made good in any specific way during the cross-examination. There was evidence in the trial as to the contents of the wallet, which apparently included a fake licence. The applicant readily admitted that it was a fake licence and that he had had dealings with fake licences (T588.37). Those concessions were enough to sustain the proposition put to the applicant (at T 596.8) that he did not leave his wallet at home because he didn’t want to have his expired licence on him, but because he knew he was “going out to do armed robberies”. The further cross-examination as to prior convictions for similar matters and other, unrelated dishonesty offences was extremely prejudicial, in my view.
	
	
	I have paused over this issue, particularly in light of the position adopted by Ms Orman-Hales at the trial. As noted by Basten JA, she appears to have perceived and been resigned to a risk that the prosecutor would take the course he did and to have assessed the prejudicial effect to be limited in the context of the “robust defence” she was conducting on the applicant’s behalf. Ultimately, however, my analysis of the record of the trial has led me to a less sanguine assessment of the degree of unfair prejudice to the applicant. The fact that he was an admitted drug user and drug supplier did not of itself equate to his having convictions for offences of dishonesty.
	
	
	For those reasons, the orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be allowed and the conviction quashed and, as sought by the applicant, an order for a new trial.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Basten JA and McCallum J. The background is set out in Basten JA’s judgment. I agree with the orders proposed by McCallum J for the reasons which follow.
	
	
	Section 103 provides the test for the credibility rule not to apply. Section 104 sets out a clear pathway which must be followed in criminal matters before an accused can be cross-examined about a matter relevant to the assessment of his or her credibility. Section 104(4) is a gateway provision and is concerned with evidence adduced by the accused that tends to prove a prosecution witness has a tendency to be untruthful and is relevant solely or mainly to the witness’s credibility. Section 192 requires the court giving the leave under s 104(2) to take into account the matters in s 192(2). It may be that s 137 is required to be considered: In R v El-Azzi [2004] NSWCCA 455, but I note [44]-[47] in Basten JA’s judgment. In the present case the issue of prejudice to the applicant was raised by his counsel in response to the course the prosecutor asked to take.
	
	
	There is very little in the primary judge’s reasons and in the exchanges between the judge and counsel leading up to those reasons that provide any confidence that proper attention was given to the requirements of ss 103, 104 and 192.
	
	
	Most of the relevant exchanges are set out in the judgment of Basten JA at [63], [66], [67] and [71]. One further passage should be set out. This passage was referred to and summarised by Basten JA at [63]. It is the exchange when the Crown Prosecutor first raised the issue of cross-examining the applicant on matters going to his credit. The following appears (T 523-5):
	


CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. Before the accused starts to give evidence, I thought it appropriate that I raise now an application for leave to cross-examine the accused about matters that might be seen as going to his credit. In my submission, the cross-examination of Mr Hibbard, in general terms, about his status as a convicted armed robber, that was the sort of question that was put to him repeatedly. It raises - and the proposition that, therefore, his evidence was unreliable and the discount that he had received. It seems to be a central plank of the cross-examination of Mr Hibbard and, in my submission, that entitles the Crown - the issue of that witness' character and credibility having been raised - that the Crown is equally entitled to cross-examine the accused. Just that I need leave to do it and I thought --

HIS HONOUR: You need --

CROWN PROSECUTOR: -- it better to raise it before we got to the point of cross-examination so there was a suggestion that it was something that was unexpected, but I assume from the cross-examination that it wasn't unexpected that my friend anticipated that that would be the consequence of--

HIS HONOUR: I would have thought so. Do you have any views about that?

ORMAN-HALES: Well, your Honour, I've cross-examined their main witness as to his character and credit. I've gone into his criminal record because of 15 certain things that he raised. He said he never hurt people and a few other things which clear that was wrong because he has a record for doing such a--

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

ORMAN-HALES: He said he never stole from people. I also cross-examined him on that. Of course, it is a big issue to cross-examine an accused about his record but nevertheless your Honour, the issue with this trial is the jury already know my client is involved in the dealing of drugs.

HIS HONOUR: That's right.

ORMAN-HALES: That really - but it is just how the trial is, I am afraid. It's just one of those --

HIS HONOUR: You have to raise that.

ORMAN-HALES: We have to raise that. It's not something that could be kept away.

HIS HONOUR: I've been particularly aware of that aspect of it because when the Crown raised the issue of the flight direction --

ORMAN-HALES: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: -- I would suggest that you both look at the case of Cook. I don't know whether you've done that or not.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I haven't.

ORMAN-HALES: No, and I haven't either.

HIS HONOUR: It's 2004 Court of Criminal Appeal Reports. I was there as the appellate Crown in that instance.

ORMAN-HALES: Okay.

HIS HONOUR: And one of the matters that was raised there was whether you'd put the accused in an impossible position to deny other reasons for flight. You haven't run your case on that basis, as I understand it? You are not saying, ""He ran away because he thought his prior convictions were going to lead to --“ –


	
	The exchange then continued as Basten JA has set out at [63].
	
	
	Nothing in those exchanges demonstrates that any attention was given to the requirements of s 104 rather than the matter of cross-examining an accused on his or her record generally. There is one indication in the primary judge’s reasons that suggests that s 104 may have been what the primary judge had in mind. His Honour said:
	


Prior convictions may be relevant to credit it was said as was said (sic) in R v Hanson (2005) 1 WLR at 169. Here the cross-examination was going essentially to the capacity to show a propensity to be untruthful.


	
	That statement almost picks up what is contained in s 104(4)(a). However, it must be noted that what the primary judge was referring to in that passage was the cross-examination of the applicant whereas s 104(4) is concerned with a witness called by the prosecutor who has a tendency to be untruthful. Further, the reference to “propensity to be untruthful” comes from Hanson and s 103(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (UK) and not from the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	None of the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions concerned the gateway provision in s 104(4). There was no reference to evidence that tended to prove that Mr Hibbard had a tendency to be untruthful and that the evidence that was adduced was relevant solely or mainly to Mr Hibbard’s credibility. Nor does the primary judge make any reference to Mr Hibbard’s evidence in that regard.
	
	
	Nor, as McCallum J points out, is there any indication that the provisions of s 103 were considered (although, in the event, the test in s 103 was probably satisfied), and the reference by the primary judge to R v Aldridge is a further indication that the correct tests were not applied.
	
	
	Although counsel for the applicant made a passing reference to prejudice to the applicant, the primary judge does not deal specifically with prejudice nor with the question of unfairness as s 192(2) requires. To the extent that the primary judge was to engage in the balancing exercise required by s 137, I do not consider what he said relating to the decision in R v Cook shows that this exercise was undertaken.
	
	
	The difficulties are compounded by the fact that the prosecutor embarked on the cross-examination about the applicant’s prior criminal record contrary to what he had indicated he would do and without having obtained leave in advance to do so. That had the result that the primary judge gave the direction to the jury about the cross-examination after the prosecutor had cross-examined on the criminal record. If the direction was to be given, it should have been given beforehand.
	
	
	His Honour had said that he wanted to review the matter at lunchtime. Even after the prosecutor had embarked on the cross-examination of the applicant about his convictions without leave and without being stopped by the judge, his Honour said after the lunch adjournment:
	


I did indicate that I was tentatively with you at that time and I think I still am, but I think I need to give a direction to the jury about it.

His Honour then delivered his reasons. His primary concern in his reasons was the matter of giving a direction to the jury about what he described as “propensity or tendency thinking”. The reasons make no reference to ss 103, 104, 137 or 192, nor to what in substance those sections require, make no reference to evidence adduced by the applicant relating to Mr Hibbard, and do not give leave even retrospectively.


	
	It was, of course, open to counsel for the applicant at the trial to have objected to the cross-examination and to the intimation by the primary judge that leave would be given. Further, it was open to counsel to have objected immediately when the Crown Prosecutor commenced to ask the question at T590.34:
	


Even before these events in May 2012 you had been charged with possessing a thing like an Australia’s driver’s licence – like an Australian driver’s licence, I apologise, with the intention to deceive hadn’t you?


	
	In my opinion Rule 4 applies by reason of the failure of counsel to object, as the framing of the ground of appeal appears to accept.
	
	
	In R v El-Azzi Simpson J said at [200] that it would not be every case where an attack is made upon the credibility of the Crown witnesses that would warrant the exercise of the 104(2) discretion to grant leave to cross-examine. Her Honour stressed the need to assess the matter for overall fairness and for the balancing exercise required by s 137. Her Honour said at [201] that this Court would not substitute its own discretion for that of the trial judge unless error in the exercise has been shown.
	
	
	In my opinion error of a House v The King type has been demonstrated. There has been a failure by the primary judge to consider properly or at all the gateway provision in s 104(4) and there has been a failure to consider matters of fairness and to perform the balancing exercise required by s 137. These errors justify leave being granted, notwithstanding Rule 4. When those matters are combined with the Crown Prosecutor’s having embarked upon the cross-examination as to previous convictions without leave and the failure of the primary judge to prevent that course, I consider that the trial miscarried and that the ground of appeal is made out.

2769681,Nation v R [2016] NSWCCA 115,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: At about 10am on 11 November 2011, the applicant, Adel Louise Nation, was driving north along the Pacific Highway near Chatsworth Island (west of Yamba and between Grafton and Ballina). The inside lane in which she was travelling came to an end and she was required to merge into the remaining northbound lane. In doing so, she lost control of her vehicle, crossed the single lane in front of a B-double truck and collided with a Tarago van travelling south, killing both the driver and the front seat passenger of that vehicle. Her own son was also seriously injured in the collision.
	
	
	On 4 June 2014 the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an indictment containing two charges of driving in a manner dangerous to other persons and causing death (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 52A(1)(c)) and one charge of driving in a manner dangerous and causing grievous bodily harm (s 52A(3)(c)). Following her pleas of not guilty, she was tried by Wells DCJ SC and a jury at Lismore. On 12 June the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all three charges.
	
	
	For reasons which were obscure, she was not sentenced until 13 February 2015, when she received a non-parole period of 18 months, to expire on 12 August 2016 with an additional term of 18 months. For reasons which are also obscure, and quite unfortunate, no application for leave to appeal was filed until 8 February 2016, after she had served all but six months of her non-parole period. The appeal was limited to a challenge to the verdicts on the basis that they were unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the whole of the evidence. To address that ground it is necessary for this Court to consider the evidence led at the trial.
	
	
	For the reasons set out below, there should be a grant of leave to appeal from each conviction, but the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Circumstances of collision


	
	The precise mechanism by which the applicant lost control of her vehicle (a Land Rover Discovery) was controversial; the circumstances in which she got into difficulty were not. Thus, it was agreed that the applicant had left an address in Victoria with a fully laden Land Rover and her three children, at about 2pm on Thursday, 10 November 2011 to drive to Brisbane. Some 20 hours later, having covered 1,588 kilometres, the collision occurred.
	
	
	The speed limit on the Pacific Highway near Chatsworth Island on the northbound lanes was 100kph. The applicant was originally travelling in the inside of two northbound lanes and passed three warning signs indicating that the left hand lane would end and she would need to merge into the centre lane. Photographs showed a “merge right” arrow on the road approximately 350 metres south of the point of impact. Beyond the arrow, the lane started to taper, with a broken white line between the tapering left hand lane and the centre lane. A photograph taken 160 metres south of the point of impact showed the final metres of the taper: any vehicle which had failed to merge right by that stage would have had its nearside wheels on the bitumen shoulder of the highway.
	
	
	Evidence as to signage and distance along the road was given by Senior Constable Hardy of Ballina Highway Patrol. Constable Hardy noted that the first sign, “Left lane ends 500 metres” was exactly that distance from the “Form one lane” sign. [1]  There was a further sign “Left lane ends merge right”, with an arrow, which was 300 metres from the actual merge. [2]  There were in fact three arrows painted on the surface of the lane. [3]  The length of the dual lane segment of the highway was 2.5 kilometres. [4]  Constable Hardy also stated that the tapering of the lane covered 250 metres. [5]  The northbound lane was in the shape of a broad sweeping left hand bend. [6] 
	
	
	A scale diagram indicated that the final white “dash” at the point where the lane vanished, was 83 metres short of the point of collision. The first of a series of tyre marks crossing the remaining lane, as the applicant’s vehicle moved towards the centre chevron markings and across into the southbound lanes, was identified some 30 metres before the point of collision.
	
	
	Sergeant Hindle gave evidence of measurements taken in the vicinity of the accident. He said that the bitumen verge on the northbound side of the highway was approximately 2.1 metres wide, the single northbound lane was approximately 3.5 metres wide and the centre dividing markers approximately 1 metre wide. [7] 
	
	
	Sergeant Hindle described the applicant’s vehicle as a gold-coloured Land Rover Discovery, and stated that the tyre marks were made as it “rotated in a clockwise direction while sliding upon the bitumen roadway”. [8] 
	
	
	At an earlier point along the dual lane section, the truck in front of which the applicant passed was behind her in the left hand lane, but pulled out to pass her. The truck, identified by its signage as a “Fred’s truck”, was a B-double driven by Craig Anthony Fuller. [9]  Constable Hardy gave evidence that a B-double is between 25 and 26 metres long, evidence confirmed by Mr Fuller. The truck did not complete the overtaking before the inside lane ended. Then in front of the applicant’s Land Rover in the inside lane was a Linfox truck. When Mr Fuller realised that he would not be able to overtake it, he flashed his lights indicating that the Linfox should merge in front of him. It did so. The applicant’s vehicle then sought to merge, after the end of the inside lane, in the gap between the Linfox and the B-double. It was in the course of that manoeuvre that the applicant lost control of her vehicle.
	
	
	The Land Rover slid into the path of a southbound Tarago, which collided with the rear of the Land Rover, causing massive damage to the front of the Tarago and killing the occupants. The applicant’s son, who also suffered significant injuries, was in the back seat of the Land Rover. The back of the Land Rover appears to have been full of bedding and other domestic possessions, although it is not clear how it was packed immediately prior to the collision. One issue was whether the applicant had a view through the rear window of the Land Rover using the internal rear vision mirror.
	


Eye-witness evidence


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at the trial, but a brief statement dated 23 March 2012 was admitted, the only matter of substance being the following passage:
	


“I have no recollection of the actual collision. However, shortly before the collision I recall travelling at the prevailing speed limit as I had adjusted the cruise control to comply with the speed limit. Just before the accident I saw a truck in my rear vision mirror travelling extremely close to the rear of my vehicle. I could not see the lights of the truck because he was so close all I could really see was the huge radiator of the truck which took up the whole back window.

The next thing I remember is being in the ambulance.”


	
	Two other persons spoke to the applicant after the collision. The first to speak to her was Ana Scott who had been a passenger in a car driven by her husband, which was driving north, but behind the Land Rover. She gave evidence that among other things, the applicant had said “I was tired”. [10]  She also said on a number of occasions, “What happened, was it my fault? I can feel my toes.” [11]  There was no challenge to the suggestion that the applicant had said, on at least one occasion, “I was tired”. The defence suggested that she was in a state of shock at that time, an inference drawn by Ms Scott herself.
	
	
	Sergeant Hindle was assisted in his investigations by Senior Constable Butler. Mr Butler made a statement but was unable to attend court through illness. Sergeant Hindle was led through parts of Mr Butler’s statement as part of his (Sergeant Hindle’s) evidence-in-chief. Constable Butler had spoken to the applicant whilst she was in hospital and, he, Butler believed, she was under the effects of medication. Mr Butler recorded the applicant as saying “I remember talking to Mark my husband on the phone and next this [next thing?], the truck being right there”. [12]  There was evidence that there was a hands free mobile phone fitted to the Land Rover. Ms Scott’s evidence was that the applicant was talking on the phone when she reached the vehicle shortly after the collision, that the applicant handed her the phone and she subsequently handed it to her husband to speak to the man on the other end. [13] 
	
	
	The case for the defence turned almost entirely upon the proposition that the dangerous situation in which the applicant found herself was caused predominantly by the aggressive driving of the B-double by Mr Fuller.
	
	
	The evidence in support of this thesis included (a) the suggestion that the distance between the B-double and the Linfox truck was unsafe (that is, Mr Fuller had driven far too close to the rear of the Linfox truck before allowing it to merge in front of him); (b) having failed to overtake the Land Rover, he should have let it merge in front of him; (c) having made no attempt to slow down to allow it to merge, the B-double collided with the right hand rear of the Land Rover; (d) Mr Fuller did not stop, although he cannot have been unaware of the ensuing collision, and (e) he lied in an attempt to explain flakes of paint found on the left hand front bumper bar of his truck.
	
	
	In addition to the police officers and a crime scene officer with expertise in reconstruction of collisions, the prosecution relied on seven eye witnesses. The first witness, who gave lengthy evidence, was Mr Fuller. It is convenient to put his evidence to one side and deal with the other eye witnesses. Two were driving south. One, Clinton Risson, was driving a B-double truck in the centre of the two lanes travelling south and had overtaken the Tarago and was able to manoeuvre his truck so that the Land Rover did not hit him. He saw the collision between the Land Rover and the Tarago in his rear vision mirror.
	
	
	The other witness travelling south was Brian Crossley-Price, who was in the left hand lane, behind the Tarago. The collision occurred in front of him and he was able to brake in order to avoid colliding with the Tarago from behind.
	
	
	There were four eye witnesses in vehicles travelling north. Luke Austen was driving a Toyota Rav4. There was, initially, another vehicle between him and Mr Fuller’s truck. Both intended to overtake the truck, but the truck pulled out into the centre lane, causing the vehicle in front of Mr Austen to move into the southbound lane. That vehicle went past, and Mr Austen flashed his lights at the truck to tell the truck that he was not committed to overtaking. [14]  As he slowed down, leaving about 100 metres between him and the truck, he could see the Land Rover in the left hand lane. His evidence was that the cab of the B-double was level with the trailer wheels of the semi-trailer (the Linfox) and thus alongside the Land Rover. [15]  He said that the B-double did not brake, but slowed enough to allow the semi-trailer to pull out in front of it. [16]  He could see that the Land Rover had its right hand indicator on, but did not slow down. [17] 
	
	
	Mr Austen was not in the best position to see what was happening in front of the B-double, but he estimated the distance between the B-double and the semi-trailer as being “enough room for like a really tight car length”. [18]  He said that he was able to see the B-double make contact with the driver’s side rear of the Land Rover. [19]  In evidence given in the Local Court committal proceedings, Mr Austen had said that he did not see contact between the Land Rover and the B-double. In cross-examination at the trial he agreed that his evidence that he had seen such contact was an assumption or reconstruction. [20] 
	
	
	Jennifer Jackson was a passenger in the front seat of a Mercedes four-wheel drive, also travelling behind Mr Fuller’s truck shortly prior to the accident. [21]  There was another vehicle between her vehicle and the truck, she being in the left lane. She described a silver Mercedes sedan in front of her which had been overtaking Mr Fuller’s truck when the truck swung out causing the Mercedes to move “closer to the centre line”. [22]  (It was not put to her that it crossed the centre line.)
	
	
	Ms Jackson was able to say that Mr Fuller’s truck gave a “very slight swerve, very slight evasive swerve to the left”, just after the Land Rover and Tarago van collided, as did the car behind the truck. Otherwise, she was not able to give any clear picture as to what had happened at the time the Land Rover (which she described as “brown” rather than bronze or gold) headed across the road.
	
	
	The third eye witness travelling north was Ms Scott. Her evidence was focused on what happened after the collision and did not deal with the circumstances immediately prior to the collision.
	
	
	A fourth witness, Robert Studd, was unavailable to give evidence, but his statement to police of 16 April 2012 was read onto the record, as was his evidence at the committal hearing.
	
	
	Mr Studd was driving a blue Toyota Aurion. Shortly prior to the accident, he was travelling behind the Mercedes RV. He saw Mr Fuller’s truck pull out in an attempt to overtake a bronze Land Rover Discovery (the applicant’s vehicle). At the end of the overtaking lane, he said that the Land Rover was “marginally in front of the truck” and he saw what he believed to be “a puff of dirt or dust come from the Land Rover” as it merged in front of the truck. He also saw what “appeared to be the rear of the Land Rover lift into the air”. It then turned abruptly to the right in front of the truck and across the road. He described the gap between Mr Fuller’s truck and the Linfox truck as “quite small and probably only a couple of car lengths long.” [23]  Mr Studd also said that from his position he could not see if the truck made any contact with the Land Rover. He did not observe the collision, but only the aftermath. In the course of his evidence in the Local Court, he had explained that he definitely saw the back of the Land Rover “bump up”, but that was before “part of the vehicle had gone in front of the truck”. [24]  He also gave evidence that his initial account which referred to the Land Rover being “shunted” in front of the truck may have indicated that he saw a physical collision, but on thinking about it he was confident he did not. [25] 
	
	
	The eye witnesses travelling behind the applicant’s vehicle and Mr Fuller’s truck were, in effect, unable to describe with any degree of clarity what had happened, although all (except Ms Scott) had been conscious of the Land Rover maintaining its speed, without a clear opportunity to merge into the single remaining lane. What Mr Studd was describing in relation to the movement of the Land Rover was quite unclear.
	
	
	It is convenient to refer next to the evidence of the two southbound drivers. The first was Mr Risson, the driver of the southbound B-double, who had been driving in the centre lane overtaking vehicles in the left hand lane. He described the events immediately prior to the point of impact in the following terms: [26] 
	


“At that point, I couldn’t really see a car until – like when the impact occurred I noticed like the, the truck that had hit – the truck that the car come out in front of – like the truck had shuddered like being hit. And then I saw the car come out in front of me and the reflexes kicked in.”


	
	Mr Risson was on the telephone to his wife at the time. [27]  He also agreed in cross-examination that in his statement he had said that it “looked like the Discovery had been spat out” from between the two trucks. He said “I thought it got spat out, it looked like it had been hit and shunted out.” [28] 
	
	
	The second southbound witness was Brian Crossley-Price. He described seeing a vehicle from the northbound lane “spinning sideways on to my side of the highway”. It was only at that point that he first saw it. He was not able to describe how it had come to be there. He did, however, clarify that by spinning, he meant that it was sideways on to him and that he could see the passenger side door on the vehicle. [29] 
	
	
	It remains to consider the evidence of Mr Fuller, driving the B-double in the northbound lanes, in front of which the applicant’s vehicle crossed the road.
	
	
	Mr Fuller described overtaking a “goldie colour” 4-wheel drive and said that he was gaining on a Linfox single trailer, but did not have room to pass before the overtaking lane finished. [30]  He said that he slowed from 100 down to 95kph and flashed his lights for the Linfox to come out in front him, which it did. He said that the Linfox vehicle was about 30 feet from him when it came out, but he did not get any closer than 30 feet. [31]  He denied being aware of the presence of another vehicle to his left at the time the Linfox truck moved into his lane but said that “[a]fter the left had ended, out of the left front windscreen I seen a four-wheel drive duck back in in front of me on the shoulder of the road.” [32]  He said that in his seat, he was about four feet behind the windscreen and that the part of the vehicle he first saw was its roof. He said that he did not see it in his left hand rear vision mirror and that it was travelling faster than he was when he first saw it. [33]  He said that it “turned across in front of me and it’s gone straight across the road between two southbound trucks.” [34]  He said that that was the last he saw of the vehicle. He agreed he did not stop and that he did not feel anything happen to the prime mover of his truck. [35] 
	
	
	Mr Fuller stated that he used his brakes “after” he saw the vehicle “alongside and then in front of [him]”, by lifting his foot from the accelerator, which brought the engine brake on automatically, and touching the foot on the other brake. He said that the tail lights would not come on when the engine brake was engaged but would come on if the foot brake were engaged. [36]  He said that he swerved a couple of feet to the left after the vehicle ducked in front of him. [37] 
	
	
	Mr Fuller was cross-examined as to what he had said at the Ballina Police Station, where he was spoken to following the accident. One answer was his description of the events in the following terms: [38] 
	


“At the end of the overtaking lane I signalled for the Linfox single trailer truck to move back into the right lane, left lane ended. At that time I noticed the goldie coloured four-wheel drive accelerating up the left hand side.

…

It swerved back in front of me, it slammed on the brakes so it wouldn’t hit the back of the Linfox truck. When it’s hopped on the brakes it’s turned completely sideways.”


	
	A further passage was to the effect that it had crossed the southbound lanes and “collided with a car in the left lane.” Mr Fuller denied saying to the police that it had collided. [39] 
	
	
	Mr Fuller also gave evidence that he had looked in the left hand rear vision mirror before the overtaking lane ended and had seen the gold-coloured 4-wheel drive behind the back of his back trailer. [40] 
	
	
	It was put to Mr Fuller expressly that the 4-wheel drive was in front of him and behind the Linfox truck; that is, he had not got to the stage of overtaking it when the left hand lane tapered to its termination. He disagreed with that. [41]  There was inconsistency in his evidence as to whether he looked back at the time the lanes were merging to see if there was anything on his inside. His final evidence was that he did not. [42] 
	
	
	The other matter which was the subject of disputed evidence was the question whether Mr Fuller’s truck hit the rear of the applicant’s vehicle. The evidence of the eye witnesses was inconsistent with any suggestion that he had braked or slowed down at about that time (except marginally to allow the Linfox in), but it was consistent with the proposition that there was very little room between the front of his vehicle and the rear of the Linfox truck. As will be noted shortly, there was expert evidence as to what part of the truck might have made contact with the applicant’s vehicle to cause it to “spin” in a clockwise direction across the southbound lanes.
	
	
	Although Mr Fuller thought that he had been asked when stopped at Ballina as to the paint on his bull bar, in fact the bull bar was not examined by police until a month later, namely 12 December 2011. A paint scraping was then recovered from the front passenger side corner of the bull bar and was the subject of a scientific analysis. The scientific officer was not called, but an agreed statement was tendered pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). When compared with paint flakes taken from the Land Rover, the expert opinion was that the flakes could not have originated from the same location on the Land Rover, with the result that it was only if there had been an area of repair (as to which there was no evidence) from which other paint had been transferred to the bull bar that the paint could have come from the applicant’s vehicle. In short, the evidence was equivocal.
	
	
	Mr Fuller, however, told police that he had collided with a yellow roadwork sign earlier that day at Tyndale, to the ire of some road workers, which could have been the source of the yellow paint. An investigation carried out by police suggested that no such incident had occurred.
	


Expert evidence


	
	The evidence of Mr Lennon, a crime scene officer with expertise in collision reconstructions called by the prosecution, and Mr Jamieson, a mechanical engineer with expertise in crash investigation and traffic safety, was also equivocal.
	
	
	The claim by the applicant in her statement that she had seen the grill at the front of the truck in her rear vision mirror suggested that the truck was directly behind her at the time she lost her memory of what occurred. The inference that the Land Rover successfully merged in front of the B-double was not consistent with the evidence of the eye witnesses, nor with the tyre marks on the roadway.
	
	
	Mr Lennon was not able to rule out the possibility of some contact, but thought it more likely than not that there was no contact between the applicant’s Land Rover and Mr Fuller’s truck. There was no debris seen on the road and the truck would need to have been going faster than the Land Rover, which he estimated from the tyre marks to have been travelling at 100kph. [43]  Furthermore, he was confident that the movement revealed by the tyre marks, from the northbound lanes across to the southbound lanes was not consistent with the applicant’s vehicle having been hit from the rear. The vehicle had turned in a clockwise direction; yet it was clear that contact between the left hand side of the truck’s bull bar could not have been made with the rear of the applicant’s vehicle, or the spin would have been anti-clockwise. The alternative hypothesis was that any contact made with the front left bull bar of the truck must have been with the right hand side of the applicant’s vehicle which must already have been travelling at an angle across the front of the truck. [44]  If there was no contact, Mr Lennon concluded that the loss of control was likely to have resulted from a “harsh right hand steer”. [45] 
	
	
	Mr Jamieson’s primary evidence was that the truck had been accelerating at the point of impact. That was not only inconsistent with Mr Fuller’s evidence, but was not supported by any of the eye witnesses. Mr Jamieson, however, was unable to rule out the possibility that the Land Rover had in fact moved sharply in front of the truck without contact, in order to leave the marks made by the tyres on the roadway. [46] 
	
	
	Both Mr Lennon and Mr Jamieson agreed that as the Land Rover skidded across the road, the brakes were not locked and, indeed, were almost certainly not on. [47] 
	


Whether the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to guilt


	
	The offences with which the applicant was charged did not in this case involve any difficulty in their application. The jury was required to consider “all matters connected with the management and control of” the car the applicant was driving. [48]  The management of the car must be such as “is in a real sense potentially dangerous to a human being or human beings who as a member or as members of the public may be upon or in the vicinity of the roadway on which the driving is taking place.” [49]  There was no suggestion that the driving itself was other than a voluntary act of the applicant. No further mental element, such as an intention to endanger members of the public, was required.
	
	
	In determining the sole ground of appeal, that is that the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, [50]  the Court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence. [51]  In some respects (though not all) this Court is in as good a position as the jury to evaluate the evidence. That is because (a) key aspects were agreed upon; (b) there was no challenge to the credibility of any witness except Mr Fuller; (c) Mr Studd’s evidence was read onto the record; (d) there was a large measure of agreement between the experts and no issue as to their credibility, and (e) the applicant did not give evidence.
	
	
	That is not to say that the jury would not have been better placed to assess the reliability of the evidence of particular eye witnesses, nor that the evidence of Mr Fuller was not significant - it was clearly treated as significant by counsel for the applicant who cross-examined him at some length. Further, the jury had the usual benefit of hearing and seeing the whole of the trial unfold before them.
	
	
	There was a strong prosecution case which allowed the jury to reach the guilty verdicts. (Given there was one course of conduct, the same verdicts were inevitable on each count.) The question is, therefore, whether at the end of its assessment, this Court would entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant.
	
	
	The material supporting the prosecution case provided ample grounds for the jury to conclude that the applicant was driving in a manner dangerous to other persons at the time she lost control of her vehicle. It may be summarised as follows. First, having driven for 20 hours through the night at an average speed of almost 80kph, the jury was entitled to infer that she had had very little rest and would have been, as she stated to Ms Scott, “tired”.
	
	
	Secondly, she appears to have been on the telephone (albeit hands free) to her husband at the time of the accident. Thirdly, she had apparently made no attempt to slow down even when it was apparent that the lane she was in was about to end and that there was a large truck alongside her (or at best just behind her) in the outside lane. Fourthly, the manoeuvre she appeared to have undertaken to merge into the outside lane from the left hand shoulder of the road, was so fraught with risk as to be dangerous in itself.
	
	
	In essence, any doubt must derive from the driving of Mr Fuller. If his driving were such as to deprive the applicant of an expectation that she would be able to merge safely into the centre lane in front of his truck, an expectation which was thwarted by the aggressive driving of Mr Fuller, it may have been open to conclude that the applicant’s driving involved a misjudgement and even a lack of reasonable care, but did not rise to the level of driving in a manner dangerous.
	
	
	An adverse inference may have been drawn with respect to Mr Fuller’s driving by reason of his earlier attempt to pull out into the centre lane at a time when two vehicles were seeking to pass him. The first vehicle, it may be accepted, was forced into a southbound lane to avoid a collision, itself a dangerous course to take. However, Mr Fuller then returned to the left hand lane, apparently realising his mistake. That conduct appeared to demonstrate lack of proper attention to his driving.
	
	
	The second, and critical element, involved his conduct in letting the Linfox semi-trailer merge in front of him. There was, of course, nothing inappropriate in that course as such; rather, the criticism was that he failed to slow down sufficiently so as to allow a proper distance between the rear of the semi-trailer and the front of his truck, in which case, there might have been room for the applicant also to merge into the centre lane. The distance between the trucks, as indicated by Mr Fuller, was about 30 feet (or 10 metres). It was put to him that that was not a safe distance, but there was no challenge to his factual assessment of the distance.
	
	
	Assuming, there being no evidence one way or the other, that the applicant was driving a safe distance behind the semi-trailer, it must follow that as she approached the end of the inside lane, Mr Fuller’s truck must have been alongside her vehicle, or at best only a short distance to her rear (in the adjoining lane).
	
	
	That evidence does little to assist the applicant. Her statement suggested that she had not seen the truck until it was directly behind her vehicle. The mechanics of the accident suggest that that was highly implausible, because the tyre marks on the road indicated that she must have been travelling across the lane by the time she was in front of the truck. Further, the experts agreed that she could not have been hit by the truck from directly behind her vehicle, or her vehicle would not have travelled across the southbound carriageway, as the tyre marks on the road demonstrated that it did.
	
	
	The fact that the applicant travelled a distance along the shoulder of the road beyond the end of the inside lane was explicable on only one of two bases. One was that she had no idea that the lane had ended, which would not assist her; the other was that she was aware of the truck in the centre lane and knew that there was no room to merge in front of it. The latter alternative, which is the more plausible, is consistent with her then attempting a dangerous manoeuvre.
	
	
	The final question raised by this aspect of the evidence is whether the truck in fact hit the applicant’s vehicle. The first question is whether, even had that occurred, it would have affected the jury’s assessment of the applicant’s conduct. On one view, if a collision occurred, that merely constituted a materialisation of the very serious risk which she took in seeking to drive in front of the truck when there was in fact no room for such a manoeuvre. The prosecutor left the case to the jury on that basis, saying that it was not necessary to decide whether or not there was contact between the truck and the Land Rover. [52] 
	
	
	The eye witness accounts were not consistent in this regard. Of the northbound drivers, none was in a position to see the collision (being behind both vehicles) and the one witness who thought he had seen contact agreed in his oral evidence that he could not have seen that occur and it must have been a reconstruction. The strongest evidence was that of Mr Risson (a southbound driver) who said that he saw the cab of the truck shudder “like being hit.”
	
	
	There was a possibility, unresolved on the evidence, that paint on the left hand front bumper bar of the truck might have come from the applicant’s vehicle. However, the experts were agreed that if there had been a point of contact with any part of the rear of the applicant’s vehicle, the Land Rover would have been turned in an anti-clockwise direction (it in fact turned clockwise) and would probably have been pushed forward by the vastly greater mass of the truck. (The tyre marks were inconsistent with such a movement.)
	
	
	The only plausible explanation was that the left hand front bumper bar of the truck had made contact with the right hand rear mudguard of the Land Rover. Mr Lennon at first could not rule out the possibility of such contact, although he later discarded it. Mr Jamieson accepted it as a possibility, but put it no higher. What led Mr Lennon at first to discount the possibility was that no other part of the vehicle appeared to have made contact with the front of the truck; the truck had to be travelling faster (in a forward direction) than the Land Rover at that point, and there were no tyre marks on the road consistent with the vehicle being spun as a result of an impact.
	
	
	As the prosecutor noted, it was not necessary to resolve the question of contact between the truck and the Land Rover. The jury was entitled to find that the applicant was driving in a manner dangerous at the time (and prior to the time) when she sought to merge into the remaining lane. What happened after the decision to merge was taken did not substantially affect that conclusion. There was no basis in the evidence to conclude that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant.
	


Conclusion


	
	Given the seriousness of the charge, the fact that the applicant appeared to have no recollection of the accident and that the objective evidence was not conclusive as to what had happened, there should be a grant of leave to appeal. Nevertheless, the appeal must be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal against her convictions.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	SCHMIDT J: Having considered the evidence, I agree with Basten JA that, while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal must be dismissed, for the reasons which his Honour has given.
	
	
	WILSON J: I also agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA, and with his Honour's reasons.

		15 June 2016",2016-06-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769689,RKF v R [2016] NSWCCA 116,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

RKF (the applicant) was charged with two counts of aggravated indecent assault against his daughter, SF, and one count of intimidating her with the intention of causing her to fear physical harm.

SF was born in Thailand. For the majority of SF’s early life, the applicant was remanded in custody on drug charges in both Thailand and Italy, all charges of which he was later acquitted. In 2007, SF moved to Australia where she lived with the applicant’s mother. In 2009, the applicant returned to Australia after release from prison in Italy. SF did not want anything to do with the applicant but in 2011, after experiencing relationship difficulties with her grandmother, she moved to Sydney to live with him.

In 2013, the applicant went overseas and the following day, SF was admitted to hospital with liver failure. Family and Community Services were notified. The applicant returned to Australia and SF was transferred to Westmead Children’s Hospital where she underwent a liver transplant, requiring further surgery on two other occasions. On her transfer, SF met a social worker, Ms Carmody, who she told that she did not want to see the applicant. This information was passed on to the nursing staff. As a result, one of the nurses, Ms Chia, described herself as “hyper-vigilant” in respect of any interaction between SF and the applicant.

After SF’s operation, Ms Chia alleged that she came into the room where SF was lying unconscious and saw the applicant place his hand on her breast and stroke it for a few seconds. After SF underwent the final surgery, Ms Carmody alleged that she entered the room where SF was lying unconscious and saw the applicant stroke SF’s breast. These allegations were reported to police and the applicant was informed. Another nurse, Ms Palmer, alleged that when the applicant returned to the hospital, she heard him shouting and threatening SF. In a recorded interview, SF indicated that, as far as she was aware, the applicant had never touched her inappropriately.

The applicant filed an election for a judge alone trial. Senior Counsel for the applicant argued that in order to properly present the applicant’s case it was necessary to explore why SF did not want anything to do with her father, which involved revealing his prior alleged criminality in order to refute adverse inferences arising from his absence and challenge alleged assumptions held by Ms Carmody and the nursing staff. The primary judge refused the application and the applicant sought leave to appeal under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

The issues on appeal were:

1.   Whether the primary judge erred in failing to apply the principle that the applicant was entitled to defend himself by all forensically available means.

2.   Whether the primary judge erred in failing to properly balance the fact that matters concerning indecency should be assessed by objective community standards against the prejudice that would result to the applicant.

3.   Whether the primary judge erred in determining that appropriate directions to the jury could overcome prejudice.

4.   Whether the primary judge took extraneous material into account in considering parts of the interview with SF not relied upon by either party.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Hall and R A Hulme JJ agreeing) dismissing the appeal:

Ground one

(i)   Redman v R [2015] NSWCCA 110 was a case decided on its own facts. To the extent that the statement in that case, to the effect that an accused should not, without good reason, be forced to make a choice between the risk that a jury will be unfairly prejudiced and censoring his or her defence, is a statement of principle, it is not one of universal application: [42], [48] (Bathurst CJ); [57] (Hall J); [58] (R A Hulme J).

Redman v R [2015] NSWCCA 110 distinguished

(ii)   Where the prejudicial evidence sought to be led by an accused has only indirect relevance to an issue in question, prejudice to the accused will have lesser weight in determining an application for a judge alone trial than where the evidence goes directly to an issue at trial: [43]-[44] (Bathurst CJ); [57] (Hall J); [58] (R A Hulme J).

Redman v R [2015] NSWCCA 110 distinguished

Ground two

(iii)   Where the primary judge undertakes the required balancing exercise in determining an application for a judge alone trial and it is not contended that she failed to take into account a relevant matter or took into account an irrelevant matter or that the decision was unreasonable, no House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 error is disclosed: [50] (Bathurst CJ); [57] (Hall J); [58] (R A Hulme J).

House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 applied

Ground three

(iv)   There is well-established authority that there is an assumption that jurors will understand and obey the instructions of trial judges. There is no reason why a jury would not follow a direction that they should not take an adverse view of an accused incarcerated for crimes of which he was acquitted: [45]-[46] (Bathurst CJ); [57] (Hall J); [58] (R A Hulme J).

R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86 applied

Ground four

(v)   Where it is not shown that extraneous material affected the exercise of discretion, it cannot be said that the primary judge took into account irrelevant matters: [52]-[54] (Bathurst CJ); [57] (Hall J); [58] (R A Hulme J).

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: The applicant, RKF (the applicant), was indicted on two charges of aggravated indecent assault on SF in contravention of s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act) and one count of intimidating SF with the intention of causing her to fear physical harm in contravention of s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW).
	
	
	On 15 May 2015, the applicant filed an election for a judge alone trial. This was opposed by the Crown and on 9 November 2015, her Honour Judge Traill refused the application.
	
	
	The applicant has sought leave to appeal under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against this refusal.
	


Background


	
	SF was born in Thailand. She was a child of the applicant and a Thai woman. Shortly after her birth, the applicant was charged with drug offences in Thailand. He was remanded in custody and remained in custody in Thailand until 2006 when he was acquitted of the charges. Thereafter he was extradited to Italy on other drug charges and remained in prison in Italy until 2009 when he was acquitted of those charges. There is evidence that whilst he was in prison in Thailand the applicant saw his family on a regular basis.
	
	
	In 2007, SF and her brother moved to Australia. SF lived with the applicant’s mother in Brisbane whilst her brother lived with the applicant’s sister in Bundaberg.
	
	
	After his release from prison in 2009, the applicant returned to Australia. He attempted to have a relationship with his daughter but she did not want to have anything to do with him. The applicant then moved to Sydney where he supervised a block of apartments in Darlinghurst.
	
	
	In February 2011, SF’s brother, who was a year older than SF, moved to Sydney to live with his father. The evidence suggests that SF had relationship difficulties with her grandmother and behavioural problems such as self-harm and truancy. Consequently, in April 2012, SF came to Sydney to live with her father and brother.
	
	
	On 16 June 2013, the applicant went to Kuala Lumpur. The following day, SF attended Randwick Hospital for liver tests. On 20 June 2013, the applicant returned to Australia. On 24 June 2013, SF underwent a liver transplant operation at Westmead Childrens Hospital. She underwent further surgery on 27 June 2013. On 18 July 2013, the wound had to be re-opened due to liver rejection, requiring further surgery.
	
	
	At the time of SF’s admission to hospital, Family and Community Services were notified. On her transfer to Westmead Hospital she met a social worker, Ms Carmody. She told Ms Carmody she did not want to see her father and did not want to know him. Ms Carmody passed this information on to the nursing staff.
	
	
	After her operation, SF was taken to the paediatric intensive care unit. One of the nurses, Ms Chia, was informed of what SF had told Ms Carmody and described herself as hyper-vigilant in respect of any interaction between SF and her father. Ms Chia alleges that she came into the room where SF was lying unconscious and saw the applicant place his open hand on SF’s breast and stroke it for a few seconds. SF was unconscious, covered by a blanket. This allegation is the basis of the first count of aggravated indecent assault.
	
	
	SF remained seriously ill and the applicant visited her every day. Ms Carmody alleges that after the surgery of 18 July, she went into the intensive care unit where SF was lying unconscious. She alleges that the applicant was in the room and that she saw him stroke her on the head and stroke her over the hospital gown on the left breast. This is the basis of the second count of aggravated indecent assault.
	
	
	Ms Carmody’s allegation was reported to the police and the applicant was informed of it. He visited the hospital on 19 July. Another nurse, Ms Palmer, said she heard the applicant shouting and threatening SF. This is the basis of the third charge. SF stated that she had a memory of her father pointing his finger at her.
	
	
	As I indicated, SF was unconscious at the time the incidents giving rise to the aggravated indecent assault charges occurred. However, in an electronically recorded interview she agreed with the proposition that as far as she was aware, the applicant had never touched her “in a place that he shouldn’t have touched”.
	


The relevant legislation


	
	Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (Criminal Procedure Act) makes provision for judge alone trials. It is in the following terms:
	


“132   Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1)   An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a trial by judge order).

(2)   The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.

(3)   If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.

(4)   If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5)   Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6)   The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7)   The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that:

(a)   there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and

(b)   the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.”


	
	Section 132A, amongst other things, places a time limit on an application for such an order. It is not in contest in the present case that the time limit was complied with.
	


The primary judgment


	
	The trial judge stated that the primary basis for the judge alone trial was the history of the relationship between the applicant and SF, in particular, the reason why she did not want her father to come near her whilst she was in hospital. She noted that senior counsel for the applicant stated that she wished to cross-examine SF about the relationship and ask what the nurses knew or assumed about it. The trial judge stated that senior counsel for the applicant informed her that she intended to explore the mental state of the people who were dealing with SF at Westmead Hospital and the view they had formed of the applicant and submitted that one could only assume their concern was that something in the nature of inappropriate sexual conduct would occur.
	
	
	The trial judge pointed out that there was no evidence that this was what the staff at Westmead had been told or assumed. She pointed out that all the evidence was was that SF stated she did not wish to see her father. She also referred to SF’s denial that there had been any prior sexual assaults.
	
	
	The trial judge also noted the submission that to properly present the applicant’s case and cross-examine witnesses, it was necessary to reveal the accused’s prior alleged criminality. She noted that it was submitted that for the applicant to properly defend himself it was necessary to raise his background in order to explain why his daughter told him she did not want to see him. She noted the submission that the disclosure of that background would prejudice the applicant in the minds of the jury.
	
	
	The trial judge stated that it was difficult to see why the applicant would need to raise his alleged criminality as he had been acquitted of the charges and the nurses and the social worker would have had no knowledge of it. She also stated that appropriate directions could be given to the jury and that there was a large body of authority that juries were generally capable of obeying directions.
	
	
	The trial judge also noted the submission that photographs of SF taken by the applicant shortly after the liver transplant were confronting and inflammatory. Her Honour stated that she viewed the photographs and they were of a young girl covered, lying in hospital with tubes coming out of her arms and mouth. She concluded they were confronting but not inflammatory. I viewed the photographs and agree with the trial judge’s assessment.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the fact that one of the main issues was whether or not an indecent assault occurred and whether the alleged touching over a sheet was in fact indecent. She pointed to s 132(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act noting that the provision envisages an act of indecency as one which requires the application of objective community standards. She stated the matters raised by Count 3 (the intimidation count) also required the application of community standards.
	
	
	Her Honour stated that there is no presumption in favour of a jury trial and no onus on the accused to establish that it is in the interests of justice for the trial to be conducted by a judge alone. She stated, however, that the case was one where the application of community standards was important. She recognised also that the election by the accused for a judge alone trial must carry some weight. However, she ultimately determined that the interests of justice did not require a judge alone trial.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal are as follows:
	



	
	Her Honour erred in failing to consider that the applicant was entitled to defend himself by all forensically available means.
	
	
	Her Honour erred by placing too much emphasis on the fact that the charges of indecent assault required an application of objective community standards.
	
	
	Her Honour erred in determining that appropriate directions could overcome any prejudice.
	
	
	Her Honour allowed extraneous and irrelevant matters to influence her decision to refuse the application.
	


The submissions

The applicant


	
	The applicant submitted that he was entitled to defend himself by all forensically available means and should not, without good reason, be required to make a choice between the risk that a jury will be unfairly prejudiced against him on the one hand and censoring his defence on the other. The submission is based on what was said by Adams J in Redman v R [2015] NSWCCA 110 (Redman) at [16].
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant accepted that it was necessary to demonstrate error in the sense described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 and submitted her Honour erred in law in failing to apply Redman. She submitted that like the applicant in Redman, the applicant in the present proceedings would have to disclose his alleged criminality, in this case to demonstrate why he did not have contact with his daughter. She also said she intended to cross-examine SF about the reasons for her antipathy towards her father.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 2, the applicant submitted that the trial judge failed to balance the fact that the question of indecency requires the application of objective community standards against the prejudice inherent in a jury trial.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant also submitted that her Honour erred in principle in that she did not have regard to the balancing requirement and the serious nature of the prejudicial material. She emphasised that the issue was not a credibility issue in terms of a complainant giving evidence, but instead, concerned challenging the perspective and interpretation of people who observed the incident. She submitted that led into the third ground of appeal, namely her Honour erred in determining that appropriate directions could address any prejudice.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 3, the applicant submitted that where an accused person, in order to properly defend himself, needs to reveal that he has been accused of serious crimes and incarcerated for a significant period of years, the potential for prejudice is high. The applicant referred to what was said by Adams J in Redman at [16] that the law recognises there are cases where, for example, evidence must be excluded because of the potential for prejudice and submitted that in the present case, the prejudice was of such a high order that no direction could overcome it. Senior counsel for the appellant submitted it was necessary to lead evidence of the reason why the applicant came back into SF’s life after a significant period to overcome any prejudice arising from inferences derived from the absence of a relationship.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 4, the applicant submitted that in her Honour’s judgment, the trial judge took into account part of the record of interview of SF which was not relied upon by either party. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the trial judge concluded from that evidence, set out in her reasons, that SF did not like the applicant and that it had nothing to do with inappropriate sexual conduct, but rather, was due to the relationship SF had with her father in 2012 and 2013, which was marked by violence and arguments. The applicant submitted that this was based on material which should not have been taken into account.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant referred to a discussion which took place after the delivery of the judgment in which, after she complained about the trial judge’s use of that material, her Honour indicated that the applicant ran the risk of the matters she had referred to emerging in cross-examination. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that in these circumstances, the trial judge was influenced in deciding against a judge alone trial by her view, based on irrelevant material, that it was unlikely that SF would be cross-examined on her past relationship with her father. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that it was not permissible for the trial judge to rely on this material in support of her conclusion.
	


The Crown


	
	The Crown submitted in reliance on R v BWM (1998) 91 A Crim R 260 (BWM) that an appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act was not a rehearing. It referred in that regard to the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL at 266 and stated that Gleeson CJ concurred with his reasons. In fact, Gleeson CJ expressly reserved his views on that question whilst accepting in that case that the appeal (from a decision giving leave to withdraw acceptance of a plea) was both interlocutory and discretionary: at 261.
	
	
	In relation to Grounds 1-3, the Crown submitted that Redman was not a case of universal application but rather turned on its own facts. It pointed to the fact that in that case, the applicant only had two choices, namely to limit the evidence as proposed by the Crown or otherwise take the risk of being actively prejudiced by giving a candid account.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the present case was wholly distinguishable. It was pointed out that: the complainant was unconscious at the time of the alleged assaults and thus incapable of giving evidence about them; evidence that SF felt antipathy for the applicant was irrelevant to the prosecution case; SF made it clear that she had never been sexually molested by the applicant; the applicant and SF had a father and daughter relationship for two years; and finally, there was nothing in the evidence of the hospital staff to show that they suspected that SF did not want to see her father because of an apprehension of indecent assault.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in those circumstances, it was difficult to see why it was necessary to cross-examine SF in the manner suggested. The Crown also submitted that the trial judge did take into account the submission that the applicant was entitled to defend himself by all available means. It noted she expressly took account of what Adams J said in Redman at [16]. It was further submitted that it was appropriate for her Honour to take account of the fact that juries generally were capable of obeying directions.
	
	
	Counsel for the Crown submitted that it cannot be the position that each and every forensic choice of an applicant needs to be considered in determining whether a judge alone trial is justified.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it was submitted that there was no error of discretion and Grounds 1-3 would not succeed.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 4 the Crown submitted that it had not been shown that the material complained of influenced the decision of the trial judge. The Crown submitted it was merely an amplification of background details.
	


Consideration


	
	Neither party disputed the proposition that as the application for leave to appeal was from a discretionary judgment, it was necessary for the applicant to establish error in the sense described in House v The King. In these circumstances, it is not necessary to give further consideration to the nature of an appeal under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act: see BWM at 261 and 266; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568 at [58]-[60], [78], [81] and [84].
	
	
	In R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86 (Belghar), McClellan CJ at CL set out a number of matters relevant to the determination of an application for a judge alone trial. He indicated that there was no presumption in favour of a jury trial, that the subjective views of the accused in dispensing with a jury trial must be a relevant factor, as is the length of a jury trial compared to a judge alone trial: at [96], [99] and [110]. To this must be added of course the power in s 132(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act to refuse to make an order if the trial involves a factual issue requiring the application of objective community standards including, relevantly, the issue of indecency.
	
	
	The trial judge did not proceed on a presumption in favour of a jury trial and took into account the other matters I referred to above in reaching her conclusion.
	
	
	However, it was contended that the trial judge erred in law in failing to apply what was said by Adams J in Redman. The relevant passage from the judgment is in the following terms at [16]:
	


“[16]   The significance of prejudice must necessarily vary from case to case, depending on the nature of the allegations, the nature of the defence and, of course, the character of the potential prejudice. Although I would not wish to suggest that this is a rule of universal application, there is to my mind an important distinction between prejudicial material proposed to be relied on by the Crown on the one hand and prejudicial material proposed to be introduced by an accused. It is an important principle of justice that an accused person be able to defend himself or herself by all forensically available means and should not, without good reason, be forced to make a choice between the risk that a jury will be unfairly prejudiced against him or her on the one hand and censoring his defence on the other. Of course, if one could be comfortably satisfied that the jury would follow directions to evaluate the evidence without allowing it to prejudice their view of the applicant this issue might be less significant. I would respectfully agree with the observation of Hamill J that ‘…many trials have been conducted in circumstances involving significant prejudice and juries have been capable of discernment and discretion in putting aside their emotional responses and prejudices’ (Simmons at [53]). Furthermore, it is to be assumed that a jury will generally act on the instructions that it is given: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at 425 (McHugh J). Nevertheless, the law itself acknowledges there are cases where, for example, evidence must be excluded because of its propensity to give rise to unfair prejudice (see s 135(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)); Hamill J cited other examples (Simmons at [88]).”


	
	There are a number of matters that need to be considered concerning this submission. First, neither of the other two members of the bench concurred in the passage, each pointing out that the case depended on its own facts: Hoeben CJ at CL at [1]; R A Hulme J at [21].
	
	
	Second, the facts are quite different in the present case. In Redman, the applicant was charged with various sexual offences which occurred around November 2004. The applicant intended to lead evidence saying he could not have committed the offence after 28 November because he was incarcerated from that date until 5 January 2005. It was held that this evidence was so prejudicial it would deprive him of his right to a fair trial and he should not be required to limit his evidence and accept as an agreed fact that he was not in the area where the offence took place after 28 November.
	
	
	By contrast, in the present case the evidence which is sought to be led only has indirect relevance to the issue in question. The evidence of incarceration is apparently sought to be led only by way of explanation of the applicant’s absence from SF’s life. This is in circumstances where SF has stated that there was no previous incident of sexual assault. Further and importantly, unlike Redman, the applicant was acquitted of the charges brought against him.
	
	
	The trial judge considered these issues and considered that any possible prejudice could be overcome by jury directions. In so doing, she was acting in accordance with well-established authority. The position was correctly summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in Belghar in the following terms at [102]:
	


“[102]   The granting of an application on the mere apprehension of prejudice in prospective jurors, not based on evidence or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice (Evidence Act 1995 s 144), is at odds with the assumption which the common law makes that jurors will understand and obey the instructions of trial judges to bring an impartial mind to bear on their verdict: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13] (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J). The fact that an accused person desires a trial by judge alone, although relevant, is not as significant as the reasons for that preference and whether those reasons are rationally justified and bear upon whether he or she will receive a fair trial.”


	
	Despite the assertion by the applicant to the contrary, I see no reason a jury would not follow a direction that they should not take an adverse view of the applicant from the fact that he was incarcerated for crimes which he was found not to have committed.
	
	
	The second area where it was said prejudice would arise was in regard to the ability to cross-examine the nurses and social worker who observed the incidents to the effect that they may have been prejudiced against the applicant because of the comments made by SF regarding not wanting to see her father. There is no evidence of this and it is speculative. If the applicant wishes to risk cross-examining on this issue and an answer is given which the jury cannot properly take into account, once again there is no reason to suggest they would not follow a direction to ignore the evidence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, her Honour did not err in failing to apply Redman. I should add that irrespective of whether there is any principle of the nature of that referred to at [16] of his judgment, Adams J himself recognised it was not a rule of universal application. There is no error in failing to apply it in the present case.
	
	
	Ground 1 of the grounds of appeal is not made out.
	
	
	Ground 2 can be dealt with shortly. Her Honour took into account the potential prejudice if the evidence was led, but concluded it could be overcome by directions. It was not suggested her Honour failed to take into account any relevant matter nor, subject to Ground 4 of the grounds of appeal, that she had taken into account irrelevant matters. Nor was it suggested that the decision was unreasonable in the House v The King sense. In my opinion, this ground has not been made out.
	
	
	The submissions on Ground 3 raise the same issues as those raised in relation to Ground 1. For the same reasons they should be rejected.
	
	
	So far as Ground 4 is concerned, it is correct that the trial judge referred to part of the record of interview which was not relied on by either party. It was not suggested in that context that there was a denial of procedural fairness but rather that she took into account irrelevant matters in reaching her conclusion.
	
	
	The trial judge summarised her conclusion as a result of “a thorough reading of her interview” by saying that SF had a relationship with her father in 2012 and 2013 which was marked on her account by violence and argument. The fact that SF and her father had a relationship over this period was not in issue and a reading of her Honour’s judgment does not disclose that the allegation that the relationship was violent and argumentative was taken into account by her in reaching her conclusion. It does not seem to me that the discussion between senior counsel for the applicant and her Honour after delivery of judgment (see above at [30]) leads to a contrary conclusion.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the relevant material did not affect the exercise by her Honour of her discretion. The ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of R A Hulme J and I agree with his observations.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the result, I am of the opinion that leave to appeal should be given but the appeal dismissed. I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	HALL J: I agree with the Chief Justice and the orders proposed by him.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Bathurst CJ and with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	I wish to make some observations about delay in this case. They are relevant to matters that come to this Court by way of appeal (or application for leave to appeal) pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant was charged in January 2014 and committed for trial in September 2014. A trial was scheduled to proceed in June 2015 but the Crown applied for an adjournment. The trial was rescheduled for November 2015.
	
	
	The trial by judge alone application (which had been filed prior to the June trial date) was heard by Traill DCJ on 5 November 2015. Judgment was given on 9 November 2015. Senior counsel for the applicant then indicated that she had instructions to pursue an appeal in this Court under s 5F(3). It was noted that the transcript of 5 November was already available and the judge said she would order a transcript of the judgment and revise it forthwith.
	
	
	In these circumstances it would have been at least a possibility that the application for leave to appeal could have been brought on very quickly in this Court if the Court's sitting arrangements could accommodate it. Sometimes they can, but not always. However it seems to have been assumed by everyone that the foreshadowed proceedings in this Court meant that a new trial date would have to be fixed. For that reason the trial was effectively vacated and the matter was stood over to the Downing Centre's District Court short matters list on Friday in the following week. The matter is now listed for trial on 8 August 2016, over two and half years after the proceedings commenced. (Two of the charges are of prescribed sexual offences involving a child; proceedings which are usually accorded some priority.) 
	
	
	In years gone by it was often the case that s 5F appeals were brought on in this Court for hearing as a matter of urgency so as not to disrupt the progress of matters in the trial Court. In more recent times it has become common practice for the proceedings in the trial Court to come to a halt and for there to be sometimes quite significant delay while proceedings in this Court are instituted, heard and determined. That is regrettable. It is partly attributable to a proliferation of such appeals involving complex technical arguments as to the admissibility of evidence or the construction of statutory provisions which underlie the interlocutory judgment or order in question.
	
	
	However, not all matters in which an interlocutory judgment or order is sought to be challenged involve matters of complexity. The present is such an example. Challenges to adjournments are another example: see, for example, Cheih-Wei Lin v R [2015] NSWCCA 264 where the decision was made in the District Court on 18 September 2015; the application in this Court was filed on 22 September; and the hearing was held and judgment was delivered on 24 September.  A more recent similar example is Robinson v R [2016] NSWCCA 108.
	
	
	Another example of the expedition that is sometimes possible is A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R [2015] NSWCCA 244 where a trial judge made a pre-trial ruling on Thursday 27 August 2015 and this Court heard and determined an application for leave to appeal the following day so as to permit the trial to commence as expected on 7 September. See, similarly, Turnbull v R [2016] NSWCCA 109.
	
	
	Practitioners involved in proceedings in which one party proposes to bring s 5F proceedings in this Court should alert the trial judge to the possibility that the Court may be able to offer an expedited hearing and determination of the matter so as to enable the proceedings to continue with minimal disruption. The Registrar is readily available by way of telephone and/or email to respond to inquiries about whether it may be possible for the Court to accommodate an urgent or at least early hearing of such applications.

2769713,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Nguyen [2016] NSWSC 883,"Judgment


	
	On 16 November 2015 Hidden J made restraining orders in these proceedings pursuant to s 19 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) against funds standing to the credit of three bank accounts in the name of Thi Huyen Nguyen and three further accounts in the name of her sister Thi Oanh Nguyen. For brevity and clarity, and without intending any disrespect, I will refer to these parties hereafter as Huyen and Oanh. The orders of Hidden J were made ex parte.
	
	
	On 20 January 2016 Lindsay J made further restraining orders under the same section in respect of three further bank accounts in the name of Huyen and two parcels of real property of which she is registered proprietor. His Honour made ancillary orders permitting the National Australia Bank (NAB) to deal with the properties in accordance with the terms of mortgages over them and for the Trustee in Bankruptcy to take custody of the restrained funds in the bank accounts and the properties. Lindsay J's orders were also made ex parte.
	
	
	Before the Court is an amended Notice of Motion filed 30 May 2016 by which Huyen applies under s 42 Proceeds of Crime Act to have Lindsay J's orders of 20 January 2016 revoked. The Notice of Motion also seeks an order under s 24(2) for Huyen's reasonable living expenses to be paid out of the restrained property. This part of the Notice of Motion was abandoned toward the end of the hearing on 16 June 2016.
	
	
	Section 42 is in these terms:
	


“42 Application to revoke a restraining order

(1)  A person who was not notified of the application for a *restraining order may apply to the court to revoke the order.

(1A) The application must be made:

(a) within 28 days after the person is notified of the order; or

(b) if the person applies to the court, within that period of 28 days, for an extension of the time for applying for revocation—within such longer period, not exceeding 3 months, as the court allows.

(2) The applicant must give written notice to the *responsible authority and the *Official Trustee of both the application and the grounds on which the revocation is sought.

(3) However, the *restraining order remains in force until the court revokes the order.

(4)  The *responsible authority may adduce additional material to the court relating to the application to revoke the *restraining order.

(5)  The court may revoke the *restraining order if satisfied that:

(a) there are no grounds on which to make the order at the time of considering the application to revoke the order; or

(b) it is otherwise in the interests of justice to do so.”


	
	Huyen qualifies under subs (1) of s 42 as a person eligible to make the present application. She was not notified of the application to Lindsay J which resulted in the subject orders being made.
	
	
	The application has been brought within the time limited by subs (1A). The original Notice of Motion, of which the document now before the Court is an amendment, was filed on 17 February 2016 within 28 days of Huyen receiving notification of the 20 January 2016 orders. Such notification was sent out to her by the respondent, to whom I will also refer as ""the Commissioner"", on 21 January 2016: Exhibit 1.
	
	
	Subsection (2) of s 42 has been partly satisfied. Notice of this application was given to the Commissioner who is the ""responsible authority"" as defined in s 338. However, notice of the grounds of the application was not adequately given. Huyen's solicitors sent an email to the Commissioner's representatives on 12 May 2016 which simply said that the grounds relied upon were those ""provided by s 42(5)(a) and s 42(5)(b) of the POC Act"". This is not a specification of grounds within the meaning of what is intended by subs (2). If that were all that were required, subs (2) would be redundant because, in terms of merely framing legal grounds or criteria, pars (a) and (b) of subs (5) are always the matters of which one or both must be satisfied if an application for revocation is to succeed.
	
	
	The clear purpose of subs (2) is to require the applicant to particularise his or her attack upon an existing restraining order, not merely to recite the statutory formulation of the test for overturning it. Exactly this point was made in a letter of reply to the applicant's solicitors from the Commissioner's solicitor dated 20 May 2016. This was, in turn, met by a long rejoinder of 27 May 2016 denying, on behalf of the applicant, the obligation to provide any clearer specification of grounds.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that Huyen was unwilling to particularise the basis upon which she would contend that there were ""no grounds on which to make"" the orders impugned (s 42(5)(a)) or that ""the interests of justice"" required that they be set aside (s 42(5)(b)). This rejoinder letter sought confirmation from the Commissioner of the limits of the evidence upon which he would rely for the hearing of the Notice of Motion.
	
	
	No expansion of the basis upon which Huyen would argue that Lindsay J's orders should be revoked was forthcoming until counsel for Huyen proffered to the Court written submissions after the commencement of the hearing of the Notice of Motion on 16 June 2016. In the event, the Commissioner was able to respond to the Notice of Motion sufficiently for his purposes by reading the affidavits which had supported the original applications to Hidden J and to Lindsay J. If the Commissioner had not been able to respond, it would have been open to him to have the Notice of Motion dismissed summarily for want of compliance with the requirement of notice of grounds as stipulated in subs (2) of s 42. Alternatively, the Commissioner could have applied for an adjournment for the purpose of gathering additional evidence if the belated notification of grounds of the application were perceived to make that necessary.
	
	
	Either way, the recalcitrance of Huyen about disclosing the basis of her application had the potential for this hearing of her Notice of Motion, listed for a full day, to be vacated. The failure of the applicant to foreshadow her case also put the Court in a position of not being able to anticipate what the issues would be and not being able to read in advance of the hearing the affidavit evidence and the balance of the Court file in a directed way. The result was an unnecessarily protracted and inefficient hearing. It is only because the Commissioner was able to adapt to Huyen's case, as ultimately revealed, that it became possible for the Court to deal with the matter in the allocated time.
	
	
	Withholding the applicant's case in this manner was in this case, and will usually be, very disruptive. It is strongly deprecated by the Court. To avoid this in future cases, the Commissioner should seek an order from the Registrar, at the time when the hearing date for a Notice of Motion of this nature is listed, requiring the applicant to provide a written outline of its case under s 42 at least two weeks before the hearing date. Further, rather than relying upon the authority of my interpretation of subs (2) of s 42, it would be highly beneficial to the fair and efficient conduct of applications of this type, which are a common occurrence, for that subsection to be amended by Parliament to require that notice be given of ""both the application and full detailed particulars of the grounds on which the revocation is sought"".
	
	
	The applicant tendered no evidence in support of her Notice of Motion. The respondent read affidavits of Federal Agent Morgen Blunden sworn 16 November 2015 and of Federal Agent Trenton Schmidt affirmed 20 June 2016. These were the affidavits relied upon in the applications to Hidden J and to Lindsay J respectively. Objections were taken to pars 16, 21, 25, 38, 42, 51 to 54, 58 to 65 and 68(d) of Mr Blunden's affidavit but I allowed those paragraphs. Objections were taken to Federal Agent Schmidt's affidavit, as per a schedule which I have marked for identification 1 and which I will leave with the file. This listed a large number of paragraphs but I allowed all of them as well. The objections were, for the most part, to relevance and to conclusory statements of the deponents. As will be seen, the matter to be proved in order to support the order under s 19, as made by Lindsay J, included the existence of a suspicion held by a police officer on reasonable grounds. The suspicion which is relevant on the facts of this case is as to the commission of offences the elements of which include further matters of which no more than a reasonable suspicion needs to be shown. It is inherent in a case involving proof of such a state of mind that evidence from police officers of their conclusions and beliefs will be admissible. It is admissible in this case.
	
	
	The issue on the Notice of Motion is whether the Commissioner's affidavits fail to provide grounds for those of Lindsay J's orders which it is sought to have revoked. This proceeding is not by way of an appeal from his Honour's orders which, of course, could not be entertained by a single judge sitting in the Common Law Division. But because the Commissioner has not filed any evidence additional to that which was before Lindsay J the question under s 42(5)(a), whether there are ""grounds on which to make the [subject orders] at the time of considering the application to revoke"" is a question to be answered by looking at the same evidence as that which his Honour read.
	
	
	The applicant does not invoke the general ground of the ""interests of justice"" (provided for by s 42(5)(b)) as a basis for her revocation application.
	
	
	As the orders were originally made under s 19 Proceeds of Crime Act, it is necessary to set out that section for the purpose of seeing whether the two affidavits relied upon by the Commissioner are sufficient to fulfil its requirements. Section 19 provides, omitting irrelevant words and subsections:
	


“19  Restraining orders—property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc.

(1)  A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must order that:

(a)  property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person; or

(b)  property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in the order;

if:

(c)  a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

(d)  there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is:

(i)  the *proceeds of … any other *indictable offence, … or an *indictable offence of Commonwealth concern (whether or not the identity of the person who committed the offence is known); or

(ii)  an *instrument of a *serious offence; and

(e)  the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an *authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)  in any case—the property is proceeds of the offence; or

(ii)  if the offence to which the order relates is a serious offence—the property is an *instrument of the offence;

and including the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion; and

(f)  the court is satisfied that the *authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.”


	
	The Commissioner's affidavits show that Huyen's occupation was given on business records relating to international funds transfers dating from March 2013 as ""student"". Business records of the same kind for May 2013 and October 2015 give her occupation as ""sales representative"". Statements of a bank account at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (“CBA”) in her name show regular fortnightly deposits with the narration ""Salary ACE Insurance Li"" at the rate of about $4,000 per month in the period July to September 2015. The documents I have referred to so far constitute admissible evidence from which it may be inferred, and was inferred by the Commissioner's deponents, that her income in the period from early 2013 to late 2015 has been either nil (as a student) or no more than $4,000 per month (as a sales representative).
	
	
	Huyen ceased to work as a sales representative on 23 October 2015. She has only subsequently obtained part-time work from Friday 10 June 2016. Other documents annexed to the Commissioner's affidavits show that Huyen purchased a house property at Edgeware Road, Enmore in 2013 for $1,050,000. This is one of the properties restrained by Lindsay J’s orders of 20 January 2016. The purchase was completed and the transfer signed on 2 August 2013. There is no indication on title searches or in any other documentary evidence before me that any borrowing was undertaken in order to fund this purchase. Huyen was a 28-year-old student in August 2013. The question arises as to how she was able to purchase outright a house in Enmore for $1,050,000 at that time. Ten months later, on 26 June 2014, Huyen borrowed from the NAB, secured by a mortgage of the Enmore property, a sum of $900,000.
	
	
	In mid-2014, Huyen bought a further house at Bridge Road, Forest Lodge. For this she paid $1,700,000. This is the second property restrained by the orders of Lindsay J. The purchase was apparently settled on about 29 July 2014. In part the acquisition of this property was funded by a loan from the NAB of $1,100,000 drawn down at settlement and secured by mortgage of the Forest Lodge property.
	
	
	For each of these property transactions admissible Land and Property Information searches, lending contracts and other business records are in evidence. The three bank accounts in the name of Huyen, which were restrained by Hidden J's orders made 16 November 2015, held balances totalling $358,000 at the date of restraint. The three further bank accounts in her name, restrained by Lindsay J’s orders, held a total of approximately $2 million as at 20 January 2016. Bank statements constituting admissible business records are in evidence to establish these figures. In addition, Huyen has admitted to having, as at March 2016, and continuing to the present, a further bank account, which is unrestrained, containing $60,000. Thus, by simple arithmetic applied to the assets and liabilities which are proved by admissible documentary evidence, it can be seen that Huyen has net assets of $3 million represented by real property and cash at bank totalling $5 million and bank liabilities totalling $2 million.
	
	
	The bank statements for the various accounts to which I have referred show numerous cash deposits of sums just under $10,000 made in the second half of 2015. These constitute strong evidence that the person who made the deposits did so in contravention of s 142 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). Section 43 of that Act, read in conjunction with the Act's definitions of various terms used, requires that reporting entities, which includes banks, ""must report to the Chief Executive Officer of AUSTRAC transactions which involve cash movements of $10,000 or more"". Section 142 of the Act in subs (1) creates an offence, punishable by imprisonment for five years, if a person is a party to a transaction which is reportable under s 43 and carries it out in a manner and form which would give rise to a reasonable conclusion that the transaction was conducted in that manner and form for the ""sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the money or property involved in the transaction was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a threshold transaction that would have been required to have been reported under section 43"".
	
	
	There is admissible evidence, in the form of business records of the banks at which a number of accounts in the name of Huyen and Oanh are held, which provides a strong basis for inferring that two of the three bank accounts of Huyen which were restrained by Hidden J's orders of 16 November 2015 have received numerous cash deposits deliberately structured to avoid the reporting obligation of s 43. Also two of the three further accounts restrained under Lindsay J's orders exhibit a similar pattern, supporting the same inference. The structured deposits were made between June and October 2015. Two of the three bank accounts in the name of Oanh which were restrained by the orders of 16 November 2015 exhibit similar features.
	
	
	It is a strong inference that such deposits would not have taken place without the knowledge and concurrence of the account holder. Thus, there is a strong basis for suspecting that both Huyen and Oanh have committed, either as principals or as accessories, numerous offences against s 142 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act during the last six months of 2015. The admissible evidence also provides a reasonable basis for suspicion that Huyen has committed the offence of dealing in property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.9(1) Criminal Code (the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)). That subsection is in these terms:
	


“400.9 Dealing with property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime etc.

(1)  A person commits an offence if:

(a)  the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)  it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c)  at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.

Penalty:  Imprisonment for 3 years, or 180 penalty units, or both.”


	
	Subsection (2) provides that element (b) of this offence is ""taken to be satisfied"" if:
	


“The value of the money and property involved in the conduct is, in the opinion of the trier of fact, grossly out of proportion to the defendant's income and expenditure over a reasonable period within which the conduct occurs.”


	
	In this subsection the word ""income"" used in conjunction with the word ""expenditure"" appears to me to denote receipts on revenue account. That is receipts derived from personal exertion, from the conduct of a business, from investments and the like. The word “income” is not apt to denote capital receipts (such as the proceeds of sale of assets) or other inflows of funds (such as gifts). On that construction, the combined net value of the cash at bank and of the equity in real property in Huyen's name appears ""grossly out of proportion"" to her ""income"". This analysis is sufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that she has committed offences against s 400.9(1).
	
	
	Breaches of s 400.9(1) are punishable by imprisonment for three years. The offences which it is reasonable to suspect, on the basis of the admissible evidence presented in this case, would involve unlawful conduct having a benefit in excess of $10,000. Consequently, the breaches of s 400.9(1), which may be suspected here, would be serious offences within the definition of that term within s 338 Proceeds of Crime Act.
	
	
	Subsection (5) of s 400.9 provides as follows:
	


“(5) This section does not apply if the defendant proves that he or she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the money or property was derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from some form of unlawful activity.

Note:   A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5) (see section 13.4).”


	
	This subsection would enable Huyen to defend any charge against her pursuant to s 400.9(1) if she could show that her bank balances and/or the funds used to acquire the real properties came from legitimate sources. Her counsel points to an inflow of approximately $1.5 million to bank accounts in the name of Huyen transferred by her sister from Vietnam in early 2013. There were four large transfers on three dates, between January and May of 2013. Huyen's counsel suggests that these inflows of funds provide explanation for her considerable net assets which, as mentioned, appear grossly out of proportion to her income. The transfers, however, do not, without more, provide any explanation of anything. I reject the submission from the applicant's counsel that these transfers from Oanh could be characterised as ""income"" for the purposes of s 400.9(2)(c). Without more information, which could only come from Huyen or her sister, nor would these inflows in early 2013 support any defence under subs (5).
	
	
	In order to try to characterise these inflows as unimpeachable legitimate sources of funds, without having adduced any evidence about them, applicant's counsel relied upon a portion of the affidavit of Morgen Blunden, which was read before both Hidden J and Lindsay J. Under a heading ""Disclosure of Other Matters"", at pars 66 to 68 Federal Agent Blunden deposed to the transfers which I have mentioned.
	
	
	When that affidavit was sworn, the Commissioner was applying to Hidden J for restraining orders which did not affect the items of real property or the bank accounts which Lindsay J later restrained. He was then seeking to restrain, amongst other things, the balances totalling about $358,000 in a group of bank accounts in the name of Huyen. In those circumstances it was appropriate for the deponent to inform Hidden J of these transfers from Vietnam which would have to be taken into account in determining whether, notwithstanding the inflow of funding from that source, the officer’s suspicions regarding the balances in the bank accounts which the Commissioner was trying to restrain satisfied the criteria for restraint under s 19 Proceeds of Crime Act.
	
	
	In par 68 Federal Agent Blunden deposed that, “notwithstanding” these inflows between January and May 2013, he maintained the suspicions set out in the affidavit that the funds in the bank accounts then sought to be restrained were proceeds of crime.
	
	
	Applicant's counsel seizes upon the words ""disclosure"" and ""notwithstanding"" as if they constituted an admission against the Commissioner that these inflows could not be proceeds of crime; that their receipt could not constitute the handling of proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.9(1) Criminal Code and that, rather, they were necessarily innocent receipts which would go towards explaining balances held. That is an attempt to read far too much into the use of these two words by Federal Agent Blunden. It is quite apparent, from the affidavit of Federal Agent Schmidt, that, two months later, in the second half of January 2016, the latter officer had formed the suspicion that the two items of real property had been acquired using funds which were the proceeds of crime and it is a fair reading of his affidavit that he suspected that the crimes involved may have been offences against s 400.9(1).
	
	
	It has been mentioned above that Oanh's bank accounts have been the subject of inflows of structured deposits of cash in the second half of 2015. The source of the funds which she transferred to Huyen in early 2013 is left completely unexplained by the applicant.
	
	
	The source of the funds which came into the hands of Huyen by June 2013 for the purpose of purchasing the Enmore property and by August 2014 to supply the $600,000 equity necessary to buy the Forest Lodge property is completely unexplained in any innocent fashion.
	
	
	There is a reasonable ground for suspecting that the funds which were used to settle the properties on both dates had been handled in contravention of s 400.9(1). The result of the use of those funds to acquire the two parcels of real property is sufficient to enable the properties themselves to be characterised as proceeds of crime. The definition of that term in s 329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act is as follows:
	


“329 Meaning of proceeds and instrument

(1) Property is proceeds of an offence if:

(a) it is wholly derived or realised, whether directly or indirectly, from the commission of the offence; or

(b) it is partly derived or realised, whether directly or indirectly, from the commission of the offence;

whether the property is situated within or outside *Australia.”


	
	In the same section, subs (2) provides the definition of an ""instrument of an offence"" as follows:
	


“(2)  Property is an instrument of an offence if:

(a)  the property is used in, or in connection with, the commission of an offence; or

(b)  the property is intended to be used in, or in connection with, the commission of an offence;

whether the property is situated within or outside *Australia.”


	
	Where it is reasonable to suspect that the funds used to acquire the properties have been handled in contravention of s 400.9(1), it is also reasonable to suspect that the properties acquired with those funds have been derived ""directly or indirectly from the commission of the offence"".
	
	
	Returning to s 19, on the above analysis it appears to me that the evidence referred to in these reasons provides reasonable grounds to suspect that the two items of real property are the proceeds of an indictable offence.
	
	
	The application for the orders in respect of those two items of real property was supported by the two affidavits to which I have referred, both affidavits being of authorised officers within the meaning of the Act and Federal Agent Schmidt's affidavit stating that he suspects that the two items of real property are proceeds of an offence. For reasons that I have given, I consider that the affidavits sufficiently state the grounds upon which the officer held that suspicion. He has not spelt out in legal analysis just exactly how the offence which he suspects has been committed. It is in the nature of the section, which requires proof of suspicion of an offence, that an officer would not in all cases be able to do that. But by analysing the material upon which he has explicitly relied for his suspicion one can see that it is reasonably supported. Consequently it appears to me that he holds the suspicions stated on reasonable grounds, as required by subpar (f) of s 19(1).
	
	
	On the hearing of the application the applicant's counsel submitted that Lindsay J's order number 5 was indivisible. It is an order that the property specified in schedule 4 to the orders be restrained and not otherwise dealt with. Schedule 4 sets out the particulars of three bank accounts, two of them are NAB accounts, the combined balances of which total approximately $2 million. The applicant's counsel accepts that the prerequisites in s 19 could be established in respect of these two accounts by the evidence that is before the Court on the present Notice of Motion. He submits, however, that that evidence would not substantiate the requirements of s 19 in relation to the third count restrained, which is an ANZ bank account holding a relatively small balance.
	
	
	The applicant’s submission that the order is indivisible is made to support the argument that, in the absence of justification for restraining the third bank account, that which is held at the ANZ Bank, the entire order must fall. This simply does not follow. It is an order which operates with respect to three separate bank accounts. If grounds for revocation were made out in relation to its effect upon only one bank account then it could be revoked, so far as it applies to that bank account.
	
	
	In the event it does not appear to me that there is an absence of grounds for the order to extend to the ANZ account. Because of the very large sums of money held at various times in bank accounts in the name of Huyen and the large and valuable transactions in property and the significant number of separate bank accounts in the name of herself and her sister, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that any money held anywhere by the applicant Huyen would be the proceeds of the commission of an indictable offence. The tracing of money from one account to another is not capable of being carried out rigorously but there are sufficient indications that very large sums may be, on reasonable grounds, suspected of being proceeds of offences of the nature to which I have referred.
	
	
	Section 317 of the Proceeds of Crime Act has the effect that the onus lies upon the applicant to prove the matters which have to be substantiated on an application under s 42. That means that it fell to the applicant to prove that the evidence which was relied upon by the Commissioner, which was the same as that which had been before Lindsay J, would not satisfy the prerequisites and criteria of s 19. The applicant has failed to discharge that onus for the reasons that I have given.
	
	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The amended Notice of Motion filed 30 May 2016 is dismissed.
	
	
	The applicant Thi Huyen Nguyen is to pay the costs of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.

		27 June 2016",2016-06-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769718,Lambaditis v R [2016] NSWCCA 117,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: On 12 June 2015, following his plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter (of Lucio Rodrigues) the applicant was sentenced in the Supreme Court to imprisonment for 9 years, made up of a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months. A maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years is applicable to the offence (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 24). The sentence imposed took into account, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) a further offence of which the applicant admitted his guilt, of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (“the Form 1 offence”), committed on the same occasion as the manslaughter. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence.
	


Facts


	
	An Agreed Statement of Facts was put before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The offence was committed on 3 November 2013, in the CBD of Sydney. The applicant had spent the previous evening in the company of a number of others. The event was what was known as a “buck’s party” to mark the imminent marriage of the applicant’s cousin. The party began in a penthouse suite in the city leased for the occasion. Food and alcohol were served. In the early hours of 3 November the party left the penthouse and went to a number of bars in the vicinity. Two of the venues refused them entry because of their perceived state of intoxication. At about 3.00am, near an inner city hotel, the applicant and his party encountered a group that included Mr Rodrigues and another man, Eric Heward. An altercation ensued. Initially, this appears to have involved abusive language. The applicant then struck Mr Heward with his right hand, causing Mr Heward to stumble backwards and fall to the ground. This constituted the offence of assault on the Form 1.
	
	
	After the applicant struck Mr Heward, Mr Rodrigues stepped forward and punched the applicant to the left side of his head, causing him to step backwards, but not fall. Mr Rodrigues then stepped forward and kicked towards the applicant. The applicant managed to deflect the kick with his hands, and again stepped backwards. He punched in the direction of Mr Rodrigues, but failed to connect; Mr Rodrigues stumbled backwards. The applicant again punched towards Mr Rodrigues. This punch connected with Mr Rodrigues’ head. Mr Rodrigues fell backwards to the ground. The applicant and his party left the scene and returned to the penthouse apartment.
	
	
	Mr Rodrigues died in hospital two days later. The cause of death was stated in the Agreed Facts in the following terms:
	


“a.   severe blunt head injury comprising of brain swelling, bilateral subarachnoid haemorrhage, bilateral subdural haemorrhage, extensive bilateral cortical contusions/lacerations with parenchymal extension, and recent infarction

b.   extensive fragmentation of the brain;

c.   most parts of the right brain hemisphere were herniating through a large craniectomy;

d.   numerous mostly smaller base of the skull fractures;

e.   blunt injuries (bruising and laceration) of the lips and the inner lining of the mouth on the left side, however no teeth or tongue injuries were noted and no maxillary fractures were identified.”


	
	The applicant was arrested later that morning. He was charged with murder. He offered, and the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment, a plea of guilty to manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	The incident was captured on CCTV footage which was in evidence at first instance, and which this Court was urged to view, and has viewed.
	


The applicant’s personal circumstances


	
	Evidence of the applicant’s personal circumstances was given in a psychological report, and in oral evidence given by both the applicant and his mother. In addition, the applicant’s mother provided a letter addressed to the sentencing judge, and a number of individuals provided references and testimonials. The following was thus disclosed.
	
	
	The applicant was born in January 1980 in New Zealand, of parents of Greek origin. He was therefore 33 years of age at the time of the offence. He had a minimal criminal record, consisting only of a single offence of driving with the medium range of prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, committed in 2010.
	
	
	The family migrated to Australia when the applicant was a baby. His parents divorced when the applicant was 3 years of age. The applicant lived with his father for the first year thereafter, and then with his mother and her second husband, but maintained regular contact with his father. Both the applicant’s mother and her second husband were alcoholics and there was some violence between them. The applicant was not the victim of physical abuse. Notwithstanding her alcohol addiction, the applicant’s mother worked hard to make an education available to him, and he was secure in her affection for him. His mother gave up alcohol consumption when the applicant was 11 years of age.
	
	
	He was sent to a private school, but was a somewhat disruptive student with a short attention span. His academic performance was undistinguished. He left school with the School Certificate, and commenced an apprenticeship as an electrician in the organisation where his step-father worked, but the apprenticeship was withdrawn after six months because the applicant was not performing to expectation. He then had a variety of jobs. As at the date of the offence he was employed in the security industry, apparently engaged in some responsible positions.
	
	
	The applicant is the father of twin boys, now aged 16. He had some early contact with them, but withdrew when the mother of the children (with whom he had not been in a relationship) married and her husband objected to the applicant’s involvement. The applicant was not involved in any committed relationship as at the date of the offence. The applicant told the psychologist that he drank alcohol on weekends, on one night to the point of intoxication. The psychologist considered that his answers to a questionnaire indicated a level of psychological dependence and compulsive use of alcohol, although he (the applicant) did not consider his use to be problematic.
	
	
	The applicant’s mother’s letter described the applicant’s childhood in more detail, particularly in relation to her alcoholism and the effect it had on him. She wrote:
	


“Nicholas had a very difficult childhood, spending a lot of his childhood, back and forth between his dad and myself. I know that was very difficult for him, feeling he had been left behind, his father remarrying and having a new family and I failed to give him the childhood he rightly deserved, due to suffering from the disease of alcoholism. I have been sober for 25 years, but still took Nicholas down a very rocky road for the first 10 years of his life and whilst I was recovering and trying to understand my disease. For many years I have tried to reverse the damage, but I left scars that he has tried very hard through his life to recover from and I believe he is doing everything he can to maintain a healthy mind and not allow his past to dictate his future.”


	
	The referees also attested to the applicant’s general good character and work ethic.
	
	
	Much of the applicant’s evidence was directed to the circumstances of the events of 3 November. He said that he had never had any intention of causing really serious harm either to Mr Heward or to Mr Rodrigues. He said that, at the time he struck Mr Heward, he was not aware of the presence of Mr Rodrigues, and he did not intend to carry on the fight. He only became aware of Mr Rodrigues’ presence after Mr Rodrigues punched him. He said that he retaliated because he felt threatened and felt he had to act. When asked how he felt (at the time of giving evidence) about his conduct, he answered:
	


“I think reckless beyond measure, really. Didn’t consider anybody’s welfare

or my own welfare.”

He said that generally when he drank alcohol he became “a happy drunk”. He expressed, both to the psychologist, and in his evidence, a considerable degree of remorse about the events.


	
	Before the sentencing judge were Victim Impact Statements by the parents and the sister of Mr Rodrigues, and also by Mr Heward. Those of the Rodrigues family attested to the great loss they suffered. These Victim Impact Statements were treated, without suggestion of error, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	On the basis of the content of the Agreed Statement of Facts, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant was affected by alcohol and in an angry state of mind after being turned away from the two venues. He accepted that it was the applicant who struck the first blow (which may have been in response to a comment made by Mr Heward) and that Mr Rodrigues’ reaction in hitting out at the applicant was precipitated by the applicant’s assault on Mr Heward. He said that the CCTV footage established that the events moved at a very fast pace, and that the applicant was “plainly intent on escalating the violent incident”.
	
	
	He recounted, in some detail, the evidence concerning the applicant’s personal circumstances. He noted a number of cases said to be comparable to which he was referred by either the Crown or by the applicant’s counsel. He expressly found that, for the purposes of s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, there were no aggravating factors to be taken into account.
	
	
	Contrary to the submissions of defence counsel who urged that the objective gravity of the offence was less than mid-range, the sentencing judge found the objective gravity to be “at least mid-range”. That was attributable to four factors:
	



	
	the applicant’s intoxicated and angry state of mind;
	
	
	the level of violence meted out to Mr Heward, which drew Mr Rodrigues into the violent episode, and was initiated by the applicant;
	
	
	the severity of the applicant’s attacks upon Mr Heward and Mr Rodrigues;
	
	
	the force with which the applicant struck Mr Heward, causing him to fall to the ground, and the force of the punch to the head of Mr Rodrigues which similarly propelled him and which caused him to hit his head on the pavement.
	



	
	He then said:
	


“95  This is a case of alcohol-fuelled violence of a high order. It is not in the type of case of injury inflicted in the course of a drunken brawl involving an offender and victim. On the findings made to which I have earlier referred, the offender drew the deceased into a violent confrontation which was entirely of his own making.”


	
	The sentencing judge then referred to the decision of this Court in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120, and said:
	


“98  Although reference is often made to one-punch or single-punch manslaughter cases as constituting a particular class of case, as the Court in Loveridge observed the circumstances of these cases vary widely: at [215]. Additionally, in Loveridge the Court of Criminal Appeal stated that the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place, is of great concern to the community and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence. It is clear in the present case that the sentence to be imposed must, in an appropriate way, give effect to the principle of general deterrence in the sentencing exercise.

…

100  There are some similarities to the facts in Loveridge to this case although there are also facts that distinguish that case from the present, including the fact that in that case the offender had a history of violent offences and was the [sic] subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offence in question.

…

102  The attack upon Mr Rodrigues was, as in the case of Loveridge, both cowardly and unprovoked. It is a serious example of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter which deserves substantial punishment. The offender in the present case, as I have earlier noted, was aged 33 years of age at the time of the offence, the offender in Loveridge was 18 years and 4 months …”

His Honour went on to refer to other circumstances distinguishing Loveridge from the present case, and identified relevant sentencing considerations such as the applicant’s subjective circumstances, general and specific deterrence, and said:

“Although there is no evidence of prior instances of alcohol-fuelled violence by the offender, the facts and circumstances of the present case, so far as specific deterrence is concerned, indicates that the offender has a potential vulnerability to outbursts of violence in circumstances where excessive drinking and frustration and/or anger combine. On this basis, I consider that specific deterrence is a factor to be given some consideration and weight as appropriate in the sentencing exercise.”


	
	He accepted (at [111]) that there was evidence from a variety of sources including the applicant’s own evidence, of remorse. He considered the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation to be reasonable.
	
	
	He noted the Form 1 offence and stated specifically that the sentence that he was about to impose took that offence into account. He declined to make any variation, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, to the ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence. He took into account the applicant’s plea of guilty and stated his intention of reducing the sentence to be imposed by 25 per cent for that reason.
	


The application for leave to appeal


	
	In written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant five grounds of appeal were identified, as follows:
	


“I.  The Judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence as he failed to consider material considerations such as provocation, self-defence;

II.  The Judge erred in his reliance on the case of Loveridge … which should have been distinguished on a factual basis and as such failed to deliver an individualised sentence;

III.  The Judge erred in giving consideration and weight to specific deterrence;

IV.  The Judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to mitigating factors of remorse, prospects of rehabilitation and previous good character;

V.  The sentence was manifestly excessive.”

At the hearing, it was made clear that the sole ground upon which reliance was placed was the fifth, that the sentence was manifestly excessive.


	
	On behalf of the applicant, a good deal of emphasis was placed upon what was said to be the reliance by the sentencing judge on the decision in Loveridge. Reference was also made to passages in the evidence, particularly those passages in which the applicant said that he considered himself to have been under threat or under attack. Although no ground of appeal (as argued) challenged the sentencing judge’s findings of fact, it did appear at times that the argument was to the effect that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account relevant factual material. As to the contention that the sentencing judge failed adequately to deal with the applicant’s evidence of his state of mind, that is, that he considered himself to be under threat, the Court was urged (by both parties) to view the CCTV footage. My viewing of the footage persuades me that the applicant’s evidence that he so considered himself ought to be treated with extreme caution. The video footage shows that the applicant is a very large, powerfully built, man. It shows him first throwing a punch at Mr Heward, and then two punches at Mr Rodrigues. In each case it can be seen that the punch is thrown with a great deal of force. The first punch, thrown at Mr Heward, was not preceded by any threat of violence from either Mr Heward or Mr Rodrigues.
	
	
	The complaint concerning reliance on Loveridge is, in my opinion, misconceived. It appears to arise, not from anything said by the sentencing judge, but from some undoubted similarities between the two cases.
	
	
	In Loveridge, the offender was in the Kings Cross area with a number of others, having earlier consumed significant quantities of alcohol at other locations. He manifested aggression towards one man, which resulted in a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He then assaulted Thomas Kelly, by punching him, causing him to fall to the ground and hit his head on the pavement. The impact of the pavement caused a severe fracture to Mr Kelly’s skull and severe injuries to his brain which proved fatal (at [26]). That attack was entirely unprovoked. Mr Kelly and the offender were not known to one another.
	
	
	After that event, the offender assaulted three other men in similar circumstances. Each assault was unprovoked, and in each case the victim was unknown to the offender.
	
	
	The similarities are obvious. The principal similarity between the two cases is that, in each, the offender was intoxicated, in public places at night (in the Loveridge case the principal offence was committed at about 9.45pm, somewhat earlier than that of the applicant) and, without provocation, attacked a stranger, with a single punch, as a result of which the victim fell to the ground and suffered fatal injuries. In Loveridge, the injury appears to have been caused by the victim having hit his head on the pavement ([26], [35], [36]). In the present case, it is not clear whether the fatal injury was caused by Mr Rodrigues’ head striking the pavement, or by the punch to the head, or a combination of the two. That is the significance of the evidence of cause of death set out above. The “blunt force” may have been the punch to the head (which might say something about the force of the blow), or the impact with the pavement.
	
	
	There were also significant points of departure between the two cases. Loveridge had a history of prior offences of violence, including one recent one in respect of which he was subject to conditional liberty. The offence of manslaughter was not his only offence of violence on the night of the manslaughter; both before, and after, he attacked that victim, Loveridge attacked, unprovoked, several other men.
	
	
	Loveridge was significant younger, and was entitled consideration for a severely deprived upbringing: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571.
	
	
	At first instance, in respect of the manslaughter offence, Loveridge was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. That sentence was part of a more extensive sentencing exercise by reason of the need to sentence him for the four separate assaults, all committed on the same evening, as part of an ongoing episode of serious and violent criminality.
	
	
	After a successful Crown appeal, in respect of the manslaughter offence, the sentence imposed on Loveridge was increased to imprisonment for 10 years, with a non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	In Loveridge, this Court said:
	


“215  Firstly, it is not meaningful to speak of one-punch or single-punch manslaughter cases as constituting a single class of offences. The circumstances of these cases vary widely and attention must be given to the particular case before the sentencing court.

216  Secondly, the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place is of great concern to the community, and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence …

…

227  The myriad circumstances of manslaughter offences render it unhelpful to speak in terms of a range of sentences, or tariff, for a particular form of manslaughter. …

…

229  When sentencing for manslaughter, a court must always have regard to the full context in which death was caused … The surrounding circumstances may bear upon the objective gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender …”


	
	The difficulty with the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant is that the sentencing judge did not treat the sentence imposed on Loveridge as governing the sentence to be imposed on the applicant. He recognised that there were relevant differences between the two cases, including those that favoured the applicant. The sentence imposed does not suggest that the sentencing judge treated the decision in Loveridge as determining the sentence to be imposed – the sentence he imposed was less than that imposed on Loveridge for manslaughter. The references to the judgment in Loveridge were made with respect to the principles therein stated.
	
	
	In R v McNeil (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1198 R A Hulme J sentenced in respect of another so-called “one punch” unprovoked assault that resulted in the death of the victim, together with other offences. Pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence, but, in accordance with s 53, specified the sentences he would have imposed if sentenced individually. He nominated 9 years for the manslaughter. (It was not necessary nor appropriate to specify a non-parole period.)
	
	
	Counsel who represented the applicant at first instance put before the sentencing judge a number of previous cases which might thought to be broadly comparable, or at least to have some comparable features: R v Field [2014] NSWSC 1797; R v Dyer [2014] NSWSC 1809; R v Matthews [2015] NSWSC 49; R v Lane (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 118. In each case the sentence was less than that imposed on the applicant, in some cases significantly so. That does not establish error in the sense that the sentence imposed lay outside the wide range legitimately open.
	
	
	At times also, it appeared to be suggested that too much weight was given to the need for the sentence to recognise specific deterrence, but this was not (and could not properly have been) pressed with any rigour. It is true that the applicant’s history was not indicative of a tendency towards violence, but it could scarcely be denied in the whole of the circumstances that some element of specific deterrence was required to be reflected in the sentence, and nothing indicates that that consideration was elevated beyond what was appropriate.
	
	
	Although it is well recognised that manslaughter is a widely divergent offence, and the personal circumstances of each offender must be given their full weight, Loveridge and McNeil demonstrate that the sentence imposed on the applicant was well within the range of sentences that might be expected, and falls within the legitimate sentencing discretion. It was not correct, as appeared to be suggested, that the sentencing judge failed to take into account relevant evidence; the Remarks on Sentence show that he gave full weight both to the objective circumstances and the applicant’s personal circumstances.
	
	
	No basis has been demonstrated for interference with the sentence imposed in the Supreme Court.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence granted;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	GARLING J: I agree with Simpson JA.
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with Simpson JA.

2769743,NSW Police v Everingham [2016] NSWLC 10,"Judgment


	
	Application is made on behalf of Jason Douglas Everingham that in relation to the matters before this court of common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and intimidation, he be dealt with under the provisions set out in section 32, Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	


Relevant legislation - s 32, Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act

32 Persons suffering from mental illness or condition 

(1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a M agistrate, it appears to the Magi strate:

(a) that the defendant is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate):

(i) developmentally disabled, or

(ii) suffering from mental illness, or

(iii) suffering from a mental con dition for which treatment is available in a mental heal th facility,

but is not a mentally ill p erson, and

(b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the M agistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law,

the Magistra te may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3).

(2) The Ma gistrate may do any one or more of the following:

(a) adjourn the proceedings,

(b) grant the defendant bail in accordance with the Bail A ct 2013 ,

(c) make any other order that the Magistr ate considers appropriate.

(3) The Magistrat e may make an order dismissing the charge and discharge the defendant:

(a) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions, or

(b) on the condition that the defendant attend on a person or at a place specified by the Mag istrate for assessment of the defendant’s menta l condition or treatment or both, or

(c) unconditionally.

(3A) If a Magist rate suspects that a defendant subject to an order under subsection (3) may have failed to comply with a condition under that subsection, the Magist rate may, within 6 months of the order being made, call on the defendant to appear before the Ma gistrate.

(3B) If the defendant fails to appear, the Magistr ate may:

(a) issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest, or

(b) authorise an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Pr ocedure Act 1986 to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest.

(3C) If, however, at the time the Magi strate proposes to call on a defendant referred to in subsection (3A) to appear before the Mag istrate, the Ma gistrate is satisfied that the location of the defendant is unknown, the Magis trate may immediately:

(a) issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest, or

(b) authorise an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Proced ure Act 1986 to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest.

(3D) If a Magis trate discharges a defendant subject to a condition under subsection (3), and the defendant fails to comply with the condition within 6 months of the discharge, the Magist rate may deal with the charge as if the defendant had not been discharged.

(4) A decision under this section to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.

(4A) A Magis trate is to state the reasons for making a decision as to whether or not a defendant should be dealt with under subsection (2) or (3).

Matters for consideration


	
	In DPP v El Mawas [2006]  NSWCA  154 at [75], [76] and [80], McColl JA said that there were at least three decisions to be made by a magistrate in dealing with a s  32 application.
	
	
	The first question is whether the defendant was eligible to be dealt with under the section, which involves a finding of fact of the relevant mental condition – does it fall within the provisions of section 32(1)(a)(i), (ii) or (iii). I will return to this point later in the judgment. The defendant has been ‘diagnosed’ as having a Major Depressive Disorder.
	
	
	Rather than at this point making a finding of fact of the relevant mental condition, I will make an assumption to that effect for the purpose of considering the second question - which is whether having regard to the facts alleged in the proceedings or such evidence as I may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant pursuant to s  32 rather than in accordance with the law.
	
	
	If it is more appropriate to deal with the defendant pursuant to s  32, the third question is then enlivened as to which of the actions set out in s 3 2(2) or (3) should be taken.
	
	
	In determining the second question, I have had regard to the agreed facts sheet (noting its tender as an agreed form of the facts); the criminal antecedents of the applicant; two colour photographs of the injury received by the victim in relation to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm matter; the psychological report of Margaret Johnson dated 8 June 2016; a letter from Dr Vijay Pandya dated 16 May 2016 and a further letter from the doctor dated 26 May 2016.
	
	
	In Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2004] NSWSC 1159 at [17] Howie J provided guidance in answering this question:
	


In order to determine whether it is more appropriate to deal with the applicant under Part 3 the Magistrate has to perform a balancing exercise; weighing up, on one hand, the purposes of punishment and, on the other, the public interest in diverting the mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system. It is a discretionary judgment upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions in any particular case. But it is one that cannot be exercised properly without due regard being paid to the seriousness of the offending conduct for which the defendant is before the court. Clearly the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the community and the less likely will it be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It should be emphasised that what is being balanced is two public interests, to some extent pulling in two different directions. It is not a matter of weighing the public interest in punishment as against the private interest of the defendant in rehabilitation.


	
	The nature of the charge itself certainly does not preclude the consideration of discretion being exercised in favour of the defendant. There are both more and less objectively serious offences before the courts where such applications have been either granted or refused.
	
	
	It is submitted that the objective seriousness of the matters is at the lower end. There was no planning involved. It is submitted that acts were impulsive and related to the applicant’s mental condition because he was unable to control his emotions. Ms Johnson, psychologist notes at paragraph 31.4:
	


Mr Everingham’s capacity to make good decisions in light of any situation that he felt his opinion, integrity or the reputation of someone he loves was questioned was compromised as a result of his, then, untreated major depressive disorder. His depressive illness was characterised by chronic irritability and during the course of his life he has tended to act aggressively when threatened in any way. The depressive disorder exacerbated this tendency.


	
	I am of the opinion that the objective seriousness of the offending conduct for the common assault matter is around mid-level; for the intimidation matter is below mid-level and for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm is above mid-level.
	


Facts


	
	The incident occurred in the context of a board meeting of the Dubbo Kart Club. The victim, Bert Wrigley, and the defendant are certainly acquainted with each other. They are in competition in business. The defendant believed that Mr Wrigley had made negative comments about the canteen at the last board meeting. The facts indicate that after initial verbal abuse by the defendant to Mr Wrigley, “other board members began to intervene to calm the situation, stating that nothing was actually said last meeting, and that [the defendant’s] actions were unfounded.”
	
	
	The defendant continued to rant and rave, stood up, rushed the victim to become face to face, continued swearing and threw a number of punches with both hands to the head and face region of the victim. The defendant was restrained but said, “I’ll get ya”, “I’ll find ya”, I’ll catch up with ya.” He continued to rant and rave, again rushed the victim who this time stood up. The defendant punched the victim to the head and face before being restrained and pulled away and forcibly returned to his seat.
	
	
	The defendant stood up holding a schooner glass containing beer, cocked his arm and threw it a distance of 3 metres in the direction of the victim, who raised his right arm to protect himself. The glass hit another glass and both shattered, sending glass shards about the place. The victim felt glass hit his head, arm and body. He received a 2-3cm bleeding laceration to his right arm. The photos are consistent with the description contained in the agreed facts. The laceration was only noticed later by the victim – with a description of a 2-3cm laceration on the back of his right arm which was bleeding down his arm. Further verbal abuse took place which give rise to the intimidation matter – “Fuck off you dog”, “If the cunt thinks this is over, it isn’t. I’ll flog the cunt”, “C’mon let’s go outside to fight”, “Good fuck of then, I’ll fucking find ya.”
	
	
	There was an escalating level of violence, punctuated only by the intervention of other board members. The incidents were unprovoked. If, as it says in Dr Pandya’s letter of 16 May 2016 that the alleged victim “had abused his [the defendant’s] wife and this made him lose his temper and hit the victim”, any such abuse (if it occurred at all) did not occur immediately prior to the incidents of violence – the inference from the defendant is that it happened at a prior board meeting. This detracts from the suggestion of impulsivity.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant described the injury as a scratch. I took issue with that as it was inconsistent with the agreed facts, and in my opinion inconsistent with the colour photographs. There is no doubt that the injury satisfies the element of actual bodily harm. I proceed on the basis that the injury is as described in the agreed facts (see Khanwaiz v R [2012] NSWCCA 168 per Beech-Jones J at [94] to [96]).
	
	
	The use of a weapon is an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(c), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 – though we are not dealing with sentence. It is also an aggravating factor as set out in Nowak v The Queen (2008) 183 A Crim R 526 at 529. This is of some significance in determining the seriousness of the matter.
	
	
	There was no degree of planning.
	
	
	The public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the community is very high. In this case, the seriousness of the offending conduct makes more important the public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the community and less likely that it is appropriate to deal with the defendant under section 32.
	
	
	Having considered all of the evidence available to me, I am not of the opinion that it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of section 32 than otherwise in accordance with law.
	


Section 32(1)(a)(iii) pre-conditions not met


	
	I should also indicate the following. Nowhere in the psychological report does it deal with the requirements of s 32(1)(a). There is a lack of evidence that the defendant suffers from a condition for which treatment is available in a mental health facility – a fundamental jurisdictional requirement as discussed in Edwards v DPP [2012] NSWSC 105 at [14]-[21]. There is no classification by the psychologist that the Major Depressive Disorder is a mental illness, which would obviate the need for the previous point. These matters are not to be assumed or inferred.
	
	
	The treatment plan is generic and non-specific to this defendant. It is certainly not a clear and effective plan within the meaning given in the case the prosecutor relies upon, Perry v Forbes & Storey (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 21 May 1993) at 15:
	


Practically, he [the Magistrate] needed to have placed before him a clear and effective treatment plan and one which was likely to ensure that there would not be a repetition of the incident in question or the occurrence of some other unfavourable incident.


	
	Order:
	



	
	The application is refused.

		04 August 2016",2016-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2769744,R v Macdonald; R v Maitland (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 865,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Ian Macdonald is due to stand trial on indictment of two charges of misuse of public office. John Maitland is due to stand trial on indictment of two charges of aiding abetting counselling and procuring that offence.
	
	
	By notice of motion filed in court on 9 May 2016 Mr Maitland seeks a permanent stay of his criminal proceedings. In the alternative, he seeks a temporary stay until any person who has access to evidence compelled from Mr Maitland in the inquiry conducted by Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is no longer involved in his prosecution. Mr Maitland no longer presses his claim that the evidence of the following witnesses be excluded on the basis that their witness statements were prepared after his compelled evidence in ICAC was disclosed to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP): Nathan Rees, Michael Costa, Brad Mullard, Alan Coutts, Richard Sheldrake, Patricia Madden, Sue-Em Tan, Richard Jones, Brendan McPherson, Anthony Maher, Jason Bartlett, Nicole Williams, Nicholas Papallo, Luke Foley, Paul Bastian, Jamie Gibson, James Chisholm, Michael Buffier, Peter Coates, Paul Healy, Gary Gibson and Archibald Tudehope.
	
	
	However, Mr Maitland, in final address, sought an order that the evidence of these witnesses (which had been taken by persons who had had access to the evidence compelled from the applicants) could not be used. The effect of such an order would be that the process of preparing admissible evidence from such witnesses would have to begin again and be undertaken by persons who had not had access to the evidence compelled from the applicants.
	
	
	By notice of motion filed on 16 May 2016 Mr Macdonald seeks orders in similar terms. Mr Macdonald made corresponding amendments to the relief sought as those made by Mr Maitland. The Crown opposes the orders sought.
	
	
	Mr Maitland and Mr Macdonald (the applicants) contended that a permanent stay was warranted on the ground that the present trial cannot be conducted in accordance with the accusatorial system of criminal justice since the DPP himself, Mr Walkowiak and Mr English had been privy to their compelled evidence and retain a role in their prosecution. They submitted that knowledge of their compelled evidence was of assistance to the DPP himself, his staff and counsel briefed, not only in formulating charges but also in gathering evidence for the prosecution case. In the alternative, they submitted that there should be a temporary stay of these criminal proceedings to ensure that no person who has had access to evidence compelled from them in ICAC over their objection is involved in the conduct of the prosecution any no evidence prepared by such persons is used.
	
	
	The Crown contended that the applicable statutory provisions authorised (and indeed required) such disclosure as was made. It also submitted that the so-called “companion principle” (that the prosecution cannot compel an accused person to assist in the discharge of its onus of proof) was not engaged until the applicants were actually charged, which occurred after their compelled evidence was provided by ICAC to the DPP. No further evidence was compelled from the applicants after they were charged and, accordingly, no breach of the companion principle occurred. Further, the Crown submitted that the lawyers involved in the prosecution case who had read the compelled evidence had done so solely for the purpose of advising the DPP whether charges should be laid, including charges contrary to s 87 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) (the ICAC Act). They had little recall of the compelled evidence and had not, in any event, had resort to such evidence in the preparation of the prosecution case. Accordingly any prejudice was speculative and had not been established. The Crown also relied on the artificiality of requiring material which had entered the public domain (through the public inquiry itself and the posting of the transcripts on the internet through ICAC’s website) to be kept from the DPP and anyone involved in the prosecution of the applicants.
	
	
	The submissions of the parties will be set out in more detail below after the relevant statutory provisions are addressed.
	


The relevant statutory provisions


	
	The questions whether, and to what extent, Parliament has authorised the compelled evidence to be disclosed to the DPP (and for what purpose) and whether it has abrogated the privilege against self-incrimination or affected the companion principle, are to be determined, largely, if not wholly, by reference to the relevant statutory provisions. Accordingly, it is necessary to address the legislation in some detail, including the statutory provisions which have been considered in the authorities relied upon.
	


Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW)


	
	The principal objects of the ICAC Act are to constitute ICAC as an “independent and accountable body” “to investigate, expose and prevent corruption involving or affecting public authorities and public officials” as well as to “educate public authorities, public officials and members of the public about corruption”: s 2A.
	
	
	Part 3 deals with “corrupt conduct”. Section 8 defines corrupt conduct in very broad terms. Section 9 provides that, despite s 8, conduct does not amount to corrupt conduct unless it could constitute or involve any one of four identified matters, one of which is a criminal offence (s 9(1)(a)).
	
	
	The effect of the ICAC Act is that a finding of corrupt conduct on the basis of s 9(1)(a) requires ICAC to be satisfied that the person has engaged or is engaging in conduct that constitutes or involves an offence: s 13(3A) and D’Amore v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2013] NSWCA 187 at [215] per Basten JA. Such a finding is not to be included in a report to Parliament under s 74: s 74B. It is not a finding that a person is guilty of, or has committed, is committing or is about to commit, a criminal offence: s 74B(2)(b).
	
	
	Section 13(1) makes provision for ICAC’s “principal functions”, which include investigating conduct alleged to be corrupt; and communicating the results of its investigations to “appropriate authorities”. Section 13(3) provides that ICAC’s principal functions “also include”:
	


(a) the power to make findings and form opinions, on the basis of the results of its investigations, in respect of any conduct, circumstances or events with which its investigations are concerned, whether or not the findings or opinions relate to corrupt conduct, and

(b) the power to formulate recommendations for the taking of action that the Commission considers should be taken in relation to its findings or opinions or the results of its investigations.


	
	Section 13(5) relevantly provides:
	


The following are examples of the findings and opinions permissible under subsection (3) but do not limit the Commission’s power to make findings and form opinions:

. . .

(b) opinions as to:

(i) whether the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be sought in relation to the commencement of proceedings against particular persons for criminal offences against laws of the State . . .


	
	Section 14 empowers ICAC to gather and furnish to the DPP evidence that may be admissible in the prosecution of a criminal offence in connection with corrupt conduct: s 14(1)(a) and (a1).
	
	
	Section 16(1) provides that, in exercising its principal functions relating to investigation of conduct, ICAC shall, as far as practical, work in co-operation with law enforcement agencies, and may work in co-operation with named bodies (including the Auditor-General and the Australian Crime Commission), as well as “such other persons and bodies as the Commission thinks appropriate”. Section 16(2) provides that, in exercising its other principal functions, ICAC shall “as far as practicable” work in co-operation with named bodies (including the Auditor-General and the Australian Crime Commission), as well as “such other persons and bodies as the Commission [ICAC] thinks appropriate”. The term “law enforcement agencies” is defined by s 16(5) and does not include the DPP.
	
	
	Section 17 relevantly provides:
	


17 Evidence and procedure

(1) The Commission is not bound by the rules or practice of evidence and can inform itself on any matter in such manner as it considers appropriate.

(2) The Commission shall exercise its functions with as little formality and technicality as is possible, and, in particular, the Commission shall accept written submissions as far as is possible and compulsory examinations and public inquiries shall be conducted with as little emphasis on an adversarial approach as is possible.


	
	Section 18(1) provides that ICAC may continue with its investigations despite any proceedings that may be before any court. The balance of s 18 provides:
	


(2) If the proceedings are proceedings for an indictable offence and are conducted by or on behalf of the Crown, the Commission must, to the extent to which the Commission thinks it necessary to do so to ensure that the accused’s right to a fair trial is not prejudiced:

(a) ensure that, as far as practicable, the investigation is conducted in private during the currency of the proceedings, and

(b) give directions under section 112, having effect during the currency of the proceedings, and

(c) defer making a report to Parliament in relation to the investigation during the currency of the proceedings.

(2A) Subsection (2) does not apply:

(a) (in the case of committal proceedings) before the commencement of the committal hearing, that is, the commencement of the taking of the evidence for the prosecution in the committal proceedings, and

(b) (in any other case) after the proceedings cease to be proceedings for the trial of a person before a jury.

(3) This section has effect whether or not the proceedings commenced before or after the relevant investigation commenced and has effect whether or not the Commission or an officer of the Commission is a party to the proceedings.


	
	Section 21 empowers ICAC, by notice, to require a public official or authority to provide a statement of information. Section 22 empowers ICAC by notice to require a person (whether or not a public official) to produce documents. Section 26 applies to such requirements and relevantly provides:
	


(2) If the statement, document or other thing tends to incriminate the person and the person objects to production at the time, neither the fact of the requirement nor the statement, document or thing itself (if produced) may be used in any proceedings against the person (except proceedings for an offence against this Act or except as provided by section 114A (5)).

(3) They may however be used for the purposes of the investigation concerned, despite any such objection.


	
	Section 30 confers power on ICAC to conduct compulsory examinations, which are to be conducted in private. Section 31 empowers ICAC to conduct a public inquiry for the purposes of an investigation “if it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so”. A public inquiry is to be held in public: s 31(8). Section 35(1) provides that ICAC may summon a person to give evidence or produce documents.
	
	
	Section 37 abrogates all relevant privileges, including the privilege against self-incrimination in that it, by s 37(2), provides that a person is not excused from answering a question or producing a document at a compulsory examination or a public inquiry “on the ground that the answer or production may incriminate or tend to incriminate the witness, or on any other ground of privilege, or on the ground of a duty of secrecy or other restriction on disclosure, or on any other ground”. Section 37(3) provides that an answer made by a person in either a compulsory examination or public inquiry is not admissible against that person in civil, criminal or disciplinary proceedings if objection is taken. Such objections can be covered by a general declaration made by the Commissioner or person presiding: s 38.
	
	
	Section 37(4) provides:
	


(4) Nothing in this section makes inadmissible:

(a) any answer, document or other thing in proceedings for an offence against this Act or in proceedings for contempt under this Act, or

(b) any answer, document or other thing in any civil or criminal proceedings or in any disciplinary proceedings if the witness does not object to giving the answer or producing the document or other thing irrespective of the provisions of subsection (2), or

(c) any document in any civil proceedings for or in respect of any right or liability conferred or imposed by the document or other thing.


	
	Section 53 provides for “Referral of matter” in the following terms:
	


(1) The Commission may, before or after investigating a matter (whether or not the investigation is completed, and whether or not the Commission has made any findings), refer the matter for investigation or other action to any person or body considered by the Commission to be appropriate in the circumstances.

(2) The person or body to whom a matter is referred is called in this Part a relevant authority.

(3) The Commission may, when referring a matter, recommend what action should be taken by the relevant authority and the time within which it should be taken.

(4) The Commission may communicate to the relevant authority any information which the Commission has obtained during the investigation of conduct connected with the matter.

(5) The Commission shall not refer a matter to a person or body except after appropriate consultation with the person or body and after taking into consideration the views of the person or body.

(6) If the Commission communicates information to a person or body under this section on the understanding that the information is confidential, the person or body is subject to the secrecy provisions of section 111 in relation to the information.


	
	Section 73 relevantly provides that both Houses of Parliament may, by resolution of each House, refer to ICAC any matter referred to in s 13 and, in that event, ICAC has a duty to “fully investigate” the matter.
	
	
	Section 74A relevantly provides:
	


Content of reports to Parliament

(1) The Commission is authorised to include in a report under section 74:

(a) statements as to any of its findings, opinions and recommendations, and

(b) statements as to the Commission’s reasons for any of its findings, opinions and recommendations.

(2) The report must include, in respect of each “affected” person, a statement as to whether or not in all the circumstances the Commission is of the opinion that consideration should be given to the following:

(a) obtaining the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions with respect to the prosecution of the person for a specified criminal offence,

. . .


	
	Section 87(1) provides that a person who, at a compulsory examination or public inquiry conducted by the Commission, gives evidence that is false or misleading in a material particular knowing it to be false or misleading, or not believing it to be true, is guilty of an indictable offence.
	
	
	Section 111 imposes secrecy requirements on officers of ICAC or legal practitioners who have assisted ICAC.
	
	
	Section 112 provides that ICAC may direct that any evidence before it, submissions, or the fact of the giving of evidence not be disclosed, but only if it is satisfied that such a direction is necessary or desirable in the public interest.
	


Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW)


	
	Section 7(1) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW) (the DPP Act) provides that the principal functions and responsibilities of the Director include the institution and conduct of prosecutions on behalf of the Crown in this Court and in the District Court.
	
	
	Section 15A(1) of the DPP Act imposes on “law enforcement officers” (which are defined to include ICAC officers) a duty to disclose to the DPP “all relevant information, documents, or other things obtained during the investigation that might reasonably be expected to assist the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused person”. This duty arises whenever the DPP exercises any function under the DPP Act with respect to the prosecution of the offence (s 15A(1A) and continues until the prosecution is terminated, a verdict is entered or the DPP decides not to prosecute. Section 15A(5) provides that the duty imposed by the section is “in addition to any other duties of law enforcement officers in connection with the investigation and prosecution of offences”. Section 15A further provides:
	


(6) The duty imposed by this section does not require law enforcement officers to provide to the Director any information, documents or other things that are the subject of a claim of privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity. The duty of a law enforcement officer in such a case is to inform the Director of:

(a) the existence of any information, document or other thing of that kind, and

(b) the nature of that information, document or other thing and the claim relating to it.

(7) However, a law enforcement officer must provide to the Director any information, document or other thing the subject of a claim of privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity, if the Director requests it to be provided.

(8) The duty imposed by this section does not require law enforcement officers to provide to the Director any information, document or other thing if to do so would contravene a statutory publication restriction. The duty of a law enforcement officer in such a case is to inform the Director of the following, but only to the extent not prohibited by the statutory publication restriction:

(a) the existence of any information, document or other thing of that kind,

(b) the nature of that information, document or other thing.

Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)


	
	Until 24 November 2015, the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) authorised ICAC officers (who are, by s 3, “public officers”) to commence proceedings pursuant to s 14 (which provides for “common informers”) and s 173 (which provides for commencement of proceedings by a police officer or public officer): Lazarus v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] NSWSC 1116 at [81]-[85] per Garling J; leave to appeal refused in Lazarus v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] NSWCA 47, per Basten JA at [10]-[12], Ward JA agreeing.
	
	
	The authority of ICAC officers to commence proceedings was subsequently limited by s 14A, which was inserted into the Act and became operative on 24 November 2015. Section 14A provided that an ICAC officer does not have power to commence proceedings for an offence unless the DPP has advised ICAC that proceedings may be commenced by an officer of ICAC. Section 14A(2) provides that “for that purpose” the DPP may liaise with ICAC but “is to act independently in deciding to advise that proceedings for the offence may be commenced”.
	


Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth)


	
	The Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (the ACC Act) is presently relevant because its provisions were considered by the High Court in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92.
	
	
	Section 28(1) of the ACC Act provided that an examiner appointed by the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) under the Act could summon a person to appear at an examination to give evidence. Section 30(2)(b) required the person to answer questions at an examination and s 30(6) made it an indictable offence for a person to refuse or fail to answer such a question. Section 25A relevantly provided:
	


(3) An examination before an examiner must be held in private and the examiner may give directions as to the persons who may be present during the examination or a part of the examination.

…

(9) An examiner may direct that:

(a) any evidence given before the examiner; or

(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the examiner; or

(c) any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the examiner to be identified; or

(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at an examination;

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence.

New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW)


	
	The New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) (NSWCC Act), although repealed, is relevant to the present application because of the reliance placed by the applicants on Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 253 CLR 455. The Act established the New South Wales Crime Commission (NSWCC). Its principal object was to reduce the incidence of illegal drug trafficking. A secondary object was to reduce the incidence of organised crime. The Act provided that these objects were to be pursued by the investigation of matters relating to criminal activity and the assembling of admissible evidence to be provided to the relevant authorities.
	
	
	Of present relevance, s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act provided:
	


The Commission may direct that:

(a) any evidence given before it,

(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the Commission or seized pursuant to a search warrant issued under section 11,

(c) any information that might enable a person who has given or may be about to give evidence before the Commission to be identified or located, or

(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at a hearing,

shall not be published, or shall not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the Commission specifies, and the Commission shall give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.


	
	Section 16(1) of the NSWCC Act conferred power on a member of the NSWCC to summon a person to give evidence. Section 18B(1) provided that a person summoned to appear as a witness was not excused from answering any question on the ground that the answer could incriminate or tend to incriminate him or her, or on any other ground.
	


Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth)


	
	The Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act) is relevant to the present application because of the reliance placed by the Crown on R v OC (Oliver Curtis) [2015] NSWCCA 212; 90 NSWLR 134. Section 13 of the ASIC Act empowers ASIC to investigate matters where it has reason to suspect a contravention of relevant legislation. Section 19 of the ASIC Act provided that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) could carry out an examination in connection with an investigation under s 13 if it has reasonable grounds to suspect a contravention of specified provisions. Under s 17, ASIC can prepare a report of the investigation. In the case of an investigation relating to a serious contravention of the law, ASIC is empowered by s 18 to give a copy of the report to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP).
	
	
	Section 49 provides that ASIC has investigatory and prosecutorial roles and can take the record of the examination into account in considering whether a person has committed an offence and, in these circumstances, may cause a prosecution to be commenced or carried on. Section 63 of the ASIC Act makes it an offence to decline to answer a question in an examination without reasonable excuse. Section 64 makes it an offence to give false or misleading evidence at an examination. Section 68(1) provides that it is not a reasonable excuse that the answer might tend to incriminate the person. Section 68(3) provides that the statement is not admissible in evidence against the person in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty other than a proceeding for the making of a false statement. Section 76 of the ASIC Act provides that a statement made in an examination is admissible in evidence against the examinee unless a claim for privilege is made before making the statement and the statement might tend to incriminate the examinee.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (CDPP Act) is also relevant to the ASIC Act since it provides, by s 9(5), that the CDPP may take over proceedings for committal for an indictable offence instituted by another person. Section 12 of the CDPP Act provides that when a prosecution is being carried on by a person other than the CDPP and the CDPP informs that person that the CDPP is considering taking over the prosecution, or takes over the prosecution, the person must provide to the CDPP a copy of all witness statements and each material document as well as “such other information or material” as the CDPP requires.
	


The facts


	
	On 23 November 2011 both Houses of Parliament, pursuant to s 73 of the ICAC Act, referred for investigation by ICAC, the circumstances surrounding the application for, and the allocation of an Exploration Licence to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd (DCM) under the Mining Act 1992 (NSW) and related issues.
	
	
	As a result of the referral, ICAC conducted an investigation, known as Operation Acacia. In the course of the investigation, Mr Maitland and Mr Macdonald gave evidence over objection at separate compulsory examinations on 13 July 2012. ICAC conducted public hearings as part of Operation Acacia, which commenced on 18 March 2013 and ran for 37 hearing days to 17 May 2013.
	
	
	Mr Maitland gave evidence over objection on 8, 9 and 10 May 2013 (amounting to 500 pages of transcript). Four excerpts from his compulsory examination were also tendered. Mr Macdonald gave evidence on 15, 16 and 17 May 2013 (amounting to more than 250 pages of transcript), also over objection. Five excerpts of his compulsory examination were also tendered. Commissioner Ipp made declarations pursuant to s 38 of the ICAC Act in relation to the objections made by the applicants, which had the effect that all their answers were taken to have been objected to.
	
	
	The transcripts of the evidence of Mr Maitland and Mr Macdonald at the public inquiry were published on the ICAC website, in accordance with ICAC’s usual practice of uploading transcript to the website at the end of each day of the public inquiry, or on the following day.
	
	
	In August 2013 ICAC published its report of Operation Acacia (the ICAC Report). It recommended that the advice of the DPP be sought with respect to the prosecution of the applicants and others. The ICAC Report contained the following public disclosure:
	


There was evidence before the Commission of the financial benefits accrued by Mr Maitland and two other persons as a result of the corrupt conduct the Commission has found to have been engaged in by Mr Macdonald. The Commission has provided relevant information to the New South Wales Crime Commission pursuant to s 16(3) of the ICAC Act for such action as the New South Wales Crime Commission considers appropriate.


	
	In about August 2013 Phillip English of counsel was briefed by the NSWCC to provide legal advice in relation to matters arising from the ICAC Report in relation to the referral to the NSWCC. For that purpose, he read parts of the transcript of ICAC’s public inquiry, to which he obtained access from ICAC’s public website and which he downloaded to his iPad. He was also briefed with hard copy materials and a disc, although he was not aware of this happening and did not refer to them. Once he became aware, on 23 May 2016, that he had such materials in his chambers he arranged for the material to be collected by the DPP that same day. On 21 May 2016 he deleted from his iPad electronic copies of the transcripts of the applicants’ evidence before the public inquiry which had remained on this device since he first downloaded them for the purposes of his first brief.
	
	
	On 3 April 2014, Lee v The Queen was argued in the High Court. Judgment was delivered on 21 May 2014.
	
	
	In about June 2014 Adrian Walkowiak was transferred from another area of the DPP’s office to the ICAC Referrals Unit, where he became the solicitor with carriage of the present matter. As far as Mr Walkowiak knew, a file for the matter had already been opened although Daniel Noll, the then Managing Lawyer of the DPP’s ICAC Referral Unit, had not allocated the matter to a solicitor before it was allocated to Mr Walkowiak. Between June and October 2014, Mr Walkowiak read transcripts of the applicants’ evidence in the public inquiry as well as exhibits tendered in the public inquiry, which included extracts from their evidence in compulsory examinations. He was provided with this material in electronic form but he also printed it (together with other material provided by ICAC) in hard copy. Mr Walkowiak considered this material for the purpose of preparing advice to the DPP and highlighted portions and made notes.
	
	
	On 23 June 2014 Mr Noll downloaded the entire public inquiry transcript from the ICAC website for Operation Acacia to the “CASES system” (an internal DPP server).
	
	
	On 24 June 2014 Keith Alder, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, was provided with an internal recommendation from a solicitor within the DPP’s office who has not had any role in the prosecution of Mr Macdonald for misconduct in public office or the prosecution of Mr Maitland for accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office. The advice did not relate to the charge against Mr Maitland of accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office. The recommendation attached an advice which set out extracts from the transcripts of Mr Maitland’s private compulsory examination on 13 July 2012 and from his public examination on 7 May 2013. This recommendation and advice was passed onto Lloyd Babb SC, the DPP, on 24 June 2014, who read the recommendation and advice at about that time and has not re-read it since.
	
	
	In about June 2014, Mr English was briefed by the DPP in connection with a potential prosecution of the applicants. Not long after receiving the brief, he went to England to visit his father. While he was away he read the transcripts of ICAC’s public inquiry into Operation Acacia on his iPad. Although he does not specifically recall reading the applicants’ compelled evidence in this period, he accepted that he may have done.
	
	
	In about July or August 2014 Mr English returned to Australia from England. Shortly afterwards, he met with his then leader, Mr Fagan SC (now Fagan J), who told him that he should make sure that he did not access the applicants’ compelled evidence or raise any aspect of their evidence either with Mr Fagan himself, or with any potential witnesses or any other member of the prosecution team. I accept Mr English’s evidence that he was very careful not to refer to the compelled evidence or to let the compelled evidence influence or assist him in the prosecution of the applicants in the present proceedings (although he accepted that he could not rule out subconscious effects). A warning to similar effect was reiterated to Mr English by Peter Neil SC, when he was briefed as lead counsel following Mr Fagan’s appointment.
	
	
	In about 20 September 2014 Mr Fagan and Mr English provided a formal written advice to the DPP concerning potential charges against Mr Maitland, including accessorial liability for offences committed by Mr Macdonald.
	
	
	Mr Walkowiak provided written advice to Mr Babb on 7 October 2014. The subject matter of this advice included possible charges against Mr Macdonald for misconduct in public office as well as charges under s 87 of the ICAC Act for giving false evidence to ICAC. It contained substantial extracts from Mr Macdonald’s statements in the public inquiry on 15 May 2013 and 16 May 2013 and contained reference to his compulsory examination on 13 July 2012 (any disparity between which was relevant to the possible charge under s 87 of the ICAC Act). Mr Walkowiak accepted that the extracts were not only relevant to the possible charge under s 87, since they were also potentially relevant to the charge of misconduct in public office. Since providing this advice Mr Walkowiak has retained a copy of the advice and the material referred to above, which he read for the purposes of preparing it, although he has not re-read or consulted it (or the notes he made while reading it) since, or shortly after, providing that advice. I accept his evidence that the advice of 7 October 2014 did not contain extracts of portions of, or otherwise refer to, Mr Maitland’s evidence at the public inquiry.
	
	
	Mr Babb read Mr Walkowiak’s advice on about 7 October 2014. Mr Babb did not re-read this advice for the purpose of considering whether to commence proceedings against Mr Macdonald for misconduct in public office.
	
	
	On the following day, 8 October 2014, Mr Walkowiak raised a requisition with ICAC in the following terms:
	


“Invitation list to Maitland’s farewell at parliament house (according to Braham’s XX [cross-examination] of Maitland, Macdonald and Hickey were the only state Labor MPs to be invited)”


	
	This was the only one of very many requisitions (things to be done to get the case ready) sent by Mr Walkowiak to ICAC which made any reference to any part of the applicants’ compelled evidence before ICAC. Mr Walkowiak noted the response to the requisition (which referred to a document in volume 10, page 2985 of the public inquiry brief which was served by the DPP on the applicants) but did not recall doing anything further in relation to it.
	
	
	On 5 November 2014 the DPP advised ICAC that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Macdonald for two offences of misconduct in public office and Mr Maitland for two offences of accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office. I accept Mr Babb’s evidence that he did not take into account the evidence compelled from the applicants in relation to the present charges (since it was inadmissible) but did take into account their compelled evidence when deciding whether there was sufficient evidence to bring charges under s 87 of the ICAC Act.
	
	
	On 20 November 2014 a Court Attendance Notice (CAN) was served on Mr Maitland through his solicitor, Mr Whyburn. The prosecutor was identified as “Senior Investigator Paul Grainger” of ICAC. The details of the offences set out in the CAN were as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Sequence

			Number
			
			
			Description & Short Particulars of Offence (including Act & Section)
			
		
		
			
			1
			
			
			Common Law Offence & Section 346, Crimes Act 1900.

			Law Part Code 17097 & 53065

			Accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office.

			That between 17 January 2007 and 22 August 2008 in Sydney and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, Ian Macdonald then holding public office as Minister for Mineral Resources did in the course of and connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by granting Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd consent to apply for an exploration licence under the Mining Act 1992, without reasonable cause or justification and John William Maitland did aid, abet, counsel and procure the commission of the said offence.
			
		
		
			
			2
			
			
			Common Law Offence & Section 346, Crimes Act 1900.

			Law Part Code 17097 & 53065

			Accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office.

			That between 21 August 2008 and 16 December 2008 in Sydney and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, Ian Macdonald then holding public office as Minister for Mineral Resources did in the course of and connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by granting Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd Exploration Licence No. 7270 under the Mining Act 1992, without reasonable cause or justification and John William Maitland did aid, abet, counsel and procure the commission of the said offence.
			
		
	



	
	A CAN was also served on Mr Macdonald, through his solicitor, Mr Dan, which set out details of the two offences of misconduct in public office with which he was charged (in similar terms to Mr Maitland’s CAN, but with corresponding amendments having regard to the difference in the charges).
	
	
	By letter dated 27 November 2014, Mr Walkowiak served Mr Whyburn with a Statement of Facts. On 15 December 2014 Mr Whyburn received a letter from the DPP inviting him to make submissions as to the possibility that an ex officio indictment would be filed in relation to the charges in the CAN. Mr Whyburn also received, on that day, 60 volumes of material. Much of this material constituted evidence given to ICAC in the course of its investigation. Further material was served on 19 February 2015.
	
	
	On 25 February 2015 the DPP served on Mr Macdonald (through Mr Dan) and Mr Maitland (through Mr Whyburn) a Notice of Intention to file an ex officio indictment, which had been filed in the District Court. The letter notified the recipients that their clients were required to attend the District Court on 20 March 2015 for arraignment. The DPP also notified them that an application had been made under s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Act that their trials be removed to the Supreme Court.
	
	
	Further material was served by the DPP on the applicants on 15 April 2015. By letter dated 28 April 2015 transcripts of compulsory examinations of 36 witnesses conducted by ICAC were served.
	
	
	In April and May 2015 Mr Walkowiak was involved in the preparation of the Crown Case Statement, which was served on the applicants’ solicitors on 6 May 2015, together with three volumes of material referred to in it.
	
	
	On 8 May 2015 the applicants were arraigned in this Court on an ex officio indictment.
	
	
	For the purposes of preparing the prosecution case, Mr English conferred with 21 witnesses: Michael Costa, Brad Mullard, Alan Coutts, Alexander Cramb, Richard Sheldrake, Patricia Madden, Sue-Em Tan, Brendan McPherson, Anthony Maher, Jason Bartlett, Nicole Williams, Nicholas Papallo, Luke Foley, Jamie Gibson, James Chisholm, Gary Gibson, Morris Iemma, Paul Miller, Julie Mahoney, Peter Reynolds and Archibald Tudehope. I accept his evidence that he has not raised any aspect or part of the applicants’ compelled evidence before ICAC in any witness conference or accessed any such evidence for the purpose of drafting or settling any witness statements or proofs.
	
	
	Between June 2015 and April 2016 Mr Walkowiak was involved in drafting witness proofs and statements from Morris Iemma, Nathan Rees, Michael Costa, Paul Miller, Luke Foley, George Campbell, Brad Mullard, Alan Coutts, Richard Sheldrake, Patricia Madden, Julie Maloney, Sue-Em Tan, Jamie Gibson, Craig Munnings, Richard Jones, Brendan McPherson, Michael Buffier, Peter Coates, Anthony Maher, Peter Reynolds, Jason Bartlett, Alexander Cramb, Nicole Williams, Nicholas Papallo, Archibald Tudehope, Adam Griffiths, Lawrie Ireland and Hessam Bahramali. These proofs and statements have largely been based on evidence given by those witnesses before ICAC or records of interviews conducted by ICAC and refer to the provenance of particular portions of evidence in footnotes. Mr Walkowiak did not refer to, or consciously use, the applicants’ compelled evidence for the purposes of preparing any of those witness proofs or statements.
	
	
	On 2 September 2015, Mr Walkowiak wrote to the applicants’ solicitors in the following terms:
	


“Please be advised that members of the prosecution team have had access to and read the following from the inquiry conducted by the ICAC in relation to Operation Acacia:

The public hearing transcript of the accused; and

Extracts of the private hearing transcript of the accused tendered during the public hearing.

Apart from the extracts of the private hearing transcript of the accused tendered during the public hearing the prosecution team have not had any access to the private hearing transcript of the accused.

If an application for temporary stay is to be made in relation to this matter, based to the above information and comments by the High Court in Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20 and X7 v Australian Crime Commission (2013) 248 CLR 92, it should be included in the Notice of Motion(s) due to be filed on 7 September 2015.


	
	I accept Mr English’s evidence that he discussed the terms of this letter (presumably when it was in draft form and before it was sent) with Mr Walkowiak and, in that context, referred to those aspects of Mr Maitland and Mr Macdonald’s evidence that he could still recall.
	
	
	Between December 2015 and April 2016 Mr Walkowiak conferred with witnesses, including those in respect of whom he had drafted statements or proofs of evidence. He did not refer to the applicants’ compelled evidence in these conferences. To his knowledge no one else at the conferences referred to the applicants’ compelled evidence, with the following single exception.
	
	
	During Mr Walkowiak’s conference with Mr Tudehope, Mr Tudehope said that he had read in the paper that Mr Maitland had given compelled evidence to ICAC that he had not spoken to anyone about giving evidence in a private compulsory examination conducted by ICAC. Mr Walkowiak then played a recording of a telephone conversation between Mr Tudehope and Mr Maitland.
	
	
	On 9 February 2016 ICAC removed from its website all public inquiry transcripts and exhibits connected with Operation Acacia. On 26 May 2016, all such documents were deleted from ICAC’s internet server to ensure that they could not be accessed.
	
	
	On 23 March 2016, Mr Whyburn wrote to Mr Walkowiak, relevantly in the following terms:
	


As you would be well aware all of Mr Maitland’s evidence before ICAC was given under compulsion, and subject to his objection pursuant to ss 37 and 38 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988. As such, the prosecution team has had the benefit of Mr Maitland’s compelled evidence before ICAC, in circumstances that are relevantly analogous to those considered by the High Court in Lee v The Queen (2014) 235 CLR 455.


	
	Correspondence ensued between Mr Whyburn, Mr Dan and Mr Walkowiak regarding the roles played by respective lawyers for the DPP and their access to evidence compelled by ICAC. It is not necessary to detail such correspondence as these matters have been established by the evidence on the notices of motion.
	


The present recollection of witnesses as to the contents of the evidence compelled from the applicants


	
	The Crown adduced evidence from several witnesses who played, and continue to play, a role in the prosecution of the applicants. Such witnesses included Susie Kim, solicitor, who worked on the matter between mid-June 2015 and 22 April 2016 and who did not have any knowledge of the applicants’ compelled evidence and did not ever hear it being referred to; and Mr Neil, who, though briefed with an electronic copy of the entire transcripts and exhibits from the public inquiry (which included the applicants’ compelled evidence), never accessed it or read it and was not aware that he had received it.
	
	
	On the basis of the Crown’s evidence I accept that only Mr English and Mr Walkowiak have read the applicants’ compelled evidence and that Mr Babb and Mr Alder have read limited extracts from the applicants’ compelled evidence which related to consideration of charges different from those the subject of these proceedings. To the extent to which findings about their role and recollection has not been included in the narrative above, they are set out below.
	


Mr English


	
	Mr English gave evidence (via audio-visual link) from the United Kingdom. I accept his evidence, which he gave in a careful and considered way. He made appropriate concessions about aspects of memory put to him by Mr Jordan SC, who appeared with Mr Kerkyasharian on behalf of Mr Maitland.
	
	
	Mr English read the compelled evidence provided to him by NSWCC for the purposes of the brief in August 2013 and may have re-read it for the purposes of the brief from the DPP, which he received in about June 2014. He did not impart his knowledge of the compelled evidence to anyone else on the prosecution team or to any potential witnesses and did not access the compelled evidence after October 2014.
	
	
	I accept Mr English’s evidence that he has only a vague recollection of Mr Maitland’s evidence before the ICAC public inquiry. His recollection comprised allegations of various misstatements being put to Mr Maitland. He does not recall the responses. He does not recall any part of Mr Maitland’s private examination which was tendered in the public inquiry.
	
	
	I accept Mr English’s evidence that he currently recalls only the following aspects of the compelled evidence given by Mr Macdonald at the public inquiry:
	



	
	Mr Macdonald’s evidence that he said, at the dinner at the Strangers’ Dining Room at Parliament House on 17 June 2008, that he required about eight conditions before he would agree to granting an exploration licence to DCM, of which Mr English remembered only two: that there be both industry and community support.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald did not agree that he received either or both of the briefing notes from the Department of Primary Industry (DPI) dated 22 February 2007 and 13 May 2008 respectively because they do not bear his signature.
	


Mr Walkowiak


	
	I accept Mr Walkowiak’s evidence that the only reason he read the applicants’ compelled evidence was for the purposes of providing the advice to Mr Babb on 7 October 2014.
	
	
	I accept his evidence, including the following evidence as to his recollection of the applicants’ compelled evidence:
	


13.   I currently have no specific recollection of the evidence given by Mr Maitland to the ICAC, apart from some questions and answers in relation to whether or not Mr Maitland had discussed with anyone his attendance at a private hearing.

14.   I currently have no specific recollection of the evidence given by Mr Macdonald to the ICAC, apart from the following:

(a)   Mr Macdonald gave evidence to the affect that the DPI had recommended to him that he directly grant the exploration licence to Doyles Creek Mining and that he would not have granted the exploration licence if they did not support it.

(b)   Mr Macdonald gave evidence in relation to other examples of direct allocations of exploration licences.

(c)   Mr Macdonald gave evidence about the dinner at the Stranger’s Dining Room at Parliament House on 17 June 2008 that he required a number of conditions before he would agree to granting the exploration licence to Doyles Creek Mining. The only specific conditions which I can recall are (1) industry support and (2) community support.

(d)   Mr Macdonald gave evidence to the affect that he had not received a formal briefing note in relation to at least one of the briefing notes prepared by the DPI in relation to the application by Doyles Creek Mining.

(e)   Mr Macdonald gave some evidence on the topic of the Budget Estimates Committee.

Mr Babb


	
	I accept Mr Babb’s evidence that the only occasion on which he read any extract from the compelled evidence was when he received advice on 24 June 2014 with respect to Mr Maitland, which contained extracts from his compelled evidence, and when he received advice on 7 October 2014 with respect to Mr Macdonald. These advices were not prepared with respect to the current charges the subject of these proceedings. I accept Mr Babb’s evidence that he can no longer recall those extracts and has not re-read these documents since.
	


Mr Alder


	
	Mr Alder deposed that on 24 June 2014 he was provided with an internal recommendation from a solicitor within the DPP’s office who has not had any role in the prosecution of Mr Macdonald for misconduct in public office or the prosecution of Mr Maitland for accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office. He no longer recalls the details of the advice accompanying the recommendation. He was informed, on 25 May 2016, for the purposes of swearing an affidavit to be relied on by the Crown in opposition to the applicants’ motion, that the advice contained extracts from the transcript of the private compulsory examination conducted by ICAC on Mr Maitland on 13 July 2012 and his public examination on 7 May 2013. I accept Mr Alder’s recollection that he no longer recalls those extracts and that he has not referred to or accessed or read extracts from the transcript of Mr Macdonald’s evidence to the public inquiry.
	


The alleged prejudice: the nature and extent of the connection between the compelled evidence and the applicants’ potential defences


	
	Mr Walkowiak was extensively cross-examined about the connection between those aspects of the compelled evidence which he could recall and the prosecution case. These will be addressed in turn.
	


Crown case that officers of the DPI did not recommend that Mr Macdonald allocated the exploration licence to DCM


	
	Mr Walkowiak recalled that, in his compelled evidence, Mr Macdonald denied receiving the briefing notes from the DPI (see [14(d)] of his affidavit extracted above). Mr Walkowiak’s evidence in cross-examination was that, irrespective of what Mr Macdonald’s position was on the briefing notes, the Crown would have to prove as part of its case that he received the briefing notes. Accordingly, he did not regard his knowledge of Mr Macdonald’s denial as being of any assistance.
	
	
	Mr Walkowiak was cross-examined by Mr Odgers SC, who appeared on behalf of Mr Macdonald, about evidence compelled from Mr Macdonald at the public inquiry when he was asked about an email Mr Maitland sent to Mr Tudehope on 26 November 2008 as follows:
	


“Arch [Tudehope], I had a dinner meeting with the Minister for Mines last night and he informed me that I will have the letter of approval for the Exploration Licence in my hands on Friday 5 December.”


	
	Mr Macdonald denied, in his compelled evidence, that he had made a decision by 26 November 2008 and said that no final decision had been made and that everything depended on whether the DPI recommended it. It was put to Mr Walkowiak that this portion of Mr Macdonald’s compelled evidence influenced him to obtain evidence in support of the Crown case that Mr Macdonald had already made the decision by 26 November 2008. Mr Walkowiak explained that the two relevant dates in the indictment were 21 August 2008 (being the date of Mr Macdonald’s consent to DCM to apply for an exploration licence) and 16 December 2008 (being the date on which the exploration licence was granted by direct allocation to that company) and that he appreciated that the Crown had to prove what occurred in relation to both of those steps.
	
	
	Mr Odgers also cross-examined Mr Walkowiak about Jamie Gibson’s statement dated 14 January 2016 in which Mr Gibson deposed (in [28]) that Mr Maitland and Mr Macdonald discussed the formal application and potential conditions of the licence over dinner on 25 November 2008. This paragraph bears a footnote which refers to a statement of Jamie Gibson of 19 May 2014. Mr Walkowiak confirmed that the statement of 19 May 2014 would have been prepared by ICAC as he only came into the matter at about that time. He also confirmed that Mr Gibson’s evidence that, as at 25 November 2008, there had been no Departmental response regarding the formal application by DCM derived from evidence Mr Gibson had given at the ICAC public hearing.
	


Relative yields of comparative extraction of coal


	
	In cross-examination, Mr Walkowiak was shown an email dated 20 May 2015 which he had sent to Gary Gibson, an expert in mining, to ask him to provide an expert report for the purposes of the prosecution. Mr Walkowiak asked him to consider the difference between bord and pillar mining on the one hand and longwall mining on the other and the relative rates of extraction of each method. It was put to Mr Walkowiak that his sending of the email was influenced by his reading of Mr Maitland’s compelled evidence. Mr Walkowiak rejected the proposition and said that the request for a report arose from the document entitled “Doyles Creek Conceptual Mine Layout – December 2007”, which indicated a particular area for a “training panel” (which was to be mined using the bord and pillar technique).
	
	
	Mr Jordan put an extract from Mr Maitland’s compelled evidence to Mr Walkowiak in which he compared the yield from bord and pillar, which he estimated to be about 50%, with the yield from longwall mining, which he estimated to be about 70%. Mr Walkowiak accepted that his email and Mr Maitland’s compelled evidence were dealing with the same topics but rejected the proposition that the compelled evidence was the impetus for the email and maintained that the request in his email to Mr Gibson arose from the concept plan referred to above. When Mr Jordan asked how Mr Walkowiak had come to understand the difference between the two techniques, he responded by explaining that he had googled it. Mr Walkowiak said that if he had been relying on Mr Maitland, he would not have googled it.
	
	
	The Crown tendered evidence which Mr McCowan had given in a compulsory examination conducted in private on 13 August 2012 in which he gave evidence about the relative costs and efficiencies of longwall and bord-and-pillar mining, although he did not quantify them in percentage or absolute terms. The Crown also tendered the transcript of the public examination of Mr Ireland, the expert who was responsible for drawing the training panel on the document entitled “Doyles Creek Conceptual Mine Layout – December 2007” (referred to above) and for calculating the figure of 150,000 tonnes which was indicated as the yield for the training panel. In his evidence Mr Ireland explained that the yield from the training panel would have been “first workings”, which is a reference to the bord and pillar method, as opposed to the longwall method. He explained that “you would end up with somewhere around a 30 per cent reserve from that block of coal with those dimensions”.
	
	
	I reject Mr Jordan’s submission that the circumstance that Mr Maitland’s compelled evidence was the only time that precise percentage figures for the relative yields were mentioned meant that Mr Walkowiak was assisted or otherwise influenced by the compelled evidence when seeking the opinion from Mr Gibson. I am satisfied that the relative yields from bord and pillar mining and longwall mining were an issue in the course of the public inquiry and that this appreciation derived from evidence other than the compelled evidence of Mr Maitland. I am not satisfied that there is any real prospect that Mr Walkowiak’s email to Mr Gibson was influenced by Mr Maitland’s compelled evidence.
	


Documents provided to the Premier relating to Doyles Creek Mine


	
	On 17 May 2013, in the public inquiry, Mr Macdonald was examined about a document relating to the proposed mine at Doyles Creek which was to be provided to the Premier’s Department prior to budget hearings. He explained to ICAC that the purpose of the document was to inform the Premier and the Cabinet Standing Committee on Public Administration of what was going on in case his budget estimates committee received a question relating to the issue and described it as a “clear indication” to the Premier’s office of what was happening with the Doyles Creek proposal.
	
	
	Mr Walkowiak said that a number of witnesses gave evidence in the public inquiry about three different versions of a document prepared for budget estimates with respect to Doyles Creek.
	
	
	Mr Odgers put to Mr Walkowiak a statement of one of the Crown witnesses, Mr Costa, dated 18 January 2016, in which he deposed that he had no recollection of a specific proposal in relation to building a training mine in the Doyles Creek region but that he would have expected such a proposal to have been brought before Cabinet. In the same statement Mr Costa set out the difference between budget estimates hearings on the one hand and the budget committee of Cabinet. Mr Walkowiak rejected the proposition put to him by Mr Odgers that he had obtained evidence as to that distinction because of Mr Macdonald’s compelled evidence referred to above. I accept Mr Walkowiak’s explanation as follows:
	


Essentially the statement was sought to clarify the difference ‑ there was a lot of uncertainty based on, from my recollection, the answers given by witnesses during the public inquiry as to what occurred with the documents that were prepared by the department and given to the Minister's office in relation to budget estimates and so my understanding was that it was directed at clarifying the difference between the nature of those two processes so we could have an understanding of those two processes.


	
	Mr Walkowiak was also cross-examined about Mr Macdonald’s compelled evidence in ICAC to the effect that he had no recollection of Mr Rees (as Premier) ever telling Cabinet Ministers that if there was a proposal which would have the effect of requiring New South Wales to forego revenue, it should be put before Cabinet. It was put to Mr Walkowiak that this compelled evidence was the reason he obtained evidence from Mr Costa to the effect that he did not recall the DCM proposal ever being put to Cabinet. Mr Walkowiak refuted that suggestion and said that Mr Rees himself had given evidence to ICAC that he had told Ministers of the need to bring such proposals to Cabinet. He also said that Mr Costa’s evidence (that such proposals would be put to the budget committee of Cabinet) in his statement dated 18 January 2016 derived from the transcript of a private hearing before ICAC, as indicated by the footnotes to the relevant paragraphs. Moreover, Mr Walkowiak explained that, in the conference with Mr Costa, it was Mr Neil (who had not read any of the evidence compelled from the applicants), not Mr Walkowiak, who asked Mr Costa the questions.
	
	
	Mr Walkowiak was shown a statement of Patricia Madden, another Crown witness, in which the deponent addressed a brief she had prepared entitled “Doyles Creek Training Mine”. It was put to him that he had obtained that evidence as a result of Mr Macdonald’s compelled evidence referred to above. Mr Walkowiak refuted the proposition on the basis that the relevant paragraph of the statement was footnoted with a reference to a statement made by Ms Madden dated 22 May 2013, which had been obtained by ICAC as a result of its own investigations prior to the public inquiry.
	


Whether direct coal allocations by Ministers were common


	
	Mr Walkowiak was asked by Mr Odgers about Mr Macdonald’s compelled evidence to the effect that it was not unusual at the relevant time for a Minister to allocate an exploration licence directly. Mr Walkowiak said that either Mr Mullard or Mr Coutts had given evidence to ICAC as to this question and that he was, accordingly, aware that there was an issue whether direct allocation was orthodox. Mr Walkowiak’s attention was drawn to evidence on this topic in Mr Mullard’s statement dated 16 December 2015. Mr Walkowiak rejected the proposition that he had been influenced to obtain that evidence by his knowledge of Mr Macdonald’s compelled evidence and explained that the footnotes indicated that ICAC had obtained the statement from Mr Mullard before charges had been laid.
	


The relationship between the applicants


	
	I note that Mr Walkowiak was not cross-examined at all about the topic of the relationship between the applicants. Mr Jordan relied on the fact that Mr Maitland had given compelled evidence on this topic in a private examination on 13 July 2012 about his communications with Mr Macdonald and whether he had his office and mobile telephone numbers. In his public examination on 7 May 2013, several questions were asked and propositions put to Mr Maitland about his relationship with Mr Macdonald. Mr Braham, counsel assisting the Commissioner, put to Mr Maitland the evidence of various witnesses in the public inquiry about this relationship, including Mr Foley, Mr Rees, Mr Munnings, Mr Maher and Mr Cameron.
	
	
	It is plain from the Crown Case Statement that it is part of the Crown case that Mr Macdonald allocated the exploration licence to DCM because of his close relationship with Mr Maitland. The questions asked by counsel assisting of Mr Maitland which referred to the evidence of this relationship given by other witnesses indicates that the nature and extent of the relationship was an issue that arose well before the compelled evidence was given. I am not satisfied that Mr Walkowiak’s preparation of the Crown case was influenced, much less assisted, by the evidence compelled from the applicants on this topic.
	


Submissions

The applicants’ submissions


	
	Mr Odgers substantially adopted the submissions made by Mr Jordan. Accordingly, I propose to address their submissions collectively.
	
	
	The applicants submitted that although the compelled evidence was downloaded by Mr Noll from the ICAC website on 24 June 2014, rather than provided by ICAC, it ought nonetheless be regarded as having been provided by ICAC, as ICAC made the evidence available on its website, albeit to the public at large, rather than specifically to the DPP.
	
	
	The applicants submitted that the combined effect of ss 2A, 13(5)(b)(i), 14(1), 37 and 74B of the ICAC Act was that ICAC is not authorised to provide to the DPP (and the DPP was not entitled to receive) evidence obtained from a person under compulsion, over objection, for the purpose of obtaining advice on whether or not that person should be prosecuted for a criminal offence other than an offence under s 87 of the ICAC Act.
	
	
	The applicants relied on the absence of any reference in s 2A of the ICAC Act to a prosecution or to obtaining evidence for the purposes of prosecution. They submitted that the wording of s 14(1), which provided that it was a function of ICAC to gather any evidence that may be admissible in the prosecution of a person and provide it to the DPP, necessarily implied that ICAC was prohibited from providing to the DPP any material other than admissible evidence and that s 14(1) ought be read as containing that prohibition. They contended that there was no need for s 37 to provide for indirect use protection (although that was its effect) because s 14 incorporated the prohibition referred to above which meant that the DPP would only receive admissible evidence anyway.
	
	
	The applicants submitted that, if s 15A of the DPP Act applied at all (having regard to the prohibition in s 14), it excluded the provision of answers or documents which were the subject of a claim for privilege and that the compelled evidence fell into that category.
	
	
	The applicants submitted that R v OC (Oliver Curtis) was distinguishable on two bases: first, ASIC can prosecute in its own right, without the need to obtain advice from the DPP; and, secondly, the ASIC Act abrogates only the privilege against self-incrimination, whereas an objection under s 37 of the ICAC Act can be taken on any basis whatsoever. They argued that the result in R v OC (Oliver Curtis) depended on the precise wording of s 68 of the ASIC Act and had no application in the present case. They submitted that, unlike in R v OC (Oliver Curtis), there would be no reason for a court to review the compelled evidence that had been objected to in ICAC if the Crown sought to tender it since it was, necessarily, inadmissible, a declaration under s 38 of the ICAC Act having been made in respect of all of their evidence. Accordingly, no adjudication such as was required under the ASIC Act at the time of tender was called for.
	
	
	They contended, in the alternative, that they did not need to go so far as to establish that the provision of their compelled evidence to the DPP was prohibited or unauthorised in order to obtain the relief sought. The applicants submitted that the limitation for which they contended preserved the companion principle in relation to evidence given to ICAC under compulsion over objection in compulsory examination or public inquiry. They contended that the “irresistible clearness” (derived from Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63; 7 CLR 277 at 304 per O’Connor J, referring to United States v Fisher 6 US 358 at 390 (1805)) which would be required to abrogate the right conferred by the companion principle was “strikingly absent” from the ICAC Act.
	
	
	The applicants also relied on the circumstance that no substantial amendments were made to the ICAC Act (as distinct from the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW), the successor to the NSWCC Act) as a consequence of the decisions of the High Court in X7 v Australian Crime Commission and Lee v The Queen. The applicants argued that this tended to reinforce the conclusion that “there was never any intention to abrogate the accusatorial system of criminal justice”.
	
	
	The applicants submitted that, although there were differences between s 112 of the ICAC Act and s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act (which was considered in Lee v The Queen), the only material difference between the sections was that s 112 effectively imposed a requirement on ICAC to make a direction when indictable proceedings were already on foot (presumably since such a direction would inevitably be necessary and desirable in the public interest in such a case) while the NSWCC’s obligation in s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act extended to persons who “may” be charged. They contended that the present case was, accordingly, analogous to the circumstances in Lee v The Queen in that their compelled evidence had been provided to the DPP without lawful authority and that their rights to a fair trial had been “altered in a fundamental respect” (relying on Lee v The Queen, at [43] and [51] per French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).
	
	
	Indeed, the applicants submitted that the present case involved “a more far reaching infringement” than in Lee v The Queen on the basis that, in the latter case, the DPP did not have access to the compelled evidence until after charges were laid; whereas in the present case, the compelled evidence has been available from an early stage. They relied on the fact that Mr English and Mr Walkowiak have had access to such evidence to give advice on whether, and what, charges should be laid, draft and settle the Crown Case statement, confer with witnesses and draft or settle their proofs of evidence.
	
	
	They contended that the decision to commence the present proceedings (trial by indictment for misconduct in public office or accessory before the fact) was made after the DPP (Mr Babb) had read extracts of evidence compelled from each of the accused and that this circumstance constituted actual prejudice. They submitted that the companion principle ought not be confined to the time from the laying of charges, and ought also apply to the consideration whether charges ought be laid.
	


The relief sought: permanent or temporary stay


	
	The applicants relied on the following in support of their application for a stay:
	



	
	The prosecution overlaps with the matters with which Operation Acacia was concerned (and matters in respect of which the applicants were examined, both in private hearings and in the public inquiry), namely the allocation by Mr Macdonald of the exploration licence to DCM, and the circumstances of the relationship between the two applicants;
	
	
	ICAC was not entitled to forward the applicants’ compelled evidence to the DPP (except in relation to potential charges under s 87) and that, even if the provision of such evidence was not expressly prohibited, it was inconsistent with the accusatory system and the statutory scheme that it be provided;
	
	
	It was of benefit to the DPP to know what evidence had been compelled from the applicants since the DPP thereby gained foreknowledge of the potential defences that would, or could, be raised by the applicants and could therefore allocate more resources and attention to the matters known to be in issue (such as whether Mr Macdonald received the DPI briefings recommending against a direct allocation to DCM);
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Babb, Mr English and Mr Walkowiak about what they recalled was not particularly reliable because of the accepted unforeseen recovery of lost memory; and
	
	
	The evidence of Mr English and Mr Walkowiak that they had been careful not to use the knowledge they had obtained through being privy to the evidence compelled from the applicants was unreliable because they were not in a position to be definitive about the use to which they put such knowledge, which may have subconsciously influenced their forensic decisions.
	


The conduct of the examination in the public inquiry


	
	The applicants submitted that there was a discrete and additional basis on which a permanent stay ought be granted which did not depend on disclosure of the compelled evidence to the DPP. They contended that the examinations conducted by ICAC in the public inquiry gave rise to such an increased jeopardy of prosecution (for an offence under s 87) that each applicant’s right to make a forensic decision whether to give evidence on his own account had been substantially affected. They argued that, if they chose to give evidence, the potential for arguably inconsistent answers (between their evidence at trial and their compelled evidence before ICAC) would expose them to an unwarranted risk of prosecution under s 87 of the ICAC Act. They submitted that the effect of this consequence was to fundamentally affect their right to choose whether to give evidence or remain silent.
	
	
	The applicants highlighted the following circumstances:
	



	
	The length of their public examinations made them oppressive;
	
	
	Many of the questions were leading, discursive and repetitive;
	
	
	Many of the questions would have been inadmissible in a court;
	
	
	Mr Maitland was repeatedly asked to comment about the evidence that others had given in ICAC in a way which went beyond what was required to afford natural justice;
	
	
	Although Mr Maitland was legally represented by experienced counsel (Mr Darke) in ICAC, his objections to questions posed by counsel assisting were dismissed in an apparently peremptory way; and
	
	
	The number of questions and the discursive and hostile manner in which they were asked increased the jeopardy to the applicants if they chose to give evidence at their criminal trial.
	


Further relief sought: requirement that fresh prosecution team be constituted


	
	The applicants submitted, on the basis of the narrative set out above, that Mr Walkowiak and Mr English were involved in drafting and settling statements and proofs of evidence of Crown witnesses between about June 2015 and March 2016 and conferring with such witnesses between about December 2015 and March 2016. They submitted that, if I declined to grant a permanent stay, I ought grant a temporary stay on terms that the evidence of each of the witnesses named in the notice of motion be required to be prepared from scratch by persons who had not read the compelled evidence of the applicants.
	


The Crown’s submissions


	
	The Crown’s submissions contained a detailed analysis of the relevant statutory provisions, with particular emphasis on the ICAC Act. The provisions relied upon have been addressed in the summary of statutory provisions set out above.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the only use made by the DPP of the applicants’ compelled evidence occurred prior to their being charged. It relied on the proposition that the “companion principle” does not operate as an aspect of the principle of legality for the purposes of statutory construction in advance of the commencement of criminal proceedings: R v Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commissioner [2016] HCA 8 (R v IBAC); 90 ALJR 433 at [48]-[52] (French CJ, Kiefel, Bell, Keane, Nettle and Gordon JJ). It submitted that to apply the companion principle to the ICAC Act in anticipation of the commencement of criminal proceedings would be antithetical to the investigation and exposure of corrupt conduct by public officials, which is an object of the Act.
	
	
	The Crown contended that the objects provision, s 2A of the ICAC Act, indicated that the results of ICAC’s investigations are intended to be made public. It submitted that ss 16 and 53 of the ICAC Act were expressed in broad terms which showed that Parliament did not intend to constrain ICAC’s power to provide information obtained in the course of its investigations to others. The Crown argued that ICAC’s function of deciding whether independent advice should be sought from the DPP was consistent with s 14A of the Criminal Procedure Act which specifically provided that ICAC is dependent on the DPP for independent advice with respect to the commencement of criminal prosecutions. It contended that the material on the basis of which independent advice could be given must, by implication, include the transcripts of public examinations conducted by ICAC.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that s 14(1)(a) of the ICAC Act, which empowered ICAC to furnish to the DPP evidence that may be admissible in the prosecution of a relevant criminal offence, did not affect ICAC’s duty to furnish information to the DPP pursuant to s 15A of the DPP Act, which was expressed, by s 15A(5), to be “in addition” to any other duties of law enforcement officers in connection with the investigation or prosecution of offences. The Crown relied on the breadth of the duty in s 15A, which was not limited to admissible or potentially admissible evidence and required, in addition, the disclosure of the existence of privileged material (although not the privileged material itself unless the DPP requested it) and of the existence of material the subject of a statutory non-publication restriction (although not the subject of material covered by the restriction).
	
	
	The Crown contended that, although s 15A is expressed in terms of a duty, the necessary power for ICAC officers to perform that duty was necessarily implied: Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517 at 528 (Sheppard J). It relied on what it submitted was a powerful distinguishing feature in the present case: ICAC was not only authorised, but also obliged, to disclose the examination transcripts (including the compelled evidence) to the DPP and the DPP was obliged to consider them, at least to determine whether there had been a breach of s 87 of the ICAC Act.
	
	
	The Crown relied on the dicta of Gageler J in R v IBAC at [65] in support of its contention that s 18(1) (which was analogous to s 70(1) of the Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2011 (VIC)) expressly abrogated the common law presumption that a statutory power to investigate an offence ends when the prosecution for that offence begins: see Hammond v The Commonwealth (1982) 152 CLR 188 at 198-199 per Gibbs CJ (Mason and Murphy JJ agreeing on this point) and at 206 per Deane J. It submitted that the references to trial by jury and the actual taking of evidence by the prosecution in s 18(2A) indicate that the mischief to which s 18(2) is directed is that the publicity attracted by an investigation could affect the capacity of jurors to confine their deliberations to the evidence in the trial to the exclusion of the information in the public domain as a result of the investigation. The Crown described s 18 as constituting the ICAC Act’s “own express scheme for the protection of the fairness of trials”.
	
	
	The Crown contrasted the effect and purpose of s 18 of the ICAC Act with s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act. It contended that the ICAC Act did not contain any provision that was equivalent to s 13(9) which had a similar purpose of protecting the future fair trial of a person who might be charged with offences as a result of an investigation conducted by ICAC.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the several limbs of s 37(2) evince a legislative intention to effect the widest possible abrogation of privilege. The protection from direct use conferred by s 37(3) by making the evidence inadmissible in subsequent proceedings is the sole protection remaining, but only if objection is taken. If no objection is made, the answer or document is admissible: s 37(4)(b).
	
	
	The Crown contended that an objection taken in the course of an examination conducted by ICAC has evidentiary consequences by reason of s 37(3) of the ICAC Act but does not fall within s 15A(6) of the DPP Act because it is not “the subject of a claim of privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity” (all relevant privileges having been abrogated). It contended that the reference to “public interest immunity or statutory immunity” is a separate category. It relied on the proposition that public interest immunity could not be waived (and was therefore in a different category from privileges such as legal professional privilege and the privilege against self-incrimination). It contended that the term “statutory immunity” referred to provisions conferring immunity from disclosure such as the secrecy provisions in s 111 of the ICAC Act and s 80 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW).
	
	
	The Crown relied on R v OC (Oliver Curtis) in support of the proposition that Parliament could, by appropriate statutory wording, authorise the provision of transcript of a compulsory examination to those responsible for determining whether to charge the examinee and institute criminal proceedings, as well as for the purposes of carrying out the prosecution.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, although one consequence of its submissions was that the DPP and his officers and legal representatives could use the compelled evidence for the preparation of the prosecution case, even after charges had been laid, it was not necessary to decide that question in the present case. It argued that the fact that the compelled evidence had been given in public provided a sufficient, and independent, reason why there was no impediment to its being known to (and used by, whether subconsciously or otherwise) the members of the prosecution team. The Crown pointed to the artificiality of the remedy proposed by the applicants which would have the following consequences:
	



	
	the DPP could consider the compelled evidence for the purposes of deciding whether s 87 charges ought be brought, but would have to bring in another DPP officer to consider other charges;
	
	
	no person who had seen or otherwise been privy to (whether as part of the ordinary daily life of the community or in his or her role for the DPP) any part of the compelled evidence could take part in advising whether charges (other than under s 87) ought be brought or in the preparation of the prosecution case for any offence other than under s 87.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the legislature had made “large choices” to have some of the work of ICAC (including the investigation of potentially criminal conduct) conducted in public and that the consequence of these choices was that the prosecutors (and the public at large) were aware of the content of the compelled evidence before charge.
	
	
	The Crown relied on the following dicta from the judgment of Gageler and Keane JJ in Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 at [323] in which their Honours said:
	


There is a variety of ways in which, as a matter of practical reality, the examination on oath of a person against whom criminal proceedings have been commenced may have a tendency to give rise to unfairness amounting to an interference with the due course of justice in a particular case. The deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice available to the person in those proceedings may be one of those ways. However, we are unable to regard as the deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice a practical constraint on the legal representatives of the person leading evidence or cross-examining or making submissions in the criminal proceedings to suggest a version of the facts which contradicted that given by their client on oath in the examination.


	
	The applicants contended, in reply, that this passage was not concerned with the examinee’s forensic choice whether to give evidence in his defence, but rather the way the cross-examination could be conducted and how other evidence in chief would be led. Accordingly, the applicants argued that it provided no answer to their argument as to the jeopardy they faced as a result of being compelled to give such extensive evidence in the public inquiry.
	


Consideration

The grounds for a stay

Criminal proceedings should be stayed permanently only in exceptional cases: Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 (Jago). The Court must be satisfied the continuation of the proceedings would, relevantly, involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness: R v Edwards [2009] HCA 20; 83 ALJR 717 at [23]. The test is a “would” test, not a “could” test. The mere risk of unacceptable injustice or unfairness is insufficient: TS v R [2014] NSWCCA 174 at [1] per Leeming JA. The Court must be satisfied that no other means are available to remedy that feature which, if unremedied, would render the proceeding so seriously defective, whether by reason of unfairness, injustice or otherwise, as to demand the grant of a permanent stay: Jago at 57 and 78.


	
	Where there is a feature which creates unfairness but which can be remedied, a temporary stay may be appropriate. Further, the evidence of witnesses tarnished by the unfairness may be excluded.
	


The effect of relevant legislation on the applicants’ common law rights


	
	As referred to above, the question whether a stay ought be granted (whether permanent or temporary) is largely one of statutory construction and requires an analysis of the relevant statutory provisions in order to determine their effect on common law principles. The reason for this is that the common law privilege against self-incrimination can be abrogated and the companion principle affected, as long as the legislative intention is sufficiently clear. As was said in Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co. Pty Ltd (1993) 178 CLR 477, at 533-534 (Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ):
	


Nevertheless, a statutory intention to modify or abrogate a common law right, such as the privilege against self-incrimination, must emerge clearly, whether by express words or necessary implication. When it does the courts must give it effect. There is no constitutional constraint as in the United States. But, as with the legislation which the Court considered in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission and Controlled Consultants Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Corporate Affairs, the legislature may, whilst compelling the production of incriminating material, provide protection against its use in the prosecution of the person producing it, whether a natural person or a corporation. Questions arise as to the extent of the protection necessary — whether it should prevent only direct use or whether it should extend to derivative use — but that is something which is properly a matter for the legislature to consider.


	
	Before turning to the legislation, I propose to address, so far as is relevant, the principal authorities relied on by the parties: X7 v Australian Crime Commission; Lee v The Queen; and R v OC (Oliver Curtis) and Redacted Judgment [2015] NSWCCA 281 (Redacted Judgment).
	


Relevant authorities

X7 v Australian Crime Commission


	
	In November 2010 X7 was arrested and charged with conspiracies involving drugs under the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). While in custody awaiting trial he was served with a summons to appear and give evidence before the ACC. On the first day, he attended the compulsory examination and answered questions that related to the very matters that gave rise to the charges. On the following day, he refused to answer any further questions of that nature. As a consequence, he was told that he would be charged with failing to answer questions.
	
	
	By narrow majority (Hayne, Bell and Kiefel JJ, French CJ and Crennan J dissenting), the High Court held that to permit the executive to ask, and compel answers to, questions about the subject matter of a pending charge (irrespective of what use might be made of those answers at the trial of an accused person) would “fundamentally alter the process of criminal justice” ([85]). Their Honours held that to construe the ACC Act as the ACC contended would “alter to a marked degree the accusatorial nature of the criminal justice system” ([87]). The majority held that the ACC Act did not authorise an examiner to require a person charged with a Commonwealth indictable offence to answer questions about the subject matter of the charged offence. I respectfully adopt Bathurst CJ’s (Beazley P, Hidden, Fullerton and R A Hulme JJ agreeing) summary of the propositions for which X7 v Australian Crime Commission is authority in X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273; 292 FLR 57, at [105] as follows:
	


First, as a matter of construction the ACC Act did not permit an examination of a charged person about the matters for which they had been charged. This was because such an examination fundamentally altered the accusatorial judicial process. The accused could no longer decide the course to adopt according only to the strength of the prosecution's case, but rather also in light of any self-incriminating answer he or she had been compelled to give at the examination. Second, such an examination constituted a contempt of court. Third, the conclusion did not depend on the fairness or otherwise of the trial, as what was required was a trial according to law.


	
	In X7 v Australian Crime Commission Hayne and Bell JJ described the prejudice suffered by an accused who is compulsorily examined in the following terms at [124]:
	


Even if the answers given at a compulsory examination are kept secret, and therefore cannot be used directly or indirectly by those responsible for investigating and prosecuting the matters charged, the requirement to give answers, after being charged, would fundamentally alter the accusatorial judicial process that begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in the accusatorial (and adversarial) trial in the courtroom. No longer could the accused person decide the course which he or she should adopt at trial, in answer to the charge, according only to the strength of the prosecution's case as revealed by the material provided by the prosecution before trial, or to the strength of the evidence led by the prosecution at the trial. The accused person would have to decide the course to be followed in light of that material and in light of any self-incriminatory answers which he or she had been compelled to give at an examination conducted after the charge was laid. That is, the accused person would have to decide what plea to enter, what evidence to challenge and what evidence to give or lead at trial according to what answers he or she had given at the examination. The accused person is thus prejudiced in his or her defence of the charge that has been laid by being required to answer questions about the subject matter of the pending charge.


	
	This passage was approved in Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 (Lee No. 1) by French CJ at [54] (footnote 173); Kiefel J (Bell J agreeing) at [163] (footnote 341). Although Hayne J did not refer to the passage specifically in Lee No. 1, his Honour restated the principle in similar terms in Lee No. 1 at [79]. To the extent to which the other members of the High Court (Crennan, Gageler and Keane JJ) said, or implied that secrecy provisions were sufficient to address that prejudice (Crennan J at [141] and Gageler and Keane JJ at [340], they were in the minority.
	


Lee v The Queen


	
	The appellants, Jason and Seong Lee (who were father and son), stood trial on various drug and firearm offences. The father had been examined by the NSWCC on two occasions prior to being charged. The NSWCC had given a direction pursuant to s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act prohibiting the publication of evidence (except as specified) on the basis that publication might prejudice his fair trial if he were charged. The son was also examined by the NSWCC before charge. After they were charged, the transcripts of their evidence before the NSWCC were provided to the DPP, contrary to the direction pursuant to s 13(9).
	
	
	In the course of a pre-trial hearing in November 2010, the prosecutor accepted that, although he could not rely on the material provided to the NSWCC because of the “use” immunity, he intended to use the material derivatively because it provided the Crown with considerable insight into the nature of the defence case.
	
	
	Both appellants were convicted after a trial by jury in the District Court of drug and firearm offences. In a unanimous judgment, the High Court held that the criminal trial of the appellants had been affected in a fundamental respect because the provision of the transcripts to the Crown “altered the position of the prosecution vis-à-vis the accused” ([51]). Accordingly, the convictions were quashed and a new trial ordered. The Court held that the question was not whether the publication of the transcripts was unlawful or wrongful but whether, as a result of the Crown obtaining the appellants’ evidence, there was a miscarriage of justice.
	


R v OC (Oliver Curtis)


	
	In R v OC (Oliver Curtis), a summary of Mr Curtis’s examination pursuant to s 19 of the ASIC Act was provided to officers of the CDPP and prosecuting counsel. It was used not only to formulate a charge but also to prepare the prosecution case. Chief Justice Bathurst (R A Hulme and Bellew JJ agreeing) agreed with the trial judge that ASIC officers could make use of the transcript for making an informed decision whether to charge the examinee and institute proceedings. This was regarded as flowing from ASIC’s power under s 18(2)(c) to supply a copy of the report and include a record of the examination.
	
	
	The issue on appeal in R v OC (Oliver Curtis) (which also arises for present consideration) was whether the prosecution could have access to the compelled evidence to prepare the prosecution case. The trial judge answered that question in the negative and ordered a temporary stay in order that a new prosecution team (which had not been privy to Mr Curtis’s s 19 examination) could be assembled for the purposes of his prosecution. The appeal was allowed and the stay set aside.
	
	
	At [108] Bathurst CJ noted that the ASIC Act expressly contemplated that use could be made of the examination. His Honour referred to s 76 of the ASIC Act which provides that a statement made in an examination is admissible in evidence against a person in a proceeding unless it is inadmissible by reason of s 68(3) (which preserves the protection against direct use if the pre-conditions in s 68(2) are met). His Honour concluded:
	


[119] Once it is accepted that statements made during a s 19 examination areadmissible in criminal proceedings, unless the two preconditions in s 68(2) are met, and that the time for determining whether these conditions are satisfied is at the time the statements are sought to be tendered in evidence, it follows, as a matter of necessary implication, that the CDPP officers responsible for the conduct of the proceedings are entitled to have access to the examination transcripts, not only to formulate charges, but to prosecute them. This access would enable CDPP officers to consider whether the privilege was properly claimed on any answer and whether the transcript could be tendered. Her Honour, with respect, erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.

[120] The alternative construction propounded by the respondent (see [90] above), suggesting that it was not necessarily implicit that the CDPP was entitled to have access to the transcript, as a separate “voir dire team” could be engaged by the prosecution, derives no support from the terms of the legislation. Rather, the ASIC Act, particularly s 49, in conjunction with s 68, s 76 and s 77, in my view, discloses, by necessary intendment, that if a prosecution is caused to be commenced or carried out by ASIC, the prosecutors may be given access to the transcript of a s 19 examination and, subject only to the prohibition against the direct use of self-incriminating material in s 68, can use it for the purpose of the prosecution.


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the appeal and dissolved the stay, on the basis that the prosecutor was entitled to use Mr Curtis’s s 19 examination for the purposes of the prosecution case, the question of its admissibility against him being a matter that could only be determined if and when it was sought to be tendered in the prosecution case.
	


Redacted Judgment [2015] NSWCCA 281


	
	In Redacted Judgment the applicant was examined by the NSWCC before he was charged with murder. Investigating police were aware of the examination and had listened to part of it. Transcripts of the evidence compelled from the applicant were provided to the DPP but none of the officers of the DPP or counsel briefed for the Crown had read or accessed the applicant’s transcript.
	
	
	In support of his application for a permanent or temporary stay of the proceedings, the applicant submitted, on the basis of X7 v NSW Crime Commission and Lee v The Queen, that his examination by the NSWCC amounted to a fundamental departure from the accusatorial system of criminal justice. He argued that the use of information obtained from his compelled evidence by the NSWCC and the police, both in connection with the investigation and the subsequent examination by the NSWCC of another witness meant that the trial would be unfair.
	
	
	The trial judge dismissed the application. The Court of Criminal Appeal granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal. It held that the mere fact of a compulsory examination did not, of itself, warrant a stay of proceedings and that it was necessary to look at the consequences of the compulsory examination. The Court held that there was no prohibition on the NSWCC using the applicant’s compelled evidence for the purposes of examining another witness. The Court also found that, since the investigation was ongoing, it could not be said that the applicant’s examination was conducted for an improper purpose, even if its purpose was to tie him down to key aspects of the case so as to inform investigating police of these matters.
	


The present case in light of the authorities referred to above


	
	The applicants have not established any breach of the companion principle in the sense of X7 v Australian Crime Commission, since no evidence has been compelled from them since they were charged. In Lee v The Queen, the investigating authority (NSWCC) was directed not to give the compelled evidence to the prosecutors, whereas in the present case the compelled evidence was already in the public domain even if s 15A did not (contrary to my view set out below) require it to be provided to them.
	
	
	The present case shares features of R v OC (Oliver Curtis) in that, before they were charged, the applicants were subject to lawful compulsory examination, which was analysed by the relevant prosecuting authority for the purposes of laying charges. It was accepted that their compelled evidence was properly considered by the DPP and his officers for the purposes of deciding whether to lay charges under s 87 of the ICAC Act. However, there is a significant distinguishing feature in the present case in that the applicants’ compelled evidence was given in, and disseminated to, the public at large, which included any prosecutors, potential prosecutors and the DPP himself. In these circumstances, any differences between the applicable legislative regimes would not appear to be determinative.
	
	
	I regard the reasoning in [119] of R v OC (Oliver Curtis) (extracted above) as applicable to the present case, although in that case no public disclosure of Mr Curtis’s compelled evidence was authorised.
	
	
	The present case also shares features of the Redacted Judgment in that the applicants were compelled to give evidence on the same subject matter as their subsequent charges. They have therefore been deprived of the opportunity of holding in reserve until the commencement of the trial, the way in which they propose to defend the charges, certain forensic choices being foreclosed to them by the content of their compelled evidence. Furthermore, if they choose to give evidence in their trial, they may expose themselves to the jeopardy of a prosecution under s 87 if their evidence at trial is inconsistent with their compelled evidence (see [124] of X7 v Australian Crime Commission). I am not persuaded that this prejudice is one that ought be taken into account, since it is a legitimate prejudice. The giving of evidence under compulsion is authorised by the ICAC Act. The prejudice to the applicants from having been compelled to give evidence, on a matter in respect of which they were subsequently charged, flows from the wording of the statute itself. This very situation (that a person could be examined compulsorily and then charged about the very same matters in respect of which he or she was compulsorily examined) was specifically authorised and provided for by the ICAC Act, which also contemplated that their evidence in the public inquiry would be given in public and disseminated to the public at large and provided to the DPP.
	


The ICAC Act: its meaning and effect in the circumstances of the present case


	
	The objects of the ICAC Act are relevant. It is plain from the objects that the publication of ICAC’s hearings and findings is crucial to the performance of its powers and functions, which include to “expose”, “prevent” and “educate”. ICAC is, in effect, akin to a permanent Royal Commission into corrupt conduct, the mandate of which is to expose what actually occurred (in some circumstances to the public at large) and recommend appropriate action in the public interest (see the summary of the legislative history of the ICAC Act in ICAC v Cunneen [2015] HCA 14; 89 ALJR 475 at [4]-[14] per French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Nettle JJ). Its investigations may lead to the eventual securing of criminal convictions, although its functions and objects are by no means confined to that end.
	
	
	The ICAC Act confers power on ICAC to obtain a statement of information from a public authority or public official (s 21) and to obtain a document from any person (s 22). However, s 24 obliges ICAC to set aside the requirement (under s 21 or s 22) if the person would have a ground to resist such a requirement in a court, except on grounds associated with public interest immunity or another ground applying to a public official. Section 26 provides that if a document tends to incriminate a person and the person objects, neither the requirement to produce nor the document can be used in any proceedings (except for an offence under the ICAC Act or for the purposes of the investigation). There is, accordingly, a prohibition in s 26(2) on use (whether direct or derivative) for purposes other than the investigation itself (s 26(3)).
	
	
	These provisions (s 21, 22 and 24) are to be contrasted with s 37 of the ICAC Act, which applies to witnesses summoned to answer questions or produce documents at a compulsory examination or public inquiry. In those circumstances, s 37 abrogates all relevant privileges in respect of answers given or documents produced. All that remains by way of protection for the examinee is a rule of evidence which makes inadmissible the answer or document in civil, criminal (except under s 87) or disciplinary proceedings as long as objection (on any ground, whether or not referable to an objection that could be taken in court) is made. Thus, an objection has evidentiary consequences because of s 37, but is not a “claim of privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity” in s 15A(6) of the DPP Act.
	
	
	Section 37 is also to be contrasted with sections such as the (now repealed) s 18(5) of the NSWCC Act which protected the person not only by making the compelled evidence inadmissible in any subsequent proceedings but also by prohibiting the use of ""any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence” of that enforced testimony in any such subsequent proceeding (considered in Rogan v Hyde (1995) 84 A Crim R 519 at 524-525. (Allen J)).
	
	
	This construction does not leave the words “claim of privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity” in s 15A(6) without work to do. First, s 15A applies to law enforcement officers generally (which are defined to include police officers or members of staff of the Police Integrity Commission, the NSWCC and ICAC). Secondly, the words comprehend privileges and immunities which are not personal, such as public interest immunity (which cannot be waived) or the statutory immunity conferring immunity from disclosure in s 111 of the ICAC Act and s 80 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW). Thus s 15A(6) is concerned with the various bases on which law enforcement officers might ordinarily be either entitled, or obliged, to refuse to produce material.
	
	
	Moreover, 15A is expressed in terms of the obligation of the law enforcement agency. The agency is not required to provide material to the DPP which is the subject of a claim for privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity (s 15A(6)), unless the DPP requests that it be provided: s 15A(7). This wording is inconsistent with a prohibition on the provision of compelled evidence to the DPP.
	
	
	The DPP’s role is to determine whether criminal charges should be laid and to conduct all prosecutions. The applicants accept that, in order to determine whether to lay charges against a person for offences under s 87 of the ICAC Act, it is necessary for the DPP to see the person’s compelled evidence. In substance, the effect of the applicants’ submissions is that, once the DPP has seen the compelled evidence for the purpose of deciding whether to lay charges under s 87, or advise that they be laid, neither the DPP himself nor any of his officers who have been privy to the compelled evidence, can take any further part either in the decision whether to lay other charges or in the prosecution of the person for any charges other than those under s 87. I do not consider that such a division of functions is required by the accusatorial system of justice when considered in light of the ICAC Act and the DPP Act, at least in the present circumstances where the compelled evidence has been given in a public inquiry (in the case of the applicants’ oral evidence) or tendered in a public inquiry (in the case of extracts from their evidence in private compulsory examination).
	
	
	In these circumstances it can hardly be supposed that ICAC would be obliged to hold back from the DPP material which is already in the public domain or that the DPP would be constrained from accessing such material, lest its very provision would disempower the DPP from using it to determine whether a person should be charged and prosecuted. I do not consider that, in these circumstances, the DPP is obliged to erect Chinese walls within the office to separate those who had seen the compelled evidence, from those who had not. ICAC’s obligation to disclose information to the DPP (including the transcripts of compelled evidence) necessarily implies that its officers have the power to disclose it and that the DPP is entitled to receive it: Australian Securities Commission v Bell at 528.
	
	
	In my view, s 14(1) of the ICAC Act is not intended to confine the provision of information under s 15A of the DPP Act. Its wording (which confers a function) is inconsistent with the construction for which the applicants contended (that it imposes a prohibition). I regard s 14 of the ICAC Act and s 15A of the DPP Act as dealing with different matters. Section 15A is designed to ensure that all material (except that which is subject to a claim for privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity) germane to a prosecution, whether for or against the accused, is provided to the DPP as soon as the DPP exercises any function with respect to the prosecution of an offence (including forming an opinion whether charges ought be laid). By contrast, the purpose of s 14(1) of the ICAC Act is to empower ICAC to gather admissible evidence for the purposes of the prosecution of a charge. Thus, the DPP can use ICAC to obtain evidence (in admissible form) for the purposes of the prosecution case in support of charges to be laid, or charges already laid. As occurred in the present case, lawyers at the DPP (such as Mr Walkowiak) can issue requisitions to ICAC with a view to its officers obtaining statements from witnesses for the purposes of the prosecution case. When seen in this context, s 14 neither limits, nor otherwise affects, ICAC’s obligation of disclosure in s 15A.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s submission that, given the evident legislative intention that the evidence compelled by the applicants in the public inquiry be public, it would be artificial to exempt the DPP from access to such material for whatever purpose. I also accept the Crown’s argument that, once the material is in the public domain (as in the present case), the accusatorial criminal process has been altered, at least to the extent of allowing the prosecutors (and the public at large) to know what the compelled evidence is, in advance of charge. I see no warrant for a requirement that the prosecutors must obliterate any memory of the compelled evidence, once they have become aware of it, or that they must live such a cloistered life that they never become aware of what is lawfully in the public domain. Although Mr Jordan sought to draw a distinction between those who had read the compelled evidence and those who had merely heard or read extracts of it in media reports or otherwise, I do not consider that any such distinction can properly be drawn.
	
	
	Accordingly, ICAC’s officers are obliged by s 15A to disclose to the DPP the information (including the compelled evidence at least if it has been given, or tendered, in public), since it “might reasonably be expected to assist the case for the prosecution or the case for an accused person”, within the meaning of s 15A(1). Although the evidence compelled from the applicants is not admissible (except in a prosecution under s 87 of the ICAC Act, which is not presently relevant), it must nonetheless be provided to the DPP and can, in my view, be used by him for the purposes of formulating a charge, whether under s 87 or any other law.
	
	
	I also consider that the DPP is entitled to use the compelled evidence (at least if it has been given, or tendered, in public) to prepare the prosecution case (although I am satisfied that this has not occurred in the present case). Although there are differences between the wording of the ASIC Act (considered in R v OC (Oliver Curtis)) and that of the ICAC Act, I do not regard them as producing a different result. That ASIC can prosecute examinees (although the CDPP can take over such prosecution at any time), whereas ICAC refers matters to the DPP (for advice whether proceedings should be commenced against particular person), is not a material distinction for present purposes. Although the ICAC Act entitles examinees to take a general objection (without grounds), whereas the ASIC Act limits the objection that can be taken and makes provision for the determination which must be made at trial, I am not persuaded that this is a relevant distinction.
	
	
	Even if the differences between the evidentiary provisions of the ASIC Act and the ICAC Act were material, the present case has the additional feature that Parliament has provided for public inquiries held by ICAC to be conducted in public. ICAC publishes transcripts of its public inquiries on the internet to be seen by all. The legislative intention that evidence can be compelled in a public inquiry from someone who may subsequently be charged is significant. It distinguishes a public inquiry conducted by ICAC from examinations conducted by the NSWCC, the ACC or ASIC, where evidence is invariably compelled in private and, if disclosed, is disclosed only to an identified class of persons, who may have a particular need to know of the evidence.
	
	
	It follows that I am not persuaded either that the provision of the compelled evidence to the DPP was unauthorised in the present case or that there is any restriction on the use to which it can be put by the DPP in the prosecution of the applicants. The only limitation on its use is that it is inadmissible in the trial for the present charges, objection having been taken at the time ICAC compelled the applicants to give the evidence.
	


Whether the way in which the compelled evidence was obtained in the public inquiry ought lead to a stay of the criminal trial


	
	The passages in the transcript of the compelled evidence relied upon by the applicants illustrate what might be regarded as salient features of a public inquiry conducted by ICAC. For example, the applicants were required to give evidence after they had been compulsorily examined and after other witnesses had already given evidence at the public inquiry. Although some questions were in a non-leading form, many more were not. Many questions contained summaries of evidence given by other witnesses (who were identified by name in the question) and invited comment from the applicants. Some questions included rhetorical flourishes beyond those which are usual in a court room. Questions not uncommonly contained several propositions.
	
	
	A reading of the passages relied upon demonstrates the differences between a public inquiry in ICAC and proceedings in court. These differences are, in my view, largely (if not wholly) the product of the provisions of the ICAC Act that the rules of evidence do not apply (s 17(1)); that ICAC’s functions are to be conducted with as little formality and technicality as possible; and that public inquiries are to be conducted with as little emphasis on an adversarial approach as is possible (s 17(2)).
	
	
	I am not persuaded that there was anything unlawful in the evidence compelled from the applicants. No improper purpose has been articulated. However, even if I were persuaded of the applicants’ contention, I am not satisfied that the appropriate remedy would be to stay the criminal trial. This Court’s jurisdiction under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) and its inherent jurisdiction over subordinate tribunals, including ICAC, (such as was invoked in Cunneen v ICAC [2014] NSWCA 421; and ICAC v Cunneen [2015] HCA 14; 89 ALJR 475) would seem to be a more appropriate (and possibly, the only) avenue of relief.
	


Conclusion


	
	I consider that ICAC’s obligation to provide information to the DPP (including compelled evidence, at least if it has been given in public) under s 15A necessarily implies (having regard to the other statutory provisions, including s 14, 26 and 37) that the DPP is entitled, not only to use such information to provide an opinion as to whether a person should be charged and to formulate charges, but is also entitled to use such information to prosecute them. It is not necessary, for present purposes, to decide whether the same result would be achieved if the compelled evidence was not already in the public domain.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the applicants have made out any basis for either a permanent or temporary stay of their trial. I am not satisfied that there is any basis to exclude Mr Babb, Mr English or Mr Walkowiak from further participation in the prosecution of the applicants for the present offences. This is sufficient to determine the notices of motion and requires that they both be dismissed.
	
	
	In these circumstances it is not necessary to determine the extent to which, if at all, Mr English’s and Mr Walkowiak’s access to the compelled evidence influenced their preparation of the prosecution case against the applicants.
	
	
	However, lest a different view be taken as to this matter, I am obliged to make findings of fact based on the evidence before me. These are set out above in the narrative and the consideration of access and recollection. The evidence relied on by the applicants goes only as far as to suggest that it is possible that Mr English’s advice and Mr Walkowiak’s requisitions for further investigations or evidence might have been affected by the compelled evidence to which they had been privy. What emerged from the cross-examination of Mr English and Mr Walkowiak is that, in respect of each matter put to them by counsel as having been prompted by some aspect of the compelled evidence, there was another (in some cases, more probable) explanation for the inquiry or advice. Each has been conscious of the requirement imposed by Mr Fagan and reiterated by Mr Neil that they put out of their minds the compelled evidence in the conduct of the prosecution case (which they read only for the (proper) purpose of advising the DPP whether charges ought be laid). I am satisfied that, to the extent to which they are able to put out of their minds what they have read and still recall of the compelled evidence, they have done so.

2769756,R v Turnbull (No. 26) [2016] NSWSC 847,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	JOHNSON J: In the late afternoon of Tuesday, 29 July 2014, Glendon (Glen) Turner and Robert Strange were carrying out their duties in the Croppa Creek area, some 60 kilometres from Moree in northern New South Wales. Both men were Compliance Officers employed by the Office of Environment and Heritage (“OEH”) exercising functions under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. The two men were approached by the Offender, Ian Robert Turnbull, on Talga Lane. The events which followed left Mr Turner dead and Mr Strange shattered by a prolonged and terrifying event.
	


The Offences


	
	Arising from these events, the Offender was charged with very serious criminal offences.
	
	
	He stood trial for the murder of Mr Turner and, on 27 May 2016, was found guilty of murder by the jury.
	
	
	On 20 April 2016, the Offender pleaded guilty to a charge of detaining Mr Strange with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely the homicide of Mr Turner.
	
	
	The offence of murder is punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. In the circumstances of this case, it is common ground that a standard non-parole period of 25 years applies given that, at the time of his murder, Mr Turner was a public official exercising public functions and the offence arose because of Mr Turner’s occupation: s.54A; Item 1A, Table of Standard Non-Parole Periods, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offence of detaining Mr Strange for advantage is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment: s.86(1) Crimes Act 1900. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	The starting point is to make findings of fact for the purpose of sentence concerning the offences. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me, for the purposes of sentencing, must be consistent with the verdict of the jury: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378. The Court may not take a matter into account on sentence, in a way that is adverse to the interests of the Offender, unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are matters which the Offender relies upon to reduce penalty, it is enough if those matters are proved by the Offender on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28].
	
	
	As will be seen, the facts of the s.86 offence involving Mr Strange lie within the narrative of the offence of murder.
	


Background to the Offences


	
	What follows constitutes my findings of fact with respect to events over a period of years leading up to the offences on 29 July 2014. An understanding of this history is necessary to explain the events of 29 July 2014.
	
	
	The Offender was born in Moree on 13 November 1934. He was 79 years old at the time of the offences. In the early 1960s, the Offender and his wife bought their first farm known as “Yambin” in the Croppa Creek area outside Moree. They were living at “Yambin” as at 29 July 2014.
	
	
	The Offender initially farmed stock and grain, but changed to only grain farming and had been a successful farmer in the Moree district. The Offender’s farming operation grew and, over the years, he purchased 11 or 12 farms with his family including his sons, Roger and Grant Turnbull.
	
	
	In the latter part of 2011, the Offender arranged the purchase of adjacent properties in the Croppa Creek area known as “Strathdoon” (about 1,532 hectares) and “Colorado” (about 916 hectares). These properties were located about 30 kilometres from “Yambin”. “Strathdoon” and “Colorado” were opposite “Buckie”, another property owned by the Offender which lay on the other side of County Boundary Road. The Offender and his wife assisted his son Grant and his grandson, Cory Turnbull, financially in the purchase of “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”, including guaranteeing Cory Turnbull’s loan. The evidence revealed that “Strathdoon” was purchased for $1.9 million and “Colorado” for $3.2 million (T933).
	
	
	Neither Grant nor Cory Turnbull lived constantly in the Moree area. At all relevant times, both Grant Turnbull and Cory Turnbull lived in different locations in Queensland. Grant Turnbull would stay with the Offender at “Yambin” about one week in four, but would otherwise conduct his business remotely from his Queensland home.
	
	
	Prior to their purchase in 2011, both “Strathdoon” and “Colorado” had been grazing properties. It was common ground at the trial that the properties were purchased so that they could be converted from grazing properties to broadacre farms. Each property was considered to have good black soil quality. This process of conversion would serve to increase significantly the value of each property and their financial profitability.
	
	
	In and after 2011, the Offender, together with workers employed by the Offender and his family, commenced the process of clearing vegetation on the two properties for the purpose of converting them to broadacre farms. This process involved the use of bulldozers and the burning off of cleared vegetation.
	
	
	Valuation evidence was given at the trial to the effect that, by July 2014, “Strathdoon” had a fair market value of $2.2 million and “Colorado” a fair market value of $5.38 million (T580-581). The increased value of the properties reflected the increase in cultivation areas on each property as a result of clearing.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, the substantial clearing activity on the two properties attracted the attention of the OEH and its officers, given the statutory duty of that agency to enforce the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	The evidence indicates that there was, and remains, a level of tension in the Moree district with respect to compliance with the Native Vegetation Act 2003. Application of that law requires a level of investigation, observation and regulatory direction by OEH officers which, at times, gives rise to a level of irritation, if not resentment on the part of landholders. In his evidence, the Offender agreed that he disliked the Native Vegetation Act 2003 and its effects (T895).
	
	
	It does not seem that the Offender had encountered directly the need to comply with the provisions of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 before the acquisition of “Strathdoon” and “Colorado” in late 2011.
	
	
	It is fair to describe the Offender as an old-fashioned farmer, with firm views about land ownership and use of the land. It may be inferred readily that the Offender, and members of his family, did not look kindly upon the level of scrutiny, accountability and regulatory action required under the Native Vegetation Act 2003, and the extent to which it may slow down, if not stop, the planned conversion of the two properties to broadacre farms.
	
	
	The evidence at the trial indicated that there was some interaction between the Offender and Mr Turner up to June 2012. There was no personal face-to-face contact or telephone contact between the two men from that date until 29 July 2014, when the Offender confronted Mr Turner and Mr Strange on Talga Lane.
	
	
	Two incidents referred to in the evidence at the trial shed some light upon the Offender’s reaction to official intervention or investigation of matters concerning his or his family’s land.
	
	
	Dr Christopher Nadolny, an ecologist then employed with the OEH, accompanied Mr Turner on 28 June 2012 on an occasion when they met with the Offender at “Strathdoon”. Dr Nadolny said that there had been substantial clearing on the property and a conversation ensued with the Offender. Dr Nadolny said that, during this conversation, discussion took place concerning a draft remediation area. When Mr Turner told the Offender that he would be able to keep his crop on the remediation area, the Offender said words to the effect, “Well, if you don’t do that, you better watch out for your wellbeing”. When Mr Turner asked the Offender, “Should I take that as a threat?”, the Offender responded, “You can take that whichever way you like. I’m an old man and there’s not much you can do to me”, or words to that effect (T546).
	
	
	On 30 August 2012, Murray Fisher, a senior investigator with the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, attended “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”, together with another Commonwealth officer. His duties involved the investigation of matters for the purposes of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth). On that day, Mr Fisher had a conversation with the Offender in the context of koala conservation on rural properties, an issue falling under the relevant Commonwealth legislation.
	
	
	In the course of a conversation concerning the impact on koalas from land clearing, Mr Fisher impressed upon the Offender the importance of following guidelines. He said that, if he did not do so, it would leave the Offender open to prosecution. Mr Fisher stated that the Offender said words to the effect, “I’m an old man. I’ll do what I want because what are you going to do with me? What will happen to me?”. In further conversation about the property, the Offender explained that he had bought the property because of the soil quality, and that it was the last of the good black soil around the area. According to Mr Fisher, the Offender said words to the effect, “It needed to have a crop in it and that’s what I’m going to do to it” (T504, 513).
	
	
	I am satisfied that these comments made by the Offender, in June and August 2012, reflect his reaction to official investigation and intervention in areas relevant to land ownership and management.
	
	
	The Offender was 77 years of age at the time of these conversations. The Crown did not assert, nor do I find, that these comments may be related directly to the Offender’s acts on 29 July 2014, in the sense that he formed the view in 2012 that he would, in due course, attack Mr Turner. However, they provide considerable insight into his mindset or approach to official scrutiny and intervention in areas relating to land clearing, an activity which was being undertaken, with some vigour, on “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”.
	
	
	By 21 August 2012, it is clear that Mr Turner had formed the view that the Offender had been clearing property contrary to the Native Vegetation Act 2003 and that it was proposed to bring proceedings for those acts. Mr Turner had expressed the view that this was being done “for the money” (Spencer, T1069). This approach was understandable given the clearing activity being undertaken so as to convert the properties to enhance their value and productivity.
	
	
	On 13 December 2012, a prosecution was instituted by the OEH against the Offender in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales. The prosecution alleged that, between about 1 November 2011 and 18 January 2012, the Offender committed an offence under s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003, in that he cleared native vegetation otherwise than in accordance with a development consent granted in accordance with that Act or a property vegetation plan. The charge related to the clearing of native vegetation on “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”.
	
	
	In due course, the Offender pleaded guilty to this charge and a hearing proceeded before Sheahan J in the Land and Environment Court on 4, 5, 6 and 7 March 2014, where the principal issue concerned disputes over the area of land unlawfully cleared and the degree of environmental harm caused. His Honour reserved judgment on sentence and that was the position as at the date of the offences.
	
	
	On 19 September 2014, his Honour convicted the Offender and imposed a fine of $140,000.00 together with an order for costs: Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet v Turnbull [2014] NSWLEC 150. Amongst the findings of Sheahan J, his Honour concluded that an area of 38.7 hectares had been unlawfully cleared, with a minimum of 3,000 trees being removed across the cleared areas of which many were environmentally significant. His Honour concluded that the level of environmental harm caused was substantial (T786-787).
	
	
	Other proceedings were brought before the Land and Environment Court with respect to activities on “Strathdoon” and/or “Colorado”. It is not necessary to recite these events in any detail. It should be noted, however, that the jury had before them parts of the reasons and orders of Preston CJ in Turnbull v Director-General, Office of Environment and Heritage [2014] NSWLEC 84; 212 LGERA 163 (25 June 2014) (Exhibit S) and Turnbull v Director-General, Office of Environment and Heritage (No. 2) [2014] NSWLEC 112 (31 July 2014) (Exhibits AE and AF). These judgments related to directions for remedial work to be undertaken on one or other of “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”.
	
	
	On 25 June 2014, a further prosecution was commenced against the Offender in the Land and Environment Court alleging that, between about 18 January 2012 and 4 September 2012, he committed an offence under s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003, in that he cleared native vegetation otherwise than in accordance with a development consent granted in accordance with that Act or a property vegetation plan. That offence was alleged to have been committed at or near “Strathdoon”.
	
	
	Mr Turner was 51 years of age at the time of his death. He had been employed as a Compliance Officer with the OEH for a number of years. The evidence at trial indicated that Mr Turner was diligent and tenacious in the discharge of his duties under the Native Vegetation Act 2003, including his duties with respect to the Offender and the Offender’s family, and the properties “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”. He utilised statutory powers in his dealings with the Offender and his family. There was some evidence indicating a measure of irritation on the part of Mr Turner at times in his dealings with the Offender and his family. This was understandable in circumstances where the process of clearing vegetation on the two properties was occurring regularly, and undoubtedly for the purpose of preparing both properties for broadacre farming, apparently with little regard for the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	The diligence and persistence of Mr Turner, and the OEH generally, resulted in strong adverse views being formed by the Offender towards him, the OEH and its officers. I am satisfied that the Offender became increasingly resentful over a period of time, at what he considered to be officious intervention in his conversion plans with respect to the two properties.
	
	
	Evidence was adduced at the trial, from members of the Turnbull family and their friends, of increasing pressure and stressors which appeared to be having an effect upon the Offender in the period leading up to 29 July 2014. It is not unusual for litigation to cause stress to those involved in it. The evidence indicates that the Offender had no prior involvement in court proceedings before the events in and after 2011.
	
	
	By 29 July 2014, the Offender was before one sentencing court awaiting decision for the offence to which he had pleaded guilty. A further prosecution had been brought against him which had yet to come on for hearing before the Land and Environment Court. When the Summons for the second prosecution was served upon the Offender in early July 2014, it was accompanied by an affidavit of Mr Turner, and other documents, which had been filed in the Court as part of the process of commencing the prosecution.
	
	
	Other proceedings were on foot in the Land and Environment Court relating to action taken by way of stop-work orders or remedial notices, which had issued from the OEH as a result of activities being undertaken on “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”. It is undoubtedly the case that significant stress and cost was resulting to the Offender as a result of these events.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender was and is a stoical type of person and an old-style farmer. I accept that, in the period before 29 July 2014, he spoke frequently to relatives and friends about action being taken by the OEH. I accept that he manifested a single-minded approach in this regard which focused upon Mr Turner, although he had not had physical or telephone contact with Mr Turner for more than two years before the murder.
	
	
	I will return later in these sentencing remarks to the psychiatric evidence for the purpose of expressing my conclusions about it.
	
	
	What is clear, on the evidence, is that the Offender had been working long hours for some nine days up to and including 29 July 2014. He would travel the 30-kilometre journey to and from “Yambin” each day, for the purpose of working on “Strathdoon” or “Colorado”, driving a bulldozer clearing land. Other employees would also either drive a second bulldozer for this purpose, or set fire to stacks of cleared vegetation which had resulted from the clearing process.
	
	
	As was the jury, I am in no position to determine whether the clearing being undertaken by the Offender, in the period up to the date of the murder, was consistently in breach of the Native Vegetation Act 2003. What is clear, however, is that two sets of prosecution proceedings were before the Land and Environment Court as at 29 July 2014. This was in addition to proceedings before the Chief Judge of that Court with respect to remedial notices, to which reference has already been made.
	
	
	As at 29 July 2014, it does not appear that there was any reasonable basis for the Offender to believe that the area he was clearing at that time lay outside a proposed remedial area. The evidence indicates a rushed approach to complete the clearing process on the properties, in aid of the end point where the properties could be utilised for broadacre farming. That was, at all relevant times, the plan so as to maximise the value and productivity of the properties.
	
	
	By 29 July 2014, Mr Turner had not been in contact with the Offender since 28 June 2012, a period of more than two years. Mr Turner had been at Court for part of the sentencing hearing before Sheahan J in March 2014, but it was not suggested that there was any contact between him and the Offender on that occasion. The further prosecution had been instituted in late June 2014 charging the Offender with another offence under s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003. Other litigation was before the Land and Environment Court with respect to remedial notices which had issued, and the Court was in the process of settling orders to be made for remedial areas to be set aside.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender was under considerable pressure as a result of this litigation, and the state of affairs which had resulted from actions taken by him since 2011 with respect to the properties. A strong resentment had built up in the Offender directed towards Mr Turner, whom he blamed for the attention that his actions on “Strathdoon” and “Colorado” were receiving.
	


The Events of 29 July 2014


	
	On 29 July 2014, Mr Turner and Mr Strange had travelled to the Moree district for the purpose of inspecting a number of properties which were unrelated to the Offender and his family. Mr Strange had worked with Mr Turner since January 2014. They were equipped with mobile telephones, an EPIRB emergency beacon, a Garmin GPS hand-held unit and a digital camera to aid with investigations.
	
	
	Whilst driving along County Boundary Road past “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”, the two men observed burning stacks following clearing of land. Understandably, they stopped to investigate. Photographs were taken together with GPS waypoints. Photographs were tendered in evidence showing burning stacks (Exhibit H).
	
	
	As it happens, clearing had occurred that day within areas which had been flagged to be set aside as remedial areas as a result of the Land and Environment Court proceedings before the Chief Judge of that Court. Although Mr Turner and Mr Strange would not have been aware of that precise aspect at that time, it serves to emphasise the proper and responsible basis upon which they stopped to inspect, from the public street, what was happening on these properties. I am satisfied that neither Mr Turner nor Mr Strange entered onto private property on that day, with all observations being made from County Boundary Road or Talga Lane and the public areas adjacent to those roads.
	
	
	By late afternoon, the Offender had completed his bulldozer work and drove his utility across County Boundary Road to “Buckie”. The Offender had put in a long day’s work clearing land on one or other of “Strathdoon” and “Colorado”. He told the jury that the clearing had, in fact, been finished that day and there was no more to be done (T923).
	
	
	The Offender was decanting oil on “Buckie” when he received a message from Ivan Maas, a farm worker employed by the Turnbull family. At that point, the Offender was planning to replace the engine oil in the bulldozer the next morning. Ivan Maas had observed the OEH vehicle, with Mr Turner and another man on County Boundary Road, as he drove past them. He informed the Offender by telephone that “Glen Turner was there on the County Boundary Road taking photos”.
	
	
	Having received this information, the Offender decided to drive to the place where Mr Turner had been seen. In evidence, the Offender explained that he had decided to make contact with Mr Turner as “he hadn’t notified that he was coming and he seemed to be continually there so that was the reason” (T888).
	
	
	The Offender drove his utility from “Buckie” out on to County Boundary Road. He noted that the OEH vehicle was not there. He drove up County Boundary Road and turned onto Talga Lane where he observed the OEH vehicle stationary down the road.
	
	
	I pause at this stage to note that there was no justification for the Offender to seek out Mr Turner on this occasion. What Mr Turner was doing, and what the Offender had been told he was doing, was making observations from a public street. Mr Turner did not have to give notice to the Offender, or anyone else, before he could undertake such an activity. As noted earlier, the attention of Mr Turner and Mr Strange was entirely understandable given the clearing and burning off that was happening and was visible from the street.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Offender decided to kill Mr Turner when he turned into Talga Lane and saw the vehicle up the road. Upon turning onto Talga Lane and observing the OEH vehicle parked ahead of him, the Offender pulled his vehicle over to the side some distance from the OEH vehicle. He took his loaded .22 pump-action rifle from under the seat of the utility and placed it in the back tray of the vehicle. The firearm was capable of holding 11 .22 long-rifle cartridges. It is apparent that it was loaded with multiple cartridges. The Offender then drove several hundred metres and stopped near the OEH vehicle.
	
	
	The Offender got out of his vehicle and approached, holding the rifle. Mr Turner and Mr Strange were standing near the fence line on public land facing the property “Colorado”.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the events at the roadside involving the three men occupied about 20 minutes, from the arrival of the Offender to his departure after murdering Mr Turner.
	
	
	Without anything being said, the Offender pointed his rifle at Mr Turner and fired, hitting him in the neck area. At the time of shooting Mr Turner the first time, the Offender intended to kill him. The medical evidence indicated that, if urgent attention had been provided to Mr Turner following this injury, it was possible that he may have survived this injury. However, as will become clear, the Offender prevented Mr Strange from obtaining assistance for Mr Turner.
	
	
	The Offender said in evidence that he was “extremely nervous” when he arrived at the scene and asked himself, “Will I or wont I?”, but that “once [he] fired the first shot, the calmness came over” him (T889).
	
	
	Having been shot the first time, Mr Turner said words to the effect, “Ian, what are you doing?”.
	
	
	Soon after, the Offender fired a second shot, hitting Mr Turner in the upper-left chest area. This gunshot wound caused extra-thoracic soft-tissue damage, but did not enter the thoracic cavity.
	
	
	Mr Strange (who had been a police officer in previous years) attempted to reason with the Offender saying, “Sir, put the gun down. What are you doing?”. The Offender told Mr Strange to throw his camera down and he did. Mr Strange again asked the Offender to put the gun down and the Offender replied with words to the effect, “No. You’ve ruined the Turnbulls. You are continually persecuting us. The only way you’re going home is in a body bag”. Mr Strange gave evidence that the Offender said, on two occasions, that Mr Turner would be “going home in a body bag”.
	
	
	Mr Strange continued in his efforts to communicate with the Offender, asking him to put the firearm down and saying that Mr Turner had been hurt and needed help, and that he (Glen) had a young family and that “we needed to get out of there”. The Offender replied to the effect, “No. You’ve ruined the Turnbulls. You know we’re in a drought. You are constantly persecuting us. You’re out here all the time. You’ve got planes flying over here”.
	
	
	Mr Strange continued to plead with the Offender to allow him to get help for Mr Turner. A couple of times, Mr Strange came closer to the Offender who told him to, “Fucking get back”.
	
	
	By this time, Mr Turner was crouched down at the side of the OEH vehicle. Mr Turner attempted to get into the passenger side of the vehicle and managed to open the door. Mr Turner managed to get to the rear of the vehicle and to deploy the EPIRB emergency beacon. At this point, the Offender fired further shots through the back canopy of the OEH vehicle. He explained in evidence that he thought Mr Turner might be trying to get a firearm or Taser from the vehicle, although he now knew that Mr Turner was reaching for the emergency beacon (T889). There was no weapon or Taser in the OEH vehicle.
	
	
	Mr Strange continued in his pleas to the Offender to allow him to leave with Mr Turner to obtain assistance. At one stage, Mr Strange said, “We’re unarmed, you know, we’re not here to hurt you”. The Offender replied with words to the effect, “You’ve ruined the Turnbulls. You’ve sent us bankrupt and you’ve been persecuting the family”.
	
	
	At one point, Mr Turner said that Mr Strange should leave, but he declined, telling Mr Turner, “I have to be fit to get us out”.
	
	
	At one stage, Mr Strange attempted to use his work phone to call “000”, but the call did not connect.
	
	
	As darkness fell, the lights of the motor vehicles lit up the area.
	
	
	At one point, when Mr Strange was moving towards the Offender, the Offender raised his rifle and pointed it at Mr Strange and said words to the effect, “I’ve told you to fucking get back or I’ll fucking shoot you”, but he did not shoot towards Mr Strange.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Turner, who was bleeding from his wounds, turned and made a run towards the fence line. He had moved about 10 metres when the Offender shot him in the back. Once again, the Offender intended to kill Mr Turner at this time. This shot caused grave injuries and significant blood loss, and was the fatal shot. Mr Turner fell to the ground.
	
	
	The Offender lowered the firearm and looked at Mr Strange and said, “You can go. I’m going home to wait for the police”. The Offender got into his vehicle, did a U-turn and did what Mr Strange described (and I accept) as a controlled drive off on an unsealed road.
	
	
	Mr Strange did his best (as he did throughout the ordeal) to assist Mr Turner, but the injuries which Mr Turner had suffered were fatal and he died before emergency services arrived at the scene.
	
	
	Mr Strange stopped a passing vehicle and obtained assistance which ultimately led to attendance of police officers and ambulance officers.
	
	
	The Offender drove home to “Yambin” some 30 kilometres away. There, he waited until the police arrived. On his way home, the Offender contacted an employee, Scott Kennett, and said, “I’ve just shot Turner. I think he’s dead. I’m going home to wait for the police”. When he got home, the Offender said he had shot Mr Turner - “I had no choice, he was ruining my family and it was never going to end”.
	
	
	Police attended “Yambin” that evening and took the Offender into custody, where he has remained ever since.
	


Factors Bearing Upon the Objective Gravity of the Offences


	
	Before moving to the question of whether the Offender was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the offences, it is appropriate to set out some objective aspects of the offences which were not in dispute on sentence.
	
	
	Firstly, Mr Turner and Mr Strange were public officials exercising public functions and the offences arose because of their occupation. This aspect leads to a standard non-parole period of 25 years for the murder offence, instead of the otherwise applicable period of 20 years. It also constitutes a significant aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining sentence for the s.86 offence committed against Mr Strange: s.21A(2)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Of course, s.21A(2)(a) should not be double counted for the murder offence given that it was the factor that gives rise to the standard non-parole period of 25 years. The law has always regarded the murder of a public person or public official, because of that person’s occupation, as being especially serious: R v Ngo (No. 3) [2001] NSWSC 1021; 125 A Crim R 495 at 501-502 [29]-[31]; Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142; 233 A Crim R 121 at 126-127 [23].
	
	
	Secondly, the Offender attacked and killed Mr Turner, and detained Mr Strange at gunpoint, for a significant period of time at a stage when he, the Offender, was awaiting sentence in the Land and Environment Court on a charge of illegal clearing of native vegetation. Although Mr Turner was not to play any further part as a witness in those proceedings, his name was mentioned in the Summons and he had sworn an affidavit which had been relied upon in those proceedings. Further, Mr Turner was to be a witness in the second prosecution which had been commenced on 25 June 2014, and was yet to come before the Land and Environment Court. To murder a public official in the context of pending criminal proceedings against the Offender renders this an especially serious offence.
	
	
	Thirdly, the attack upon Mr Turner involved repeated wounding of him over an extended period of time (about 20 minutes) which undoubtedly heightened his distress and terror which otherwise arose from the event. Mr Strange was subjected to a protracted and terrifying event as well, whilst he sought to persuade the Offender to desist and allow the two men to leave to seek urgent medical assistance for Mr Turner.
	
	
	Fourthly, the detention and attack upon the two men occurred in a remote location, some 60 kilometres from Moree, in a position where police or medical assistance could not be readily and urgently provided. Mr Turner and Mr Strange were vulnerable to criminal conduct of this type, where a person under official investigation armed himself and challenged them in the manner described earlier.
	
	
	Fifthly, it was the Offender who chose to come to the scene where the two men were performing their duties in a public place. The Offender moved directly to the use of force, shooting Mr Turner and detaining both men at gunpoint until the process of murder was completed.
	
	
	Sixthly, the s.86 offence involving Mr Strange was rendered more serious because of the significant length of time for which he was detained at gunpoint by the Offender, in circumstances where the Offender so acted to facilitate the homicide of Mr Turner. This was not a fleeting event. Mr Strange was threatened with being shot at a time when the Offender had demonstrated his willingness to shoot his colleague, Mr Turner. This, magnified the terror experienced by Mr Strange, as he observed the tragedy unfolding despite his best efforts to implore the Offender to stop, and to allow him to obtain assistance for Mr Turner.
	
	
	It is quite clear that the Offender blamed Mr Turner for the investigatory and legal action which had flowed from the process of clearing “Strathdoon” and “Colorado” since 2011. That the Offender had a strong dislike or hatred of Mr Turner is clear. A remaining question is the extent to which any mental disorder intruded upon the Offender’s thought processes, so as to assist him in the imposition of sentence.
	


The Mental Disorder Issue on Sentence


	
	The issue for the jury at trial was whether the Offender should be convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter, by reason of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. In this regard, Dr Olav Nielssen and Professor David Greenberg gave evidence in the defence case. Dr Adam Martin gave evidence in the Crown case in reply.
	
	
	It was contended for the Offender that, at the time of the offences, he was suffering from severe depression. Reliance was placed upon evidence of members of the Offender’s family, employees and friends, who had observed the Offender in the period leading up to the offences, taken with the assessments of Dr Nielssen (carried out in August 2014 and February 2016) and Professor Greenberg (in February 2016). The defence psychiatrists testified that the Offender was subject to such a mental condition at the time of the offence, and that that condition substantially impaired his capacity to understand events or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself.
	
	
	Dr Martin did not agree with the defence psychiatrists. In his view, the Offender was not suffering from severe depression at the time of the offences. He expressed the opinion that the Offender may have been suffering from a mental condition in the nature of an adjustment disorder, related to the various stressors which he was experiencing. However, Dr Martin rejected the view that the Offender was experiencing severe depression.
	
	
	Submissions were made on sentence as to the finding which the Court should make concerning the question of mental disorder, in light of the jury’s verdict. A finding of substantial impairment requires the defence to prove two things on the balance of probabilities. Firstly, that at the time when the Offender killed Mr Turner, the Offender’s capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind. Secondly, that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Offender that the jury had found, and that the Court should find on sentence, that the jury was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Offender was suffering from severe depression at the time of the offences, and that his capacity to understand events or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself, were substantially impaired as a result. It was submitted for the Offender that the jury was not satisfied, however, on the second limb of s.23A(1) Crimes Act 1900, namely that the Offender had not established to the civil standard that his impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. Upon the basis of this submission, it was contended that the Court should find on sentence that the Offender was suffering from severe depression at the time of the offences, and that this aspect would have a significant role to play on sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the jury was not satisfied on the first limb of substantial impairment, and that the Court should make the same finding on sentence. It was submitted that there was a very live issue at trial on both the first and second limbs. The Crown submitted that the Court should not be satisfied that the Offender suffered from severe depression at the time of the offences, although, as indicated by Dr Martin, the Court may find that the Offender was experiencing an adjustment disorder at that time.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence and submissions made on this aspect, I record my conclusion that the Offender failed on the first limb of substantial impairment at trial. In my view, he did not establish on the balance of probabilities that, at the time of the offences, his capacity to understand events or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself were substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition in the nature of severe depression. My reasons for reaching this conclusion are as follows.
	
	
	Firstly, there is no evidence that the Offender sought or was provided with medical treatment or assistance for any mental condition in the years prior to 29 July 2014, or, importantly, since his incarceration. I accept that members of his family, employees and friends noted aspects of his conduct, although no one suggested that he should seek medical attention. However, I do not consider that these features provide any real support for a conclusion that he was suffering severe depression at the time of the offences. A number of the features referred to may be explained by aspects of his life separate from the presence of any mental disorder. For example, the Offender had always been an early riser so that there is no solid evidence of sleep disturbance. Further, other physical health problems from which he suffered (including a leg nerve problem) may serve to explain a number of the matters touched upon in evidence.
	
	
	This is not to say that the Offender was not under significant stress and pressure in the weeks leading up to 29 July 2014. He was before the Land and Environment Court for more than one matter, and other litigation was impacting upon the family properties as well. Substantial legal costs had been paid by him in relation to the litigation. I am not persuaded, however, that the matters relied upon provide a solid foundation for a diagnosis of severe depression.
	
	
	Secondly, it is undisputed that the Offender worked long hours, and in very hard conditions, for some nine days up to and including 29 July 2014. He was driving to and from his home property and, during the working days, was operating bulldozers and otherwise carrying out a range of activities on the properties. I accept the opinion of Dr Martin that this pattern of work is not consistent with the existence of severe depression. I have considered the explanation provided by Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg that the Offender’s approach to work was a form of coping mechanism. However, I consider that the work pattern of the Offender, in the days leading up to the offences, operates against a finding of severe depression.
	
	
	Thirdly, once the Offender was in custody from 29 July 2014, he has not received any treatment by way of medication or otherwise for any mental condition. I note that Dr Nielssen examined the Offender on 8 August 2014 for the purpose of preparing a report for these proceedings. He did diagnose depression at that time. However, an experienced Justice Health psychiatrist, Dr Hearps, examined the Offender and did not diagnose depression. The Offender was seen, from time to time, by Justice Health personnel and there is no indication of any diagnosis of depression nor the giving of any treatment for such a condition, or any mental disorder.
	
	
	There was a suggestion in evidence that severe depression could resolve spontaneously following the release of the stressors which contributed to the existence of the condition. A difficulty with this explanation is that whatever stressors may have been operating on the Offender up to 29 July 2014, a different and very substantial set of stressors have operated upon him since, in that he has been in prison for the first time in his life facing a charge of murder. It is not uncommon to see depression manifesting itself in persons facing such a scenario. However, I am not persuaded that the evidence supports a conclusion that the Offender suffered from severe depression, which has since resolved without treatment. The fact that treatment was not needed supports the conclusion that the condition of severe depression did not exist in the first place.
	
	
	Fourthly, I have considered the evidence of Professor Greenberg that persons who suffer severe depression can mask the condition and then, to the surprise of all around them, commit suicide or, in rare cases, homicide. It was argued for the Offender that this is what happened here, that those around the Offender had not picked up the particular signs of depression and that he had, unexpectedly, committed homicide.
	
	
	In approaching this issue, it is necessary to take into account the events of the afternoon of 29 July 2014 and the actions of the Offender. I have already expressed difficulty in accepting that, given his heavy working cycle for many days, he was suffering from a form of severe depression. Further, an unexpected act of suicide may be one thing. However, what the Offender did on 29 July 2014 involved a protracted process where, for some 20 minutes, he held Mr Turner and Mr Strange at gunpoint, culminating in the murder of Mr Turner and the lengthy and terrifying detention of Mr Strange. This was not an act of homicide committed quickly.
	
	
	It is the case that the Offender said things during the course of the offence which suggest a strong view concerning the OEH and Mr Turner. It is quite clear that his thought processes concerning the OEH and Mr Turner were critical to explain his actions. However, I have difficulty in reconciling the drawn out and terrifying nature of the events with a person who is said to be suffering from severe depression.
	
	
	Fifthly, comments made by the Offender in recorded telephone calls, which took place on 3 and 15 September 2014 and 9 and 14 October 2014 (Exhibits AJ and AK), indicate strong ill-feeling on the part of the Offender towards Mr Turner, Dr Nadolny and the OEH expressed in terms that do not seem to echo the existence of severe depression. Senior counsel for the Offender argued that the depression may have still been in place at the time of these calls and this served to explain why the Offender expressed these views. I have difficulty with this submission.
	
	
	Not only is there a problem, at the threshold, as to whether severe depression existed as at 29 July 2014, but I consider the comments made by the Offender in these calls are inconsistent with the presence of such a condition. What they show, of course, is very strong and entrenched ill-feeling on the part of the Offender towards the OEH, Mr Turner and Dr Nadolny. This sheds some light upon the state of mind of the Offender, not only at the time of the calls, but at the time of the offences as well.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Offender made good the first limb on the partial defence of substantial impairment. In my view, the jury reached the same conclusion.
	
	
	Even if the first limb had been made out, however, I am satisfied that the Offender fell far short of satisfying the second limb of substantial impairment, which involved a value judgment by the jury (representing the community) concerning the question of whether, in the circumstances, the Offender’s culpability should be reflected by a verdict of manslaughter and not murder.
	
	
	The remaining question is the extent to which any mental condition played a part in the commission of the offences, for the purpose of sentence. The jury’s rejection of the partial defence of substantial impairment does not, of course, prevent the Offender from seeking to rely upon such mental condition as may be demonstrated on the evidence: R v Fraser [2005] NSWCCA 77 at [24]-[25]; Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229; 227 A Crim R 217 at 244 [136].
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Offender suffered, at the time of the offences, an adjustment disorder which arose from the combination of stressors which operated upon him. He had developed entrenched thought processes concerning the OEH and, in particular, Mr Turner. He was talking about these topics and the litigation constantly.
	
	
	The Offender’s reaction, when he heard that Mr Turner was in the area, was to drive immediately to the place that he was at and then to proceed, over a period of time, to murder him, whilst expressing strong views about the adverse consequences which the OEH action was having upon him and his family.
	
	
	I am satisfied that these aspects support the existence of some mental disorder at that time, in the form of an adjustment disorder. However, I am not satisfied that any substantial mental disorder was in place. As mentioned, I am fortified in this conclusion by the absence of the need for any medical or psychiatric treatment for the Offender, in the months and years since 29 July 2014.
	


Specific and General Deterrence


	
	The circumstances of these offences raise, as important factors on sentence, the principles of specific and general deterrence.
	
	
	General deterrence has particular operation because of the need to discourage persons from taking the law into their own hands to punish, let alone kill, public officials who are entrusted by our community to enforce the laws of the State.
	
	
	The fact that particular laws may not be popular serves to elevate the importance of general deterrence on sentence. Persons in the position of Mr Turner and Mr Strange were required to travel to relatively isolated areas to investigate and enforce the law amongst persons who, in this case, disliked and resented the attention.
	
	
	Further, persons in rural areas commonly possess firearms, as did the Offender. OEH officers were not armed, and it ought not be expected in this country, that they should be armed. However, the law must emphasise the importance of protecting public officials discharging these functions, even more so where the laws which they are required to apply are not popular in the community.
	
	
	Personal deterrence remains a factor on sentence for the Offender. The comments made by him, in the recorded telephone calls of September and October 2014, indicate ongoing hostility on his part towards the OEH and its officers. The fact that the Offender murdered Mr Turner and dealt with Mr Strange in the way that he did, did not lead to any subsidence of his strong feelings in this respect.
	
	
	It is the fact, of course, that the Offender is now 81 years of age. The practical circumstances in which he may be in a position to harm anyone else are limited. However, there is no evidence of any insight on his part.
	
	
	The roles of general deterrence and personal deterrence may be reduced, in a particular case, because of the existence of a mental disorder which affected the Offender at the time of the offences or at the time of the sentence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]. I accept that there is a limited form of mental disorder which affected the Offender as at 29 July 2014. The full weight of general deterrence and personal deterrence may be modified to some extent on sentence in his case. However, I have not accepted that he was suffering from severe depression at the time of the offences, so that these factors remain of particular significance on sentence.
	


Family Support


	
	The Offender has a strong and supportive family network, including his wife, children and grandchildren. He continues to be supported by them and this will be the case into the future.
	


Prior Good Character


	
	The Offender was 79 years of age at the time of the offences and is now 81 years of age. He has one criminal conviction, being the offence committed in 2011-2012 of unlawfully clearing native vegetation, for which he was fined $140,000.00 in September 2014. The circumstances of that offence are tied up with the commission of the present offences (see [29]-[31] above).
	
	
	Evidence was adduced at the trial as to the Offender’s prior good character and reputation in the Moree district. He has been a hard-working farmer for many years and has assisted the community in a number of respects. He has no prior history of violence.
	


The Offender’s Health


	
	I have made findings above concerning the Offender’s mental condition at the time of the offences (see [90]-[106] above). I accept that, at the time of the offences, he was suffering from a form of adjustment disorder, but not any severe mental disorder. There is no evidence that the Offender now suffers from any mental disorder.
	
	
	There was evidence that the Offender had suffered from depression in the mid-1960s at a time of severe drought, and had received treatment and was on medication for about two years. There has been no further treatment sought for any mental condition in the 50 years which have passed since then.
	
	
	The evidence indicates that the Offender was in reasonably robust health as at 29 July 2014, particularly given his age. He had been working solidly for a number of days and he had been working for many years in farming activities.
	
	
	The medical evidence does not indicate that the Offender was suffering, or is presently suffering, from any cognitive impairment.
	
	
	He had a pacemaker fitted some years ago and suffers from a condition which affects the nerves in his legs, but these aspects did not compromise his ability generally to drive and work on the properties.
	
	
	The Offender was taking various medications as at July 2014 of a type commonly used for persons in middle-to-older age.
	
	
	The Offender is presently housed in the Long Bay Hospital Wing where he has been for some time. The Court should proceed on the basis that the Offender’s health will deteriorate with age, but from a position where his present state of health is quite good for a man of his age.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the Offender’s present custodial conditions are especially difficult. However, it may be expected that the Offender’s ongoing custody will give rise to some difficulties because of his age.
	
	
	Although there was no evidence in these proceedings, the Court is aware that a facility is provided by the Department of Corrective Services for aged male inmates, the Kevin Waller Unit located at Long Bay. The custodial system in this State has the capacity to house and care for elderly prisoners.
	


The Offender’s Age


	
	In determining sentence, the Court should have regard to the Offender’s personal circumstances, including his age. It is the fact that the Offender committed these very serious crimes when he was 79 years of age.
	
	
	The Crown has not pressed an argument that the Court should sentence the Offender to imprisonment for life by way of s.61 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In adopting this approach, however, the Crown submitted that the circumstances of this case came close to satisfying the criteria for s.61, but that, given the age of the Offender, determinate sentences to be imposed may have the practical effect of seeing the Offender die in custody.
	
	
	The courts have made clear that age is not a licence to commit an offence: R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507. Whilst the age of the Offender needs to be taken into account, this cannot give rise to an expectation that the elderly can offend with relative impunity: R v McLean [2001] NSWCCA 58; 121 A Crim 484 at 492 [44]. The sentence imposed must remain one that is commensurate with the seriousness of the criminality involved, and is one that accords with the general moral sense of the community: R v McLean at 492 [45].
	
	
	There is no principle that, if the Court does not impose a life sentence under s.61 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that the Court should impose a sentence which provides some prospect of the Offender being released before his death. A fundamental sentencing principle is that a sentence must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. Adherence to that principle may, in the case of an offender of advanced years, have the practical effect of being a life sentence: Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164 at [22]-[27].
	
	
	It will be necessary to keep these principles in mind in taking into account the Offender’s age in passing sentence upon him.
	


The Offender’s Plea of Guilty to the s.86 Offence


	
	The Offender pleaded guilty, on 20 April 2016, to the s.86 offence of detaining Mr Strange for advantage. The Offender had been committed for trial on the murder and s.86 charges on 21 September 2015. On 4 December 2015, the Offender was arraigned in the Supreme Court upon the murder charge only, to which he pleaded not guilty. The Court was asked not to take a plea from him on the s.86 charge at that time. On 2 March 2016, the defence disclosure notice indicated an objection to the wording of the s.86 charge.
	
	
	After discussions with the Crown, an amended indictment was presented on 20 April 2016 containing a differently worded s.86 charge, to which the Offender pleaded guilty.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Offender that the Court should allow a discount of 20% for the Offender’s plea of guilty on the s.86 charge.
	
	
	The discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea, the greater the discount: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at 10-11 [32]. The Offender pleaded guilty to the s.86 charge on a date in April 2016 which was after the date initially fixed for the commencement of the trial. Because of pretrial issues which needed to be determined, the trial before a jury did not commence until later in April 2016.
	
	
	I do not consider that the amendment to the wording of the s.86 charge by the Crown bears materially upon the discount to be allowed for the Offender’s plea of guilty. As was accepted at the sentencing hearing, there was no evidence that the Offender had offered to plead guilty to a s.86 charge at an earlier time. In the circumstances of this case, the discount for the Offender’s plea of guilty on the s.86 charge should be 10%.
	


Remorse or Contrition


	
	It was argued for the Offender that he had demonstrated remorse for his offences. The Crown submitted that the Offender had not demonstrated remorse.
	
	
	Section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the Court may take into account remorse shown by an Offender, but only if the Offender has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and he has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).
	
	
	The Offender has not given evidence expressing remorse. He gave evidence at the trial, but not at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Offender that remorse is demonstrated, for the purpose of s.21A(3)(i), by reference to what Dr Nielssen and Dr Martin had recorded in their meetings with the Offender. Dr Nielssen gave evidence that the Offender, when asked whether he felt remorse for his actions, said “Well, I do, of course I’m remorseful for the man and his family. I have remorse. I do feel sorry for what happened and for the bloke who was with him I feel sorry. I could have shot him too but I didn’t know him. I think back maybe I should have shot myself but I just wanted to see Rob [his wife] one more time”. The Offender told Dr Martin, “I can’t undo what I’ve done” and “I’m sorry about it now”.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Offender pointed out that, in his own evidence before the jury, the Offender had said that he had been honest in what he told Dr Nielssen and that this was not challenged by the Crown at the trial.
	
	
	Reliance was placed, as well, upon the Offender’s plea of guilty to manslaughter (which was rejected by the Crown) and to the s.86 offence involving Mr Strange, and the fact that he did not contest at trial that he had shot Mr Turner with the intention of killing him.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the Offender has demonstrated remorse in accordance with s.21A(3)(i). Reliance upon statements made to psychiatrists does not, in my view, provide any real assistance to the Offender. Nor is the Offender’s argument assisted by the proposition that the Offender could have been cross-examined, in some way, at trial as to what he had said to Dr Nielssen with respect to remorse.
	
	
	It has been said that the assessment of the genuineness of remorse is likely to be better informed in circumstances where it is expressed directly, as remorse is an intrinsically subjective matter, the evaluation of which depends upon human interaction: Mun v R [2015] NSWCCA 234 at [39]. That has not happened in this case.
	
	
	Further, the courts have emphasises that considerable caution must be exercised in determining what weight, if any, can be placed upon self-serving and untested statements by an offender contained in a report or evidence of a health professional: Mun v R at [40].
	
	
	Reliance upon the Offender’s pleas of guilty, and the manner in which the trial was conducted, provides little assistance to the Offender. The Crown case involved not only the direct eye-witness evidence of Mr Strange, but admissions made by the Offender to Scott Kennett and members of his family that he had killed Mr Turner. The Crown case against the Offender was very strong.
	
	
	A number of the comments made by the Offender in telephone conversations which took place in September and October 2014, are quite inconsistent with remorse on his part. He made strong comments about the OEH, Mr Turner and Dr Nadolny in a manner which indicated an ongoing attitude of hostility. There is no reliable basis to conclude that the Offender no longer holds these views.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the Offender has demonstrated genuine remorse in this case.
	


Section 22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999


	
	It was submitted for the Offender that he had facilitated the administration of justice, by conducting his defence in a manner so as to attract s.22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was submitted that the proceedings had been conducted by the Offender in such a manner that his trial had been concluded less than six months after arraignment in the Supreme Court, despite some complexity in the matter arising from the Crown’s change of venue application, contested subpoenas and pretrial rulings that were appealed.
	
	
	It was submitted that the Offender had consented to being examined by the Crown psychiatrist on two occasions (for the purpose of substantial impairment), and that defence disclosure obligations for the purpose of s.143 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 had been complied with in a fulsome and timely manner.
	
	
	I do not consider that the Offender is assisted by his willingness to be examined twice by the Crown psychiatrist on the issue of substantial impairment. It is the practical experience of the Court that, where substantial impairment is to be relied upon, the accused person will be made available to the Crown psychiatrist for examination on one or more occasions if required.
	
	
	It is the case that this trial was brought on and completed in this Court within six months of the arraignment of the Offender in December 2015. The Court took the view that an early trial was appropriate given the circumstances of the case and the age of the Offender. However, the start of the trial was delayed as a number of pretrial issues required determination, with most of those rulings being adverse to the Offender.
	
	
	The events surrounding the commission of the offences did not come under real challenge at the trial. I keep in mind that Mr Strange was a direct witness to the events of 29 July 2014, and that challenge to his account would likely have been difficult, in particular given admissions made by the Offender to Scott Kennett and to his family as to what he had done.
	
	
	Some time was taken up at trial in cross-examination of Crown witnesses on issues relating to OEH action under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. This material had limited relevance to what was the real issue in the trial, substantial impairment. To the extent that much of this material related to the wish of the defence to rely upon the partial defence of extreme provocation, I note that I twice ruled against the Offender on this issue: R v Turnbull (No. 5) [2016] NSWSC 439; R v Turnbull (No. 25) [2016] NSWSC 831.
	
	
	Of course, the Offender is not to be more severely punished for the manner in which the proceedings were conducted: Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656 at 663-664. However, it is for the Offender to demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that he has brought himself within the terms of s.22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, so that the Court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose because of the Offender facilitating the administration of justice. Having considered the matters raised on behalf of the Offender, I am not persuaded that s.22A has been engaged in the circumstances of this case.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	The Court received victim impact statements from family victims of Mr Turner, Alison McKenzie (his wife) and Fran Pearce (his sister). Each of these statements was read to the Court by the author. In addition, the Court received written material which shed light upon the impact of Mr Turner’s death upon his young children, Alexandra and Jack.
	
	
	Mr Strange made a victim impact statement which he read to the Court.
	
	
	The Crown made application, for the purpose of s.28(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that the victim impact statements given by the family victims be considered and taken into account by the Court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence of murder, on the basis that the harmful impact of Mr Turner’s death on the members of his immediate family was an aspect of harm done to the community.
	
	
	The victim impact statements of Mr Turner’s wife and sister, and of his children, demonstrate the enormous loss and terrible impact resulting from the death of a loving husband, father and brother. The victim impact statements also revealed the great distress caused to Mr Turner’s parents as a result of his untimely death.
	
	
	Section 3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 states that one of the purposes of sentencing is to impose a sentence which recognises the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
	
	
	In delivering the second reading speech for the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Family Member Victim Impact Statement) Act 2014, the Attorney General made clear that the legislation was intended to overcome the principle in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 to the extent of permitting a sentencing court to take into account on sentence, for the purpose of s.3A(g), the harmful impact of the death on members of the immediate family as an aspect of harm done to the community, where the Court considers it appropriate to do so (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 7 May 2014).
	
	
	I am satisfied that it is appropriate to take into account the impact of Mr Turner’s death upon his immediate family, as an aspect of harm done to the community. In the case of Mr Turner, he was a loving and caring husband, father, brother and son. He had much to offer the community, not only in his family role, but in his service as a public official exercising duties in an important public capacity. I have kept these factors in mind in considering sentence in this case.
	
	
	As I did at the sentencing hearing, it is appropriate that the Court, on behalf of the community, expresses publicly its condolences to each member of Mr Turner’s family for the loss which they have suffered, and will continue to suffer, arising from these terrible events.
	
	
	The victim impact statement of Mr Strange confirms the terrifying and shattering nature of the ordeal to which he was subjected at the hands of the Offender on 29 July 2014. He remains affected by these events. Mr Strange did everything which he could to try and save Mr Turner and to bring the incident to an end. In the circumstances of this case, the impact of these events upon him is what is to be expected when a very serious s.86 offence such as this is committed.
	


Determining Appropriate Sentences for the Offences


	
	I have recited in these remarks, a range of factors bearing upon the objective gravity of the offences, the subjective circumstances of the Offender and other sentencing principles, including personal and general deterrence. It is necessary for the Court to complete the process of instinctive synthesis involved in sentencing, by forming a value judgment in determining an appropriate sentence: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 131-132 [26]. As there are two offences, issues of concurrency, accumulation and totality also need to be considered.
	
	
	The offence of murder in this case was especially serious. The standard non-parole period of 25 years operates as a legislative guidepost on sentence: Muldrock v The Queen at 132 [27]. Mr Turner was murdered whilst carrying out his duties as a public official. There is no doubt that the Offender intended to kill him. I am satisfied that the Offender’s motive involved a desire for retaliation or revenge because of the Offender’s belief that Mr Turner had been interfering with his efforts to clear and develop the two properties, for the purpose of broadacre farming. At the time of the murder, the Offender was already before the Land and Environment Court by way of two prosecutions, as to one of which he had pleaded guilty.
	
	
	The events on Talga Lane on 29 July 2014 involved the Offender prolonging the process of murdering Mr Turner, thereby heightening the terror to which Mr Turner was subjected, before the final and fatal shot was fired. I accept that the Offender had developed a mental condition which was present as at that day. However, I am not persuaded that the condition involved severe depression. I accept that the Offender was suffering from a form of adjustment disorder, resulting from the stress upon him arising from investigatory action and court proceedings relating to his activities on the two properties. I do not consider that the moral culpability of the Offender is much reduced, nor that the need to denounce his crime is lessened significantly: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa at 43 [177].
	
	
	It must be kept in mind that it was the Offender’s desire to clear these properties, for the purpose of increasing their value and productivity, which had attracted official OEH attention. By the time he had murdered Mr Turner, the Offender (on his own account) had completed that clearing process. The objective seriousness of this murder offence was very high.
	
	
	In light of the findings which I have just recorded, there is a strong need for general deterrence and, to a lesser degree, personal deterrence to be reflected on sentence.
	
	
	I have taken into account the Offender’s subjective circumstances, including his age, health and prior good character with respect to offences of violence. With respect to the Offender’s age, I keep in mind the sentencing principles to which I have made mention (at [128]-[129] above).
	
	
	It was submitted for the Offender that a finding of special circumstances should be made so as to reduce the non-parole period component of the sentence. Particular reference was made to the Offender’s age and health. Reference was made to published actuarial data which indicated that the Offender has a further life expectancy of about eight years.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Offender that, to preserve a prospect of release (however remote) and to avoid imposing a sentence that would not provide any incentive for ongoing rehabilitation, the Court ought to make a generous finding of special circumstances for the purpose of s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, leading to the imposition of a much shorter non-parole period.
	
	
	In approaching sentence of an aged offender for very serious offences such as these, it is necessary to keep in mind the principles which require a sentence to reflect the objective seriousness for the murder. In sentencing the Offender for this offence, compliance with this principle may unavoidably extend to all of the Offender’s life expectancy, so as to involve a de facto life sentence. I am satisfied that the circumstances of this case require such an approach. To accept the submission made on behalf of the Offender would involve error in this case. It may also operate to give substance to the Offender’s comment, made twice in 2012, to the effect, “I’m an old man. What are they going to do to me?” (see [22]-[27] above).
	
	
	Having regard to the objective and subjective factors, and keeping in mind relevant sentencing principles, the head sentence for the crime of murder should be a sentence of 32 years’ imprisonment. Without a finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period for this sentence would comprise 24 years’ imprisonment. I accept that there are special circumstances because of the Offender’s age and health. I do not accept that a very substantial reduction in the non-parole period should be made by way of a finding of special circumstances, so as to leave open the (perhaps theoretical) possibility that the Offender may be released on parole before he dies. Such an approach would be inconsistent with sentencing principles given the need for the non-parole period to reflect the minimum term which is appropriate to reflect the criminality involved, and having regard to all the principles of sentencing: R v Simpson  [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 718 [63]-[65].
	
	
	With respect to the crime of murder, the appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for 32 years with a non-parole period of 22 years.
	
	
	Mr Strange was detained at gunpoint for an extended period, during which time he was himself threatened and he observed his colleague being slowly shot dead. Mr Strange was performing his duties as a public official at the time. This was a very serious example of an offence under s.86(1) Crimes Act 1900, as to which a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment applies. I keep in mind the finding which I have made with respect to the Offender’s mental condition at the time of the offence. This finding, however, is of limited assistance to the Offender.
	
	
	There is a strong need for general deterrence to be reflected in this sentence, given the need to protect public officials from threats and acts of violence at the hands of armed citizens who happen to dislike the laws which public officials are required to apply.
	
	
	I keep in mind, as well, the Offender’s subjective circumstances, including his age, health and prior good character with respect to offences of violence.
	
	
	After applying a 10% discount for the Offender’s plea of guilty for this offence, I would impose a sentence of imprisonment of nine years for this offence.
	
	
	With respect to issues of accumulation and concurrency, I have kept in mind that the two offences occurred effectively at the same time, whilst the two unfortunate victims were trapped by the acts of the Offender on Talga Lane. It may be said that the offences arise out of the same course of conduct. At the same time, it is important to recognise that Mr Strange was separately and seriously victimised by the acts of the Offender.
	
	
	Where there are several victims of crimes of violence, it is important for the sentences actually imposed to recognise the fact that several individuals have been victimised by the offending conduct. This aspect should be kept in mind when considering issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality for offences against two victims arising out of the same course of conduct: Vaovasa v R [2007] NSWCCA 253; 174 A Crim R 116 at 121 [19]; Jeffries v R [2008] NSWCCA 144; 185 A Crim R 500 at 513 [96]. I am satisfied that a measure of accumulation is required in this case, which would have the effect of extending the non-parole period by two years and the head sentence by three years.
	
	
	I am satisfied that an aggregate sentence of imprisonment should be fixed in this case for the purpose of s.53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The aggregate sentence will comprise a head sentence of 35 years and a non-parole period of 24 years. A finding of “special circumstances” is made to warrant a limited variation of the usual ratio of non-parole period to head sentence.
	
	
	I have taken into account that this sentence will almost certainly constitute a de facto life sentence, with the Offender dying in custody before the expiration of the non-parole period. I am satisfied that no lesser sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	In compliance with s.54B(4) of that Act, I have indicated the head sentence and non-parole period that the Court would have set for the offence of murder, had a separate sentence of imprisonment been imposed for that offence.
	
	
	I have indicated, as well, the head sentence which would have been imposed for the s.86 offence had a separate sentence been imposed for that offence: s.53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The Offender has been in custody since 29 July 2014 and the sentence should date from then.

2769757,Siafakas v R [2016] NSWCCA 100,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: Mr Vasilios Siafakas, also known as William, was convicted following a trial lasting some 24 days before a judge of the District Court, sitting without a jury, of two counts of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the Act) and one count of possessing a precursor intended for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug contrary to s 24A(1) of the Act. The primary judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing on 3 January 2012. The indicative individual sentences for the purposes of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were:
	


“Count 1: Imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years

Count 3: Imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 5 months

Count 5: Fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years”.


	
	It will be seen that although an aggregate sentence was imposed, the indicative sentences relating to counts 3 and 5 were wholly subsumed within the indicative sentence for count 1, with the latter corresponding with the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	The appeal is confined to Mr Siafakas’ convictions on counts 1 and 3 pursuant to s 24(2) of the Act. There is no challenge to the conviction on count 5 pursuant to s 24A(1) of possession of a precursor. Nor is any separate appeal sought to be brought from the sentence.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are as follows:
	


“1. The verdict in relation to count 1 is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

2. With respect to count 1, the learned trial judge erred in law in finding that proof that the applicant was aware that what he was engaged in was criminal was sufficient to satisfy the mental element relating to the physical element that the substance was a prohibited drug.

3. The learned trial judge erred in law in failing to provide adequate reasons for his finding that the applicant was aware that the substance, the subject of count 1, was 3,4-Methylenedioxy-phenyl-2-propanone or ‘MDP2P’.

4. The verdict in relation to count 3 is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.”


	
	Grounds 1 and 4 invoke the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (“unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”) while grounds 2 and 3 invoke the second limb (“wrong decision of any question of law”). The appeal is as of right in relation to grounds 2 and 3, and with leave in relation to grounds 1 and 4: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(a) and (b). Even so, it will be convenient to refer to Mr Siafakas as the appellant.
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I have concluded that grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal have been made out, but that grounds 1 and 4 should be dismissed. My judgment takes the following form. First, I deal with the basic facts and legislative provisions. Secondly, I give an overview of the appellant’s case at trial, which, although incomplete, is sufficient to address grounds 2 and 3. Thirdly, I turn to each of grounds 1 and 4, which will require returning to the evidence in more detail. Fourthly, I deal with the orders which in my view should be made.
	


The precursors and prohibited drugs found in the appellant’s factory


	
	The appellant (by a company controlled by him) entered into a lease of factory premises in Padstow in south western Sydney in July 2007. In August 2007 police installed three fixed camera surveillance devices in the factory. An important contributor to the length of the trial was the extensive video surveillance evidence tendered in the Crown case (no audio surveillance was tendered). There was no dispute that substantial quantities of precursors and prohibited drugs were manufactured in the Padstow premises in the second half of 2007. On 9 December 2007, in the execution of a warrant, police seized, inter alia:
	



	
	268,958 grams of Isosafrole;
	
	
	1,645 grams of 3,4-Methylenedioxy-phenyl-2-propanone (also known as MDP2P); and
	
	
	3,694 grams of 3,4-Methylenedioxy-amphetamine (also known as MDA).
	



	
	At the time those substances were seized, the appellant was the only person present in the premises. The video surveillance demonstrated that he had been in the premises for some hours on each of the ten preceding days, including staying overnight from 17:53 on the afternoon of 3 December until 7:18 on 4 December, as well as from 8:46 until 17:39 on 4 December.
	
	
	Each of the three counts on which the appellant was convicted related to one of the three different substances seized at the premises.
	
	
	Isosafrole is a precursor for the prohibited drug MDP2P. It was the Isosafrole which was the subject of count 5, the charge of possession of a precursor with intent to manufacture a prohibited drug, which was not challenged in this appeal.
	
	
	Section 24(2) makes it an offence to manufacture or produce, or knowingly take part in the manufacture or production of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity of that drug.
	
	
	Count 1 was that the appellant had knowingly taken part in the manufacture of the prohibited drug MDP2P in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug.
	
	
	Count 3 was that the appellant had knowingly taken part in the manufacture of the prohibited drug MDA in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug.
	
	
	The commercial quantities of MDP2P and MDA are, in each case, 125 grams. The large commercial quantities of MDP2P and MDA are, in each case, 500 grams. The offence created by s 24(2) refers only to taking part in the manufacturing of a commercial quantity. Section 33(2)(a) provides that the maximum penalty for the offence created by s 24(2) is a fine of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years. However, in the event that the court is satisfied that the offence involved not less than a large commercial quantity, then s 33(3)(a) provides that the maximum penalty is a fine of 5,000 penalty units or imprisonment for life.
	
	
	The amounts of MDP2P and MDA seized at the Padstow premises were considerably more than the large commercial quantities of those substances specified in the Act.
	
	
	As well as being a prohibited drug, MDP2P is also a precursor. That is to say, MDP2P is listed in Schedule 1 of the Act and also in Schedules 1 and 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2011 (NSW), which is where the definitions of “precursor” in subss 24A(3) and 24B(3)(b) direct attention. The fact that MDP2P is both a precursor and a prohibited drug underlies each of grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the appeal. That is not, of itself, unusual; pseudoephedrine is likewise a precursor for the purposes of s 24A as well as being a prohibited drug.
	
	
	What was unusual, so it was said, is that there was evidence to suggest, and the trial and the appeal proceeded on the basis that, MDP2P was not itself readily consumable for any narcotic effect. Rather, MDP2P is typically used to make a prohibited drug (normally, either MDA or the chemical which is abbreviated as MDMA, both of which are sold under the name “ecstasy”).
	


Overview of appellant’s case at trial


	
	The appellant gave evidence that he was knowingly involved in the manufacture of a precursor. He said that he had been introduced, through a financier, to Mr John Robert Bemand, who was also a good friend of the godfather of his eldest child. He said that Mr Bemand had approached him and expressed concern regarding money he owed to friends of Mr Charles Cassar. His evidence in chief was as follows:
	


“Q. Can you detail the conversation in a sort of he said, you said type scenario, the best as you can?

A. Yes. John Bemand said, ‘Look, William, we’re in a bit of a bother at the moment. We’re in debt to some people and I need your factory to manufacture some ketone.’ I’d never head of what ketone was before. I asked him, ‘What is ketone?’ He said to me, ‘William, it’s a chemical,’ and I said, ‘Fine.’ I said, ‘Is it illegal?’ He said to me, ‘Unfortunately, yes, it is, William.’ I said –

DJEMAL: He said, ‘Unfortunately, yes, it is illegal,’ is what Bemand said to him.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I heard that. I was listening for that, yes.

WITNESS: He said, ‘Look’ – I became a little apprehensive. He said, ‘Look, it’s only a precursor chemical,’ and I said, ‘Look, how long will it take you to do this? What does it involve?’ and he said, ‘Look, William, it’ll only take us three weeks to do it,’ and I said, ‘Well, look, if you say it only takes three weeks, I’ll allow you to use a factory for that purpose and if it gets you out of trouble, because I can see that you’re really concerned about it, I will help you,’ and I allowed him to use the premises for that purpose.”


	
	The appellant accepted that he was to receive $50,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the precursors manufactured in his premises. He said that he did not in fact receive any money.
	
	
	MDP2P falls within the class of organic chemicals known as ketones. The simplest ketone is acetone, which is readily available at hardware stores. It was uncontroversial that some, but obviously not all, ketones were precursors. However, the testimonial evidence at trial, as well as some transcripts from telephone intercepts, had participants referring to the precursor being manufactured as “ketone”.
	
	
	MDP2P is structurally similar to, and may be converted to, MDA in a variety of ways. One way of doing so involves a process known as a Leuckart reaction. Mr Bemand, who gave evidence in the Crown case, described the reaction as follows:
	


“It’s a reaction using … ammonium formate, a mixture of ammonia and formic acid. The two are mixed together and then they’re slowly heated up to a maximum temperature of about 160 degrees, over a period, as I said 24 to 36 hours”.


	
	Mr Bemand said that the ammonium formate came from a cylinder and that “William bubbled that ammonia into the formic acid for me”. Mr Bemand gave a deal of other evidence, to which it will be necessary to turn when addressing ground 4, to the effect that the appellant was personally involved in the decision to convert MDP2P to MDA and the process which was followed implementing that decision.
	
	
	The appellant denied he had the level of involvement stated by Mr Bemand. He accepted that he knew that a precursor could be used to make a prohibited drug, but maintained that he was only involved in the manufacture of a precursor. In support of this, Mr Bemand’s statement dated 28 April 2010 (and therefore made much closer to the events in question) said that:
	


“At no stage did [the appellant] know we were manufacturing ecstasy as I knew he was against it ... [The appellant] only agreed to the manufacture of Ketone and other precursors”.

Ground 2 – the mental element of count 1


	
	The Crown submitted at trial that the mental element of the offence created by s 24(2) was satisfied by knowledge that a precursor was being manufactured. As it was put at trial:
	


“The Accused was at all times [aware] that he was taking part in the process that would lead to the manufacture of a prohibited drug, either MDA, MDMA or Methylamphetamine. The Accused was merely mistaken in his belief that MDP2P was only a precursor.”  


	
	That submission was accepted by the primary judge. The critical aspect of his Honour’s reasons was as follows:
	


“In my view someone who knowingly takes part in the manufacture of the precursor ketone substance MDP2P, believing it to be a ketone precursor chemical and believing the manufacture to be illegal and prohibited by law, where the substance manufactured was in fact a scheduled prohibited drug, the mental element is satisfied even if the substance has none of the typical characteristics of a drug. The mental element could not include a belief that the substance was in fact some type of drug when the scheduled substance had none of the characteristics of a typical drug. The schedule includes substances that are drugs typically and substances that are not drugs as such.

It is sufficient in my view that the accused has knowledge or belief in the wrongfulness of the act that he is knowingly taking part in, that is the illegal and prohibited manufacture of the substance which in fact is a scheduled prohibited drug. He needs to know all the facts constituting the ingredients necessary to make the act criminal.”


	
	On appeal, the Crown propounded an even broader submission, which was that it was sufficient that a person know that what he or she was doing was unlawful. To use the example raised in argument, if a person believed he or she was taking part in the unlawful manufacture of distilled spirits, but in fact was taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, then that would, according to the Crown, suffice to satisfy the mental element of s 24(2).
	
	
	In contrast, the appellant submitted that, given that the precursor MDP2P was itself a prohibited drug, there were two, and only two, possible ways for the Crown to prove the mental element of the offence created by s 24(2):
	



	
	by proving that the person knew he or she was manufacturing a prohibited drug (although without necessarily knowing precisely which prohibited drug was being manufactured); or
	
	
	by proving that the person knew he or she was manufacturing MDP2P specifically, where a belief that MDP2P was only a precursor and not a prohibited drug would not stand in the way of satisfaction of this element of the offence.
	



	
	For the reasons which follow, I would accept the appellant’s submissions.
	
	
	The starting point is statute. As Gleeson CJ said in this context in Tabe v The Queen [2005] HCA 59; 225 CLR 418 at [24], the issue is ultimately one of legislative intention as to what are the elements of an offence created by statute.
	
	
	It is plain from the words in s 24(2), “knowingly takes part in the manufacture or production of … a prohibited drug”, that there is a mental element in the offence. As much was common ground. The Crown would fail if it could not displace a reasonable doubt that an accused believed that he or she was taking part in the production of, say, paracetamol.
	
	
	But is it sufficient, as the Crown submitted on appeal, that the Crown establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed he or she was taking part in the production of some substance which was unlawful? Alternatively, is it sufficient, as the Crown submitted at trial, that the Crown establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed he or she was taking part in the production of a precursor which in turn would lead to the manufacture of a prohibited drug? Or is it necessary, as the appellant submitted, for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed that he or she was taking part in the production of either a prohibited drug or MDP2P specifically?
	
	
	A natural reading of the statutory language suggests that the Crown would have to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed that he or she was taking part in the manufacture of something which is within the class of chemicals defined as prohibited drugs. A natural reading does not confine the word “knowingly” to taking part in some process of manufacture generally, but to taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	I do not think it is necessary in order to resolve this appeal to review in any detail the principles authoritatively stated by the High Court in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 and subsequent cases in relation to the approach to the mental element of offences created by statute. Instead, it is convenient to proceed directly to the analysis by Sheller JA (with whom Smart and Allen JJ agreed) in R v CWW (1993) 32 NSWLR 348; 70 A Crim R 517 at 355, on which the appellant relied. That decision answered a question submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to (former) s 5A of the Criminal Appeal Act, following the acquittal of CWW, concerning the mental element of the offence created by s 23(2) of the Act, which relevantly provided:
	


“A person who ... cultivates, or knowingly takes part in the cultivation of, a number of prohibited plants which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to prohibited plants ... is guilty of an offence.”


	
	After consideration of the judgments in He Kaw Teh v The Queen and Bahri Kural v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 502, Sheller JA said in CWW:
	


“In my opinion, s 23(2) is structured so that the number of prohibited plants cultivated is a circumstance which attends the physical act of cultivation or supply to create the offences under the subsection. The offences are not established unless it is shown that the number of plants cultivated was not less than the commercial quantity. This gives character to the physical act involved to create the offence under the subsection. To adapt the language of Brennan J there is a presumption that the intention that must be proved is an intention of doing an act of the defined kind which constitutes the offence namely, in this case, cultivating a number of plants not less than the commercial quantity. Consistent with He Kaw Teh and Bahri Kural in my opinion the question asked must be answered in the affirmative.”


	
	That passage was cited and applied by Nettle JA, with which Buchanan JA agreed, in R v Van Xuan Bui [2005] VSCA 300 at [62]. It is entirely orthodox, and, although seeking to distinguish it, the Crown did not submit to the contrary.
	
	
	In CWW the mental element posed by s 23(2) was an intention of cultivating a sufficiently large number of plants. The Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had an intention of cultivating not less than the commercial quantity (250) of plants in order to secure a conviction.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, with a view to distinguishing CWW, that its reasoning applied only to an intention as to the quantity of the prohibited substance (which in the present case was not in issue) and did not extend to its quality.
	
	
	However, in my view the reasoning in CWW on the elements of the offence created by s 23(2) readily applies to that created by s 24(2). Just as the mental element of s 23(2) was an intention to cultivate not less than the commercial quantity of prohibited plants (as opposed to an intention to cultivate some quantity of prohibited plants, which happened as it turned out to exceed the commercial quantity), the mental element in s 24(2) was an intention of manufacturing a substance which was a prohibited drug (as opposed to an intention to manufacture some substance, which happened as it turned out to be a prohibited drug). That is to say, I see no reason to depart from the presumption to which Sheller JA referred in CWW that the intention which must be proved is an intention of doing an act of the defined kind which constitutes the offence.
	
	
	The degree of specificity in the mental element of the offence suggested by CWW is confirmed by authority. This Court’s decision in Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 is highly persuasive on this issue, because of the similarity of the statutory language and the fact that in that appeal, as in the present, the substance was both a precursor and a prohibited drug and so there was necessarily a degree of precision in the formulation of principle.
	
	
	Yousef Jidah included an appeal against conviction on two counts, one of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Act, and one count of attempting to possess a precursor intended for use in the manufacture or production of a prohibited drug, contrary to s 24A(1) of the Act. In respect of each count, the prohibited drug and the precursor was the same chemical (pseudoephedrine). The appeal against conviction required the Court to consider closely the interrelationship between the two offences and the elements of each.
	
	
	The joint judgment of Bathurst CJ, Fullerton and Davies JJ stated at [34]-[36]:
	


“The elements of the offence under s 25(2) of the DMT Act, applicable to this case, were that the appellant attempted to obtain possession of what he believed to be a prohibited drug, for the purposes of supply in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. To establish the count, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the appellant attempted to take possession of the drug for the purposes of supply, knowing or believing that the substance in the 45 boxes was a prohibited drug of not less than a large commercial quantity.

By contrast, the elements of the offence under s 24A of the DMT Act, as applicable to this case, were that the appellant attempted to possess a precursor, intending it to be used by another person in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. As we have observed, it was not contended by the Crown that the appellant intended to use the precursor for the manufacture of such a drug. The identity of that person (or those people) and where and when and how they were to be given access to the precursor was left open by the Crown.

Thus, to establish the offence under s 24A of the DMT Act, the prosecution was required to prove that the appellant attempted to possess a substance he knew or believed to be a precursor with the intention of it being used by another person to manufacture a prohibited drug”. (emphasis added)


	
	Of course, their Honours were dealing with different offences from those with which the appellant was charged. But the structure of s 25(2) and s 24(2) are very similar. Compare:
	


“24(2) A person who manufactures or produces, or who knowingly takes part in the manufacture or production of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence”

with:

“25(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.”


	
	Given the relevantly identical language, I think it is clear that the offence created by s 24(2) must have the same mental element in relation to the quality of the substance as that created by s 25(2).
	
	
	There is a further reason for concluding that the mental element of the offence created by s 24(2) requires a knowledge or belief concerning a prohibited drug, and that a knowledge or belief concerning a precursor is insufficient. This Part of the Act creates different offences, with different penalties, distinguishing between chemicals which are precursors and chemicals which are prohibited drugs. That is seen most clearly by comparing ss 24B and 25. Section 24B creates an offence of the possession of more than a prescribed quantity of precursor, with a maximum penalty of 1000 penalty units or 5 years imprisonment. That is a different offence from the offence of (deemed) supply of not less than the traffickable quantity of a prohibited drug created by s 25 (read with the deeming provision in s 29), which carries a maximum penalty of 2000 penalty units or 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Test the matter this way. Suppose an accused possessed 100g of MDP2P, but without knowing what precisely the substance was. The traffickable quantity of MDP2P, considered as a prohibited drug, is 0.75g. The prescribed quantity of MDP2P, considered as a precursor, is 50g. There is every reason to conclude that if it were shown that the accused believed only that the substance in his or her possession was a precursor, he or she would be guilty of an offence under s 24B, and that in order for the accused to be guilty of an offence under the more serious offence created by s 25, it would need to be shown that he or she believed that the substance in his or her possession was a prohibited drug.
	
	
	If the approach adopted by the primary judge was correct, then it would suffice for the Crown to establish either offence, in the example given above, that the accused believed that the substance in his or her possession was a precursor. I regard that as so improbable a result that I would strain against a construction of the statute that would give rise to it.
	
	
	True it is, as Schmidt J has observed, there is no offence of manufacturing a precursor. If there were such an offence, as well as an offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug, then it would be tolerably clear that the mental elements of the offences would be distinct. However, in my view the absence of an offence of manufacturing a precursor does not mean that the distinction between precursors and prohibited drugs is inapplicable to the offence with which the appellant was charged, nor does it render inapplicable the reasoning in CWW and Yousef Jidah.
	
	
	For completeness, I note that the same considerations lead me to reject the Crown’s narrower submission at trial, to the effect that knowing involvement in the manufacture of a precursor, itself intended to be converted into a prohibited drug, was sufficient without more to satisfy the mental element of “knowingly takes part” in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. The Act draws a distinction between prohibited drugs and precursors, and goes so far as to create, by s 24A, a separate offence of possessing a precursor intended by the person for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. If an intention to take part in the manufacture of a precursor sufficed to satisfy the mental element of the offence of taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, merely because the precursor might in the future be converted into a prohibited drug, then once again the distinctions drawn by the Act between offences based on precursors and offences based on prohibited drugs would be elided.
	
	
	The Crown’s broader submission on appeal was that proof of a knowledge or belief that the substance was unlawful was sufficient. It was put thus in oral submissions:
	


“The Crown proved that what he manufactured was a prohibited drug, he was knowingly manufacturing it and the fact that at law what he was manufacturing was illegal or a prohibited drug, he can’t rely on that defence because it is as a matter of law that the product is a prohibited drug. It’s not a question of fact.”


	
	As is clear from that submission, the Crown was at pains to deny the availability of a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, and made elaborate submissions based on Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; 218 CLR 493. Those submissions fall away once it is seen that the issue is not the availability of a defence, but instead the nature of the mental element of the offence which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt. I would reject the Crown’s broader submission for the reasons already given.
	
	
	One thing should be made clear. The Act defines two classes of chemicals – prohibited drugs and precursors – and creates different offences with different elements by reference to those classes. For the reasons already given, the mental element of those offences involves an intention which relates to those classes of chemicals. However, it does not follow from any of the foregoing that it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that an accused believed that the substance being manufactured or supplied was some particular prohibited drug. That follows from Dunn (1986) 32 A Crim R 203, where a conviction of possession of a prohibited drug with intent to supply was upheld, notwithstanding that the accused believed he was acquiring methamphetamine but in fact obtained cocaine; both drugs were “prohibited drugs”. Dunn was applied in this Court in R v Ruiz-Avila [2003] NSWCCA 264; 142 A Crim R 459 at [14], where it was said that:
	


“[I]f the appellant’s knowledge of the presence of the tablets were proved, it would not be necessary to prove that he knew that they contained the drug ecstasy. Knowledge, or even belief, on his part that they contained a prohibited drug would be sufficient.”


	
	I have concluded that the primary judge applied an erroneous test. If that were the only basis on which the conviction for count 1 could be sustained, the conviction would have to be set aside pursuant to the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (“on the ground of the wrong decision on any question of law”), noting that no reliance was placed by the Crown on the proviso. However, it is now necessary to turn to an alternative basis available on the findings made by the primary judge, which is challenged by ground 3 of the appeal.
	


Ground 3 – adequacy of reasons


	
	As noted above, the appellant acknowledged that the mental element of the offence in count 1 was satisfied if the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew he was involved in the manufacture of MDP2P, even if he believed that MDP2P was only a precursor. He accepted that ignorance of the law (namely, that MDP2P appeared in Schedule 1 of the Act making it a prohibited drug) was no defence.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the error of law in the legal test formulated and applied by the primary judge, which has been addressed above, the findings made by the primary judge were sufficient to satisfy the correct legal test. Towards the end of his Honour’s reasons, the primary judge said (emphasis added):
	


“I also reject [the appellant’s] evidence beyond reasonable doubt that he equated ketone only to the epoxide. It is one thing to have no particular knowledge of chemistry. It is another thing to be completely oblivious to the fundamental steps in making the ketone. I find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the fundamental steps in making the ketone and he was aware that the ketone was indeed MDP2P.” (emphasis added)


	
	His Honour made the same point shortly thereafter:
	


“The third finding beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused was aware of the general steps involved in making the ketone. He did not believe that an epoxide was the ketone that was to be sold. He was aware of the required step that [was] involved in converting the Isosafrole epoxide into a ketone, indeed, MDP2P.  I accept beyond reasonable doubt Bemand’s evidence that he did discuss that phase with the accused.” (emphasis added)


	
	Ground 3 challenged the adequacy of this aspect of the primary judge’s reasons. It should be said at the outset, in fairness to the primary judge, that the findings emphasised above were not, on the approach taken by his Honour, necessary to establish the mental element on count 1. On the approach taken by his Honour, a belief that a precursor was being manufactured was sufficient. Such a belief was common ground throughout the trial. Had the finding that the appellant knew that MDP2P was being manufactured been necessary to establish guilt, I expect that his Honour would have given much more elaborate reasons in support of it.
	


Conflicting evidence as to the appellant’s knowledge


	
	There was a deal of inconsistent evidence as to whether the appellant knew or believed he was involved in the manufacture not just of some precursor, but of MDP2P.
	
	
	On the one hand, the appellant denied that he knew precisely what was being made, save that it was “ketone”. He gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. Have you ever heard the term MDP2P back then, I’m talking about, in 2007?

A. No.

Q. Back then, did you ever read any literature that indicated what MDP2P was?

A. No.”


	
	The appellant maintained that he had no knowledge of chemistry. That was consistent with Mr Bemand’s statement dated 28 April 2010. That statement made no reference to MDP2P, confirmed that the appellant was involved in the manufacture of “ketone” and that “[the appellant] was only present to assist me as he was not aware then of the chemical process to manufacture the Ketone”. It was also consistent with the Agreed Facts tendered at trial, which referred to the appellant agreeing to produce a precursor from sassafras oil.
	
	
	Mr Bemand gave evidence which bore upon this issue. He said when describing the agreement he reached with the appellant:
	


“Q. But are you saying that there was just an agreement to make this MDP2P or ketone?

A. Originally, yes.”


	
	However, that is equivocal when considered in its context, and reflects the fact that the participants tended to use the word “ketone” to describe the MDP2P being manufactured. For that reason, for example, there were separate containers in the premises marked as “ketone” and “epoxide”. The force of Mr Bemand’s evidence was that initially, he and the appellant had agreed only to making a precursor, not a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Likewise, the (plausible) evidence that Mr Bemand, in the hours and days during the various processes, discussed with the appellant “what was going on” is insufficient of itself to demonstrate that the appellant knew that he was involved in the manufacture of MDP2P (as opposed to some other precursor).
	
	
	However, it was open to the primary judge to reject the appellant’s evidence, and there were documents linked with him which pointed squarely to a better knowledge of MDP2P. Literature was found at the appellant’s home, including a book titled “Uncle Fester’s Guide to the Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture”. Mr Bemand agreed that the book was his, and that he thought he had brought it and other materials to the appellant for him to read.
	
	
	Further, literature found in the factory premises included documents describing the processes formally with chemical diagrams and IUPAC names. It also included more colloquial literature (there was a suggestion in the evidence that some had been copied out of “Uncle Fester’s” guide). Especially from the material at the factory, a reader would become aware of the precise chemical being produced, and that because of the complexity of its formal scientific name, it was convenient to call it “ketone” or an acronym. For example, one page read:
	


“STEP 3

Isosafrol Epoxide to Ketone (Ketone is 3, 4 Methylenedioxphenyl-2- Propanone ie MDPP). Do this rearrangement in 10 to 12 Kilo batches only. This is a potentially explosive step being a very exothermic reaction ...” (sic)


	
	The appellant denied reading the material, although he accepted that his fingerprint was found on one page in a bundle of these documents in the factory (a page headed “Reaction of Methamphetamine with Tartaric Acid”). The video surveillance showed the appellant at various times holding a page as if he was reading it.
	


The obligation to give reasons


	
	Section 132(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) provided that, in criminal proceedings without a jury:
	


“A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.”


	
	In Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 at [28], the High Court addressed that provision (then located in s 33(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act) as follows:
	


“[W]hilst s 33(2), when specifying that which a ‘judgment’ must include, does not use the expression ‘reasons for judgment’, it should not be taken as intending that the requirements of s 33(2) be satisfied merely by a bare statement of the principles of law that the judge has applied and the findings of fact that the judge has made. Rather, there must be exposed the reasoning process linking them and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict that is reached.”


	
	It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to give a precise analysis of the content of the obligation to give reasons, although I respectfully agree that they need not be lengthy or elaborate, especially when based on credibility: see W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [147]. There is much to be said, given the seriousness of a finding of guilt (exposing the appellant in this case to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment) that the obligation is no less than is required from a civil court (cf R v Hendricks [2011] NSWCCA 203 at [7]-[9]). However, it suffices to resolve this ground by direct application of what was held in Fleming. The finding that the appellant was aware, beyond reasonable doubt, that he was involved in the manufacture not just of any precursor, but of MDP2P, was unsupported by any reasons connecting the appellant’s knowledge to what he had been told or what he had read, and did not address the far from implausible evidence that he had no detailed knowledge of chemistry. Nor was there any reconciliation between that finding and the agreed facts.
	
	
	It is true that, prior to making the finding that the appellant knew he was involved in the manufacture of MDP2P, the primary judge directed himself to “have regard to the submissions in the light of the totality of the evidence.” I am conscious that his Honour described the appellant’s evidence as “inherently implausible on a number of aspects” and subsequently rejected the appellant’s evidence that he equated ketone only with epoxide, and that he accepted the evidence of Mr Bemand to the effect that he told the appellant about the steps involved in the manufacturing process. However, I do not regard that as sufficient to discharge the obligation to give reasons if a knowledge or belief that the appellant was involved in the manufacture of MDP2P was necessary to establish his guilt. While the primary judge found that the appellant was aware of the “fundamental steps” in manufacturing the ketone, there is no reasoning linking that finding with the finding that the appellant was aware of the particular ketone being manufactured. Given the lack of direct evidence that the appellant knew the substance was MDP2P specifically, the appellant’s lack of knowledge of chemistry, and the way in which the term “ketone” was used by the participants, I do not consider that the reasons of the primary judge justified the conclusion that the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew it was MDP2P which was being manufactured.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion, it is to be recalled that the question is not whether the Crown had demonstrated that the appellant believed he was doing something unlawful. Nor is it whether the Crown demonstrated that the appellant believed he was making a precursor. Both those matters were undisputed. The very narrow issue arises because count 1 of the indictment charges the appellant with involvement in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely, MDP2P, and this ground of the appeal proceeds on the basis that the appellant’s conviction on that count required proving that he knew or believed that he was involved in manufacturing a particular chemical. There is, in this respect, force in the appellant’s submission noted at the outset that this is an unusual case.
	
	
	The failure to provide any reasoning process linking the finding as to the appellant’s state of mind with the evidence which supported that conclusion was an error. As Gageler J indicated in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 89 ALJR 776 at [81], the reasoning in Fleming at [31]-[33] means that the failure is an error of law which engages the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. I conclude that ground 3 is made out.
	
	
	At one point in the hearing of the appeal it appeared that the Crown submitted that this Court should conclude that the appellant knew he was taking part in the manufacture of MDP2P. I disagree. In light of the competing evidence on this point, I do not consider that this Court is able to make a positive finding that the appellant knew the substance was MDP2P.
	


Grounds 1 and 4 – the verdict in relation to counts 1 and 3


	
	Unlike the grounds addressed above, grounds 1 and 4 of the appeal invoked the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Each ground contended that the verdict in relation to count 1 or count 3 was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence.
	
	
	However, in light of what has already been said, the issues posed by these two grounds are quite different.
	
	
	I have concluded that the guilty verdict in respect of count 1 must be set aside. The only question remaining on this count is whether the evidence is so weak that a guilty verdict was not open and an acquittal should be ordered.
	
	
	That question is readily answered. The primary judge accepted that the appellant “was not aware that the ketone was scheduled as a [prohibited] drug” and I proceed on that basis. Even so, I think it was quite open to the trier of fact to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that a man who had been personally involved in the manufacture of a precursor or “ketone”, who had worked for many hours under the direction of Mr Bemand as part of that process, and who had access to literature identifying the precursor being manufactured as MDP2P, knew or believed that he was involved in the manufacture of MDP2P. The Crown case was not nearly so weak as to permit this ground to be made out.
	
	
	On the other hand, ground 4 is the only basis upon which the conviction on count 3 is challenged. The applicable principles were and are uncontroversial. It is necessary for this Court to undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality. Even if there is sufficient evidence upon which the trier of fact might convict, this Court must also determine whether “nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand”: see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14].
	
	
	The primary judge relied upon the following evidence to find the appellant guilty of count 3:
	



	
	the evidence of Mr Bemand;
	
	
	the video surveillance device footage;
	
	
	the agreed statement of facts;
	
	
	the transcripts of certain telephone intercepts contained in the agreed statement of facts;
	
	
	the video recorded assessment of the factory unit when entered by police;
	
	
	photographs of items seized at the factory;
	
	
	photographs of items found at the appellant’s house, including a pill press;
	
	
	expert certificates; and
	
	
	the documents found at the factory premises, some of which have been mentioned above.
	


Overview of Crown case on Count 3


	
	In written submissions on appeal, the Crown outlined its case against the appellant as follows:
	


“The case against the [appellant] on all counts was circumstantial, plus the direct evidence of Bemand who gave evidence of what he had told the [appellant] about the nature of the substances that were manufactured by him others and in which the applicant knowingly took part. Although the trial judge was constrained to some extent by the agreed facts, there was other evidence in the case which allowed his Honour to build on those agreed facts.”


	
	The Crown’s case against the appellant on this count relied on Mr Bemand’s evidence that he had told the appellant that he was going to make MDA at the Padstow factory, in addition to the “overwhelming circumstantial” evidence, including the video surveillance footage, the items found at the Padstow factory and the appellant’s home, and the fact that the appellant was not only present during the various manufacturing stages, but was also the only person present when the police raided the factory and seized MDA.
	
	
	In light of the way in which the appellant advanced this ground, it is necessary to provide some further details of the evidence given by Mr Bemand. His Honour summarised his evidence, referred to various inconsistencies or contradictions in it, and gave himself the relevant warnings for such a witness. No complaint is made about the nature or adequacy of those warnings.
	
	
	Mr Bemand’s evidence unequivocally tied the appellant to the manufacture of MDA. He said that “I had to make some product to recover the money … that we owed, that I owed” and that he had discussed his intention to make MDA, originally with Mr Cassar and then with the appellant. He gave this evidence:
	


“Q. Did Mr Siafakas react in any way to what you said?

A. He wasn’t – wasn’t particularly happy about it.

HIS HONOUR

Q. What was said, what was said?

A. It wasn’t the original agreement.

Q. He said that did he?

A. He said that to me, yes.

Q. Yes, and what did you say?

A. I said I had no choice.”


	
	Mr Bemand then described the reaction to convert the MDP2P to MDA. When asked how long that step actually took, he said, “That took by the time you do you the cook, which is say a couple of days, and then you have to clean it up and so on, about two to three days.” He then gave this evidence:
	


“Q. When you were making that MDA, was anyone else present?

A. Cassar was in the premises and William was in the – in the premises.

Q. Did you speak with Mr Siafakas while you were doing that?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you tell him what you were doing?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What was his reaction to that?

A. At that stage, he had agreed to stay, so it wasn’t any reaction to that at that time. So I didn’t do it without first telling him that I was going to do it.”


	
	Mr Bemand gave further evidence that Mr Siafakas was present while Mr Bemand was performing certain steps in the process, and participated in other steps.
	
	
	In addition to the evidence of Mr Bemand, the primary judge said that “there is powerful circumstantial support for much of the evidence of John Bemand”. His reasons proceeded to say:
	


“On 9 December the accused was in charge of a fully functioning drug factory. He leased the premises. He had spent hundreds of hours there, was there alone for almost a day before the police raid. There were large quantities of drugs present covering all the aspect in the manufacture of MDA, namely Isosafrole, MDP2P, MDA, ovens for the drying of MDA as salt, five trays containing MDA in the oven, pill press, materials for the conversion of the salt into tablets, instructions manual at the premises. Bemand’s evidence is supported by the very fact that the accused was there for all that time in this fully functioning factory. On the 9th he assisted in the crystallisation of the MDA, transferring the tartaric acid, and scraping the trays.”

Overview of the defence case on Count 3


	
	The defence case at trial was that Mr Siafakas accepted that on 4 December there had been a conversation which went beyond making the ketone precursor chemical and involved making a prohibited drug. He said that “John Bemand made me aware that he was considering making some prohibited drugs”. He said that Mr Bemand “was considering to make some prohibited drugs to try and pay for some of the debts that he and Charlie [Cassar] owed to some people”. He said that his response was:
	


“I was upset, and I said that that’s not to happen in my factory. That’s not the agreement that we had.”


	
	Mr Siafakas gave the following explanation for the pill presses located in his house:
	


“I was asked to see if I could repair them and, for convenience’s sake, so I wasn’t going backwards and forwards to the factory in respect to the pill presses, I agreed and maybe even asked if they could be taken to my home.”


	
	He denied believing that the pill presses were going to be used to press prohibited drugs. He said that the pill presses were taken to his home purely to repair and then to be onsold.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he was asked:
	


“Q. Didn’t you ever make any connection between those pill presses and prohibited drugs?

A. No, because it was never the agreement.

Q. Are you saying you thought at all times those pill presses were going to be used for purely lawful activities?

A. I said I was asked to repair them for the purpose of them being on-sold …”

The appellant’s submissions on ground 4


	
	The appellant’s submissions on this ground have two aspects. The first is that “[a]cceptance of Bemand’s evidence that he informed the [appellant] that there was a change of plan and MDA was to be produced was essential to the finding of guilt on count 3”. That was said to follow from the fact that “there had been an explicit agreement between the [appellant] and Bemand to produce only ketone combined with the fact that the [appellant] had no particular knowledge of chemistry” (appellant’s written submissions, para 56).
	
	
	Secondly, it was submitted that because there were “three major inconsistencies” in Mr Bemand’s evidence, and limitations upon the utility of the surveillance footage, that the evidence could not sustain the conviction on this count.
	
	
	Quite elaborate submissions were made concerning the three major inconsistencies. The first was based on timing. Mr Bemand gave evidence that the process of “cooking” the MDP2P to produce MDA oil “went most of the night”. Mr Bemand said he was present during that process. The video surveillance evidence established that the only time Mr Bemand was in the factory overnight was the night of 1-2 December 2007.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that Mr Bemand’s evidence that the appellant was present during the process, and that Mr Bemand told him what was being done during that time, was inconsistent with the video surveillance evidence, which demonstrated that the appellant was not present at the factory on the night of 1-2 December 2007. Rather, the appellant was present in the factory between 9:42 and 15:38 on 1 December and 12:45 to 14:54 on 2 December. (The appellant was present in the factory on the night of 3-4 December 2007.)
	
	
	A further inconsistency based on timing was said to emerge from the evidence Mr Bemand gave about the crystallisation process, by which MDA oil was converted to powder. Mr Bemand said that the appellant was present during this process. Again, by reference to the video surveillance evidence, this process was established as occurring on the morning of 8 December 2007, prior to the arrival of the appellant on that day (which was at 10:49).
	
	
	The appellant submitted that “[n]either of these inconsistencies were the subject of comment in his Honour’s reasons”.
	
	
	The “second major inconsistency” related to whether the appellant was present when trays of MDA were put in the oven. Mr Bemand’s evidence in chief was unequivocal:
	


“Q. Can you recall how many of the trays you saw Mr Siafakas with?

A. I think all up we packed about four trays to dry, something like that.

Q. How many of those would you have seen Mr Siafakas with?

A. We were all handling the trays at the time. So we all handled the trays, yes.”


	
	However, the video surveillance evidence demonstrated that Mr Bemand and Mr Cassar were at the factory, in the absence of the appellant, when the trays of powder were placed in the oven. The five trays were placed in the oven between 10:19 and 10:29 on 8 December 2007, while the appellant did not enter the factory until 10:49. This was described as a “significant lie”, and Mr Bemand was cross-examined at trial on the basis that during the committal he had given evidence that the appellant was not present when the trays were placed in the oven. The appellant made this submission:
	


“When regard is had to his committal evidence it is difficult to attribute it to a simple mistake. Of perhaps greater significance, is that Bemand’s evidence at trial in this respect attempted to falsely involve the applicant in one of the final stages of the manufacture of the MDA.”


	
	Again, the appellant submitted that this incongruence was not dealt with by the primary judge.
	
	
	The “third major inconsistency” was conceded by the appellant to be less important. Mr Bemand gave evidence that on the afternoon of 8 December 2007, the video surveillance showed that “it looks like he’s turning powder on the tray”. In cross-examination, Mr Bemand accepted that the footage was more consistent with the appellant cleaning a tray, as opposed to turning over powder.
	


Resolution of ground 4


	
	I would reject both aspects of the appellant’s submissions on ground 4. In relation to the inconsistencies, the third was minor, as counsel for the appellant acknowledged (“certainly we wouldn’t suggest that it’s as significant as the earlier matters that I’ve taken your Honours to”). But I would regard the first and second inconsistencies as also being relatively minor. Mr Bemand was giving evidence about what occurred during the production of MDA some six years earlier. It is true that he made errors about when he was overnight in the factory premises, and that he wrongly said that the appellant was present in the factory on the morning before the police executed a search warrant when the trays of powder were placed in the oven, whereas in fact he arrived 20 minutes later. However, those errors of recollection did not, in my view, disentitle the trier of fact from believing the gravamen of Mr Bemand’s evidence – namely, that the man who had been working closely with him knew that he was involved in the manufacture of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	It is to be recalled that this was not a typical case of participants having different recollections of events many years previously. This was a case where Mr Bemand and the appellant gave extensive evidence (in the case of Mr Bemand’s, in chief and in cross-examination) by reference to the video surveillance. Both men gave explanations of what they were doing six years previously by reference to images showing precisely what they were in fact doing six years previously. Those explanations had considerable force, because the video surveillance of necessity circumscribed the denials which could plausibly be maintained, and enhanced the probative value of the positive evidence. The fact that the testimonial evidence was linked in this way to an objective record of events in the factory premises six years earlier very much diminished the usual concerns of the fallibility of human memory and the fact that Mr Bemand was an accomplice who had accepted a discount on his own sentence in exchange for assisting the Crown prove its case against the appellant. Especially in those circumstances, I consider that it was open to the trier of fact to accept the evidence of Mr Bemand when he said that what was occurring was the production of MDA, and to reject the appellant’s denials that he was aware of that fact.
	
	
	Secondly and independently of the foregoing, I do not consider that the Crown case depended upon acceptance of Mr Bemand’s evidence. To the contrary, the Crown case was one which was very powerful, and parts of the appellant’s case were highly implausible. The Crown case contained the following elements independent of Mr Bemand’s evidence:
	



	
	The appellant was caught red-handed in a fully functioning drug factory. He was alone, and had been there alone for some hours, in the presence of very large quantities of precursors and MDA.
	
	
	According to the appellant, and although it was not in the original agreement, there was discussion of which he was aware that the “ketone” would be converted into a prohibited drug.
	
	
	In late November 2007, the appellant acknowledged that he had prepared ammonium formate, a substance which was used in the process of converting MDP2P to MDA.
	
	
	On 7 December 2007, the surveillance cameras showed the appellant scooping some powder from a bin into a measuring flask. The evidence established that it was tartaric acid. The appellant accepted that “there needed to be a degree of precision in relation to the amount of tartaric acid” which was used in crystallising out the MDA, although denying that he had any awareness of why he was doing what he was doing.
	
	
	The appellant’s fingerprint was found on one of the pages found at the factory premises, a page headed “Reaction of Methamphetamine with Tartaric Acid”.
	
	
	The appellant agreed that the surveillance cameras on 7 December 2007 showed the appellant taking a white powder from a tray, and “scraping it up into a nice, neat little heap”. He explained that “We put it in the bag, and we put it aside for John Bemand to have a look at and to see how successful the salvage was”. The explanation that, at this stage in the process, he believed he was recovering isosafrole epoxide, is implausible.
	
	
	There were pill presses found in the factory and in the appellant’s home. Pill presses have no role in the production of precursor. Also found at the appellant’s home, in the basement with the pill presses, were documents relating to the manufacture of pills. The appellant’s evidence that he had taken the presses home to repair them with a view to their being on-sold is implausible.
	



	
	It is not necessary to summarise the whole of what was plainly a strong circumstantial Crown case. The foregoing suffices to demonstrate that this ground is not made out.
	


Orders


	
	There was no challenge to the conviction on count 5, and the challenge to the conviction on count 3 has failed. It follows that the indicative sentences for those offences should remain in place, but the conviction for count 1 and the aggregate sentence which was, in part, based upon that conviction, must be set aside.
	
	
	In the absence of any challenge to (a) the finding of special circumstances, (b) the approach inherent in the aggregate sentence that the individual sentences should be wholly concurrent and (c) the backdating to 3 January 2012 having regard to pre-sentence custody, the approach adopted by the primary judge should apply on resentencing, although I would not impose an aggregate sentence. In lieu of the existing aggregate sentence, the sentences for the convictions on counts 3 and 5 should be imposed in the way indicated by the primary judge.
	
	
	There has been considerable delay in the commencement of the appeal. The sentence was imposed on 9 May 2014, but a notice of appeal was only filed on 6 November 2015. I mention that to explain why it is that more than two thirds of the non-parole period had already been served, something which may bear upon the decision whether there is to be a retrial.
	
	
	The formal orders I propose are:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal in respect of grounds 1 and 4.
	
	
	Appeal allowed in part.
	
	
	Set aside the verdict of guilty on count 1.
	
	
	Set aside the sentence imposed on 9 May 2014, and in lieu thereof, sentence the appellant:
	



	
	in respect of count 3, to a term of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 5 months;
	
	
	in respect of count 5, to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years.
	


Each of those sentences will commence on 3 January 2012. The earliest date on which the appellant would be eligible for release on parole will be 3 June 2017.


	
	In accordance with what was said in AK v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [60], whether there is a new trial on counts 1 and 2 is a matter for the prosecuting authorities.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgments of Leeming JA and Schmidt J. I agree with Leeming JA that grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal have been made out but that the remaining grounds should be dismissed. I also agree with the formal orders proposed by his Honour in the circumstances in order to dispose of the appeal.
	
	
	I agree that, given MDP2P was itself a prohibited drug, there were only two ways in which the Crown could prove the requisite mental element of the offence created by s 24(2) of the Act, namely by proving either that the person knew he or she was manufacturing a prohibited drug or by proving that the person knew that he or she was manufacturing MDP2P. It was in this case necessary for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant believed that he was taking part in the production of either a prohibited drug in general or MDP2P in particular.
	
	
	I agree that the mental element in s 24(2) of the Act is an intention to manufacture a substance that is a prohibited drug, not merely an intention to manufacture some substance that turns out to be a prohibited drug. I do not accept that proof that a person has been involved in some coincidental but general illegal activity suffices to displace the Crown’s obligation to prove the specific illegality of which the section requires proof.
	
	
	With respect to the adequacy of the trial judge’s reasons, I agree that his Honour’s approach was influenced by his acceptance that a belief that a precursor was being manufactured was all that was necessary. However, to the extent that a finding that the appellant knew that MDP2P was being manufactured was sufficient to establish his guilt, it should necessarily have been supported by reasons that clearly exposed and reconciled the conflicting evidence that bore upon the issue.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I have had the benefit of reading Leeming JA’s reasons. I agree with his Honour’s conclusions and reasons as to ground 4 of the appeal, concerning the s 24 manufacture of MDA offence (count 3), but find myself in disagreement with his Honour as to grounds 1, 2 and 3. Those grounds concern count 1, the s 24 manufacture of MDP2P offence.
	
	
	In my view the appellant has not established grounds 1, 2 and 3. Accordingly, they should be dismissed, with the result that the appeal should be dismissed in its entirety. These are my reasons for those conclusions.
	
	
	The appellant accepted that if he did not succeed on ground 2, he could not succeed on ground 1. Ground 3 is also closely connected to the other two grounds. They are:
	


“1.    The verdict in relation to count 1 is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

2.    With respect to count 1, the learned trial judge erred in law in finding that proof that the applicant was aware that what he was engaged in was criminal was sufficient to satisfy the mental element relating to the physical element that the substance was a prohibited drug.

3.   The learned trial judge erred in law in failing to provide adequate reasons for his finding that the applicant was aware that the substance, the subject of count 1, was 3,4-Methylenedioxy-phenyl1-2-propanone or ‘MDP2P’.”


	
	The appellant was charged with six counts, three of which were in the alternative. He was convicted of counts 1, 3 and 5. Count 5 was an offence under s 24A, of possessing the precursor, isosafrole, with the requisite intent. The appellant does not appeal that conviction.
	
	
	The appellant’s case on appeal turns on the finding that he did not know that the substance MDP2P, the subject of count 1, was a prohibited drug.
	
	
	There was no issue that in law that substance is both a precursor and a prohibited drug. It is not normally ingested. That was submitted on appeal to be significant, because:
	


“… of course in the ordinary course of being in a laboratory, making a prohibited drug, if you’re in the process of actually producing something that you know is going to be ingested by somebody else for the psycho active effect then you are going to have the relevant intention with respect to producing something that is in the class prohibited drugs. The fact that you’re not producing something that is to be ingested does not then carry with it the necessary inference that you are within the class of prohibited drugs.”


	
	In written submissions it was put that:
	


“In the present case there was no issue that the applicant knowingly took part in the manufacture of a substance which, as it happens, was a prohibited drug. Nor was there any issue as to his knowledge that the quantity was in excess of the large commercial quantity. The issue at trial was whether he did so knowing the manufacture was of a prohibited drug. It was open to the Crown to prove this element in one of two ways:

a.   By proving the applicant knew he was manufacturing a prohibited drug of some sort (without necessarily knowing which particular drug he was manufacturing). In this event the applicant would have the requisite mental element for the manufacture of a prohibited drug that being the element of the charge; the precise identity of that drug being a particular, which, in the circumstances of a case such as this, would not need to be proved.

b.   Alternatively, the element would be satisfied by proof the applicant knew he was manufacturing MDP2P. In this event, the applicant would be manufacturing a prohibited drug. Any lack of knowledge that MDP2P was a prohibited drug would be ignorance of the law and no excuse.”

The evidence


	
	The evidence established that the appellant, an intelligent man, who was successfully operating a radiography business, agreed to provide the premises at which the drug laboratory in which he worked with his two co-accused, was established. There they manufactured the three substances the subject of the charges, the appellant well understanding that what they were doing involved breaches of applicable drug laws. On his own evidence he expected that the production he had initially agreed to participate in would take two to three weeks; that the substance to be produced was illegal; that it would be sold to others to be used to manufacture prohibited drugs; and that in return, he would be paid $50,000.
	
	
	There was an agreed statement of facts tendered at trial (ex 1). What was there agreed included that:
	


“10.   Between 17 August 2007 and 3 September 2007 John Bemand, Charles Cassar, Michael Cassar, Michael Fuller carried out various tasks inside the factory, which included: attending to a 600L boiler, unloading drums and containers of liquid from vehicles, reading paperwork contained in folders, conducting chemical reactions, monitoring chemical reactions, draining liquid from buckets, handling glassware, transferring liquid between glassware and moving various buckets, glassware and drums around the Factory.

11.   The Accused attended the Factory on a few occasions during this period 17 August 2007 and 3 September 2007 but did not physically participate in any of the activities of the others inside the Factory.

12.    Some time in the later part of August 2007 early September 2007, the accused agreed to participate with Mr John Bemand, Charles Cassar, Michael Cassar and Michael Fuller to produce a precursor from sassafras oil.

…

14.   On 3 September 2007 to 22 September 2007 the Accused, along with Charles Cassar and John Bemand participates in activities inside the Factory which included: mixing substances, moving buckets, handling glassware, transferring liquid between glassware, emptying drums, watching reactions, stacking shelves, scraping containers, monitoring the contents of the 600L boiler and monitoring the GLC machine.

15.   From 22 September 2007 to 5 November 2007 no chemical processing activity takes place at the factory. Charles Cassar and John Bemand do not attend the Factory as they were both overseas. The Accused attends the Factory form time to time but does not participate in any chemical processing activity.

16.   From 6 November 2007 to 29 November 2007 the Accused and John Bemand attend the Factory and participate in activities inside the Factory.

17.   From 30 November 2007 to 9 December 2007 the Accused, along with Charles Cassar and John Bemand participated in activities inside the Factory which included: mixing substances, moving buckets, handling glassware, transferring liquid between glassware, emptying drums, watching reactions, stacking shelves, scrapping containers, monitoring the contents of the 600L boiler and moving trays.

18.   On 9 December 2007 police entered the factory and found various chemicals including a quantity of drug precursor, namely 268,958 grams of Isosafrole. Isosafrole is a precursor for the prohibited drug MDP2P. Police also found a quantity of prohibited drugs, namely 1,645 grams of MDP2P and 3,694 grams of MDA. MDP2P is both a prohibited drug and a precursor for MDA.”


	
	The Crown’s case was otherwise circumstantial. It depended on the surveillance videos which showed the appellant working in the lab over this period; various physical evidence found at the lab and at the appellant’s home, including pill presses, various documents about what was being manufactured and the “Uncle Fester’s Guide to the Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture” book, which belonged to Mr Bemand, but was found at the appellant’s home; as well as the evidence called from witnesses, including Mr Bemand. It was he who had the necessary knowledge for the production of the substances which the co-accused manufactured.
	
	
	Mr Bemand had given evidence on committal, which was, in part, exculpatory of the appellant’s involvement. He received a discount on his sentence in return for giving evidence at the appellant’s trial. He was cross-examined extensively as to the truth of the evidence he then gave, which inculpated the appellant, as well as about other relevant aspects of his evidence, by reference to what could be seen on the surveillance videos.
	
	
	Mr Bemand’s explanation for giving a different account at committal as to the appellant’s involvement in the operation was that he had then been dishonest, because he didn’t want to cause the appellant trouble and he felt bad about saying anything against the appellant. That he gave truthful evidence at trial, was in issue. That he did give truthful evidence was revealed not only by the agreed statement of facts, but also by what could be seen on the surveillance videos and the evidence which the appellant himself gave, including in cross-examination, as to what he had agreed to do and what he could be seen doing on the videos.
	
	
	In the appellant’s evidence in chief he made various admissions, that is, representations which were adverse to his interest in the outcome of the proceedings. He made further admissions in cross-examination. In large measure those admissions corroborated evidence which had been given by Mr Bemand. There is no question that the Crown was entitled to rely on those admissions to meet the onus which fell upon it, to establish its case on all three counts beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	What still finally remained in issue at trial included whether, on critical matters, Mr Bemand’s evidence would be accepted over that of the appellant. As Leeming JA has explained, there was good reason for the appellant’s evidence to be rejected on those matters. No error has been shown in his Honour’s preference of Mr Bemand’s evidence over that of the appellant, including as to the state of the appellant’s knowledge as to what was being manufactured in the laboratory.
	
	
	As to count 1, Mr Bemand’s evidence was that he had approached the appellant to assist him make a ketone, by which he meant “a ketone that makes MDA. So 3,4 (methylenedioxyphenyl acetone)”, which he agreed was sometimes known as MDP2P, after he had received a threat. Without objection he was asked:
	


“Q.   But are you saying that there was just an agreement to make this MD2P2[sic] or ketone?

A.   Originally, yes”


	
	Mr Bemand’s evidence was that it was initially agreed that appellant was to be paid $50,000 and later, that the profits were to be shared between the three offenders; the initial agreement was that the appellant was to obtain the premises, Mr Cassar the chemicals and a fair bit of the equipment, and that Mr Bemand would provide other equipment and would work with the appellant and Mr Cassar to do the cook, he having the requisite knowledge. Mr Bemand expected to make 50 to 60 kilos of the ketone in the first production, which he knew was to be used in the manufacture of ecstasy, MDMA or MDA, it being intended to sell the ketone to Mr Cassar’s contacts, who would pay a fee for each litre of the MDP2P supplied. Later it was agreed that MDA would be manufactured.
	
	
	Mr Bemand described the manufacture process, which began with turning sassafras oil into isosafrole. That took about four to five days. The isosafrole then had to be converted into isosafrole epoxide, but it overheated, with the result that nearly all of the product was destroyed. Only 4 litres, or 4 kilos isosafrole epoxide was then obtained.
	
	
	Mr Bemand said that he then had to think about how he could extract anything more. He went overseas and on his return, he worked with Mr Cassar and the appellant for a considerable period, in order to pursue a number of processes, which he described, to convert the overheated substance into isosafrole epoxide and then into MDP2P. That latter process took a further two to three days. Mr Bemand said that it was when he had converted about half of the 4 litres of epoxide, that he decided that he had to make some “product” to recover the money that he owed. He explained that product to be MDA. His evidence was that he discussed this with the appellant, who not only agreed, but then assisted in its manufacture.
	
	
	The evidence in chief which the appellant gave as to the initial agreement was:
	


“Q. Can you detail the conversation in a sort of he said, you said type scenario, the best as you can?

A. Yes. John Bemand said, “Look, William, we’re in a bit of a bother at the moment. We’re in debt to some people and I need your factory to manufacture some ketone.” I’d never heard of what ketone was before. I asked him, “What is ketone?” He said to me, “William, it’s a chemical,” and I said, “Fine.” I said, “Is it illegal?” He said to me, “Unfortunately, yes, it is, William.” I said--

DJEMAL: He said, “Unfortunately, yes, it is illegal,” is what Bemand said to him.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I heard that. I was listening for that, yes.

WITNESS: He said, “Look” - I became a little bit apprehensive. He said, “Look, it’s only a precursor chemical,” and I said, “Look, how long will it take you to do this? What does it involve?” and he said, “Look, William, it’ll only take us three weeks to do it,” and I said, “Well, look, if you say it only takes three weeks, I’ll allow you to use a factory for that purpose and if it gets you out of trouble, because I can see that you’re really concerned about it, I will help you,” and I allowed him to use the premises for that purpose.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Sorry, was there discussion about precursor for what?

A. No, it was a - no, not at that time.

Q. You didn’t ask?

A. Didn’t ask, no.

HIS HONOUR: Continue.

DJEMAL

Q. At that time, you didn’t know what it was a precursor for, you knew it was a precursor?

A. A precursor chemical. That’s all I established.

Q. You know it wasn’t legal?

A. That’s correct, yes.

Q. Is that all he explained to you about the illegality then?

A. As time progressed, I probed a little bit further. It may have been when I assisted on the 3rd or 4th of September, and thereabouts there might have been a conversation regarding the legality of it.

Q. When you say the legality, what that precursor could do or what the precursor chemical was?

A. No. He explained to me it was a chemical, because I said, “Why can’t you just buy it?” He said to me, “Look, William, it is a restricted chemical. You do need a licence, and it’s difficult to get.”

Q. Did he explain to you that it can be used to make a prohibited drug?

A. It would have been about that time, yes.

Q. That you know that from that time?

A. That’s correct.

Q. What was your understanding about prohibited drugs being made at the factory, though, at that time?

A. That was never an agreement. That--

Q. Was that a clear understanding?

A. That’s correct. It was never raised. It was never questioned. It was never an agreement.

Q. Have you ever heard the term MDP2P back then, I’m talking about, in 2007?

A. No.

Q. Back then, did you ever read any literature that indicated what MDP2P was?

A. No.

Q. Back then, if you understood you were going to be making ketone, if you were informed that ketone was a prohibited drug, would you have let your factory be used?

A. No.

HIS HONOUR

Q. But you thought it was something illegal?

A. Yes, I did, your Honour.

Q. And you let your factory be used?

A. Yes, I did, your Honour.”


	
	In cross-examination the appellant agreed that he knew that it was illegal to manufacture the ketone, which could be used to manufacture prohibited drugs and that up until 9 December, he had assisted in its manufacture. He denied knowing, however, that from 4 December it was prohibited drugs that the ketone was being used to manufacture, which he identified to be ecstasy. Given that MDP2P is a liquid and that what was finally produced was a solid capable of being used to make pills with the pill presses found at the laboratory and the appellant’s home, this evidence was simply unbelievable, as his Honour found and Leeming JA has explained.
	
	
	His Honour also found that the appellant knew that it was MDP2P which was being manufactured. In his evidence in chief the appellant denied knowing at the time of manufacture, that the substance was MDP2P, he claimed to have only known that it was a ketone, which he also described as a “precursor chemical”. He also described what he had been involved in, when attempts were made to salvage the epoxide in the ruined process which he also described. In cross-examination, however, the appellant made further admissions. He there said:
	


“Q. Let’s get some things straight. Now, in August of 2007, you had some discussions with Mr Bemand. Is that correct?

A. Yes. I had many discussions.

Q. During that discussion, it came up that he wanted to manufacture ketone. Is that correct?

A. Yes, that’s correct.

Q. You knew, at that stage, that it was illegal to manufacture ketone?

A. Yes.

Q. You know that ketone would go onto be used to manufacture prohibited drugs. Is that correct?

A. That’s correct.

Q. You knew that from August of 2007?

A. No, I said 3rd - possible 3rd of 4th of September.

Q. But from at least the 3rd or 4th of September 2007 you knew--

A. Thereabouts.

Q. You knew that there were going to be manufacture of ketone which is now known to MDP2P. That’s correct?

A. That’s correct.

Q. You know at that stage that it was something which would be or could be used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. Is that correct?

A. You asked that question, yes.”

Ground 2 – the mental element of a s 24(2) offence

The statutory scheme


	
	The Act deals with both precursors and prohibited drugs. Relevantly, the scheme of Division 2 Indictable Offences of the Act, is to create offences for the manufacture and production of prohibited drugs (s 24) and for supply of prohibited drugs (s 25). In the case of certain specified quantities of prohibited drugs, there is a deemed supply offence (s 29). A cascading regime of penalties for Division 2 offences is provided in s 30 - s 33A.
	
	
	Whether evidence has established the requisite intention for offences of supply, manufacture or production of a prohibited drug must be approached in light of the requirements of s 6, which provides:
	


“6    Meaning of “take part in”

For the purposes of this Act and the regulations, a person takes part in the cultivation or supply of a prohibited plant or the manufacture, production or supply of a prohibited drug or psychoactive substance if:

(a)    the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that cultivation, manufacture, production or supply,

(b)    the person provides or arranges finance for any such step in that process, or

(c)    the person provides the premises in which any such step in that process is taken, or suffers or permits any such step in that process to be taken in premises of which the person is the owner, lessee or occupier or in the management of which the person participates.”


	
	Possession of prohibited drugs is dealt with in s 10 of Division 1 Summary offences. Section 21 Penalties prescribes that:
	


“The penalty for an offence under this Division is a fine of 20 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 2 years, or both, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Division.”


	
	Division 2 also creates offences for possession of precursors and certain apparatus for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs (s 24A) and for possession of prescribed quantities of prohibited drug precursors (s 24B). There is no offence for the manufacture of precursors. That reflects that it is not illegal under the Act merely to possess precursors.
	
	
	Possession can result from acts of an offender, including acts such as manufacture, purchase or theft. It can also result from the acts of others. Manufacture, however, requires positive steps to be taken by the offender.
	
	
	Counts 1 and 3 both involved offences under s 24(2). The maximum penalty for count 1 was life imprisonment, because the amount of MDP2P manufactured was 1.645 kilograms, more than the commercial quantity (s 33). The standard non-parole period for that offence was 15 years. Section 24(2) provides:
	


“(2)     A person who manufactures or produces, or who knowingly takes part in the manufacture or production of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.”


	
	A “prohibited drug” is defined in s 3 to mean “any substance, other than a prohibited plant, specified in Schedule 1.” The substances there specified include substances which, like MDP2P, are not usually ingested.
	
	
	Count 5 was an offence against s 24A(1), the maximum penalty for which was 10 years imprisonment (s 33AB). Section 24A(1) provides:
	


“24A    Possession of precursors and certain apparatus for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs

(1)     A person who has possession of:

(a)     a precursor, or

(b)     a drug manufacture apparatus,

intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.”


	
	A “precursor” is defined in s 24A(3) to mean “a substance specified or described in the regulations as a precursor for the purposes of this section.” They are specified in Schedules 1 and 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2011 (NSW). In the case of such substances, it is not their manufacture which constitutes an offence. Possession of such a precursor only amounts to an offence under s 24, when the person in possession intends that it be used to manufacture or produce a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Possession of specified amounts of a precursor can also be an offence under s 24B. Those amounts appear in Schedule 4 to the Regulation. There are, however, defences to such an offence specified in s 24B (2), if the defendant establishes:
	


“(a)    that the defendant is in possession of the precursor for the purposes of an activity that is not unlawful, or

(b)    that the defendant otherwise has a reasonable excuse for possessing the precursor.”


	
	It follows that the Act contemplates both lawful manufacture and possession of precursors. It is the purpose for which a precursor is possessed, which makes its possession unlawful.
	
	
	Some substances are, however, both precursors and prohibited drugs under the Act. It is in their cases that both manufacture and possession can involve offending. The Act does not contemplate either lawful manufacture or possession of such substances.
	
	
	That is why it was the possession, rather than the manufacture of isosafrole, which constituted the appellant’s offence under s 24A, it being only a precursor under the Act and not also a prohibited drug. The appellant accepted on appeal that the evidence established that he had committed the offence charged in respect of the isosafrole found at the laboratory, it establishing as it did both his possession of the isosafrole and his intention that it be used for the production of another prohibited drug.
	
	
	It was the manufacture of MDP2P and MDA which formed the basis of the appellant’s alleged s 24 offences, counts 1 and 3 respectively. The mental element required to be established in relation to both those offences was “to knowingly take part in the manufacture or production of a prohibited drug”.
	


Issues on appeal


	
	On appeal there was no issue that the appellant was involved in the manufacture of the three substances the subject of the charges. Each is a chemical substance, isosafrole and MDP2P being liquids and MDA a solid. Both MDP2P and isosafrole are precursors under the regulations for the purpose of s 24A. MDP2P is also a prohibited drug listed in Schedule 1, as is MDA. Neither isosafrole and MDP2P are ingested for narcotic effect. They can both be used to manufacture prohibited drugs. The isosafrole was used by the appellant and his co-accused to manufacture MDP2P. It, in turn, was used to manufacture MDA.
	
	
	It was the appellant’s knowledge as to what was being manufactured which was in issue at trial. On appeal it was only his knowledge that the substance the subject of count 1, MD2P2, was a prohibited drug and that he was involved in the manufacture of MDA, as well as isosafrole and MDP2P, which were in issue.
	


The trial judge’s approach to intention


	
	His Honour’s unchallenged reasons in respect of count 5 may not be overlooked in resolving the issues lying between the parties in relation to count 1.
	
	
	This was a judge alone trial. In his conviction judgment, after dealing with the issues as to the appellant’s possession of the isosafrole, his Honour turned to the resolution of what lay in issue as to his intention. His Honour said:
	


“Before I leave this count, the accused submissions focus principally upon the second element, the intention element. The contention on behalf of the accused is that the evidence only establishes that the accused understood that a chemical precursor could be used by others to make a prohibited drug. It has not established that the accused intended the making of a prohibited drug. That involves some interesting questions. According to Jackwitz v Franklin [2006] NSWCCA 419 at para 29 the essential element of the offence is possession of the precursor accompanied by the relevant intention. It is not essential to the proof of the charge that the person in possession have a specific intent as to the identity of the individual or individuals who will manufacture or produce the prohibited drug. That is merely incidental. It may well be that the offender has possession of the precursor with an intent that it be made into a prohibited drug without a final intention as to by whom the prohibited drug is to be made.

Clearly an intention involves questions of fact and degree. Clearly the accused expected that Bemand would use the isosafrole to make the chemical ketone precursor, indeed to make MDP2P which is itself a prohibited drug which was to be provided to others, namely associates of Cassar because of its capacity for use in the manufacture of ecstasy. That is in fact why it was valuable. The accused expected and in my view he intended for that to take place. He intended the isosafrole to be converted into the ketone chemical precursor MDP2P and he knew that conversion was illegal and he intended it then to be on sold and used in the manufacture by others of ecstasy.

I do not consider that it is necessary for the accused to have a particular interest in the manufacture of the final product. It is a question of intention rather than interest. He needs to possess a precursor with the intention that others will use it in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. He had an interest that the ketone will be manufactured and purchased by those who consider it of value because it could and would be used to manufacture ecstasy. According to exhibit 27 which was adopted by the accused in evidence, the accused became involved at the behest of John Bemand because Charles had borrowed money from some people to manufacture ketone and now they have threatened to kill him: “He has got me in a lot of trouble, William I need to use the premises.” The whole venture was designed to make ketone perhaps with some haste, to have it given to somebody who would turn it into ecstasy.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the evidence on which the issue as to intention in relation to count 5 was resolved. There is no appeal from those conclusions.
	
	
	His Honour the turned to count 1. As to intent, he took the view that:
	


“… it is sufficient in my view that the accused has knowledge or belief in the wrongfulness of the act that he is knowingly taking part in, that is the illegal and prohibited manufacture of the substance which in fact is a scheduled prohibited drug. He needs to know all the facts constituting the ingredients necessary to make the act criminal.”


	
	His Honour concluded on the evidence that the original agreement was to make the ketone the subject of count 1, MDP2P, the appellant believing that manufacture to be illegal and prohibited by law, accepting Mr Bemand’s evidence about those matters. He also found, however, that the appellant was not aware that MDP2P was scheduled as a prohibited drug under the Act. His Honour took the view, nevertheless, that the appellant’s knowledge was sufficient to establish the mental element of the s 24 offence.
	
	
	It was those conclusions which were submitted on appeal to involve error.
	


The appellant’s case on count 1


	
	The case the appellant advanced at trial as to count 1 was that it had to be shown beyond reasonable doubt not only that he knew that the ketone he had agreed to manufacture was MDP2P, but also that it was prohibited, not in “the schedule sense”, but that it was a drug, having the qualities of a drug. Knowledge that the substance was illegal, was argued to be not enough.
	
	
	On appeal in relation to count 1 it was submitted that:
	


“What makes this case unusual, particularly in relation to count 1, is firstly, there is express agreement as between the parties, but the original agreement to which the applicant was a party was to make no more than a precursor, variously described as a ketone, precursor and P2P. So that’s the first curious aspect but obviously it sets the tone in relation to the evidence that follows, the other aspect is that that particular substance despite being a prohibited drug is not a product that is ingested by the end user.”


	
	On the appellant’s case proof of intention to manufacture a substance which was a prohibited drug was necessary, in the case of the s 24 offences. Proof of an intention to manufacture a substance of a different quality was not sufficient, because that would not prove intention of doing an act of the defined kind (see R v CWW (1993) 32 NSWLR 348; (1993) 70 A Crim R 517 at 351.) What was thus necessary was proof of the appellant’s knowledge that what was being manufactured, was not only illegal, but that it was a prohibited drug. Given the express finding that the appellant did not have such knowledge, it followed that ground 2 had to be upheld.
	


The appellant’s case must fail


	
	The appellant accepted that ignorance that MDP2P appeared in Schedule 1 was no defence to this charge. Whether it was proven that he knew that the substance was MDP2P was in issue. That issue is raised by ground 3, his Honour having concluded that he was aware that the substance he knew to be a precursor, was MDP2P. The appellant also argued that the evidence was incapable of proving that he had the requisite intention.
	
	
	If the appellant’s ignorance that the substance manufactured was actually MDP2P is not a defence to a charge under s 24, as the appellant conceded, it is difficult to see why the appellant’s ignorance of the reason why the manufacture of the substance he knew to be illegal, namely because it is a prohibited drug under the Act, is also not a defence to a s 24 manufacture charge.
	
	
	Contrary to the case he advanced on appeal, the original agreement was not merely to make a precursor, but to do so knowing that its manufacture was illegal, intending that it be used for the production of another prohibited drug.
	
	
	The intention provided for in s 24 is not an intention to manufacture a substance which “was a drug, having the qualities of a drug”, as was argued at trial. The Act does not make the manufacture of substances which have “the qualities of a drug” illegal. Section 24 makes the manufacture of substances falling into the definition of a “prohibited drug” which appear in Schedule 1 to the Act, illegal.
	
	
	Some of those substances are also precursors, as defined in s 24A and s 24B. Manufacture of precursors is not illegal. It is rather possession of such precursors, with specified intent, which is made illegal by s 24A. Possession of traffickable quantities is made illegal by s 24B, subject to the defences there specified, which provide lawful excuse for their possession.
	
	
	The existence of the requisite intention in a statutory offence such as s 24 is a question of fact which, absent admission, must be decided as a matter of inference on the basis of the facts established by the evidence. His Honour found that while the appellant knew that the substance was MDP2P; that it was a precursor; and that its manufacture was illegal, he did not know that it was also a prohibited drug. In the circumstances, his knowledge was found to have been sufficient to establish the requisite intention for the s 24 offence. That conclusion has to be understood in the context of the statutory regime, which does not make manufacture of a precursor illegal.
	
	
	The circumstances which arose for consideration on the evidence included that the appellant was shown on the surveillance footage to have worked extensively in the drug laboratory which he and his two co-accused had established, participating in the manufacture of the three chemical substances the subject of the three offences of which he was convicted. Documents found there to which he had access described those processes.
	
	
	On his own evidence, so far as the MDP2P was concerned, he knew not only that it was a precursor, but also that its manufacture was illegal. That understanding was correct, not because what was being manufactured was a precursor. It was because the substance was a prohibited drug under the Act, which made its manufacture illegal under s 24. That was also why the manufacture of MDA was illegal.
	
	
	In Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 it was held at [36] that to establish a possession offence under s 24A “the prosecution was required to prove that the appellant attempted to possess a substance he knew or believed to be a precursor with the intention of it being used by another person to manufacture a prohibited drug.” In that case the appellant had also been charged with a s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), of attempt to obtain possession of a prohibited drug, for the purposes of supply. There it was observed at [39] that:
	


“... at least theoretically, the appellant could have been aware that the substance was a precursor but not a prohibited drug, perhaps because he was told it was not and believed that to be the case. It is true that this possibility would be highly unlikely where the drug was within both categories but nevertheless it does illustrate the different elements of the counts and, most critically, the different mental elements.”


	
	In this case, while the appellant knew that MDP2P was a precursor and did not know that it was a prohibited drug, he did know that its manufacture, like the manufacture of MDA, was illegal.
	
	
	In Kural v R [1987] HCA 16; (1987) 162 CLR 502 it was observed:
	


“3.    Where, as here, it is necessary to show an intention on the part of the accused to import a narcotic drug, that intent is established if the accused knew or was aware that an article which he intentionally brought into Australia comprised or contained narcotic drugs. But that is not to say that actual knowledge or awareness is an essential element in the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence. It is only to say that knowledge or awareness is relevant to the existence of the necessary intent. Belief, falling short of actual knowledge, that the article comprised or contained narcotic drugs would obviously sustain an inference of intention. So also would proof that the forbidden act was done in circumstances where it appears beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that his conduct involved that act and nevertheless persisted in that conduct. As a practical matter, the inference of mens rea or a guilty mind will ordinarily be irresistible in cases involving the importation of narcotic drugs if it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually imported the drugs and that he was aware, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, of the likelihood of the existence of the substance in question in what he was importing and of the likelihood that it was a narcotic drug. What we have said is designed to emphasize that the existence of the requisite intention is a question of fact and that in most cases the outcome will depend on an inference to be drawn from primary facts found by the tribunal of fact. In this, as in other areas of the law, it is important not to succumb to the temptation of transforming matters of fact into propositions of law. In that regard, we would emphasize that the foregoing comments are not designed as a direction or instruction to be read by trial judges to juries. They are intended to give guidance to trial judges in order to enable them to formulate such directions as may be appropriate to the facts and circumstances of particular cases.”


	
	In CWW Sheller JA discussed (at 524) the need for proof “of an intention of doing an act of the defined kind which constitutes the offence”. That depends on the nature of the act in question, in this case manufacture. In R v Lau (1998) 105 A Crim R 167, it was intention in a supply of prohibited drug offence, which arose for consideration. There it was concluded that intention to supply could be established by proof of actual knowledge that what was supplied was a prohibited drug, or by proof of actual knowledge of what was probable, that is, knowledge that there was a significant or real chance that what was supplied was drugs. In Regina v Ruiz-Avila [2003] NSWCCA 264; (2003) 142 A Crim R 459 knowledge or belief that the tablets in question contained the drug ecstasy, or a prohibited drug, was held to be sufficient for a supply offence.
	
	
	In this case the evidence established, as a matter of fact, that the appellant, knowing that the manufacture of the MDP2P was illegal, not only continued to manufacture that substance up to his arrest, intending that it be used to manufacture prohibited drugs, he actually used it to manufacture MDA, another prohibited drug. He did not know that MDP2P was itself a prohibited drug, but he did know that the manufacture of both MDP2P and MDA involved offences under the laws which regulate the manufacture of prohibited drugs. That his knowledge fell short of actual knowledge of the reason for the illegality of the manufacture of MDP2P, did not preclude the inference that thereby, he knowingly took part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	On his own evidence the appellant was told both that the MDP2P was a precursor and that its manufacture was illegal. He was not also told that the reason was because it was a prohibited drug. That left him in ignorance of an aspect of the law, but that did not result in him being incapable of forming the necessary intention for the offence with which he was charged.
	
	
	Contrary to the appellant’s case, what was decided in Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; (2004) 218 CLR 493 is relevant to a resolution of the issue lying between the parties. That case was concerned with a contravention of a regulation made under the Fish Resources Management Act 1994 (WA) which prohibited the holder of a commercial fishing licence from fishing for rock lobsters in an area defined in a table to the regulation. That offence did not require a particular intention to be formed, it was committed simply by being the holder of a commercial fishing licence; fishing for rock lobsters; and doing so in specified waters. What the respondent did not know in that case was that there was a regulation prohibiting his conduct. In the result he argued that he had not committed any offence.
	
	
	What was in issue turned on the operation of the rule that ignorance of the law does not afford an excuse, encapsulated in s 22 of the West Australian Criminal Code and on a defence provided by s 24, for a person who does an act under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of things, who is then not criminally responsible for the act to any greater extent than if the real state of things had been such as he believed to exist.
	
	
	It was concluded that the only mistake the respondent had made was a mistake that resulted from his ignorance of the law and that what his argument amounted to was that if he had not been ignorant of the law, he would not have done the acts which constituted the offence. In the result it was observed by Gleeson CJ and Kirby J at [13]:
	


“This is not a case that gives rise to the difficulties that are sometimes involved in distinguishing between mistakes of law and mistakes of fact, or in applying the common law, or ss 22 and 24, to what are sometimes described as mixed questions of fact and law. Here the mistake that was made, however it is characterised, was not relevant to any element of the offence charged. Rather, it was a mistake that resulted in ignorance of the existence of the prohibition contained in reg 34, that is to say, ignorance of the law.”


	
	Here, the appellant’s case at trial was that if he had known that the substance he manufactured was a prohibited drug, he would not have manufactured it. But on his own evidence the appellant made no mistake. He not only manufactured MDP2P, despite knowing that to be illegal, the evidence also established that he then used that substance to manufacture MDA, another substance the manufacture of which he knew to be illegal. It was not manufacture of precursors which was illegal under the Act, but manufacture of substances specified to be prohibited drugs by inclusion in Schedule 1 to the Act. Ignorance of that aspect of the law could not prevent him from forming the requisite intention in relation to either MDP2P or MDA. The proper inference was that he had the requisite intention in relation to both substances.
	
	
	Consistently with the approach in Zaburoni v The Queen [2016] HCA 12, (there in the context of the Queensland Criminal Code), the existence of the requisite intention could be inferred from the evidence of all that the appellant knew and did in relation to the manufacture of the MDP2P and the use to which it was intended to be and was actually put. As there discussed at [14] – [17]:
	


“14    Where proof of the intention to produce a particular result is made an element of liability for an offence under the Code, the prosecution is required to establish that the accused meant to produce that result by his or her conduct. As the respondent correctly submits, knowledge or foresight of result, whether possible, probable or certain, is not a substitute in law for proof of a specific intent under the Code. In the last-mentioned respect, the Code is distinguished from its Commonwealth counterpart, which allows that a person has intention with respect to a result if the person is aware that the result will occur in the ordinary course of events.

15    Where the accused is aware that, save for some supervening event, his or her conduct will certainly produce a particular result, the inference that the accused intended, by engaging in that conduct, to produce that particular result is compelling. Nonetheless, foresight that conduct will produce a particular result as a “virtual certainty” is of evidential significance and under the Code it remains that the trier of fact must be satisfied that the accused meant to produce the particular result.

16    It is necessary to say something in this context about the concepts of purpose, desire and motive. Discussions of proof of intention sometimes equate desire with motive. The respondent’s submissions treat motive and purpose as synonyms. This is in aid of the submission that motive is irrelevant to criminal responsibility under the Code.

17    In ordinary parlance, purpose, desire and motive may be used interchangeably. However, in law motive describes the reason that prompts the formation of the accused’s intention. The accused may fire a pistol at his business partner. His intention or purpose in pulling the trigger may be to kill. His motive for forming that intention may be to avoid repaying a debt he owes to his partner. Where liability for an offence requires proof of the intention to produce a particular result, the prosecution must establish that the accused had that result as his or her purpose or object at the time of engaging in the conduct. Purpose here is not to be equated with motive.” (footnotes omitted)


	
	Here, on his own evidence, the result which the appellant not only intended, but actually achieved, was the manufacture of two substances which he knew to be illegal under the legislative scheme. That he did not know that the actual reason why the manufacture of one of them, MDP2P, was illegal, namely, because it was a substance falling into the definition of “prohibited drug” in the Act, as did the third substance manufactured, MDA, did not preclude the inference that he had formed the requisite intention for the offence involving the manufacture of MDP2P.
	
	
	The appellant’s approach to the mental element specified in s 24 in fact requires proof of actual knowledge of the reason why the manufacture of a substance understood to be illegal, was illegal at law. Such ignorance of the law is no defence. Such actual knowledge, namely that the substance being manufactured is a “prohibited drug” as defined under the Act, should it exist, would unarguably establish the requisite intention. That, however, is not the only way that such intention can be proven. The evidence earlier discussed was capable of proving that the appellant had the requisite intention, as his Honour correctly found.
	
	
	Further, as I will explain, the evidence also permitted his Honour to conclude that the appellant knew that the substance was MDP2P. That, alone, the appellant conceded was a basis on which a finding as to intention could rest.
	
	
	It follows that his Honour did not err in his conclusion that the mental element of the s 24 offence was established on the evidence.
	


Ground 1


	
	The appellant conceded that if Ground 2 did not succeed that this ground must also fail. It is accordingly unnecessary to consider it further.
	


Ground 3


	
	On sentence, the obligation to give reasons discussed in Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250 as [28] is to expose the findings of fact required by s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and the principles of law applied, together with the reasons which link them, to justify the conclusions reached, including as to the ultimate verdict.
	
	
	I consider that his Honour met that obligation. He found on the agreed facts that the purpose of the original agreement was to manufacture the ketone the subject of count 1, noting that was also the evidence of both of Mr Bemand and the appellant. He outlined the arguments advanced for the appellant as to why it would be concluded that the Crown had not established that he knew that the ketone was MDP2P. That depended on acceptance of the appellant’s evidence that he did not have such knowledge. His Honour preferred Mr Bemand’s evidence, which he found to have been truthful and essentially accurate, supported as it was by the other evidence on which the Crown relied.
	
	
	I have earlier outlined relevant aspects of the appellant’s evidence. The appellant denied knowing that the precursor was MDP2P, said that its manufacture continued until 9 December, but denied knowing that from 4 December, he was also involved in the manufacture of MDA. He also denied knowing what was involved in the manufacture of MDA from MDP2P from 21 November, or that he had participated in any agreement to its manufacture. This evidence was challenged, but it is not necessary to further detail the answers which he gave.
	
	
	His Honour found the appellant’s evidence to have been implausible in a number of respects, the first being that he did not realise from the time of his initial conversation with Mr Bemand, that the ketone was to be made with the objective of someone making a prohibited drug and that he made no enquiry about what it could be used for.
	
	
	His Honour rejected various other aspects of the appellant’s evidence, for reasons which he explained, including that the appellant equated the ketone only to the epoxide. In the result he found beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware both of the fundamental steps involved in making the ketone and that it was MDP2P. On that basis, his Honour found the following facts to be established beyond reasonable doubt:
	


“(1) The accused was approached by Bemand in the latter part of 2007. He agreed to the factory being used to make precursors including the ketone precursor re count 1. (2) He permitted the factory to be used to manufacture ketone precursor believing the manufacture to be illegal and prohibited by law. I accept that he was not aware that the ketone was scheduled as a prohibitive drug and in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.

(3) The third finding beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused was aware of the general steps involved in making the ketone. He did not believe that an epoxide was the ketone that was to be sold. He was aware of the required step that involved in converting the Isosafrole epoxide into a ketone, indeed, MDP2P. I accept beyond reasonable doubt Bemand’s evidence that he did discuss that phase with the accused.

(4) I find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was, as well as permitting in the factory to be used illegally to manufacture the ketone MDP2P he was physically involved in some of the steps in the manufacture of the ketone and he well knew he was assisting in the illegal manufacture of the ketone MDP2P. The accused also knew of the approximate quantity to be manufactured.”


	
	Mr Bemand’s evidence, when considered with the appellant’s admissions in relation to what he had agreed with Mr Bemand and what he had done in pursuit of their agreement; the documents he had had access to in the laboratory and at home; the nature of his ongoing involvement in the manufacture; and his knowledge that what was being manufactured was illegal, I consider provided a proper basis for his Honour’s conclusion as to his knowledge that it was MDP2P which was being manufactured. That was an issue of fact the resolution of which was also adequately explained by the reasons which his Honour gave.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal must be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I would make are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

		23 June 2016",2016-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769764,R v Turnbull (No. 25) [2016] NSWSC 831,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: During the course of the trial, I made a number of rulings where I indicated that my reasons for those rulings would follow at a later time.
	
	
	These rulings were:
	



	
	a decision on 11 May 2016 to admit recordings of certain telephone conversations involving the Accused whilst in custody, and declining to admit other recordings;
	
	
	a decision on 11 May 2016 permitting the Crown to call Dr Adam Martin, forensic psychiatrist, in reply with respect to the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind;
	
	
	a decision on 23 May 2016 not to leave the partial defence of extreme provocation to the jury.
	



	
	What follows constitutes my reasons for making these rulings during the course of the trial.
	


Admission and Rejection of Certain Recordings of Telephone Conversations Involving the Accused Whilst in Custody


	
	The Crown sought to tender extracts from a number of telephone calls between the Accused and other persons, which took place whilst the Accused was held in custody after bail was refused (MFI50). The conversations in question took place between 3 September 2014 and 2 April 2015. Ultimately, the Crown tendered extracts from some 23 telephone calls.
	
	
	Following submissions made on 11 May 2016, I made a ruling in the following terms (T718):
	


“I propose to allow the Crown to adduce evidence of the following calls: 

Call 1, a call on 3 September 2014, pages 1 and 2 of MFI 50. 

Call 5, a call on 15 September 2014, pages 23 to 25 of MFI 50. 

Call 8, a call on 9 October 2014, pages 35 and 36 of MFI 50. 

And call 10, a call on 14 October 2014, page 43 of MFI 50. 

I do not propose to allow the Crown to adduce evidence of all the remaining calls, and I note that call 21 was not pressed.” 


	
	To assist the parties, I provided a brief outline of my reasons for this ruling (T718-719).
	
	
	This judgment contains my detailed reasons for the ruling made that day.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the conversations contained in the recordings were relevant to issues in the trial, as they bore upon motive or the presence or absence of any underlying condition for the purpose of the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind under s.23A Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that it was not using the term “motive” in its ordinary sense, where the presence or absence of motive may bear upon the question of whether an accused person in fact killed the deceased and, if so, whether he or she did so with the requisite intention for murder: De Gruchy v The Queen [2002] HCA 33; 211 CLR 85 at 92-93 [28]-[30].
	
	
	In the present case, there is no issue that the Accused shot Glendon Turner several times, over a period on the late afternoon of 29 July 2014. Nor does there appear to be any issue, in light of the evidence of Mr Robert Strange, that the Accused intended to kill Mr Turner.
	
	
	The term “motive” as used by the Crown should be understood as a contention that the Accused acted in a manner which involved a generalised strong dislike of the Office of Environment and Heritage (“OEH”) and its officers, with that approach not being confined to Mr Turner only.
	
	
	The Crown submission with respect to the existence of an underlying condition is to be understood by reference to a supplementary report dated 9 May 2016 of Dr Adam Martin, the forensic psychiatrist retained by the Crown (MFI49).
	
	
	Dr Martin had been provided with some 100 extracts from telephone calls between the Accused and others whilst the Accused was in custody. In his supplementary report, Dr Martin referred to three conversations, but expressed a more general view that the content and manner of conversations were not consistent with a serious enduring mental illness or disorder on the part of the Accused. Dr Martin expressed the opinion that the recordings were not consistent with the hypothesis that the Accused was experiencing a significant enduring mental disorder, such as major depression or dementing illness prior to the alleged murder. He expressed the opinion that the recordings were evidence of a reasonably healthy mental state post-arrest, which shed significant doubt as to whether the Accused was experiencing a serious mental disorder prior to his arrest.
	
	
	A further submission advanced for the Crown was that there was material in two conversations (Calls 12 and 14) that raised the question as to whether the Accused had been frank in his dealings with health professionals, who had undertaken tests with respect to him whilst in custody.
	


Submissions for the Accused


	
	Objection was taken on behalf of the Accused to the tender of all 23 transcripts and recordings. The transcript of submissions on this topic sets out, in some detail, the submissions which were made by the parties (T685-718). The submissions for the Accused may be expressed shortly.
	
	
	Firstly, it was submitted that the Court should refuse to admit this material under s.146(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986, as the Crown had failed to disclose the evidence in accordance with the requirements for pretrial disclosure. Although it was acknowledged that a disk containing extracts from some 100 calls (including the tendered 23 calls) had been served some months before the trial, it was submitted that the bases upon which these calls were to be tendered was only communicated a few days prior to 11 May 2016, with the supplementary report of Dr Martin of 9 May 2016 being served late on 9 May 2016. In these circumstances, it was submitted that the material should not be admitted because of the failure of the Crown to comply with the threshold requirement for pretrial disclosure.
	
	
	Secondly, it was submitted that to admit any or all of these calls would involve consequential problems given that the Crown seeks to tender extracts from conversations only, and not the full conversations. Further, it was submitted that if any of these calls were to be admitted, the defence would need to consider whether other calls from the pool of 100 calls should also be played to assist an understanding of the admitted calls in context. With this whole exercise being undertaken for the first time well into the trial, and shortly before the Crown case was to close, it was submitted that there were strong discretionary factors supporting s.146 exclusion or, alternatively, exclusion under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Thirdly, even if the Court was satisfied that any conversation was relevant to an issue in the trial, it was submitted that the Court should refuse to admit the evidence, upon the basis that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be misleading or confusing under s.135(b) Evidence Act 1995. Alternatively, it was submitted that the Court should refuse to admit the evidence upon the basis that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused under s.137 Evidence Act 1995, given the selective approach taken to the material and, in particular, the difficulty of attempting to identify with precision the conversations upon which Dr Martin had expressed a general opinion.
	
	
	Fourthly, it was submitted that the content of some conversations included the discussion of legal advice provided to the Accused and members of his family, so as to give rise to an issue concerning client legal privilege.
	


Decision


	
	In determining to admit the four conversations and to not admit others, I had regard to the following considerations and conclusions.
	
	
	Firstly, the Crown was not assisted by the way in which this material was served upon the defence and, importantly, the very late identification of its suggested relevance and reliance upon a report of Dr Martin dated 9 May 2016. Although I was not satisfied that the Crown should be shut out from adducing evidence at all in this area, it seemed to me that the legal representatives for the Accused had practical restrictions operating upon them where the Crown had selected parts of 100 calls (initially) which had been provided to Dr Martin, and had then narrowed the number to 23 calls. This course was unsatisfactory, but was not determinative of the outcome of the Crown tender.
	
	
	Secondly, I was satisfied that the four calls which were admitted were directly relevant to a fact in issue in the trial. In each of the four calls made on 3 September 2014, 15 September 2014, 9 October 2014 and 14 October 2014, the Accused makes strong critical comments about the OEH and its officers, with this evidence capable of being relied upon as indicating a strong dislike by the Accused of that agency and its officers including the deceased, Mr Turner, and Dr Christopher Nadolny, an ecologist. These calls shed light upon the state of mind of the Accused on 29 July 2014, and also at the time of the calls in September and October 2014.
	
	
	To the extent that it was submitted for the Accused that parts of conversations involved disclosure by the Accused or others of legal advice that had apparently been given with respect to proceedings under the Native Vegetation Act 2003 before the Land and Environment Court, I accept the Crown submission that the fact that the Accused was discussing these topics with others, and in telephone calls which he knew were being monitored by other persons, gave rise to waiver of any client legal privilege which may have otherwise existed. In reaching this conclusion, I have made no positive finding that client legal privilege was established. I proceed upon the basis that, even if it had been, waiver is demonstrated.
	
	
	With respect to the two conversations relied upon by the Crown as to possible misleading of health professionals (Calls 12 and 14), I took the view that certain jocular exchanges between the Accused and his wife did not support the construction advanced by the Crown. Even if this material had been relevant, which I consider to be highly doubtful, it was appropriate in any event to exclude it under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	As to the generalised opinion of Dr Martin by reference to a number of calls, I did not consider that the content of the excluded conversations rose above a level of general family discussions concerning property issues and other practical matters, in the context of the Accused being in custody. Even if these conversations had been relevant to, in some way, indicate the absence of features of a major psychiatric condition in the Accused at the time of the conversations, there was a significant risk that the evidence might be misleading or confusing, or cause or result in undue waste of time, so as to warrant exclusion under s.135 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	A particular difficulty encountered by the Crown was that Dr Martin’s opinion (contained in the supplementary report) made very limited reference to specific conversations, in circumstances where the Crown wished to rely upon a significant number of conversations for this purpose.
	
	
	It was for these reasons that I determined to admit recordings of four conversations which became Exhibit AJ (recordings) and Exhibit AK (transcripts) at the trial, and to not admit the balance of the conversations in MFI50.
	


Ruling Allowing Crown to Call Dr Adam Martin in Reply


	
	Following submissions made on 11 May 2016, I expressed my satisfaction that the Crown should be permitted to call Dr Adam Martin after evidence was given on behalf of the Accused, to support the contention of substantial mental impairment in his case (T724).
	
	
	What follows constitutes my reasons for this ruling.
	
	
	In advance of the trial, the Accused had given notice, for the purpose of s.151 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, of his intention to adduce evidence of substantial mental impairment from Dr Olav Nielssen and Professor David Greenberg, for the purposes of s.23A Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Section 151(3) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides:
	


“(3)    Any evidence tendered to disprove a contention of substantial mental impairment may, subject to any direction of the court, be given before or after evidence is given to prove that contention.”


	
	Section 23A(7) Crimes Act 1900 relevantly provides:
	


“(7)    If, on the trial of a person for murder, the person contends:

(a)    …, or

(b)    that the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section,

evidence may be offered by the prosecution tending to prove the other of those contentions, and the Court may give directions as to the stage of the proceedings at which that evidence may be offered.”


	
	The Crown submitted that it should be allowed to call Dr Martin in reply. Senior counsel for the Accused submitted that the Crown should be required to call Dr Martin in the Crown case in chief.
	
	
	As s.23A(4) Crimes Act 1900 makes clear, the onus is on the accused person to prove that he or she is not liable to conviction for murder, but ought be convicted of manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. The existence of this legal onus (to the civil standard of proof) upon the Accused no doubt explains ss.151(3) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and 23A(7) Crimes Act 1900, which bear upon the requirement otherwise existing that the Crown should not split its case.
	
	
	In R v Fraser [2003] NSWSC 965, Howie J said at [19]-[21]:
	


“19    But whatever may have been the situation at common law, it seems clear to me that the principle has been affected by s 151(3). I can see no reason why that section should be construed other than in accordance with its terms and unaffected by any common law rule that it may have displaced. 

20    On its face s 151(3) provides the Crown generally with a discretion as to whether to call evidence to rebut the defence under section 23A either in its case-in-chief or in reply. However, in an appropriate case the trial judge may be required to intervene and give a direction as to when that evidence should be called. This will usually be necessary because it would be unfair to the accused if the evidence were to be adduced in reply. The need for that direction might arise, for example, because the evidence relied on by the Crown is part of the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and, therefore, would more appropriately be adduced in the Crown case. Another example may be where the evidence has a prejudicial effect that might operate unfairly against the accused if it were the last evidence to be heard by the jury. Yet another example may be where, although the evidence is tendered to rebut the defence, it is also relevant to either establish or disprove an element in the Crown case, such as an intention to kill. 

21    But where the evidence is expert opinion given by a professional such as a psychiatrist or medical practitioner, and is relevant only because the defence intends to rely upon s 23A, I find it difficult to see how the intervention of the Court to interfere with the discretion vested in the Crown by s 151(3) could usually be justified let alone warranted.”


	
	In R v Fraser, Howie J noted at [25] that it should be borne in mind that s.151(3) is permissive, in that it relieves the Crown of the restriction placed upon it by the common law, and that the onus is upon the defence to show why the Crown should be subject to an order preventing it from calling the evidence in reply. See also R v Kaewklom (No. 1) [2012] NSWSC 1103 at [35]-[36].
	
	
	Howie J observed in R v Fraser at [27]:
	


“I do not believe that the accused is treated unfairly just because the Crown’s evidence on the issue of substantial impairment may be the last evidence adduced before the jury. It should be noted, of course, that in this State the accused has the right of last address to the jury.”


	
	Finally, Howie J stated in R v Fraser at [29]:
	


“It will not be the case that a direction should be made under s 151(3) just because there has been evidence adduced in the Crown case that touches upon the issue raised by the defence. Section 151(3) is concerned with evidence that is “tendered to disprove the contention of substantial impairment” and not evidence that happens to disprove the contention but is not tendered for that purpose.”


	
	The parties in the present trial invited the Court to apply the principles expressed in R v Fraser in determining the present application. I gratefully adopt the analysis of Howie J in R v Fraser for that purpose.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that questions asked by the Crown of a number of Crown witnesses should be taken by the Court to have been relied upon to disprove the contention of substantial impairment, so that the Crown should be required to call Dr Martin as a witness in its case in chief. Reference was made to questions asked of a number of lay witnesses concerning their observations of the Accused in the weeks leading up to 29 July 2014, as set out in a schedule provided to the Court (MFI58).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that questions asked of these witnesses did not provide a foundation for the Court to decline to allow the Crown to call Dr Martin in reply.
	
	
	I have considered the defence submission made by reference to a limited number of questions asked of Crown witnesses concerning the conduct or demeanour of the Accused. I am not persuaded that the Crown has adduced evidence to disprove the contention of substantial impairment, so as to warrant the Court requiring the Crown to call Dr Martin in its case in chief: R v Fraser at [29] (see [38] above).
	
	
	The defence case with respect to substantial impairment will be articulated fully through the evidence of Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg. The Accused proposes to call expert evidence from forensic psychiatrists which is relevant only because the Accused intends to rely upon s.23A Crimes Act 1900: R v Fraser at [21] (see [35] above). It is appropriate, in the circumstances of this case, that the Crown be in a position to call Dr Martin in reply, so that his detailed evidence may be given against the background of the evidence adduced on behalf of the Accused from Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg.
	
	
	As Howie J observed in R v Fraser at [27] (see [37] above), the Accused is not treated unfairly just because the Crown’s evidence on the issue of substantial impairment may be the last evidence adduced before the jury. As his Honour noted, the Accused has the right of last address to the jury in this State.
	
	
	For these reasons, I was satisfied that the appropriate course in this trial was to permit the Crown to call evidence from Dr Martin in reply.
	


Decision that Extreme Provocation Should Not be Left to the Jury


	
	After all evidence had been adduced, and before closing addresses, senior counsel for the Accused made an application on 23 May 2016 that I leave the partial defence of extreme provocation to the jury. Submissions were made on this issue (T1297-1312) together with written submissions on behalf of the Accused (MFI85) and the Crown (MFI86).
	
	
	Following those submissions on 23 May 2016, I announced my decision declining to leave extreme provocation to the jury, with reasons to be published at a later time for this conclusion (T1313).
	
	
	What follows constitutes my reasons for this ruling.
	
	
	The extreme provocation issue had been raised and was the subject of a pretrial ruling given on 15 April 2016: R v Turnbull (No. 5) [2016] NSWSC 439. The Accused sought leave to appeal under s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to that decision. On 19 April 2016, the Court of Criminal Appeal refused leave to appeal upon the basis that the appeal was incompetent. The Court of Criminal Appeal gave reasons for that decision on 10 June 2016: Turnbull v R [2016] NSWCCA 109.
	
	
	In R v Turnbull (No. 5), I expressed the following conclusions (at [117]-[118]):
	


“117   The conclusions which I have reached in this judgment are that:

(a)   the conduct of Mr Turner relied upon by the Accused and as identified in this judgment is not capable of constituting a serious indictable offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 for the purpose of s.23(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900;

(b)   the application of the Accused to rely upon tendency evidence is declined.

118   As there is a possibility (perhaps theoretical) that the Accused will adduce evidence which is capable of raising the partial defence of extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900 within the confines of this judgment, I cannot determine finally that such a partial defence should not be left to the jury. That said, I have had regard to all material before the Court at this pretrial hearing and, upon the construction of s.23 which I have adopted, it may be difficult to conceive a basis upon which this partial defence could be left to the jury.”


	
	The four elements required to raise extreme provocation are contained in s.23(2) Crimes Act 1900 which provides:
	


“(2)    An act is done in response to extreme provocation if and only if:

(a)    the act of the accused that causes death was in response to conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused, and

(b)    the conduct of the deceased was a serious indictable offence, and

(c)    the conduct of the deceased caused the accused to lose self-control, and

(d)    the conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.”

Submissions of the Accused


	
	The Accused contended that the partial defence of extreme provocation arose from the evidence of the following circumstances:
	



	
	the Accused lost control and shot Mr Turner in response to Mr Turner’s conduct, including his presence on Talga Lane on 29 July 2014 undertaking surveillance activities of “Colorado” without prior notice;
	
	
	Mr Turner’s conduct from at least 21 August 2012 to 29 July 2014 amounted to a serious indictable offence, namely harassment pursuant to s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007;
	
	
	the conduct of Mr Turner could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Turner.
	



	
	Submissions were developed on behalf of the Accused in support of each of the four elements under s.23(2)(a)-(d) Crimes Act 1900. It was submitted that sufficient evidence had been raised so that the partial defence of extreme provocation should be left to the jury.
	
	
	I will not repeat here the detailed submissions in support of the Accused which were contained in MFI85. I will refer to parts of those submissions when expressing my conclusion.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown addressed first the requirement that the conduct of the deceased be a serious indictable offence: s.23(2)(b). It was submitted that the Accused had failed to adduce evidence in support of the offence of stalking or intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm contrary to s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.
	
	
	The Crown submitted further that the Accused had failed to adduce evidence so as to raise for the jury’s consideration the further requirements that the conduct of the deceased caused the Accused to lose self-control (s.23(2)(c)) and that the conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased (s.23(2)(d)).
	
	
	Once again, I will not repeat the submissions made for the Crown in MFI86.
	


The Applicable Test


	
	In support of the application that the partial defence of extreme provocation be left to the jury, the Accused bears an evidentiary onus to point to evidence from which it could be inferred that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the homicidal act of the Accused was provoked in accordance with the four elements contained in s.23 Crimes Act 1900: R v Youssef (1990) 50 A Crim R 1 at 3. I accept that caution must be exercised before declining to leave extreme provocation to the jury: Lindsay v The Queen [2015] HCA 16; 255 CLR 272 at 284 [27].
	


Decision on s.23(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900


	
	I will commence with the requirement that the conduct of the deceased was a serious indictable offence: s.23(2)(b). This aspect was the principal focus of attention in the pretrial judgment: R v Turnbull (No. 5). Once again, argument focused on this aspect in submissions made at the close of the evidence.
	
	
	I have regard to features of the offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 which were set out in R v Turnbull (No. 5) at [13]-[16]. They need not be reproduced again in this judgment.
	
	
	The Accused’s written submissions outlined the material upon which it was submitted that the serious indictable offence element of extreme provocation had been raised in this case.
	
	
	Reference was made to evidence from the Accused that, on 23 April 2012, at a meeting on “Colorado”, he heard Mr Turner say to Grant Turnbull, “I have a strong dislike for your son Roger and I’m starting to get a strong dislike for you” (T877). The Accused said that Mr Turner appeared to be angry and agitated at this time (T878). Reliance was placed, as well, upon evidence of a conversation on 21 August 2012 between Mr Turner and Anna Simmons, in the presence of Gary Spencer. According to Mr Spencer, in the course of the conversation, Mr Turner said, “The Turnbulls have been clearing the property, contrary to the Native Vegetation Act. We’re going to get them for that. It is clear that they are doing this for money” (T1069).
	
	
	Ms Simmons said that Mr Turner told her that “He was out to get the Turnbulls” (T1084). Ms Simmons was asked by the Crown in cross-examination (T1101):
	


“Q. I want to suggest to you that the next thing that was said was Mr Turner said, ‘The Turnbulls have been clearing contrary to the Native Vegetation Act, and we are going to get them for that’? 

A. I'm not sure if they're the exact words, but in that nature.”


	
	Accordingly, the account given by Mr Spencer, which formed the basis for the question put to Ms Simmons, may be used for present purposes.
	
	
	Apart from these conversations, the Accused sought to rely, as well, upon events between November 2012 and 29 July 2014 as summarised in paragraph 26 of the written submission (MFI85). These events may be briefly summarised as follows:
	



	
	the issue of remedial directions and notices to produce information, with that process being issued under the Native Vegetation Act 2003;
	
	
	inspections from public streets, including the taking of photographs, of parts of “Colorado” and “Strathdoon”;
	
	
	the use of surveillance flights on two occasions for the purpose of aerial photography of the properties;
	
	
	entry onto the properties by Mr Turner pursuant to authority under the Native Vegetation Act 2003;
	
	
	the issue of Summonses commencing criminal proceedings in the Land and Environment Court against the Accused, with those Summonses being filed in that Court on 13 December 2012 and 25 June 2014;
	
	
	discussion with an employee of the Accused (Ivan Maas) in November 2012 for the purpose of Mr Turner seeking information from him about clearing activities being undertaken on the properties.
	



	
	It was submitted for the Accused that Mr Turner’s “persistent contact” (as described in paragraph 26 of MFI85) “with the accused and his family and their properties may properly be described as harassment”. It was submitted that an inference is available that the contact was carried out with hostile intent to “get the Turnbulls”, so that it may be said that it was carried out with the intention of causing the Accused to fear mental harm to himself or a family member, or at least in the knowledge that it was likely to cause such harm.
	
	
	I do not accept the submission of the Accused in this respect. A number of observations may be made with respect to the events relied upon by the Accused in support of the second element of extreme provocation.
	
	
	Firstly, it is not contended that Mr Turner acted contrary to the Native Vegetation Act 2003. Indeed, various steps which are said to have been taken, involved the issue of process or other statutory action under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. The Summonses commencing two separate prosecutions were brought alleging offences under the Native Vegetation Act 2003, and were filed in accordance with appropriate procedures for the Land and Environment Court.
	
	
	Secondly, the inspections by Mr Turner, about which complaint is made, were made either from public places (where authority and advance notice were not required) or in accordance with authority granted under the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	Thirdly, the use of surveillance flights, on the evidence at the trial, was a method of investigation used where unlawful clearing of native vegetation was alleged. It was, and remains, an understandable form of investigation given the need to acquire reliable objective evidence of the state of properties under scrutiny at different times. The same observation may be made with respect to observations of properties from ground level, including the taking of photographs and GPS waypoints to obtain an objective record of events on the properties at particular locations and at different times.
	
	
	Fourthly, it was to be expected that activities on “Strathdoon” and “Colorado” would come under close scrutiny from late 2011 to July 2014, given the acquisition of the properties by the Accused’s family with the stated purpose of converting the two properties from grazing land to broadacre farms, a process which would involve substantial land clearing. As the evidence at the trial indicated, these activities attracted the attention and concern, not only of the OEH and Mr Turner, but Mr Fisher of the Commonwealth Department of the Environment: R v Turnbull (No. 11) [2016] NSWSC 783.
	
	
	Fifthly, the conversations on 23 April 2012 and 21 August 2012, upon which the Accused relies, took place at times when Mr Turner was exercising his functions under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. That, after all, was the very reason why Mr Turner came into contact with the Accused and his family in the first place. It was the ongoing activities of the Accused and his family with respect to the properties and land clearing which attracted the ongoing, regular and understandable attention of the OEH.
	
	
	Taking the comments made at their highest, Mr Turner is said to have expressed dislike for Roger Turnbull and other members of the Turnbull family. I do not see that this event raises for consideration an offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence Act) 2007. The conversation with Ms Simmons, in the presence of Mr Spencer, on 21 August 2012 involves a statement by Mr Turner that he proposed to act against the Accused for breaches of the Native Vegetation Act 2003. That is precisely what happened, when proceedings were commenced in the Land and Environment Court on 13 December 2012 for an offence by the Accused against s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003 which had been committed between 1 November 2011 and 18 January 2012. In due course, the Accused pleaded guilty to this offence.
	
	
	Where the conduct sought to be relied upon as an offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 is that of a public officer exercising compliance or enforcement functions for the purpose of the Native Vegetation Act 2003, I consider that conduct is only capable of constituting a s.13 offence if it falls completely outside the lawful exercise of the public officer’s functions.
	
	
	In R v Turnbull (No. 5), I observed at [77]:
	


“It is not sufficient to raise potential s.13 liability that the officer may have been rude, abrupt, perhaps even overzealous in the performance of functions in the course of employment. The issue under consideration here is not one of best practice, but whether conduct may constitute a serious criminal offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007”


	
	Soon after, I said at [81]-[82]:
	


“81   It may be the case that a person who is being spoken to about possible breaches of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (let alone being prosecuted for such alleged conduct), may feel harassed or under pressure or will experience other negative feelings towards the officer whose task it is to ensure compliance with these laws. 

82   The material before the Court contains a number of examples of the person complaining about what happened to them, expressing conclusions or opinions that he or she felt harassed or threatened by the conduct. The expression of opinions or conclusions to this effect does not raise s.13. As I have said, it may be expected that the exercise of functions of a compliance officer (which may involve prosecution or other remedial action requirements), may upset persons and render them apprehensive as to what may happen. An explanation by the officer that penal consequences may result could likewise lead to concerns, stress or apprehension of adverse consequences. In my view, however, that is a long way from a viable basis upon which s.23(2)(b) could be raised by reference to a stalking or harassment offence under s.13.”


	
	I adhere to the views expressed in these parts of R v Turnbull (No. 5).
	
	
	I accept the Crown submission that there is no evidence of any conduct by Mr Turner, whether personally or as an officer of the OEH, that could be characterised as either stalking or harassment. Acts of Mr Turner in carrying out his lawful duties, even if they had the effect of making the Accused feel harassed in some way, or believe that he was being harassed in some way, could not constitute acts of stalking or harassment under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.
	
	
	The Accused has failed to discharge the evidentiary onus by pointing to evidence from which it could be inferred that there is at least a reasonable possibility that Mr Turner committed a serious indictable offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. I accept the Crown submission that the Accused has failed with respect to both the physical and mental elements of that offence.
	
	
	At the conclusion of R v Turnbull (No. 5) (see [50] above), I observed that the final and conclusive resolution of the question whether the partial defence of extreme provocation should be left to the jury, could only be made at the close of the evidence in the trial. That point has now been reached. I express my conclusion that the Accused has fallen far short of discharging the evidentiary onus in support of the second element of extreme provocation, so as to warrant that partial defence being left to the jury.
	


Other Aspects of s.23 Crimes Act 1900


	
	It is, of course, for the Accused to discharge the evidentiary onus with respect to each of the four elements under s.23(2) Crimes Act 1900. Where the Accused has failed with respect to one of the four elements, that is fatal to the application to have extreme provocation left to the jury.
	
	
	However, as I expressed some comments with respect to other elements of the partial defence in R v Turnbull (No. 5), and further submissions were made on those topics at the close of the evidence, I will say something briefly about them. Of course, the following comments are by way of obiter dicta only in the context of these proceedings.
	
	
	In R v Turnbull (No. 5), I made some observations (at [94]) concerning the construction of the words “towards or affecting the Accused” in s.23(2)(a) of the Act. I expressed the view that “If Mr Turner was investigating other persons (such as relatives or friends of the Accused), the fact that the Accused may be upset or irritated by that action is not such as could fall within s.23(2)(a) of the Act”.
	
	
	Upon further consideration, I accept that this comment probably places too narrow a construction on the words which form part of the first element of extreme provocation. It may be, in a particular case, that the act of an accused person which causes the death, may be in response to the conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused person directly or indirectly. That issue may await determination in a case where it is necessary to decide the question.
	
	
	With respect to the third element in s.23(2)(c) (that the conduct of the deceased caused the Accused to lose self-control), the Crown submitted that, if this point had been reached, the Court should rule that the Accused had not discharged the evidentiary onus on this aspect as well. It was submitted for the Accused that the evidentiary onus had been discharged on this aspect because of the Accused’s evidence that when he saw the OEH vehicle on Talga Lane on the afternoon of 29 July 2014, “something snapped” (T888) before he took out his rifle in contemplation that he would shoot Mr Turner. Reliance was placed upon statements to a similar effect to the Accused’s wife and to Dr Nielssen, and upon Dr Nielssen’s opinion with respect to a loss of self-control, for the purpose of substantial impairment under s.23A Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	There is considerable force in the Crown submission that the Accused had not discharged the evidentiary onus on the third element of extreme provocation in this case. The protracted nature of the events on Talga Lane on 29 July 2014, and the actions of the Accused, do not assist him in an assertion of loss of self-control for the purpose of s.23(2)(c) of the Act. However, it is not necessary to proceed further with consideration of this element of extreme provocation, for the purpose of the present ruling.
	
	
	With respect to the fourth element of extreme provocation, the “ordinary person” test contained in s.23(2)(d) of the Act, I expressed certain obiter views in R v Turnbull (No. 5) at [89]-[93].
	
	
	It is clear that the removal of the words “in the position of the accused”, as part of the 2014 amendments to s.23, operate to narrow significantly the “ordinary person” test for the purpose of extreme provocation.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused made submissions concerning the “ordinary person” test, by reference to statements made by the High Court of Australia in Stingel v The Queen [1990] HCA 61; 171 CLR 312 and Masciantonio v The Queen [1995] HCA 67; 183 CLR 58. In considering these authorities, it is necessary to keep in mind the terms of the 2014 legislative changes, and the purpose or object of those changes as disclosed in the second reading speech: R v Turnbull (No. 5) at [55]-[66].
	
	
	The attributes of the Accused, which could be taken into account in the past by operation of the words “in the position of the accused”, should now be placed to one side. What remains for consideration is whether the “ordinary person” test should take into account the age (in the sense of immaturity) of an accused person as being an attribute of the ordinary person: Masciantonio v The Queen at 66-67. There is force in the view that this aspect remains as part of the “ordinary person” test. This concept was not dependent upon the words “in the position of the accused”, which were removed by the 2014 amendments. Of course, age (in the sense of immaturity) would not have assisted the elderly Accused in this case.
	
	
	However, the proper construction of this part of s.23 should await a case where the matter is fully argued and requires determination. It is sufficient to observe that, even on the most generous construction to the Accused of the “ordinary person” test contained in the fourth element of s.23(2)(d), he would experience significant difficulty in discharging the evidentiary onus in this case, so as to allow extreme provocation to be left to the jury.
	


Conclusion


	
	It was for the reasons expressed in this judgment that I made the rulings on the topics set out at [2] of this judgment.

		23 June 2016",2016-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769765,Barber v R; Zraika v R [2016] NSWCCA 125,"Judgment


	
	JUDGMENT of THE COURT delivered by BASTEN JA: The applicants for leave to appeal are two of four accused put on trial together for offences arising out of the death of Raymond Pasnin in Pendle Hill in October 2013. There was no dispute that one of the accused (Daniel Haile) shot the victim. He claimed that he acted in self-defence, but the jury convicted him of murder.
	
	
	A second offender and former girlfriend of the victim, Louise Spiteri-Ahern, was charged with the murder and, in the alternative, with soliciting Haile to murder the victim. The jury was unable to agree in relation to Ms Spiteri-Ahern.
	
	
	Shortly after 3pm on Thursday, 9 June 2016, the jury having advised that they were unable to reach a verdict, the trial judge, R S Hulme AJ, discharged them both with respect to the charges against Ms Spiteri-Ahern and with respect to the present applicants. The applicants, who thereby lost an opportunity for an acquittal following a lengthy trial, sought leave to appeal the decision to discharge the jury with respect to them.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant April Barber applied to the trial judge for a stay of his order discharging the jury: that application was refused. The following morning, Friday, 10 June 2016, there was an application to this Court for a stay. Although the jury had already been discharged, and over the objection of counsel for the prosecution, this Court ordered a stay and gave directions to the Sheriff to advise the jurors that the order discharging them was the subject of an appeal, that this Court had stayed the order, that the appeal would be heard on Tuesday, 14 June 2016 and that pending further advice from the Sheriff, they should abide by the orders made during the trial not to discuss the case with others or inquire of others about matters relating to the trial.
	
	
	Following that order and direction, the long weekend intervened. On Tuesday, 14 June 2016 the Court heard the application for leave to appeal. Leave was granted in each application, but the appeals were dismissed. The Court reserved its reasons. These are the reasons of the Court for the orders made on Tuesday, 14 June. It is convenient to outline first the circumstances which gave rise to the application.
	


Background circumstances


	
	There were only two issues to be determined by this Court, namely (a) whether the trial judge was wrong to discharge the jury with respect to the charges against the applicants, and (b), if so, whether the Court should set aside the order, or grant other relief.
	
	
	The indictment provided to this Court included four counts. The first charged Daniel Haile and Louise Spiteri-Ahern with murder; the second was an alternative count against Ms Spiteri-Ahern that she “did solicit” Daniel Haile to murder the victim. The third count charged April Barber with inciting Haile and Spiteri-Ahern to murder the victim. The fourth count charged Amin Zraika with concealing a serious indictable offence because he knew of the matters alleged against Ms Barber and failed to report those matters to the authorities.
	
	
	The first issue of significance for present purposes arose from the manner in which the jury were instructed to address the charges. In a report furnished to this Court pursuant to s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the trial judge described the course taken in that regard in the following terms:
	


“There was a deal of evidence against Ms Barber and Mr Zraika that was not admissible against Mr Haile and Ms Spiteri-Ahern. I accordingly took the approach that I would sum up generally but not mention that evidence, ask the jury to consider the cases involving Mr Haile and Ms Spiteri-Ahern and then, hopefully after verdicts had been returned in respect of these two, sum up further with particular attention to the cases involving Ms Barber and Mr Haile.”


	
	The last reference to “Mr Haile” was clearly intended to be a reference to Mr Zraika. It followed that, at the time the jury was discharged, they had neither been instructed by the judge in relation to the particular evidence relevant to the applicants, nor had they been directed to consider the charges against them.
	
	
	After setting out some circumstances relating to the lengthy period of deliberation, the judge explained the final steps taken in the following terms:
	


“The jury could not find Ms Barber or Mr Zraika guilty unless they also found Ms Spiteri-Ahern guilty. I took the view that it was not appropriate to ask them to consider the case against Ms Barber and Mr Zraika when the only result could be a verdict of acquittal or an absence of agreement.”


	
	The first question is whether the judge was correct in discharging the jury on that basis. However, before considering that question it is necessary to set out some further details in relation to the procedure adopted immediately prior to the discharge of the jury.
	
	
	First, the trial had run, with some short interruptions, from 22 February 2016 until 20 May 2016 when the jury were directed to consider their verdicts with respect to Mr Haile and Ms Spiteri-Ahern. The jury returned its verdict of guilty of murder with respect to Mr Haile on 6 June 2016. They were directed to continue to deliberate with respect to Ms Spiteri-Ahern and did so for three further days before they reported that they were unable to reach agreement.
	
	
	Secondly, over the period of the trial, the jury had been reduced to nine members. It was open for the trial to proceed despite the reduction in numbers, pursuant to s 22 of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW). However, the reduction below 11 members meant that any verdict was required to be unanimous. [1] 
	
	
	There was no dispute in this Court that, as a result of the formulation of the charges, the trial judge was correct in saying that, given the failure to agree with respect to Ms Spiteri-Ahern, the only affirmative verdict that could be reached with respect to the applicants was the acquittal of each. Accordingly, the discharge of the jury in circumstances where it had not been required to consider its verdict with respect to the applicants, left open the possibility that they and Ms Spiteri-Ahern could be put on trial again with respect to the unresolved charges.
	
	
	Finally, it should be noted that, although the judge prepared a report for this Court, he did not deliver a judgment with respect to his decision to discharge the jury. Following the discharge of the third juror, he did give reasons for not discharging the remaining members of the jury, pursuant to s 53C(1) of the Jury Act, a judgment delivered on 6 June 2016. With respect to events thereafter, the Court was provided with copies of the transcript of 7, 8 and 9 June 2016. The judge stated to the jury, after receiving the note to the effect that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict:
	


“In light of the fact that any verdict of guilty against Ms Barber and Mr Zraika depended upon you finding a guilty verdict against Ms Spiteri-Ahern, I’m not going to require you to consider the situation of Ms Barber and Mr Zraika. So I am going now, and I do, discharge you from any further function in this trial.”


	
	After some further words of explanation in relation to the system and expressing the Court’s thanks to the jury for their contribution, the following exchange took place with Ms Francis, counsel for Ms Barber: [2] 
	


“FRANCIS: Sorry to interrupt, but I would ask your Honour to stay that decision and for the accused to exercise her rights under s 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act.

…

It would be a stay until tomorrow morning.

…

HIS HONOUR: Ms Francis, I think what I have said amounts to a discharge of the jury already. If it does not, I am not going to delay that decision. In my view it is not an appropriate case to stay an order for the discharge of this jury.

FRANCIS: … Your Honour, the taxpayer has funded four months of trial on the part of Ms Barber and she is entitled to a verdict. The jury have not indicated any difficulty with considering her case and your Honour hasn’t left her case.

HIS HONOUR: I understand that. This jury has, however, now been here for the best part of 14 weeks. They have spent a long time deliberating.”


	
	The prosecutor then objected to the exchange occurring in front of the jury, presumably on the ground that they might not be discharged. The jury was then discharged and the judge made the following further statement:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Ms Francis, I was not going to say this in front of the jury but I will say it now: having regard to the time the jury has already been deliberating, I would think it inappropriate to – with regard to the time at which they were deliberating, having regard to their statement today and the last three days or so they have been deliberating solely on the situation of Ms Spiteri-Ahern, having regard to the discharge of a couple of jurors already on the grounds of stress, and although I haven’t acquiesced in them, I am not unconscious of the submissions which have been put to me by defence counsel in reliance upon that discharge, I think it would be not appropriate to effectively retain this jury longer until you have proceeded to the Court of Criminal Appeal and then bring them back here tomorrow or next week to further deal with the matter.”


	
	Although there was no discussion with counsel immediately prior to the statements set out above, there had been consideration in the morning as to what steps should be taken if the jury were deadlocked. The trial judge noted that they could not convict Ms Barber if they did not convict Ms Spiteri-Ahern, noting with respect to Ms Barber that “they could theoretically acquit her, they could, on the other hand, disagree.” The prosecutor agreed with that assessment but said that “to send a jury out where the only verdict they could reach is a verdict of not guilty would be manifestly unfair because the danger that there would be pressure on the jury to produce a result in such a circumstance has in it such a degree of procedural unfairness that it should not be done.” [3] 
	
	
	Counsel for Ms Barber took issue with the proposed course of action and the reasoning behind it. Counsel for Ms Barber, in a submission adopted on behalf of Mr Zraika, stated: [4] 
	


“There is available to the jury, in respect of which your Honour hasn’t yet directed, evidence which exculpates her and she has sat at trial for four months, in the charge of the jury, and is entitled to a verdict on the evidence with proper directions attaching to the same.

That the jury might be hung on a category of evidence that’s admissible in the case of Ms Spiteri is no impediment to the jury reaching an acquittal in respect of that category of evidence which is admissible in the case for and against Ms Barber. … [T]here is no legitimate basis to take away from the jury their deliberation.

And to the extent that my friend refers to some procedural unfairness, the jury are entitled to acquit Ms Barber at any point. … The procedural unfairness is taking away from the accused who sat here for four months their entitlement to a jury verdict according to law.”


	
	The prosecutor’s submission in response was merely that the situation was not the same as if the jury had been sent out to consider all four accused at the same time. [5] 
	
	
	In the light of these earlier exchanges, it is clear that all counsel had a sufficient opportunity to address the Court in relation to the circumstances that eventuated.
	


Nature of appeal


	
	The right of appeal to this Court, with leave, arises under s 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act, which reads as follows:
	


5G   Appeal against discharge of whole jury

(1)   The Attorney General, Director of Public Prosecutions or any other party to a trial of criminal proceedings before a jury may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal for review of any decision by the court to discharge the jury, but only with the leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal.

(2)   The Court of Criminal Appeal is to deal with an appeal as soon as possible after the application for leave to appeal is lodged.

(3)   The Court of Criminal Appeal:

(a)   may affirm or vacate the decision appealed against, and

(b)   if it vacates the decision, may make some other decision instead of the decision appealed against.

(4)   If leave to appeal under this section is refused by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the refusal does not preclude any other appeal following a conviction on the matter to which the refused application for leave to appeal related.

(5)   This section does not apply to the discharge of a jury under section 51, 55E, 56 or 58 of the Jury Act 1977.


	
	This provision was inserted by the Jury Amendment Act 2008 (NSW), following upon recommendations made by the NSW Law Reform Commission in September 2007. [6]  In R v Abdul-Razzak [7]  this Court considered an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act (providing an appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order) in circumstances where the trial judge had decided to discharge the jury, but had not taken that step pending an indication that the prosecutor intended to appeal. In the event, the Court held there was no error in the approach proposed by the trial judge. However, the Court noted submissions by Mr Game SC for the accused that there had been no judgment or order to appeal and that, once one was made, it would not be an interlocutory order, but a final order bringing the trial to an end. [8]  Those circumstances cast doubt on the availability of an appeal under s 5F, which have been resolved by the enactment of s 5G.
	
	
	It was accepted by both parties, in accordance with the established approach to appeals in this jurisdiction, that the applicant was required to establish an error of the kind identified in House v The King [9]  including, relevantly, that the judge had acted upon a wrong principle or had made a decision which was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


Whether error established


	
	The underlying circumstances which gave rise to the discharge of the jury with respect to two accused as to whose guilt the jury had not deliberated, did not themselves reveal error. In Smith v The Queen [10]  a jury in a conspiracy case had been sent out to consider their verdict with respect to a particular accused who was alleged to have conspired with each of the other accused. They returned a verdict of guilty. The judge then summed up specifically in relation to each of the other accused persons, guilty verdicts being returned by the jury. On an appeal to the High Court the validity of that course was challenged. Menzies J (with whom other members of the Court agreed) stated: [11] 
	


“The fundamental strength of the objection to the course taken at the trial, is, that the jury, upon a summing up which was complete as to Mitchell only, had to decide whether or not there was a conspiracy between Mitchell and at least one of the other persons charged as parties to the alleged conspiracy. … His conviction, therefore, involved an affirmation by the jury that at least one of the other accused was a conspirator with him. If it had turned out otherwise, it would, of course, have been necessary for the jury to have been instructed to acquit Mitchell too, notwithstanding its earlier verdict against him.”


	
	That objection was rejected on the basis that a person could be tried for, and convicted of, conspiracy alone. [12]  Otherwise, the Court concluded that the trial judge “had a discretion to conduct the trial as he did, and that, in choosing the course which was followed, there was no error of law.” [13]  Whilst agreeing that the course taken was not wrong in law, Walsh J continued: [14] 
	


“But I think that I should say that in my opinion the course which should be regarded as the normal course is that of inviting the jury to consider, at the same time and after a summing up which has dealt with the whole trial and with the cases for and against each of the accused, all the verdicts which need to be returned. A departure from that procedure should be made only if it appears to the trial judge that there are substantial reasons for doing so. … I think that the practice of asking the jury to return verdicts only after there has been placed before the jury everything which they will be required to consider, including the complete charge of the presiding judge, ought still to be followed as a general rule in conspiracy trials as well as in other joint trials.”


	
	This was not a conspiracy trial, nor was the Court invited to conclude that the approach adopted in separating the accused for the purpose of the jury considering their verdicts, was erroneous. There was no material before this Court to suggest that that course should not have been taken.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the result that the jury was unable to agree in relation to Ms Spiteri-Ahern was seen to give rise to a dilemma as to what course should be taken with respect to the two accused whose cases had not been addressed by the jury.
	
	
	There is much to be said for the position taken by the applicants in this Court, namely that, having been charged and tried with serious offences which, at least with respect to Ms Barber, could have led to a conviction for being an accessory to a murder, they were entitled to have verdicts unless the trial had miscarried.
	
	
	There are a number of ways in which a jury trial might not reach a final verdict. One possibility is that, where jurors are discharged in the course of a trial, so that, by a process of attrition, there is no longer an adequate number to allow the trial to continue, in accordance with s 22 of the Jury Act. That had not occurred in this case, but it appears that the trial judge was concerned about the length of the trial (which had exceeded expectations). [15]  The jury had retired to consider the charges against Mr Haile and Ms Spiteri-Ahern at about 11am on May 20 and had concluded that they could not agree with respect to Ms Spiteri-Ahern at 3pm on 9 June, a period of some 15 days.
	
	
	The judge stated in his report:
	


“While I cannot point to any concrete evidence to this effect, and recognising the possibility in error in making such a judgment or that what I saw may only have been frustration, I also had the impression from the demeanour and long pause by the foreman yesterday morning when called to the witness box and answering my questions as to the likelihood of agreement and also from the demeanour of the jury itself when in court yesterday that they had had enough.”


	
	Whether such circumstances could have warranted the discharge of the jury, over the objection of an accused, was not addressed specifically in submissions before this Court. It is sufficient to say that the material which was before the Court did not warrant the discharge of the jury over the objection of two of the accused. That factor justifies a grant of leave to appeal.
	
	
	It should be added that it was not appropriate for the prosecutor to complain of “unfairness” if the charges against the applicants were to be left to the jury.
	


Availability of relief


	
	On the basis that there was error in failing to put the charges against the applicants to the jury, it is necessary to consider whether relief should now be granted under s 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	The difficulty at the heart of the application arose from the fact that the trial judge declined to stay his decision to discharge the jury. As a result, the jury separated on the understanding that their functions had been completed.
	
	
	The directions subsequently given by this Court, and transmitted to the members of the jury by the Sheriff, were that they should continue to act in accordance with the directions given by the trial judge, namely that they should disregard media publicity, not make inquiries about matters outside the courtroom and not discuss the case with others. That communication was conveyed to all members of the jury, but not until about 24 hours after the order discharging them. In these circumstances, the prosecutor submitted that the Court should be satisfied as to what he called “presumptive prejudice”. That expression appeared to cover the likelihood that jurors would have had extraneous discussions about the case, examined material on the internet and had regard to publicity from other sources.
	
	
	In response, counsel for the applicants submitted that the case should not be disposed of on such presumptions, and that there were powers available under the Jury Act which would allow the judge to determine whether there had in fact been extraneous communications, the effect of which could not be dissipated by appropriate directions.
	
	
	Counsel for Ms Barber also referred the Court to the consideration given to such issues by the Supreme Court of the United States in Dietz v Bouldin, [16]  a decision handed down on 9 June 2016.
	
	
	The case involved a civil trial in which the jurors had delivered a verdict and were discharged. The trial judge, immediately realising that the verdict was not legally available, ordered the clerk to bring the jurors back, a direction which was effected before they left the building. (One had left the building, but only to obtain a receipt for expenses and had returned immediately.) The first question considered by the Court was whether, in the absence of a specific rule, the judge had an inherent power to reassemble a jury after discharge. The opinion of the Court, delivered by Sotomayor J, upheld that power but noted that it should be “exercised with restraint” and subject to careful consideration of discretionary limits. [17]  The Court noted:
	


“The inherent power to rescind a discharge order and recall a dismissed jury, therefore, must be carefully circumscribed, especially in light of the guarantee of an impartial jury that is vital to the fair administration of justice. This Court’s precedents implementing this guarantee have noted various external influences that can taint a juror.

…

The potential for taint looms even larger when a jury is reassembled after being discharged. While discharged, jurors are freed from instructions from the court requiring them not to discuss the case with others outside the jury room and to avoid external prejudicial information. … Any suggestion of prejudice in recalling a discharged jury should counsel a district court not to exercise its inherent power.”


	
	The reasons of the Court [18]  stated that the trial judge in considering whether to rescind a discharge order should determine whether any juror has been “directly tainted”, for example by discussing the case with others and the judge should also take into account “factors that can indirectly create prejudice in this context, any of which standing alone could be dispositive in a particular case.” Three particular factors were identified: [19] 
	


“First, the length of delay between discharge and recall. The longer the jury has been discharged, the greater the likelihood of prejudice. Freed from the crucible of the jury’s group decisionmaking enterprise, discharged jurors may begin to forget key facts, arguments, or instructions from the court. … And they are more likely to be exposed to potentially prejudicial sources of information or discuss the case with others, even if they do not realise they have done so or forget when questioned after being recalled by the court.

…

Second, whether the jurors have spoken to anyone about the case after discharge. …

Third, the reaction to the verdict. Trials are society’s way of channelling disputes into fair and impartial resolutions. But these disputes can be bitter and emotional. And, depending on the case, those emotions may be broadcasted to the jury in response to their verdict. …

In such a case, there is a high risk that emotional reactions will cause jurors to begin to reconsider their decision and ask themselves, ‘Did I make the right call?’ Of course, this concern would be present even in a decision to reinstruct the jury to fix an error after the verdict is announced but before they are discharged.”


	
	Although the Court held there was no abuse of power in the case before it, the Court emphasised that it was dealing with a civil case and not a criminal trial. (Indeed it was a very small claim, arising out of a motor vehicle accident.) The court referred to its own decision in Remmer v United States [20]  in which it had said:
	


“In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering, directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial.” [21] 


	
	Similar considerations arise in this jurisdiction, although due regard must be paid to constitutional differences and differences in the relevant statutory schemes governing trials. Nevertheless, the factors to be considered are common.
	
	
	The first consideration is that the jurors in the present case were discharged, and were entitled to consider themselves free of the immediate obligations imposed on them and applicable during the trial, for a period of some 24 hours. Secondly, there was before this Court some evidence of pre-trial publicity which suggested that the initial crime had received considerable coverage in the media, both at the time of the offence in 2013 and again on 6 June 2016, following Mr Haile’s conviction. There was, therefore, a very real prospect that members of the jury would have considered extraneous material, discussed the case with friends and family and, away from the “crucible of the jury’s group decisionmaking enterprise”, [22]  reassessed the material they had heard at the trial, free from the effect of the directions given by the trial judge.
	
	
	The suggestion that the effect of actual prejudice could be assessed by the trial judge raises additional difficulties. While it is an offence for a juror to make inquiries about matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror, pursuant to s 68C of the Jury Act, any such inquiries made in the present case would not have been made whilst the person was a juror for the trial of the matter and hence would not have constituted any offence under that provision. Importantly, the power of the judge to examine a juror on oath to determine whether such conduct has occurred, pursuant to s 55DA of the Jury Act, would be unavailable.
	
	
	The judge also has power to examine a juror to determine whether the juror has read, seen or heard alleged prejudicial material “published or broadcast during the trial” and whether such juror has been influenced by the material. [23]  However, the present hypothesis concerns material which may have been published after the trial was understood to have concluded. There would be a live issue as to whether jurors could properly be examined pursuant to that provision on the basis that the trial had not been completed once the order discharging the jury was revoked.
	
	
	There may be other powers of inquiry vested in a trial judge, but this possibility was not explored. There are other difficulties in belatedly recalling the jurors. The matters referred to by the trial judge in his report, set out at [31] above, are not to be disregarded. Although the judge was careful to state the limitations on his opinion, the circumstances of the trial give them a significant degree of plausibility.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act, this Court is required to act expeditiously in determining such appeals. Although, as in Abdul-Razzak and other matters, the Court has been able to address the application for leave and the appeal within three working days of the decision of the trial judge, the fact that a long weekend intervened is also not to be disregarded.
	
	
	A combination of the circumstances set out above satisfied the Court that, the jury having in fact been discharged, it was not an appropriate case in which to intervene. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.
	


Other matters


	
	In recommending the provision of a right to appeal, with leave, with respect to the discharge or non-discharge of an individual juror or the whole jury, the Law Reform Commission expressly took into account the ability of this Court to deal with such questions expeditiously. [24]  That fact, together with the statutory requirement for a determination “as soon as possible”, make it appropriate that, in all but exceptional cases, a judge who is minded to discharge a juror or the jury, over the opposition of one party, should stay his or her decision to allow an application to be made to this Court, if so requested. There will, of course, be circumstances where, because the trial judge is not persuaded that any other course is reasonably available, or for other reasons, the decision should be given effect immediately. However, those cases will be the exception to the rule.
	
	
	A second matter to be noted was an application on behalf of the applicants that there be a permanent stay with respect to the charges laid against them. There were two difficulties in acceding to that course. The first was that the Director had no notice that such an application was to be made. The second was that such an order could properly be made only after the Director had decided whether to present a further indictment involving the applicants. That step may or may not be taken: it involves the independent exercise of the prosecutorial discretion which is not within the control of this Court. If the applicants were to be charged on a fresh indictment, they would have available to them the right to seek relief by way of permanent stay or otherwise, based on the circumstances revealed by the present application. The dismissal by this Court of the appeal under s 5G should not be taken to influence the way in which such an application is determined, if it becomes necessary. It certainly does not preclude such an application, nor any anticipatory application which may now be made to the Director being given independent and unfettered consideration.

		23 June 2016",2016-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769767,Kennedy v R [2016] NSWCCA 123,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Damien James Kennedy was sentenced by his Honour Judge Frearson SC in the District Court at Port Macquarie on 19 June 2015. He had pleaded guilty to an offence of wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 25 years and there is also prescribed a standard non-parole period of 7 years. His Honour sentenced Mr Kennedy to imprisonment for 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months dating from 6 April 2015.
	
	
	Mr Kennedy (“the applicant”) seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed. He relies upon four grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1:   His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence

Ground 2:   His Honour erred in finding that the applicant’s moral culpability was not significantly diminished   

Ground 3:   His Honour erred in finding that there was no significant diminution of the requirement for general and specific deterrence or denunciation

Ground 4:   The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive

Facts


	
	There was no dispute as to the facts as set out in the statement of facts tendered before the judge from which I draw the following. On Saturday 8 February 2014 the 15 year old victim, BA, was visiting extended family in West Kempsey. The applicant and BA were aware of each other from having lived in the same neighbourhood at times.
	
	
	At about 9.30pm BA left his cousin’s house with four of his friends and they walked to the vicinity of the applicant’s home. There, BA and his friends taunted the applicant and challenged him to come out of his house. The applicant had formed an opinion that BA and his cousins had been throwing rocks at his aunt’s house. He said it had been happening for weeks and admitted the main protagonists, to his understanding, were two 11 year old boys. BA had only arrived that day from Coffs Harbour.
	
	
	The applicant came out of the house and said, “Who wants to fight?” He approached BA who saw that the applicant was holding a knife which had a blade about 10cm in length. BA said, “If you put the knife down I’ll fight you”.
	
	
	The applicant punched BA in the left eye, splitting his eyebrow which began to bleed. BA walked away and the applicant chased him down the street. The applicant grabbed BA and hit him again. BA grabbed the applicant by the scruff of his shirt and pushed him into a fence. The applicant stabbed BA in the upper right arm with the knife and then stabbed him in the lower left side of his chest.
	
	
	BA walked away holding his chest wound and spoke to someone on the street who called an ambulance. Blood was spurting from the wound. While waiting for the ambulance, BA said, “Am I going to die?”
	
	
	BA was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery. He had a 6cm laceration to his chest through which his lung was visible. He had lost a large amount of blood. A chest tube was inserted to manage the large pneumothorax. His pleura had been lacerated on his left-hand diaphragm. Surgeons cauterised blood vessels to control the bleeding, stitched the lacerations to the diaphragm and chest wall, and reinserted a chest tube. BA’s injuries were described as “of a serious [kind] and posed a significant life threat”. BA also had the wound to his arm closed with six stitches and the laceration to his eyelid was also repaired.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested that evening and taken to Kempsey Police Station where he complained of a swollen and painful hand. He agreed to participate in an interview and he confirmed to the police that he had chased BA and had punched him. He denied being armed with a knife at any time and denied stabbing BA.
	


Assessment of the seriousness of the offence


	
	After referring to the facts pertaining to the offending the sentencing judge turned to explain his assessment of its objective seriousness. He said:
	


“I do accept that the offence was precipitated by the taunting by children but whatever happened thereafter, the accused was a willing and enthusiastic participant. He was holding a knife with a ten centimetre blade. Thereafter he punched the victim, he chased the 15 year old who had clearly retreated and then what happened thereafter was he stabbed the victim twice in the areas that I have already mentioned and the injuries were indeed life threatening.

Even accepting there was some provocative behaviour on the part of the group which comprised the victim, this was nevertheless a callous knifing of a 15 year old by an 18 year old and it occurred in circumstances where the 15 year old was in retreat. He had been physically dominated by an older male when attempting to retreat and this presents as a case where the 18 year old is actually bullying a 15 year old and assaulting and stabbing him.

I do acknowledge that an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm is an element of the offence and cannot be double counted. Nevertheless the consequences of the offence were dire and there was a life threatening injury to the victim. There was a risk of death. The witness was killed when stabbed in the chest. This is a very serious matter.

The fact that the legislature provides a maximum sentence of 25 years and the standard non-parole period is indicative of the seriousness which the legislation regards conduct that gives rise to this offence. This is a very serious example of the offence.

I do accept that the stabbing itself was not pre-planned but the fact is that the offender had deliberately armed himself with a knife to confront the children. There is an element of cowardice involved in confronting children armed with a knife. It seems to me that the offence is at least at the upper end of the mid-range in terms of the objective gravity.” (Emphasis added)

Personal circumstances of the applicant


	
	The learned judge observed at the outset of his sentencing remarks that the applicant was “a very young man of 18 at the time of the offence”.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s criminal history the judge noted that he was on a good behaviour bond for a matter of assault at the time of the index offence which he regarded (correctly) as an aggravating feature. Also in the applicant’s criminal history were a number of offences of damaging or destroying property. Overall the judge regarded the record as denying to the applicant the leniency that could otherwise be available.
	
	
	No oral evidence was given in the sentence proceedings but a number of reports were tendered: a Pre-Sentence Report, a Juvenile Justice report and a report by a psychologist, Mr Allan Anderson.
	
	
	The judge noted that the Juvenile Justice Report prepared in May 2013 revealed that the applicant came from ""a disadvantaged background of poor educational achievement and a low income household"". His Honour also noted that the applicant's education had been significantly obstructed due to poorly developed social skills, anger issues, violence, bullying and intimidation in the school environment. The applicant had left school during the course of Year 6 and received no further education.
	
	
	The judge remarked that ""even then [presumably referring to when the Juvenile Justice report was prepared] the offender had a background of substantial disadvantage"".
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report provided further information as to the applicant's background to which the judge made some reference. He noted that the applicant had been predominantly raised by his aunt. His biological father had separated from his mother when he was between 1 and 2 years of age. His father had relocated to Queensland and there had been no contact with him. His mother formed a relationship with his stepfather some 17 years ago and despite reports of domestic violence and abuse between the parents, the applicant maintained that his mother, stepfather and younger siblings continued to be supportive of him.
	
	
	The judge then observed that ""the most remarkable occurrence during his upbringing was reportedly significant bullying from peers, which started in early school years and continued"" to the present time. This bullying ranged from taunts to physical assaults to malicious damage to houses. His Honour remarked:
	


""It seems his history of having been bullied turned him into a bully on this occasion. He became an aggressive person and someone very easy to ignite apparently and ignite in a most inappropriate way.""


	
	The judge noted that the applicant had a period of psychological counselling coupled with antidepressant medication but ceased both about five years ago.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report included that the applicant accepted some responsibility for his actions but some aspects of his account to the Community Corrections officer did not accord with the facts. He admitted that he carried a knife around for protection.
	
	
	The judge referred to the psychologist's report as including more information about the applicant's background. His Honour accepted that the applicant had ""an unhappy childhood"".
	
	
	The judge rejected the psychologist’s conclusion that the applicant had a relatively insignificant alcohol and drug history. His Honour described the applicant’s reported daily use of cannabis as “a significant problem” and found that it likely exacerbated his fragile mental health state.
	
	
	Mr Anderson suggested some diagnoses of psychiatric conditions. These were based upon a Personality Assessment Inventory that he said did not provide definitive diagnoses but rather ""suggest areas of mental health concern"". The judge regarded this as ""highly speculative"". He said (while apparently part reading from the report):
	


""Well it is not clear to me what he is actually suffering from, but I do accept that he was suffering from a form of depression, a form of borderline personality disorder and an antisocial personality disorder. I do accept he was hyper vigilant and aggressive and paranoid. …

I do accept he was depressed and I do accept he suffers from paranoia. He has a negative self-view, which I accept. As an indication of antisocial behaviours, 'A very aggressive attitude to people in general', I do accept that.""


	
	In relation to the circumstances giving rise to the offence, Mr Anderson suggested: ""In essence he had to protect himself from people who were attacking him"". His Honour responded:
	


""I do not accept that. Looking at the facts of this case, he was not protecting himself, he was having a fight with a younger boy who was retreating and he stabbed him.""


	
	The judge also rejected Dr Anderson's assessment that the applicant had shown remorse: ""There is nothing I can see in the evidence that supports any conclusion that he has remorse"". He did, however, accept Mr Anderson's assessment that the applicant ""has had an unfortunate childhood and adolescence"" and that ""he was clearly teased and harassed for the whole of his young life"".
	
	
	Some other aspects of the judge’s treatment of the applicant's background and personal circumstances will be referred to later in the context of Grounds 2 and 3.
	


Ground 1 – error in assessment of objective seriousness of offence


	
	As noted earlier, the judge’s finding was that the offence fell into “at least the upper end of the mid-range” of objective seriousness. It was submitted that this assessment did not take into account “the provocation presented by the victim and four friends who taunted the applicant and challenged him to come out of his house”. Provocation is a statutory mitigating factor (s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) and the judge was in error in not treating it as such.
	
	
	I have extracted in full (at [11]) the judge’s reasoning that led to his conclusion. He accepted that “the offence was precipitated by the taunting by children” and that “there was some provocative behaviour”. However, he found that there were some countervailing considerations which he explained in that passage and I will not repeat.
	
	
	The written submissions by counsel for the applicant refer to a question as to whether a subjective state of mind (in this instance, provocation) is relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence: e.g. Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. There is no need to engage with the issue because I am satisfied that the judge did factor into his assessment the provocation and taunting of the applicant. The simple fact is that he did not find it to be of the same significance as is contended. That was a finding that was open to his Honour.
	
	
	Another basis upon which the judge’s finding as to objective seriousness was challenged concerned the extent of the injury sustained by the victim. It was accepted that the stabbing to the victim's torso was serious but ""there was no evidence before the Court as to any sequelae from the injury"". Further, reference was made to the judge's statement “the witness was killed when stabbed in the chest” and it was argued that his Honour “clearly mistook the facts”.
	
	
	There is no merit in these arguments. As to the first point, it was open to the judge to make the assessment of objective seriousness at the level he did where the applicant thrust a knife into the chest of a 15 year old boy causing life threatening injury that required surgical intervention to save his life. As to the second point, either the transcript of his Honour’s remarks is incorrect or he misspoke. It is, quite frankly, ludicrous to think that he assessed the seriousness of the offence on the basis that the victim had been killed. His Honour either said, or at least meant, that the victim could have been killed. That was consistent with the unchallenged evidence in the statement of facts (signed by the applicant) that the victim’s injuries were “serious and posed a significant life threat”.
	
	
	The assessment of the seriousness of an offence is a matter for sentencing judges and not a matter that this Court will readily undertake in usurpation of that function: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] (Spigelman CJ) and [46] (Simpson J, as her Honour then was).
	
	
	This ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 2 – moral culpability not significantly diminished

Ground 3 – no significant diminution of requirement or general and specific deterrence or denunciation


	
	It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. They arise from the following passage of the sentencing remarks (which followed his Honour’s review of the various reports):
	


“Now I have read that out in some detail because it is difficult to work out in any particular case what impact the mental functioning has on the particular crime and whether it provides any amelioration in terms of the moral culpability or the sentence or both and these matters depend on the particular facts and circumstances.

I do accept that the offender was paranoid. He was depressed, he was anxious, he was antisocial, he was aggressive, he was hyper vigilant. I accept all of that and I do accept that his condition and his background made him less disciplined in terms of emotional control than ordinary people in his situation. He was a bit of a powder keg and highly likely to react to any provocative behaviour and react in a completely unreasonable way.

One consideration is whether there is anything to preclude a very substantial appreciation of the gravity and consequences of his conduct when he pursued a 15 year old and stabbed him in the chest. I conclude there is not anything to preclude that. As I said, I do accept that he would have had less control than others. He is certainly not inhibited in making reasoned decisions.

He was aggressive and antisocial and easy to anger and he said he carried a knife around for protection, and he did that when he was on a bond. It seems to be that his moral culpability is not significantly diminished in the present circumstances and of course a countervailing consideration is always that his antisocial personality and aggression do make him a danger to the community, because he is likely to snap when he is provoked and snap completely inappropriately.

I do not conclude this is a case where there would be any diminution of the requirements for general deterrence or specific deterrence or denunciation. I am required to take into account for the purposes of sentencing the one step process and that includes providing adequate punishment, denouncing the conduct, recognising the harm to the victim, protecting the community from people who do these things [and] to rehabilitate the offender.” (The portions I have emphasised reflect the grounds of appeal)


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s finding that “his moral culpability is not significantly diminished in the present circumstances” was untenable in the light of his Honour's acceptance that the applicant had a “background of substantial disadvantage” and his acknowledgement of the various other negative aspects of his upbringing. I have alluded to the substance of these matters earlier in relation to the applicant’s personal circumstances.
	
	
	It was submitted that the applicant bore “significantly less moral culpability for his actions than a person with the benefit of a normal or stable background and without his psychological abnormalities"".
	
	
	It may be accepted quite readily, as Simpson J (as her Honour then was) said in R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 at [69], that an offender who has the start in life that the applicant had would not ordinarily bear equal moral responsibility with one who has had a “normal” or “advantaged” upbringing. (Her Honour quickly added that she was not saying that such a person bears no moral responsibility.) But the problem with the applicant’s submissions is that they rely upon some aspects of his personal circumstances to the exclusion of others. It was necessary in this case for the sentencing judge to strike a balance between a number of competing considerations. That was his task and, again, one which this Court should not readily usurp. It is notable that the findings that his Honour made which were adverse to the applicant are not challenged; they are simply not mentioned.
	
	
	Moreover, to say that the applicant’s moral culpability was not “significantly” diminished is not to say that it was not diminished at all. It was a question of degree, or weight; an assessment quintessentially one for the primary judge. “The circumstances in which matters of ‘weight’ will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined”: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	In relation to Ground 3 it was submitted that “the applicant, as a result of his global difficulties and issues, was suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality such that general deterrence should have been given less weight in the sentencing exercise because he was not a suitable medium for making an example to others”. Muldrock v The Queen at [53] was cited.
	
	
	The problem with this submission is that even if it be assumed that the applicant was suffering from a “mental disorder or abnormality” (the judge accepted only some aspects pointing towards such a conclusion) this was another topic upon which there were countervailing considerations.
	
	
	The judge concluded that the applicant had a “very substantial appreciation of the gravity and consequences of his conduct when he pursued a 15 year old and stabbed him in the chest”. Hunt CJ at CL said in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51 that where an “the offender [with a mental disorder or abnormality] acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation [of the requirement of general deterrence] need not be great”.
	


Ground 4 – manifest excess


	
	The sole written submission in support of this ground was:
	


""Given the objective and subjective features of the applicant's case, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.""


	
	At the hearing it was emphasised that the applicant had only just turned 18 at the time of the offence. Counsel described him as ""particularly vulnerable and psychologically fragile"". She submitted that even if error was not established in relation to Ground 1, this Court should take provocation into account as a mitigating factor in assessing whether the sentence is erroneously excessive.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown correctly reminded the Court that for the applicant to make good this ground it was necessary to establish that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust. (Authority for the proposition is too well-known to cite.) Reference was also made to the statutory guideposts of the maximum penalty of 25 years and the standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	The offence was assessed as being in the ""upper mid-range"" of objective seriousness. The sentence was one of 6 years 6 months after the application of a 10 per cent discount for the applicant's plea of guilty. The starting point was about 7 years.
	
	
	The non-parole period is 3 years 6 months, about 54 per cent of the head sentence. If the judge had not made a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the non-parole period would have been in the order of 4 years 10 months. The reasons for reducing the non-parole period were expressed as follows:
	


""I do propose to find special circumstances because of his fragile mental condition, his age, it is the first time in custody. He will need a lot of help when he gets out and a lot of supervision to control or give him the mechanisms to control his anger and to become more disciplined in relation to violence. ""


	
	The problem with the applicant's ""provocation"" argument is that there is no evidence of any loss of self-control. Nevertheless, the judge accepted that the incident was precipitated by taunting and provocative behaviour. After the initial altercation the victim walked away after he had received a punch to the eye. Rather than leaving it at that, the applicant, armed with a knife, pursued and caught up to him and continued his assault, culminating in him twice stabbing the boy.
	
	
	Making full allowance for those subjective matters that stood in the applicant's favour, whilst also acknowledging those that did not, and respecting the two statutory guideposts in the light of the assessment of the seriousness of the offence, I cannot conclude that the sentence is unreasonable or unjust.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2.   Appeal dismissed.


	
	RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and subject to the following remarks, with his Honour's reason.
	
	
	I take the view that the Applicant's moral culpability for his actions was significantly less than it would have been had he had a normal and stable background and did not suffer from psychological abnormalities. Thus in my view the second ground of appeal is established.
	
	
	However I also accept that the Applicant must have had substantial appreciation of the gravity and consequences of his conduct when he pursued a 15 years old and stabbed him in the chest. Stabbing someone in the chest is so obviously dangerous that the Applicant could not but have known of that fact. As an 18 year old he could not but have also known what a knife with a 10 cm blade could do - a fact amply demonstrated by the Applicant as he said carrying the knife for protection.
	
	
	His Honour had to balance these and other considerations to which he referred including that the Applicant was depressed, has an anti-social personality and is aggressive - factors which make him a danger to the community.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that in its objective gravity the Applicant's offence was at least at the upper end of the mid-range. Certainly it was within the mid-range, a fact that makes particularly relevant as a guidepost the standard non-parole period of 7 years. Of course given that the Applicant had pleaded guilty and the standard non-parole period takes no account of subjective factors it was not to be applied mechanically but it clearly was not.
	
	
	The sentence of 6 years and 6 months including a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months falls well short of the statutory guides of 25 years and a non-parole period of 7 years, even making allowance for the 10% his Honour allowed for the Applicant's plea. I am satisfied that, even taking the view I have concerning the Applicant's moral culpability, and bearing in mind the manner in which this Court should approach an appeal where it finds error - Kentwell v R [2014] HCA37; 252 CLR 601 - the sentence imposed was appropriate.

		23 June 2016",2016-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769770,Wright v R [2016] NSWCCA 122,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: In circumstances fully explained by R A Hulme J, the applicant, Richard Wright, sought leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Woodburne DCJ for a number of sexual assaults on young children. Although the circumstances require careful consideration, the material presented to the Court does not ultimately qualify as material upon which this Court could intervene. Accordingly, I would refuse leave to appeal against the sentences.
	
	
	The admissibility in this Court, on an application for leave to appeal against sentence, of evidence not before the sentencing judge has been the subject of recent consideration in the High Court, restating principles which have, broadly speaking, been applied by this Court for several decades. It is convenient to restate those principles, so far as relevant for present purposes, in order to demonstrate that no occasion for intervention has been established.
	
	
	An application for leave to appeal under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is to be determined in accordance with s 6(3) of that Act. The first step is to identify error on the part of the sentencing judge. As explained in Kentwell v The Queen, [1]  in terms derived from House v The King: [2] 
	


“When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. … This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.”


	
	The joint judgment in Kentwell continued, “[a]fter having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence.” [3]  This last proposition was very recently reiterated in Betts v The Queen: [4] 
	


“As a general rule, the appellate court's assessment of whether some other sentence is warranted in law is made on the material before the sentencing court and any relevant evidence of the offender's progress towards rehabilitation in the period since the sentence hearing. For the purposes of that assessment, an offender is not permitted to run a new and different case. This general rule does not deny that an appellate court has the flexibility to receive new evidence where it is necessary to do so in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. In this appeal, the general rule applied because the new evidence sought to be adduced by the appellant was inconsistent with the case that he ran in the sentencing court and its rejection in the circumstances did not cause justice to miscarry.”


	
	Although Betts was concerned with evidence relevant to the second stage of the process (error having been established warranting intervention by this Court), the joint reasons commenced with a statement of the principles relevant to the determination of appeals generally under s 6(3). The Court said: [5] 
	


“Notwithstanding its wide terms, it is well settled that the Court of Criminal Appeal's power to intervene is not enlivened unless error in any of the ways explained in House v The King is established. [6]  The identification of error will ordinarily be by reference to the sentencing judge's reasons on the material that was before the court. However, the Court of Criminal Appeal has recognised that there are bases upon which error at first instance may be disclosed by new or fresh evidence. [7]  Generally, the Court of Criminal Appeal insists upon proper grounds being established as a foundation for the exercise of its discretion to receive fresh evidence. [8]  Evidence qualifies as fresh evidence if it could not have been obtained at the time of the sentence hearing by the exercise of reasonable diligence. [9]  None of this is to deny that the Court of Criminal Appeal has the flexibility to receive new evidence where it is necessary to do so in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. [10] ”


	
	This statement of principle is important in the present case, because the evidence sought to be relied upon to establish a ground of intervention was not evidence before the sentencing judge, nor was any error independently identified in the judgment on sentence. Unlike Betts, the focus in the present case was on the first stage (identifying error) rather than the second stage (resentencing).
	
	
	The statement of principle in Betts raises two issues of present importance. The first is whether the phrase “new or fresh evidence” was intended to refer to “new and fresh” evidence and, secondly, whether the caselaw approved in the last sentence, referring to “the flexibility to receive new evidence” was not limited to evidence properly described as fresh evidence.
	
	
	The concept of “fresh evidence” is generally understood as evidence that is new, in the sense that it had not been obtained at the time of the hearing at first instance, and was “fresh” in the sense that it could not have been obtained at that time in the exercise of reasonable diligence. The element of ambiguity is revealed by the reference to R v Lanham, a decision of this Court constituted by Mason and Manning JJA and Isaacs J. The passage in the judgment referred to in Betts read as follows: [11] 
	


“Before dealing with the substance of the appeal it is necessary to deal with an application made by senior counsel for the applicant that this Court should receive certain affidavit evidence which was not tendered to the learned Chairman of Quarter Sessions. The Court has, of course, a discretion to admit fresh evidence but that discretion is to be exercised in accordance with well-settled principles which need no reiteration here. … It is necessary that we should state clearly and unequivocally that it is not the customary practice of the Court to receive fresh evidence and that in every case proper grounds must be established as a foundation for the exercise of the Court’s discretion to admit fresh evidence. Indeed, if the Court were to take any other view, it would be lending its encouragement to a situation in which evidence relevant to the issue of penalty might be withheld from a lower court to be used on appeal in the event that the penalty imposed was thought to be too severe.”


	
	The last sentence (envisaging withholding of evidence) suggests that the term “fresh evidence” was not being used in a restricted and technical sense.
	
	
	In R v Vachalec, also referred to in Betts in the passage set out above, Street CJ (delivering the judgment of a court comprising himself, Nagle CJ at CL and Lee J) stated, by reference to both appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence, that the primary function of the Court was to ascertain whether the decision was in error. The reasons continued: [12] 
	


“Normally error requires the evaluation of the material placed before the first instance court. There are, however, well-established bases upon which error in the first instance proceedings can be disclosed by fresh or new evidence. In addition the Court’s jurisdiction is exercisable where it is shown that there has been a miscarriage of justice.”


	
	Referring to the judgment of James J (with whom Mason P and Hislop J agreed) in R v Deng [13]  the High Court noted that this Court will routinely receive “evidence of the offender’s progress towards rehabilitation in the period since the sentence hearing” on the limited basis that it may be taken into account at the second stage (resentencing). [14]  However, even at the second stage, in circumstances where the power of the court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion had been enlivened, the High Court rejected the proposition that other evidence, not before the sentencing judge, should be admitted. Thus the Court stated: [15] 
	


“Forensic choices are made in the conduct of the offender's case at the sentence hearing. These include the material that is to be relied upon in mitigation of penalty and whether any of the facts are to be contested. The circumstance that the sentencing judge's discretion is vitiated by House error does not, without more, provide a reason for not holding the offender to these forensic choices. Justice does not miscarry by reason of the refusal to allow an appellant to run a new and different case on the question of re-sentence. Exceptional cases apart, the question of whether some other sentence is warranted in law is answered by consideration of the material that was before the sentencing court and any relevant evidence of post-sentence conduct.”


	
	In Deng, James J commented on a passage in the reasons of Howie AJ in R v Fordham [16]  in the following terms:
	


“[41]   In argument on the appeal counsel for the respondent referred to another part of the judgment of Howie AJ in Fordham where his Honour said (at p 377):–

‘Absent sentencing error which requires the Court to re-sentence an appellant, the Court should in my view, resist attempts to place before it material which was not before the sentencing judge’.

…

[43]   … I would understand [Howie AJ] as saying that, if there has not been any sentencing error then, in general, evidence which was not before the sentencing judge will not be admissible on an appeal against sentence and as implying that, if there has been sentencing error, certain kinds of evidence may be admissible on an appeal but not as implying that, if there has been sentencing error, all kinds of evidence which might be relevant to sentencing are admissible on an appeal, notwithstanding that they were not before the sentencing judge.

[44]   In the same paragraph of his judgment in Fordham in which Howie AJ made the remark I have been discussing, his Honour said:–

“Those representing an accused person before the trial court ‘have a wide discretion to conduct the defence as they see fit and this Court should not generally interfere in the exercise of that discretion (his Honour cited R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677). I see no reason why that principle should not apply, at least to the same extent, to sentencing proceedings as it does to the actual trial.’”


	
	The submission put to the Court in Betts was contrary to the conclusion reached in Deng; [17]  it was rejected, thereby affirming the approach accepted by James J in Deng.
	
	
	It is not necessary for present purposes to consider whether evidence which was either obtained and not relied upon, or was reasonably available but not obtained, could ever (and if so in what circumstances) form the basis for an application for leave to appeal against sentence. What may be accepted, however, is that evidence which was not obtained because it was not available in the exercise of reasonable diligence, may be admissible in order to show that the sentencing process miscarried, although that is only likely to be in exceptional cases and will depend upon the nature of the evidence.
	
	
	In the present case, the evidence concerned the applicant’s deteriorating health at the time of sentencing and subsequently. Such evidence should be distinguished from evidence which had potential consequences for the moral culpability of the applicant at the date of his offending, as was the case in Betts.
	
	
	There is another kind of evidence which arguably falls into a different category. That is evidence which may not have been available at the time of sentencing, but which demonstrates that the circumstances of imprisonment are harsher, due to the deteriorating condition of the offender, than had been anticipated at the time of sentence. In respect of such evidence, Street CJ stated in Vachalec, immediately after the passage referred to above at [10]:
	


“But, as an Appeal Court, it is not its function, nor is it equipped, to fulfil a continuing supervisory role over the effect of imprisonment upon an individual. Such a matter involves essentially administrative considerations and remedial action involves essentially an exercise of administrative power that this Court does not possess. … Administrative miscarriage in the working out of a sentence cannot be remedied by this Court as it has no jurisdiction to enter the administrative field. There could, of course, be cases where significant administrative miscarriage was so plainly foreseeable at the time of sentence as to justify this Court finding error in the sentencing decision of the first instance court. Such cases will be rare, and the present is not among them.”


	
	There is some tension between the principle that the Court should generally only consider admitting fresh evidence and the principle that anything that has happened since sentencing (being the most obvious category of fresh evidence) is a matter for the executive and not for the court on an application for leave to appeal against sentence. There is a further problem, particularly with medical conditions, in identifying what is properly described as “fresh evidence”. For example, there was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant was in declining health. He had not been diagnosed as suffering from dementia at that stage, nor, it may be accepted, should such a diagnosis have then been made. However, the fact that a psychiatrist has (for sound reasons) later proffered such a diagnosis does not necessarily mean that there is some fresh material which might have affected the sentencing, had the diagnosis then been available.
	
	
	In Khoury v The Queen, [18]  Simpson J stated that “[i]f evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion – the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance.” That statement was worded in the past tense because of the understood need to distinguish between “events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing” (which cannot be taken into account) [19]  and those facts or circumstances which “existed at the time of sentencing, even if not known, or imperfectly understood, at that time”. [20]  Nevertheless, Simpson J suggested that “[t]oo rigid an application of the principle clearly has potential to be the cause of injustice, and has led to the development of the sub-set of evidentiary propositions peculiar to the admission of additional evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence.” [21]  After noting the further difficulty in determining whether the relevant “event or circumstance” is the psychological condition or the diagnosis [22]  Simpson J concluded: [23] 
	


“For myself, I would question the too ready acceptance that a psychological report post dating sentencing, is, because it is prepared after sentencing, fresh or new evidence. The substance of the evidence is not the existence of the report, but the history and opinions expressed in the report concerning the applicant's psychological condition.”


	
	Simpson J further emphasised that, even if the evidence did cast light on circumstances known but not fully appreciated at the time of sentencing, the admission of such evidence remained a discretionary function of the court. [24]  Not only is that desirable in order to ensure that evidence which might have been obtained prior to sentencing is not deliberately held back, as a forensic stratagem, but also because of the need to assess the materiality of the evidence.
	
	
	The evidence sought to be relied upon in the present case has been identified by R A Hulme J in terms which need not be repeated. As he explains, the evidence now proffered should not properly have resulted in a more lenient sentence. Accordingly, the evidence should not be admitted. If it were thought appropriate to admit the evidence in the particular circumstances of this application, it nevertheless could not provide a sufficient basis for a grant of leave to appeal.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Mr Richard Wright seeks leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Woodburne SC in the District Court at Sydney on 6 February 2015 in respect of a number of child sexual assault offences he committed in the early 1960's upon his stepdaughter.
	
	
	Her Honour imposed an overall sentence of 4 years 5 months with a non-parole component of 2 years dating from 2 October 2014. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 1 October 2016.
	
	
	Details of the individual offences, maximum penalties and sentences imposed appear in the following table. Each offence is contrary to sections of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Each sentence was reduced by 12.5 per cent because of the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty.
	



	
		
			
			Count 1
			
			
			Indecent assault (s 76 – max 5 years) between 1.1.61 and 30.4.62

			2 years 7 months from 2.1.15

			NPP 1 year 3 months
			
		
	



	
	The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal:
	


""Fresh evidence in respect of the applicant's health shows that a miscarriage of justice occurred in the sentence proceedings.""


	
	The ""fresh evidence"" concerns an aspect of the applicant's health which was not discovered until after he was sentenced. He has been diagnosed as suffering from Probable Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer's disease.
	


Facts


	
	The complainant was born in 1948. Her mother married the applicant in 1959 when he was aged 29. He was born in 1930 and is now aged 86.
	
	
	Count 1: Sometime between 1 January 1961 and 30 April 1962 when the complainant was aged 12 or 13 there was an occasion when the applicant put a towel on the complainant's bed and put oil on his hands. While she was lying on the towel he rubbed her thighs and digitally penetrated her vagina. Her mother witnessed this and asked what was going on. The applicant replied, ""I'm helping her to lose weight, what do you think is going on here?"" The mother left the room and the applicant continued what he was doing.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge assessed this offence as ""a very serious instance of an offence of its type"".
	
	
	Count 2: Sometime between 24 October 1961 and 30 April 1962 when the complainant was aged 13 there was an occasion when she was in a bedroom and the applicant entered wearing only a shirt. She was shocked to see his erect penis. He commanded her to lay on the bed and he removed her clothing. He rubbed her genitalia and digitally penetrated her vagina a number of times which caused a stinging sensation. He then said to her, ""I love you, I love you, you're ripe for the picking. When I married your mother she wasn't a virgin but you are"". He then inserted his penis in her vagina which caused her to cry out in pain. He said to her, ""Shh"". The complainant experienced immense pain and blacked out. She was unable to say for how long he penetrated her. When he finished he wiped her vagina roughly with a towel.
	
	
	This offence was assessed by the judge as being ""a very serious example of an offence committed in contravention of s 73 Crimes Act"".
	
	
	Count 3: This event occurred later on the same day as the event in Count 2. The complainant was in the lounge room and he told her, ""I love you, you're so special"". They kissed and he laughed because she was responding to him. He then had penile vaginal intercourse with her on the linoleum covered floor which she found to be extremely painful.
	
	
	The judge assessed this offence as serious, but less so than the offence in Count 2.
	
	
	It was an agreed fact that the applicant continued having sexual intercourse with the complainant over the following years. He would take her in his car to secluded locations. The complainant recalled that if she was having a bad day or was upset the applicant would say to her, ""I know what you need"", meaning that he would have sex with her.
	
	
	Count 4: This event occurred between 24 October 1963 and 23 October 1964 when the complainant was aged 15. He took her for a drive to a secluded location when he had penile vaginal intercourse with her which culminated in him ejaculating on the ground beside her.
	
	
	The judge accepted the submission by the applicant's counsel that this offence was not the most serious example of such offending (the Crown did not contend that it was) but it remained a serious matter.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	A victim impact statement was prepared by the complainant and read out in the District Court. The learned judge regarded it as ""an eloquent reminder to this Court and the community of the damage done by the criminal actions of the offender"". She described the statement as an expression by the complainant of ""the continuing emotional and psychological damage caused by the offender's actions"" and noted that the ""hurt, pain and dislocation has endured over many years"". She considered it was to the complainant's credit ""that she had survived the sexual assaults committed upon her and that she has managed to have the courage and fortitude to appear before the Court to inform the Court of the damage done"".
	
	
	There is no complaint about the manner in which the judge had regard to the statement. It describes in considerable detail the variety of very tragic and deleterious effects that offences of this type can cause their victims. The psychological, emotional and life-changing responses of the complainant, even over half a century after her abuse by the applicant, are palpable.
	


Complaint, investigation and the course of proceedings


	
	The complainant made her first complaint to the authorities when she was living in Western Australia in mid-2009.
	
	
	In September 2009 the applicant was interviewed by Western Australian police in relation to his offending in the late 1980's and early 1990's in relation to two other female children, one being his step-granddaughter. During that interview he made partial admissions of having interfered with the complainant in the present matter.
	
	
	In September 2010 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court of Western Australia in relation to the offences concerning the other children. He received a sentence of 18 months imprisonment which was suspended for 2 years.
	
	
	The Western Australian police sent information to police in this State in November 2010 and an investigation commenced. In September 2013 an arrest warrant was issued which was executed in November that year in Queensland where the applicant was then living. He was extradited to this State and remained in custody until he was released on bail in March 2014.
	
	
	The applicant was committed for trial on 8 May 2014. A trial in the District Court was scheduled for 29 September 2014. In the weeks preceding the trial the applicant instructed his solicitors to enter into charge negotiations with the prosecutor which led to pleas of guilty being entered on 29 September 2014.
	
	
	The matter came before Woodburne SC DCJ on 18 December 2014. Judgment was reserved and the applicant was sentenced by her Honour on 6 February 2015.
	
	
	The Registrar granted an application for an extension of time to file a Notice of Intention to Appeal on 10 April 2015. The life of the notice was twice extended, ultimately to 30 March 2016. The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed on 9 March 2016. Accordingly, notwithstanding the time that had elapsed, no extension of time is required. Although I make no criticism, it is unfortunate that the matter has taken so long to proceed in the appellate phase given the applicant's non-parole period expires on 1 October 2016.
	


The applicant's personal circumstances including his ill-health


	
	The judge stated that the determination of the appropriate sentence was made more complex in this case by reason of the passage of time; the change in sentencing practices in the ensuing period; the applicant's advanced age (she noted he was soon to turn 85); delay; and ill-health.
	
	
	A number of documents concerning the applicant's ill-health were tendered in the sentencing proceedings: reports by Dr Emma Brown, the applicant's general practitioner, and Dr Stuart Reader, ophthalmologist; Justice Health medical records and a summary of the same; and an affidavit by the applicant.
	
	
	The judge noted that in the applicant's affidavit he listed his health conditions: advanced macular degeneration, being almost completely blind in one eye; chronic obstructive airway disease; chronic renal failure; hyperthyroidism; peptic ulcer; arthritis; and other degenerative changes. He said that he suffered from dizziness, shortness of breath and nose bleeds and back pain from a previous back injury.
	
	
	Dr Brown's report confirmed that the applicant had significant visual loss due to macular degeneration; chronic kidney disease requiring blood test monitoring; hypertension and hyperthyroidism requiring regular oral medication; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring inhaled therapy. She considered that whilst the future of these conditions was uncertain, the applicant's renal function and respiratory condition may well deteriorate.
	
	
	Dr Reader confirmed a diagnosis of advanced macular degeneration. It was his opinion that the condition could continue to deteriorate. He said, ""Given the fact that the offender is almost legally blind, a period of incarceration would be more difficult for him in relation to his ocular problems"".
	
	
	The Justice Health records related to the period in which the applicant was in custody from 21 November 2013 to 26 March 2014. He had received treatment at the eye clinic at Prince of Wales Hospital and had also been referred for physiotherapy for bilateral arthritis and osteoporosis treatment. He had also been referred to a psychologist because he was teary and not coping being in custody. Arrangements were made to have his blood pressure checked weekly. He was housed on a downstairs level to minimise the risk of falls.
	
	
	The judge referred to all of these matters (I have drawn the above summary from her judgment). She considered that the applicant's various conditions were amenable to treatment in the custodial environment although she added that she was not discounting their relevance. Her Honour accepted that imprisonment would be ""a greater burden on him by reason of his state of health and his advanced age"". This was relevant to the determination of the length of a sentence of imprisonment including the non-parole period.
	
	
	Another aspect rendering the applicant's custodial experience more difficult that the judge took into account was the fact that he would be separated from his 90 year old wife and other family members who lived interstate and were unable to visit regularly.
	
	
	A short time later in the judgment her Honour reiterated that she accepted the applicant would ""find his incarceration more difficult than would otherwise be the case than if he was in good health and not of advanced age"". It was ""a significant consideration and a matter that calls for mitigation of punishment"". (Emphasis added)
	
	
	Other matters taken into account in the assessment of sentence included the applicant's prior good character; he had no criminal history at the time of the index offences. This was considered in the context of him having offended over a number of years. Reference was also made to the subsequent sexual offending against two children in Western Australia. Her Honour also noted that the applicant had family support as indicated by their presence in court and by a testimonial by the daughter of his current wife. (His former wife of 42 years, the mother of the complainant, had died in 2002 and he remarried in 2005.)
	
	
	The judge was not satisfied that the applicant had any insight or remorse for his offending and the impact of that offending upon the complainant. Nevertheless she accepted that he was unlikely to reoffend given his age and ill-health.
	
	
	The delay in the present matters being prosecuted and brought to finalisation was taken into account. Her Honour’s consideration of this issue was detailed and, given there is now no complainant about the subject it is unnecessary to say more except to observe that her Honour noted and took into account that the applicant had aged and his health had deteriorated.
	
	
	Another aspect of delay that her Honour dealt with was the fact that it was necessary for sentencing to be assessed with regard to the significant change in the approach to sentencing in the period since the offences were committed. She referred to relevant authority in this Court on the subject (e.g. the five-judge bench decision in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368) and, again, given there is no complaint about the manner in which her Honour dealt with this issue there is no need to say more.
	
	
	Special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were found so as to justify a reduction in the proportion of the sentences (including the total effective sentence) represented by the non-parole component. This finding was based upon a combination of the changed sentencing practices; the applicant's age and ill-health; the conditions he would experience in custody; and the fact that individual sentences would be partially accumulated.
	


The fresh evidence


	
	An affidavit by the applicant's present solicitor affirmed on 3 March 2016 was read at the hearing of the application. Annexed to the affidavit was a report by Dr Sharon Reutens, consultant psychiatrist, of 25 February 2016 as well as a number of documents to which she had referred including a report of a neuropsychological assessment by Dr Susan van den Berg dated 4 September 2015.
	
	
	Dr van den Berg’s report includes the following:
	


“The predominant impression is that Alzheimer’s pathology is the most likely underlying cause of Mr Wright’s presentation.

…

Mr Wright’s diagnosis remains tentative and he will require follow up to monitor his functioning. Reassessment in 12 months is recommended, using the current results as a baseline, to help clarify the clinical picture and confirm the diagnosis.

Given Mr Wright’s advancing age, physical limitations and cognitive difficulties, he is likely to be vulnerable in a mainstream custodial setting. It is also likely that his cognitive abilities will decline over time. As such, he would benefit from placement in a supportive environment which is able to cater for his aged care needs, such as the Kevin Waller Unit at Long Bay Correctional Complex.”


	
	Dr Reutens' curriculum vitae includes that she has advanced training in neuropsychiatry and old age psychiatry. She is employed as a Senior Visiting Medical Officer in Psychogeriatrics with Justice Health and as such is involved in management of the psychiatric needs of the older inmate population.
	
	
	Dr Reutens’ diagnosis of the applicant was: Probable Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer's disease. She wrote:
	


""The diagnosis of a DSM 5 Major Neurocognitive Disorder, more commonly termed dementia, was made on the basis of a history of memory deficits that were more prominent for recent than remote events. Mr Wright had deficits of memory, attention and executive function (planning, language generation, abstract thinking) and orientation, indicating that the impairment affected several areas of cognition.

… The documentation does not indicate any abrupt cognitive decline or significant illnesses, and the cognitive impairments noted on neuropsychological testing about 6 months prior are roughly similar. Therefore, a slow degenerative disease such as an Alzheimer's-type dementia, possibly with concomitant vascular aetiology (based on the history of hypertension and past history of smoking) is the most probable cause of the cognitive impairment.""


	
	She described Alzheimer's and Vascular type dementias as slowly progressing conditions that present with obvious clinical symptoms some years after the onset of the disease. She considered that the applicant ""most likely had cognitive impairment while he was on remand"". An episode of confusion recorded in the Justice Health records on 31 January 2014 was, with hindsight, a warning sign of cognitive impairment.
	
	
	When asked by the applicant's solicitor in his letter requesting Dr Reutens to make an assessment of his client whether incarceration affects the symptoms of the condition she responded: ""incarceration is unlikely to affect the pathogenesis or expression of the disease in any material way"".
	
	
	As to whether the applicant's experience of incarceration is affected by the symptoms of the condition she wrote:
	


""[The applicant's] experience of incarceration is affected because of the combination of dementia with his sensory impairments. He is essentially blind and at the interview appeared to have a hearing impairment as well. One of the mainstays of therapy for dementia is activity. Diversional activities provide quality of life, and mitigate against the development of behavioural disturbance of dementia (BPSD), however there are limited activities that are able to be provided in prison, and [the applicant] cannot participate in most of the offered activities in the Kevin Waller Unit (gardening, reading, painting) because of the visual impairment, and he has nothing to occupy him after lock-in in the afternoon.

Therefore, he is currently experiencing greater hardship than most of the other older prisoners in the Wing.""


	
	Dr Reutens said that to mitigate the symptoms, the applicant ""would, ideally, be able to engage in meaningful activities suitable for visually impaired people with cognitive impairment. If he were in the community, [the applicant] could attend a centre with activities for cognitively impaired people"". She added:
	


""He is at risk for delirium due to his cognitive deterioration and sensory impairment. Therefore a regular routine and limiting changes in his cell placement would help prevent episodes of confusion.""


	
	Dr Reutens referred to a relevant academic work and reported that the prognosis for Alzheimer's dementia is of a gradual deterioration in cognition until death. Given his advanced age, the applicant would be expected to be at the shorter end of the range of life span, something in the order of several years. She said that during this time it is expected that he would gradually lose independence and will become carer dependent, culminating in the terminal stage where he would be unaware of his environment.
	
	
	In a further report dated 7 June 2016 (annexed to an affidavit affirmed by the applicant's solicitor on 8 June 2016) Dr Reutens noted a number of difficulties the applicant had experienced in custody in attending to daily activities (for example, requiring prompting to shower and assistance to ensure he took medications). She referred to the applicant lacking the assistance a person with cognitive impairment can rely upon by way of visual prompts, cues and reminders. She said he would benefit from having a carer to assist him. She also referred to various facilities that are available in the community to assist persons in the applicant's situation: home care; a community team or carer to liaise with services that could assist; and adult day care centres to provide diversional activities and social interaction.
	
	
	Other material annexed to the solicitor's affidavit of 8 June is informative of the various services and facilities that could be available to the applicant in the community.
	
	
	An affidavit sworn by the ""inmate-carer"" assigned to the Kevin Waller Unit where the applicant has been held since shortly after he was sentenced provides information as to the care and assistance he provides to the applicant and the other 21 elderly male inmates of the unit. A number of these inmates suffer from dementia as well as a range of other physical disabilities. Reference is made to the apparent confusion expressed by the applicant as to why he is there and when he is due for release.
	


Principles in relation to fresh evidence and their application


	
	There are limits on the ability of this Court to receive fresh or new evidence. Simpson J (as her Honour then was) provided a most detailed and useful summary of the relevant principles in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [104]-[121]. It is, however, sufficient for present purposes to refer to the more succinct summary provided in the written submissions of senior counsel for the applicant:
	


1.   ""Fresh evidence"" is to be distinguished from ""new evidence"": fresh evidence is evidence which was not available or which could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence at the time of sentence; new evidence is evidence which was available but not used or which could have been obtained with reasonable diligence: R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 at 330.

2.   Generally, neither fresh evidence nor new evidence is received on appeal, as a reflection of the principle of finality: Cornwell v R [2015] NSWCCA 269 at [39]. Fresh evidence or new evidence will only be received where a miscarriage of justice is shown: R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 377-378; or where it is in the interests of justice: Cornwell v R at [59].

3.   Evidence of events or circumstances that have arisen entirely since sentence is not received. However, evidence may be received of events or circumstances which existed at the time of sentence but which were unknown, or the significance of which was unappreciated. The rationale for reception of the evidence is that the court proceeded on an erroneous view of the facts: Khoury v R at [110]-[115].

4.   The determination to receive the evidence is discretionary. Caution must be exercised and a proper basis for admission of the evidence must be established: Khoury v R at [117].

5.   Factors relevant to the determination to receive the evidence include the circumstances of, and any explanation for, the failure to produce the evidence at first instance and the potential significance of the evidence to the outcome: Khoury v R at [121].


	
	The final point was elaborated upon earlier in the judgment of Simpson J in Khoury v R:
	


""[108] If evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion - the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance. If it is not judged to have that capacity, its admission is pointless, and, while it has to be considered in order for that evaluation to be made, the evidence may not, in the result, be acted upon: see, for example, Fordham.""


	
	In his judgment in Turkmani v R [2014] NSWCCA 186, Beech-Jones J referred (at [66]) to three examples of the application of the principle concerning the receipt of evidence derived after sentencing:
	


a)   Where the offender was diagnosed with a condition after sentence but was affected by it at the time of sentence.

b)   Where, although the symptoms of a condition may have been present, their significance was not appreciated at the time of sentencing.

c)   Where a person was sentenced on the expectation that they would receive a particular level of medical care and attention in custody but they did not.

Submissions for the applicant


	
	In the present case it is contended that the evidence qualifies as ""fresh evidence"" and that it falls within the first and second of the examples referred to by Beech-Jones J in Turkmani v R. The episode of confusion exhibited by the applicant in January 2014 was referred to as indicating that the onset of dementia pre-dated the applicant’s sentencing.
	
	
	As to the significance of the evidence, senior counsel for the applicant submitted, first, that the sentencing judge found that there was no evidence that the applicant would not receive appropriate medical treatment in prison, whereas the fresh evidence establishes that his imprisonment limits his access to therapy recommended for his disease. Secondly, it was submitted that while the judge accepted that the applicant's imprisonment would be more burdensome because of his age and poor health, the fresh evidence establishes that it may be a greater burden than was anticipated.
	
	
	For these reasons, it was submitted, the factual basis upon which sentence was determined was erroneous and there had thereby been a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant raised a new argument at the hearing of the application. By reference to R v AB [2015] NSWCCA 57 he contended that some of the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to which the sentencing judge had regard were really inapt in the applicant's circumstances; specifically, denunciation and making him accountable for his actions. If the judge had been aware of what is now known about the applicant there would have been a significant difference in the sentence imposed.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	Senior counsel for the Crown conceded that it would be open to the Court to receive the evidence on the basis identified in the submissions for the applicant.
	
	
	It was not, however, conceded that the evidence establishes that the applicant's custodial experience is more onerous than was appreciated when he was sentenced.
	
	
	Reference was made to Dr Reutens’ first report in which she spoke of the inevitable progression of the applicant’s dementia and identified the ""limited treatments available"". It was argued that there was nothing in the report to suggest that the applicant is not being appropriately cared for in custody.
	
	
	A further submission was that the applicant's non-parole period of 2 years expires in under 4 months time on 1 October 2016. There is no evidence that in the 16 months that have elapsed since he was sentenced and returned to custody there has been any decline in his ability to manage. Further, there is no evidence that any further (gradual) decline in the ensuing months will be of such magnitude so as to impact on his ability to manage in a manner similar to which he has to date.
	
	
	In short, the Crown submitted that when regard is had to the range of ill-health factors, coupled with the applicant's advanced age, to which the sentencing judge had regard, this Court would not be satisfied that incarceration would be more onerous than her Honour anticipated. The offences were found to be objectively serious and the Crown contended that the fresh evidence did not justify any reduction when ""considerable leniency"" had already been factored into the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	In meeting the new argument based upon R v AB that was raised by the applicant at the hearing, senior counsel for the Crown contended that the circumstances of that case were quite different to those of the present case
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence properly qualifies as fresh evidence that this Court could receive in accordance with the principles to which I have earlier referred. I am not, however, persuaded that the Court should exercise its discretion to receive it because it is insufficient to warrant a fresh assessment of sentence. (I have since had the benefit of reading in draft the very useful analysis of Basten JA which further confirms the view I have formed.)
	
	
	The primary judge's reasons disclose that she approached her task very carefully, giving attention to both the seriousness of the offences as well as the substantial mitigation arising from various factors including (but not limited to) the applicant's advanced age and his multifaceted ill-health. She said a number of times that the applicant's incarceration would be more difficult than it otherwise might be. She regarded this as ""a significant consideration and a matter that calls for mitigation of punishment and a matter to be brought into account … in the determination of the appropriate sentence"".
	
	
	Sympathies might be aroused by the reports that have recently come to hand which disclose that an elderly inmate who was sentenced on the basis of having a variety of significant conditions of physical ill-health is now found to have dementia from which he is gradually declining. But is more weight to the difficulties of being incarcerated justified when such consideration already formed a major component of the assessment of sentence? In my view, in the circumstances of this case that question must be answered in the negative. The sentence imposed already represents a lenient outcome when regard is had to the gravity of the applicant's offending and the enduring harm that it caused.
	


R v AB


	
	The argument of senior counsel for the applicant concerning the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires some detailed attention. The circumstances in R v AB were, as the Crown contended, rather different. There the respondent was the subject of a special hearing under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) because he had been found unfit to be tried on a charge of having murdered his estranged wife. He was aged 64 at the time of the killing and was almost 69 at the time the case was finalised. Psychiatric opinion was to the effect that he suffered from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He was also diagnosed with dementia (probably caused by long term hazardous alcohol consumption), cerebro vascular disease and possible Alzheimer's dementia. There were also a number of physical ailments.
	
	
	The primary judge found the respondent to be not guilty of murder but that on the limited evidence available he had committed the offence of manslaughter upon the basis of him being substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind (s 23A of the Crimes Act). A limiting term of 7 years was imposed. (No non-parole period is specified when a limiting term is nominated.) In the course of his reasons the primary judge said:
	


""A limiting term that is likely to end after an offender's understanding of where he or she is and why serves no useful public purpose and is, therefore, pointless … .""


	
	One of the grounds of the Crown appeal against the asserted inadequacy of the limiting term was that the judge ""erred in principle in his statement of a 'purpose' of a limiting term"". The ground was rejected.
	
	
	Simpson J (as her Honour then was) set out the various purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A:
	


“(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c) to protect the community from the offender,

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""


	
	She found (at [42]) the matter in (a) to be irrelevant by reference to authority for the proposition that the purpose of nominating a limiting term is not to punish. That is the first difference with the circumstances of the present case.
	
	
	Her Honour said that findings of the primary judge (the respondent's mental disability rendered him an unsuitable vehicle for general deterrence and he would not commit another act of violence) rendered the matters in (b)-(e) irrelevant.
	
	
	Her Honour also considered (at [45]) that denunciation of the respondent's conduct was in the same category as general deterrence because both stemmed from his diminished moral culpability which in turn arose from his impaired mental capacity.
	
	
	Recognition of the harm done to the deceased, her daughter and to the community was held to remain of relevance and it was not established that the primary judge had overlooked the fact.
	
	
	In the present case the judge made reference to s 3A and, after listing its content, she remarked: ""Of course, the weight to be attributed to each of these matters depends on the facts of the case"". She continued:
	


""In the present case it remains important to denounce the offender's crimes, to make him accountable for his actions and to recognise the harm done to the victims of the crime and the community"".


	
	The sentence to be imposed upon the applicant was to be in the form of a punishment, unlike the limiting term in R v AB. Accordingly, it was appropriate for her Honour to have regard to the need to ensure the respondent was adequately punished for his offences (with such assessment having to be made in the light of all relevant factors). There was no suggestion of the respondent's moral culpability for his crimes being diminished and so denunciation was also a matter her Honour could factor into the assessment (qualified by the various mitigating features). Finally, there was no argument about the relevance of recognising the harm done to the complainant. As to the other purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A, the judge made no other specific reference to them so it may be assumed that they did not loom large in her approach.
	
	
	Another point of distinction between the present case and R v AB is that the length of the limiting term under consideration in the latter was significantly longer than the sentence in this case (7 years as opposed to a non-parole period of 2 years). The concern of the primary judge in that case not to impose a term that would exceed the period in which the respondent would retain some awareness of where he was, and why, does not have the same degree of significance in this case.
	
	
	I am not persuaded of the applicant's contention that the fresh material presented to this Court would have made a significant difference to the sentence.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


Leave to appeal against sentence refused.


	
	FAGAN J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2769785,YY v Regina [2016] NSWCCA 124,"Judgment


	
	HARRISON J: The appellant pleaded guilty to three counts of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was sentenced in March 2010 in the District Court of New South Wales. He successfully appealed against that sentence to this Court and was re-sentenced in March 2011 as follows:
	


Count 1: supplying a prohibited drug, namely 8.02 grams of cocaine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Act - imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 26 February 2009 expiring on 25 February 2010.

Count 2: supplying a prohibited drug, namely 85.15 grams of cocaine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Act - imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 26 August 2009 expiring on 25 August 2011.

Count 3: supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely 5.9573 kilograms of cocaine, contrary to s 25(2) of the Act - taking into account the Form 1- imprisonment for a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 26 August 2009 expiring on 25 August 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 25 August 2021.

Form 1: two charges of supply prohibited drug and two charges of possess unlawfully obtained goods were taken into account in accordance with ss 32 and 35 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Section 166 Certificate: deal with property suspected to be proceeds of crime, namely $1,313,700, contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 - a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 26 February 2009 expiring on 25 February 2010.


	
	Counts 1 and 2 attracted a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment with no standard non-parole period. Count 3 attracted a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	Following a somewhat complicated appellate history thereafter, the precise details of which it is presently unnecessary to recite, the appellant’s case was referred to this Court pursuant to s 86 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. In those circumstances, this Court is required to approach the present proceedings “as if the Court of Criminal Appeal’s sentence [in March 2011] was itself the subject of an appeal under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, such that if error be detected, it is for this court itself to impose the appropriate sentence pursuant to s 6(3)”: Louizos v R [2014] NSWCCA 242 at [6]. Leave to appeal is not required.
	
	
	The appellant appeals upon a single ground as follows:
	


Ground 1: The sentencing judge at first instance and then the Court of Criminal Appeal in the appellant’s initial appeal erred in their consideration of the standard non-parole period in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.


	
	Section 6(3) 0f the Criminal Appeal Act  1912 provides as follows:
	


“6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases

(3) On an appeal under section 5 (1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.”


	
	The Crown concedes the error contended for by the appellant. However, the Crown submits that after exercising its own independent sentencing discretion, this Court would conclude that no lesser sentence is warranted in law. The single issue in this appeal is therefore that arising under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	


Details of the offending


	
	In August 2008, Rose Bay detectives commenced investigations into the supply of prohibited drugs by the offender in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. On 23 September 2008, a controlled operation was undertaken.
	


Count 1


	
	On 24 December 2008, an undercover operative arranged to meet the appellant at the Paddington Bowling Club car park at the end of Quarry Street, Paddington. The undercover officer handed the applicant $2,500 in pre-recorded buy money, and received thirteen small resealable plastic bags containing a quantity of white powder. A subsequent analysis of the white powder by the Division of Analytical Laboratories revealed the substance to be cocaine, with a total weight of 8.02 grams.
	
	
	The facts in relation to the first offence on the Form 1 concern similar events that occurred on 30 December 2008. The total weight of cocaine was 8.1 grams.
	
	
	The facts in relation to the second offence on the Form 1 were as follows. At approximately 9.45am on 25 February 2009, police commenced surveillance of the appellant. At approximately 11.40am, the appellant drove from his home address in Sutherland Street, Paddington. He was followed to the Phoenix Hotel at the corner of Moncur and Wallis Streets, Woollahra. A man got out of the front passenger seat of the vehicle. The vehicle drove about a further fifteen metres before stopping, and another person got out of that vehicle. The vehicle then drove off and the person who got out was stopped and searched. Located in his sock were two small resealable plastic bags containing a quantity of white powder. A subsequent analysis of the white powder by the Division of Analytical Laboratories revealed the substance to be cocaine with a total weight of 1.44 grams.
	


Count 2


	
	The facts, in part, in relation to Count 2 on the indictment and offence number 3 on the Form 1 are as follows. At approximately 11.50am, the appellant was stopped in a motor vehicle in Ocean Street, Woollahra. He was arrested and cautioned. When he was removed from the motor vehicle, a silver-blue and white metal canister fell onto the roadway and was recovered by police. Located inside it were forty-six resealable plastic bags containing a quantity of white powder. These items were seized. Also located in the vehicle was a spiral notepad containing names and figures and two mobile telephones. The offender was searched and found to be in possession of $3,740. A subsequent analysis of the white powder by the Division of Analytical Laboratories revealed the substance to be cocaine with a total weight of 34 grams.
	
	
	The further facts in relation to Count 2 in the indictment and offence number 4 on the Form 1 are as follows. Police executed a search warrant at the appellant's residence in Sutherland Street, Paddington. During the search, the police located a black backpack containing an A4-sized envelope with nine bundles of cash totalling $50,000. This money was seized. The black backpack contained another A4-sized envelope that was sealed. This envelope contained two vacuum-sealed bags with numerous smaller resealable plastic bags containing quantities of white powder. A subsequent analysis of the white powder by the Division of Analytical Laboratories revealed the substance to be cocaine with a total weight of 51.15 grams.
	


Count 3


	
	On 26 February 2009, the police received information that the appellant owned premises in Sutherland Crescent, Darling Point, where he kept prohibited drugs. Police executed a search warrant at these premises and located the following things:
	



	
	A cardboard box containing fifty bundles of $50 notes bundled into $5,000 amounts totalling $250,000.
	
	
	A cardboard box containing one hundred bundles of $50 notes, bundled into $5,000 amounts totalling $500,000 and fifty bundles of $100 notes bundled into $10,000 amounts totalling $500,000.
	
	
	Two bundles of notes totalling $18,700.
	
	
	A Nokia mobile telephone box containing nine bundles of $50 notes bundled into $5,000 amounts totalling $45,000.
	
	
	350 resealable plastic bags and seven packages containing 255 grams of cocaine.
	
	
	2,000 resealable plastic bags in forty packages containing 1.47 kilograms of cocaine.
	
	
	Two compressed blocks of beige substance being cocaine weighing 992.2 grams and 994.5 grams respectively.
	
	
	Six lots of five plastic bags in a heat-sealed package containing 2.2456 kilograms of cocaine.
	
	
	A total of $1,313,700 in cash and 5.9573 kilograms of cocaine was located on the premises.
	
	
	A number of unused resealable plastic bags similar to those containing the cocaine, and an electronic money counting machine.
	



	
	On 27 February 2009, the appellant attended the Rose Bay Police Station and was arrested. He declined to be interviewed.
	


Appellant’s submissions


	
	These submissions sought to emphasise the appellant’s strong subjective case, particularly in light of developments since March 2011. The matters referred to are supported by recent affidavits upon which the appellant relied in this Court. These are referred to below.
	


Subjective features


	
	The appellant was born in September 1972. He was 36 years old at the time of the offending and is now 43 years old. The uncontested evidence reveals the following things about him.
	
	
	The appellant had an ambivalent relationship with his parents, particularly his mother, and a distant relationship with his father. He had a good relationship with his aunt and uncle, the latter being a police officer who gave evidence on his behalf in earlier proceedings. He had a long history of employment, starting when he was 15 years of age. He acquired and successfully operated his own restaurant business and was involved in modest property development.
	
	
	The appellant had a minor criminal record of no present significance. He demonstrated remorse.
	
	
	The appellant began using cocaine as a stimulant to boost his energy levels while operating restaurants from 2000 to 2007 and while caring for his chronically ill father from 2003 until his death in 2008. The appellant then became involved in selling cocaine initially as a source of funds to pay his business suppliers. His own cocaine problem began to erode his wealth and began to affect his health and judgment. He was not motivated by greed and did not cut or dilute the cocaine that he on-sold. His hyper manic style of socialising and energy led to his wide acceptance in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, which he found extremely rewarding as a motivation for continuing to supply cocaine.
	
	
	Although his supply operation was of a significant size, the appellant was not involved in an organized supply chain and he had no one beneath him in any hierarchy. The scale of his supply operation was instead said to be a product of his engaging personality.
	
	
	The appellant’s offending was consistent with what Dr Rowe described as “an impulsive, careless, poorly considered thought process.” One example of that consisted in the fact that a tin full of cocaine fell out of his car when he was pulled over and arrested by the police. Dr Rowe considered that the appellant was not a “seasoned drug dealer” but rather an “impulsive, careless and disorganised individual with an inattention to detail…suffering the effects of a hyper manic episode together with other psychiatric symptoms” who “did not consider the potential consequences of his actions or the potential dangers to himself and his family or the community members who were using the cocaine.”
	


Assistance


	
	The appellant has been required to serve his custody in protection. He was originally given a 25 percent discount for his early plea of guilty and a further 20 percent discount for his assistance to authorities. Matters relevant to the appellant’s assistance have been referred to in the affidavit of his former solicitor, Wayne Vincent Annis-Brown, sworn 9 December 2010. That affidavit deals with the appellant’s conditions in custody in protection, and the fact that his family have had to leave Australia as the result of direct threats made to them.
	


Education and personal circumstances


	
	The appellant’s first child was an infant at the time of his arrest, and his second child was born while he was in custody. Mr Annis-Brown’s affidavit also details the appellant’s progress towards a Bachelor of Business degree while in custody, as well as additional courses undertaken by him in literature and technology.
	
	
	The appellant was moved from a Sydney gaol to a correctional centre in country New South Wales on 8 June 2011, where he remained on protection. Although that move was in some respects an improvement for him, the appellant received far fewer visits there from his friends and family. The appellant unsuccessfully sought a prison transfer to the United Kingdom to be closer to his family. The appellant’s wife commenced proceedings for divorce in 2014 as a result of the strain associated with the length of his sentence, associated uncertainties for her and the children, and her anxiety about the future and the appellant’s release. The appellant has not seen his children since 2014 although he maintains weekly telephone contact with them.
	
	
	These circumstances notwithstanding, the appellant has continued to make significant progress in custody. He completed his university degree in June 2013 with distinction. He then completed his Masters of Business Administration from Charles Sturt University in December 2015.
	


Remorse


	
	The appellant contends that he has demonstrated significant and continuing remorse. This has been amplified as the result of his experiences with drug affected inmates. He has cut all contact with his former social group, and undertook the Getting Smart Drug and Alcohol Programme in gaol in August 2013. The appellant’s active participation in this group and his mentoring of younger offenders prompted gaol staff to request that he undertake a TAFE programme in mentoring, which he completed in December 2013. The appellant has acted as a Peer Support Inmate and has been elected to the Inmate Delegate Committee in three years. The appellant has worked in custody whenever possible, and held senior positions as Manager of Industries, Activities Clerk and Clerk to the Kitchen/Laundry overseer.
	
	
	The appellant has progressed to minimum security classification. He was permitted to work off premises. He has incurred no infringements of prison rules during his seven years in custody. The appellant was moved to a Sydney gaol in February 2016.
	


Delay


	
	The sentence that this Court is required to impose has been significantly delayed by reason of matters beyond the appellant’s control.
	
	
	The offending occurred in 2008 and 2009. The appellant has been in custody since February 2009. He was immediately cooperative and pleaded at the earliest available opportunity. He was first sentenced in March 2010. That sentence was quashed on appeal to this Court in March 2011 and the appellant was re-sentenced. Following the High Court’s decision in Muldrock, the appellant applied for a referral to this Court on 27 August 2013. Disposition of the appellant’s application was significantly delayed by the time required to identify and review cases potentially afflicted with so-called Muldrock error. The appellant’s Part 7 application was determined in June 2014 and was erroneously refused. The appellant commenced proceedings seeking declaratory relief in the Court of Appeal on 17 November 2014. That relief was granted in July 2015, upon the basis of a finding of jurisdictional error. The appellant once again applied to have his matter referred to this Court on 11 September 2015. That application was successfully determined in December 2015. Argument in this Court in the present appeal was heard on 20 April 2016.
	
	
	The appellant submitted by way of summary that he has facilitated the course of justice from the point of his arrest and has so far served a sentence that was imposed contrary to law. That is despite all of the procedural steps referred to above. The appellant submitted that the delay has been extraordinary and that the number of proceedings that he has been required to commence in order to correct multiple errors, together with the enduring uncertainty that he has had to confront, are matters that should be taken into account in resentencing.
	


Respondent’s submissions


	
	In the way of things, this appeal was effectively conducted around competing contentions concerning the objective seriousness of the appellant’s offending. In that respect, the respondent emphasised the following matters.
	
	
	The offences were characterised as very serious drug offences involving a high level of criminality. The respondent submitted that Count 3 in particular should be assessed “as falling well above the middle range of objective seriousness.” That is said to be for a number of reasons.
	
	
	First, the appellant played an exclusive and singular role in the supply of almost six kilograms of cocaine. He was a very active and significant retailer to what appears to have been an extensive and eager clientele who would appear regularly to have purchased from him. The appellant had been operating a large scale retail drug supply operation to a large network of Eastern Suburbs drug users for some years.
	
	
	Secondly, the operation was patently highly profitable.
	
	
	Thirdly, the background to Count 3 concerned the supply of one or two 0.75g bags of cocaine up to as much as 8g at a time. This included supply in a public place with a brazen disregard for the law. The supply was to a previously unknown recipient through a mobile phone introduction. No prior assessment or check of the purchaser would appear to have been made by the appellant.
	
	
	Fourthly, Count 3 involved almost six kilograms of cocaine (5.9573kg) or six times the large commercial quantity, capable of being sold as 7,943 separate 0.75g deals. When apprehended by police the cocaine was made up of 2,350 resealable bags containing a total of 1.72 kilograms of cocaine ready for sale together with a further 4.23 kilograms of cocaine in various bulk forms apparently awaiting division into smaller quantities for sale.
	
	
	Fifthly, the purity of the cocaine in small retail bags was in the order of from 31 percent to 39 percent and the purity of the cocaine in the two 1 kilogram bags was 49 percent and 52 percent respectively.
	
	
	Sixthly, the appellant was in possession of a blender, a bulk quantity of small resealable plastic bags, an electronic money counting machine, two mobile phones used in the appellant’s drug supply activities and a drug sales ledger. These items were together said to be indicative of a large scale supply operation.
	
	
	Finally, the amount of money discovered at the appellant’s premises was very high, being $1,313,700 in cash. That money was an indication of the extent of previous supplies by the appellant.
	


Further evidence in this appeal


	
	For the purposes of this appeal, the appellant relied upon three further affidavits that were read without objection. The first was an affidavit affirmed by the appellant on 17 March 2016. In that affidavit the appellant sought to focus upon his progress in custody since the date of his previous affidavit in December 2010. The appellant’s affidavit is detailed and expansive and it is not convenient to recite it verbatim in these reasons. I have taken the whole of the affidavit into account.
	
	
	The appellant has now served just over 7 years of his 9.5 year non-parole period that is due to expire on 25 August 2018. He has continued during that period to use his time in custody as productively as possible, enthusiastically performing the various roles in which he has been employed, improving his skills and knowledge by undertaking education courses and contributing to the gaol community as an inmate delegate and peer support inmate.
	
	
	After his previous appeal, the appellant remained housed at a maximum security gaol in Sydney. On 8 June 2011 he was moved to a gaol in country New South Wales. That move came without warning. The country gaol houses inmates who had been on the witness protection programme, as well as former police officers and correctional officers. The appellant indicated that he did not wish to be taken out of protective custody. He held fears that he could be violently assaulted. The uncertainty of his new environment made him feel anxious and disoriented.
	
	
	Whilst the appellant’s time out of his cell increased, he received fewer visits from friends and family in the country. While there, these numbered about four visits per year. On 26 February 2016 he was returned to a Sydney gaol where he expects to remain for the duration of his sentence. The appellant remains fearful that other inmates will discover that he has provided assistance and has been held in protection.
	
	
	The appellant described his great sadness about the breakdown of his marriage and the separation from his children.
	
	
	In August 2013, the appellant undertook the Getting Smart Drug and Alcohol Treatment Programme. A large part of that course involved sharing his experiences with drug use and engaging with other inmates who had fallen into drug related lives of crime. In group sessions, the appellant shared his personal experiences of loss that he has suffered as the result of his own drug use. As a result of his contribution to this programme, the appellant was encouraged to undertake a TAFE course in mentoring which he completed in December 2013. He has since then used his acquired skills in various roles counselling and supporting other inmates. He has also acquired impressive tertiary qualifications to which earlier reference has been made.
	
	
	The appellant has been supported by his relatives and friends since his arrest and incarceration. He maintains regular contact with them. His mother is now 72 years old and in frail health. The appellant plans to assist in her care upon his release. He has indicated that he wishes once again to become a productive member of the community.
	
	
	Next, the appellant read the affidavit of Stephen Eccleshall affirmed on 29 March 2016. That affidavit annexes documents in support of matters deposed to by the appellant which are not challenged in this appeal. It is therefore unnecessary to refer to that affidavit in detail.
	
	
	Finally, the appellant read the further affidavit of Stephen Eccleshall affirmed on 19 April 2016. That affidavit deals in thorough and commendable detail with the circumstances attending the delay of almost four years since 2 July 2012 when the appellant first requested Legal Aid to seek a review of his sentence upon the basis of perceived Muldrock error. The respondent does not take any issue in this appeal with respect to delay, and it is unnecessary for present purposes further to trace the historical events that bring the present proceedings to this Court.
	
	
	Mr Eccleshall also refers to the assistance given by the appellant to authorities and to a letter dated 5 April 2016 from Commissioner Peter Hastings QC from the New South Wales Crime Commission. The appellant contends that even though he received a discount of 20 percent for assistance to authorities when originally sentenced, and when resentenced by this Court on 10 March 2011, the outcome of cases prosecuted with the benefit of information supplied by him ought now to inform a second look at that discount. As senior counsel for the appellant put it in the course of argument, “there is further material and it would be open to [this Court] to assess [the discount for assistance] in a different way.” The further evidence reveals that since preparation of a letter dated 10 November 2011 by Acting Commissioner Singleton, upon which the original discount was assessed, a confiscation order has been made and satisfied to the order of $43,330.
	


Consideration


	
	The appellant’s offending has been variously described since his original sentencing in the District Court. Sorby DCJ initially described Count 3 as “objectively a very serious offence” but later characterised it as “well above the midrange of objective seriousness for such offences.” He described count 1 as “towards the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences, but below it” and Count 2 as in the midrange of objective seriousness. In this Court, McClellan CJ at CL considered that Sorby DCJ’s assessment of the objective seriousness of Count 3 was “inappropriate.” He preferred to characterise that Count as “above the mid-range but modestly so.” Hall J agreed with the Chief Judge. Garling J agreed with the ultimate outcome in the appeal but indicated that he “would not have been disposed to find that the sentencing judge’s description of the criminality in count 3…was an error.”
	
	
	It will be apparent that these various opinions cannot any longer be utilised in this Court as an aid to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the appellant’s conduct. That is for the obvious reason that it is not possible to extract from these expressions of opinion the extent to which if at all they were influenced by an erroneous consideration of subjective factors of the type referred to by Garling J at [62]. I hasten to observe that his Honour expressly disavowed the notion that any such factors in the particular circumstances of this case “warrant[ed] a reduction in the objective seriousness of the criminality involved.”
	
	
	After the decision in Muldrock, s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) act 1999 was amended to read as follows:
	


“54B Consideration of standard non-parole period in sentencing

(1) …

(2) The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.”


	
	In these proceedings, error is relevantly conceded by the respondent. In accordance with Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601, it therefore now falls to this Court to resentence the appellant without the need to assess whether the error was “material” or whether it relevantly “infected” the sentence before the duty to resentence in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act arises. This Court is required independently to exercise its sentencing discretion, as the following paragraphs from Kentwell v The Queen make clear:
	


“[42] Spigelman CJ's analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ‘warranted in law’. A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ‘warranted in law’ unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

[43] After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.

[44] In assessing the prospects that the appellant's appeal would succeed, it was wrong to determine that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that substantial injustice was occasioned by the sentence. This is best understood as a conclusion that the aggregate sentence did not impress the Court, upon summary review, as excessive. The appellant is entitled to be sentenced according to law. The issue for the Court's consideration was whether upon the hearing of the appeal it might conclude, taking into account the full range of factors including the evidence of the appellant's progress in custody and current mental state, that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.

[45] The Court of Criminal Appeal wrongly confined its discretion by applying a test which required the appellant to demonstrate that substantial injustice would attend the refusal of the application…” [Emphasis added]


	
	The significant thrust of the appellant’s submissions in this case is that when one has regard to what must have been the starting point for the sentence for Count 3, taking into account a combined discount of 45 percent for the appellant’s early plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities, the sentence is manifestly excessive. In rounded terms, that starting point must have been in the order of 21 years and 9 months. In aid of this submission the appellant provided a detailed and helpful summary of some 41 decisions in this Court dealing with sentences for s 25(2) offences that have been either varied or affirmed. Of this collection of decisions, only four were concerned with cocaine. By comparison with these cases, taking into account the difficulties of accurately assessing the extent to which they can usefully be described as comparable, the sentence imposed upon the appellant was more severe than almost all of the sentences in the sample.
	
	
	Specifying where in the theoretical range of objective seriousness any particular offence lies is both evaluative and subjective. The cases to which the appellant has drawn attention bespeak the truth of that concern. This is especially, although not uniquely, so in cases where the maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment. However, taking account of these difficulties, in my opinion the Count 3 offence committed by the appellant was objectively serious and clearly above the middle of the range of seriousness for offences of its type. There is almost nothing at all that can persuasively be proffered in derogation of such a conclusion. In short compass, the appellant was engaged in a single-minded and well organised operation of supplying cocaine to a receptive and apparently loyal clientele that produced large sums of money without any apparent need to employ or retain others to assist him. The ultimate profitability of the undertaking for him was not reduced by the need to compensate assistants. The appellant was also conspicuously unconstrained in his mode of offending, and did not appear to take any calculated or at least any sophisticated steps to avoid apprehension.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant contended that the significant amount of money found at the appellant’s premises could not reliably inform the seriousness or significance of the offending. That was said to be for the reason that the appellant was otherwise sentenced for an offence contrary to s 193C (1) of the Crimes Act. That contention, if I understand it correctly, fails to take account of the fact that the profitability of the offending can reliably inform its objective seriousness regardless of whether the proceeds of the offending are discovered or recovered. I do not consider that the coincidental imposition of a sentence for the s 193C offence reduces the seriousness of the offending that its profitability appears reliably to indicate.
	
	
	I am also not inclined to accept that there are grounds for concluding that the appellant’s discount for assistance should be increased. The revelation of success from assistance considered retrospectively is only a manifestation of what is assumed to be the value of the assistance considered in the first place. It would be equally inappropriate to reduce a discount for assistance on appeal if the information turned out, especially through no fault of the offender, to be of less value than was originally anticipated. The material disclosed in the Crime Commission letter dated 10 November 2011 was originally thought to be significant by the sentencing judge and this Court previously, and in my opinion it remains so.
	
	
	Whatever view might have been indicated by the evidence that was available in March 2010 concerning the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation, the evidence today demonstrates that the appellant has taken what are arguably quite remarkable steps towards self-improvement and reinstatement as a contributing member of society upon his release. He has acquired impressive tertiary qualifications and demonstrated significant responsibility and leadership qualities in the admittedly constrained context of the prison environment. He has not come under notice for disciplinary reasons while in custody and there does not appear to be any tangible likelihood that he will revert to a life of reoffending when released. This prospect is encouraged to a considerable extent by the assistance and support that he is likely to enjoy from family and close friends in the wider community.
	
	
	In this last respect the loss of the appellant’s marriage is an unfortunate consequence of his offending and inevitable incarceration. He has continued to attempt with considerable difficulty to maintain what remains of his relationship with his children in the circumstances of their relocation to the United Kingdom. These are matters which tend normally and naturally to evoke sympathy but are not in my view matters that also influence the approach that this Court can take to resentencing the appellant. It is inevitable that families will be disrupted and damaged when one of their members is imprisoned for a long period. It would not be appropriate to make allowances for the consequences of such imprisonment in circumstances that were not wholly unusual or even exceptionable. Such hardship as the appellant has had to endure in the circumstances is in this case an inevitable result of his original offending, and does not set him apart from an unfortunately large number of other offenders.
	
	
	Nor am I attracted to the proposition that delays in sentencing the appellant according to law inform consideration of a reduction of his sentence. Anxiety about the outcome of his several appeals whilst he remained incarcerated would in my view only sound in his favour if the ultimate outcome of the resentencing process resulted in him having been imprisoned for a total period that exceeded what was determined to be the proper sentence. In the events that have occurred here, it is not my opinion that the appellant has demonstrated that the delays in his case have produced an injustice of this kind.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant finally referred to special circumstances. There do not appear to me to be any reasons for varying the statutory ratio of parole to non-parole periods. One of the curious reasons for that may well be that the appellant has demonstrated such good prospects for rehabilitation through his educational and leadership successes whilst in prison. Whereas it would not be appropriate to disadvantage the appellant for such efforts if he were otherwise able to demonstrate special circumstances, it would in my view be inconsistent and contradictory to take account of his good prospects of rehabilitation on the one hand and yet implicitly derogate from such a finding by suggesting that he warranted some longer period of supervision upon his release on the other hand.
	
	
	In my opinion it follows, accepting the existence of specific error of the kind described in House v The King, and taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, or more particularly since the appeal to this Court determined in March 2011, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the appellant on Count 3. The appellant’s significant progress whilst in custody is something that this Court can and should acknowledge as a factor substantially influencing the question of what is the proper sentence for this count. In circumstances where this Court is presented with an opportunity to endorse and encourage the commendable manifestation of rehabilitation and self-improvement, it should not in an appropriate case decline to do so. This is such a case.
	


Conclusions and sentence


	
	In my opinion a lesser sentence for Count 3 is warranted in law.
	
	
	I consider that a proper starting point for the Count 3 offence, taking into account the two charges on the Form 1, is a sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. The sentence should commence on the same day as the appellant’s sentence for that count imposed by this Court in March 2011. A combined discount of 45 percent should continue to apply for the appellant’s early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. That produces a head sentence for this count of 11 years of which the appellant should serve a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months commencing on 26 August 2009 and expiring on 25 November 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months expiring on 25 August 2020.
	
	
	All of the appellant’s other sentences have now expired. I did not understand the appellant to contend that these sentences should be individually revisited or that any question of their respective accumulation or concurrency should influence this Court’s approach to the appellant’s complaints concerning the sentence for Count 3. Nor is there any suggestion in Kentwell v The Queen that it is necessary in a case such as the present for those expired sentences to be reviewed.
	
	
	I would propose the following orders:
	



	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Quash the sentence for Count 3 imposed by this Court in March 2011.
	
	
	In lieu of the sentence imposed by this Court for Count 3 in March 2011, sentence the appellant to a term of imprisonment of 8 years and 3 months commencing on 26 August 2009 and expiring on 25 November 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months expiring on 25 August 2020.
	
	
	The first date upon which the appellant will become eligible for release on parole is 26 November 2017.

	BATHURST CJ: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Wilson J. 
	
	
	WILSON J: On 16 February 2015 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales for an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The serious indictable offence was robbery; the circumstance of aggravation relied upon by the Crown was that there were persons in the premises. The sentence imposed was one of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	The maximum sentence for an offence contrary to s 112(2) is 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 5 years is specified by Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against that sentence, advancing a single ground of appeal, that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive.
	


The Proceedings before the District Court


	
	The applicant entered a plea of guilty to the charge against him when the matter was in the Local Court and he was committed to the District Court for sentence. He adhered to that plea on 12 March 2015 before her Honour Judge Hock in the District Court. He additionally asked her Honour to take a further three offences into account when he was sentenced for the s 112(2) offence, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, each of the offences being one of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	A further six related summary offences of possess prohibited drug (four counts contrary to s 10 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act) and possess prescribed restricted substance (two counts contrary to s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW)) were also before the sentencing judge, on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	A statement of facts agreed by the parties was tendered in the Crown case. The sentencing judge found the facts of the applicant’s crimes in accordance with the agreed facts.
	


The Facts of the Applicant’s Crime


	
	Shortly before 9 o’clock on the morning of 26 October 2013, Ms Gao arrived at the pharmacy where she worked, the Sydney Cove Chemist in The Rocks. She unlocked the entrance door to the pharmacy, entered the building, and closed the door behind her. Since it was not yet time to open the pharmacy for customers, she did not turn the lights on, but went into the dispensary in the rear of the premises and put her handbag on a counter. She then went upstairs to make some coffee.
	
	
	Whilst Ms Gao was upstairs the applicant opened the closed door to the pharmacy and went inside. He was dressed in black clothing and was wearing black gloves. He was carrying a shopping bag. He went to the dispensary area, before moving towards the stairs.
	
	
	Ms Gao was descending the stairs at that time, and saw the applicant at the bottom of the staircase. She asked if she could help him, and he responded by demanding that she take him to the safe. He demanded, “Codeine, Oxycontin, and money”. Ms Gao said she would cooperate, and walked towards the safe which was located in the ground floor dispensary.
	
	
	When she approached the safe the applicant told her, “I don’t want to hurt you but I will if I have to”. Ms Gao was frightened that she would be hurt, and she opened the safe and stood back to give the applicant access to it. He told her to crouch down and turn away from him, but she remained standing. When the applicant told her to point out the codeine and oxycodone, she complied. The applicant took codeine, oxycodone and other drugs, including methadone, from the safe and piled them into the shopping bag he was carrying.
	
	
	The applicant said, “where is the money kept?” and was told it was in the till. He moved in the direction of the till, demanding money from Ms Gao’s handbag as he walked past. Ms Gao gave him the cash she had in her bag, being $100.
	
	
	On reaching the till in the pharmacy, Ms Gao opened it, and the applicant emptied it. He thought there should have been more and demanded, “where is all the other money”. Ms Gao told him that the till was emptied each night and “the big notes” had been removed.
	
	
	The applicant told Ms Gao to show him where the drug Xanax was kept and, on it being pointed out to him, put all of the drug from the shelf into his shopping bag. Having filled his own bag, the applicant obtained another from Ms Gao, and put further items in it.
	
	
	The applicant told Ms Gao:
	


“Sorry, I don’t want to do this, but I have a habit and the doctors won’t give me the drugs so I have to do this. Don’t call the cops ‘cause I know that you have contacted them and I will come after you. Now go back into the room and count to one hundred and don’t come out until you finish.”


	
	Carrying the bags filled with drugs, the applicant left the pharmacy. He was seen by a man who was standing outside the pharmacy waiting for it to open, and the witness got the attention of a police officer on foot patrol in the area and pointed the applicant out. Senior Constable Heydon called out to the applicant to stop, but he ran off down George Street. The officer pursued him, and caught him soon after. The whole pursuit was captured by closed circuit surveillance cameras operating in the area.
	
	
	A quantity of cash, $562 of the approximately $1500 stolen from the pharmacy, was found in the shopping bags, together with a quantity of drugs (methadone, oxycodone, buprenorphine, morphine, pethidine, fluritrazepam, and codeine) and a quantity of prescribed restricted substances (alprazolam and diazepam). The stolen drugs were valued in excess of $2000. The $100 taken from Ms Gao’s handbag was later found secreted in the applicant’s sock.
	
	
	On arrest, the applicant claimed to have found the drugs in a bin at the back of the pharmacy. He said that the money was his. He refused to be formally interviewed.
	
	
	The drugs and cash found in the applicant’s possession was returned to the pharmacy.
	
	
	The charges that were to be taken into account on sentence were all offences of supplying a prohibited drug, charges referable to the applicant’s possession of the drugs that he had stolen, deemed by s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act to be possession for the purpose of supply. Those drugs were, respectively, 1.4 litres of methadone, 15.94 grams of oxycodone, and 140 milligrams of buprenorphine.
	
	
	The applicant’s possession of the remaining stolen drugs was reflected by charges of possessing the particular substances, which were all either prohibited drugs or prescribed restricted substances. These charges were before the court on a s 166 certificate, to be dealt with pursuant to s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	


Other Evidence in the Crown Case


	
	In addition to the facts and some photographs relating to the offence, the Crown tendered the applicant’s criminal history, his custodial history, and a pre-sentence report.
	
	
	The applicant, who was born in August 1961 and was aged 52 at the time of the commission of the offence and 53 when sentenced, was first before the courts as a child, in 1977. He has a long history of criminal offending, including convictions for armed robbery, drug offences, larceny, break and enter offences, and firearms offences.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the present offence, the applicant was subject to parole, having been sentenced in the District Court in March 2010 to a term of 3 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, for an offence of conspiracy to cheat and defraud. When released to parole on 11 March 2013 (about six months prior to the present offence), the applicant had also served a number of other, shorter sentences imposed on the same date for various offences of dishonesty.
	
	
	The applicant’s parole was revoked upon his arrest for this matter, with the sentence expiring on 11 June 2014.
	
	
	As a consequence of sentences imposed upon him over the years, the applicant had considerable contact with Community Corrections. His first contact with the service was in 1979, and numerous reports had been prepared concerning him between then and his most recent release to parole in March 2013.
	
	
	The author of the pre-sentence report gave an account of the applicant’s personal circumstances, education and employment history, and features related to his offending history.
	
	
	The applicant reported an unsettled childhood following his parents separation when he was aged 10. He had, for a number of years, moved between each of his parent’s homes, foster placements, and a period spent in institutional care. After moving in his teenage years to reside permanently with his father, he experienced a period of stability.
	
	
	The applicant was educated to year 11 and had been employed for a short time in the information technology industry.
	
	
	He had been involved in two significant relationships as an adult and had a child from each relationship. Although the applicant had no contact with his adult son, the applicant had maintained a relationship with his teenage daughter who, on the death of her mother, was in the care of relatives as a ward of the Minister. The applicant supported his daughter’s education as a boarder at a private school, something he was able to do following receipt of a significant inheritance from his father, who died in 2012.
	
	
	The applicant has a longstanding history of drug abuse, having first experimented with heroin at age 14. Other than during periods of incarceration, he had used prohibited drugs ever since. In the months leading up to the commission of the present offence, the applicant described himself as “out of control”, using prescription methadone in addition to other drugs he was able to obtain, including further methadone, heroin, and Xanax. On the day of the offence, he had taken six Xanax tablets.
	
	
	In 2009 the applicant had been diagnosed with agoraphobia, and had difficulties with anxiety. He had previously been non-compliant with a treatment regime.
	
	
	Although he had been living in a hostel at the time of his arrest, the applicant expressed the wish to buy a rural property and move away from Sydney. He evinced a wish to tackle his drug addiction, although the author of the pre-sentence report noted that the applicant’s motivation and resolve in that regard was yet to be tested.
	


The Subjective Case

 


	
	The applicant gave evidence himself and tendered a report from a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Ellis, who saw the applicant for the purpose of preparing a report for use on sentence.
	
	
	Dr Ellis saw the applicant on one occasion by way of audio-visual link. The applicant described a heavy addiction to cigarettes, and a long standing heroin addiction, typically injecting himself with that drug three or four times each day. He had also used cocaine irregularly, and experimented with LSD, amphetamines, and methylamphetamines. The applicant told Dr Ellis that his need to fund his heroin addiction was behind every crime he had committed.
	
	
	Rather in contrast to the personal history given to the author of the pre-sentence report, the applicant told Dr Ellis that he had had a good upbringing, being raised by both parents, and attending school until age 15. He was self-taught in information technology and had been employed in a computer shop for about five years.
	
	
	The applicant told Dr Ellis that, at the time of the commission of the offence, he had been homeless and distressed about his daughter, who was self-harming. He was abusing heroin and other drugs, as the prescribed methadone available to him was insufficient to stop him craving heroin. He said that the decision to rob the pharmacy had been an impulsive one and he had stolen some gloves prior to entering the premises. He was uncertain as to why he had stolen money, given that he had considerable funds of his own.
	
	
	Dr Ellis concluded that the applicant had a severe Substance Abuse Disorder and he had some symptoms indicative of an underlying anxiety disorder. The applicant’s anti-social behaviour was likely related to his drug use. He was using drugs to cope with his psychological distress about his daughter’s situation. Dr Ellis thought that the applicant’s ability to control impulses and think rationally at the time of committing the offence was likely to have been impaired by his substance use. He opined that the applicant would benefit from a residential program directed to assist him with drug rehabilitation.
	
	
	In his evidence on 12 February 2015, the applicant told her Honour that he had been accurate in the information he had given to the author of the pre-sentence report and to Dr Ellis. He said that, since his admission to Bathurst prison following his arrest, he had worked five days each week in prison industries, principally packaging confectionary and other small food items for sale. He had not failed any urinalysis test administered in custody.
	
	
	He deposed that he had begun using drugs at about age 14 because of peer pressure, and in an attempt to “look cool” to impress a girl. His school results, which had previously been good, suffered as a result, and he left school half way through year 11. He emphasised that his many subsequent criminal offences had all been committed to support his heroin habit.
	
	
	At the time of the offending conduct, the applicant told her Honour that he had read some posts on a social media website from his daughter and found that she was depressed and self-harming. Since his daughter’s mother had earlier committed suicide, he had become very anxious about her. In that distressed state, he had taken his prescription methadone, the take-away methadone dose intended for use on the forthcoming weekend, and a quantity of Xanax. Although it had not been his intention to leave his accommodation in an intoxicated state, he had been obliged to do so, and had committed the offence impulsively when he found the door of the pharmacy was unlocked.
	
	
	The applicant said that he would have shared the drugs that he had with a friend, rather than keep them all and risk being robbed.
	
	
	He said that he had “screwed up”, and there was no excuse for what he had done. He said that, if the victim of the crime had been present, he would apologise to her.
	
	
	The applicant said that his intention for the future was to buy a hobby farm in a rural area, and have his daughter live with him.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the applicant denied having planned the offence some days earlier, saying that he wore black clothes all the time and it was part of his mood.
	
	
	Due to a recording error, the submissions on sentence made by the parties to her Honour were not recorded.
	


The Sentence Judgment


	
	In her judgment on sentence, her Honour set out the agreed facts of the offences, noting that there was considerable overlap between the criminality of the principal offence and that of the offences to be taken into account on the Form 1 document, and before the Court on a s 166 certificate.
	
	
	Her Honour considered the offence to fall within the middle of the range for an offence of its nature, noting that the serious indictable offence committed, robbery, was a more serious crime than the more usual object of a break and enter, larceny. There was additionally some planning, involving the applicant obtaining gloves to wear in an effort to avoid detection for the crime.
	
	
	The fact that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offence was noted to be an aggravating feature of the offence.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the applicant’s personal circumstances, and to his lengthy criminal history which, she concluded, showed a continuing disregard for the law.
	
	
	The applicant’s long term drug use was noted to be the basis of the applicant’s offending history but, despite that, the applicant had not been able to achieve rehabilitation from drug use. Her Honour considered the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation to be bleak, unless he was able to conform to a treatment program.
	
	
	The applicant was given the benefit of a reduction in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed upon him of 25% to reflect the utilitarian benefit of his early plea of guilty.
	
	
	Applying the totality principle, her Honour gave the applicant the benefit of some modest degree of concurrency with the sentence he served for the conspiracy to cheat and defraud offence, determining that the commencement date for the current sentence should be 26 April 2014, about two months before the expiration of the earlier sentence.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was made because of the need for some adjustment to the usual ratio of sentence to give effect to the requirements of totality, and because her Honour considered that the applicant would benefit from an extended period of supervision.
	
	
	Taking into account the three counts of supply prohibited drug, a sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years was imposed. The overall sentence expires on 25 April 2020; the non-parole period will expire on 25 April 2018.
	
	
	The applicant was convicted of those offences before the Court on a s 166 certificate. Pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, no further penalty was imposed upon him.
	
	
	Her Honour directed that the applicant should be referred to the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre.
	


The Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	As earlier noted, the only ground of appeal advanced by the applicant is a complaint that the sentence imposed upon him is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant argues that, having regard to the discount on sentence of 25% allowed to him, the starting point for the sentence must have been 8 years imprisonment. Applying the same ratio of sentence evident in the sentence imposed by her Honour (being 67%), an 8 year sentence would have resulted in a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months. This, it is submitted, is in excess of the standard non-parole period of 5 years, and is indicative of error.
	
	
	It was submitted that the applicant’s long-standing drug addiction was a mitigating feature that should have ameliorated the sentence imposed, as should the applicant’s health issues and his need to provide support to his daughter.
	
	
	Although there is no ground of appeal as to the assessment of the objective gravity by the sentencing judge, the applicant additionally argues that her Honour did not give sufficient weight to those features of the crime which made it less serious, such as the absence of a forcible break, and the modest value of the property stolen.
	
	
	The applicant points to statistics held by the Judicial Commission to support the complaint of manifest excess.
	


Consideration


	
	The arguments advanced by the applicant in support of his complaint of manifest excess are, without exception, flawed, and represent a misunderstanding of principle.
	
	
	The ground itself is problematic, in that the applicant seeks to advance three specific asserted errors in support of it. Firstly, that the assessment of the gravity of the applicant’s crime as falling within the middle of the range was incorrect. Secondly, that the sentencing judge did not give adequate weight to the applicant’s subjective case, and particularly the fact that his long-term drug addiction was a feature that should have significantly mitigated the sentence to be imposed. Thirdly, by reference to the assumed “starting point” for the sentence and sentencing statistics, the sentence and the non-parole period were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	As was pointed out most recently in Pleasance v R [2016] NSWCCA 113, at [110]:
	


“A ground asserting manifest excess is one which invites this Court to consider whether the length of the sentence imposed is demonstrated to be outside the range of a sound sentencing discretion, and thus unfair and unjust. It should not be advanced as a means of raising other asserted errors that could have been addressed by a specific ground. Ordinarily, a ground asserting that a sentence is manifestly excessive should be advanced only where specific error of the type identified in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, at 504-505, cannot be identified, or as an alternative to grounds raising specific error.”


	
	The first of the asserted errors is that the sentencing judge was in error in the assessment she made of the gravity of the offence. The applicant contends that her Honour did not give appropriate attention to features of the crime that mitigated its gravity, being the absence of a forcible break, the lack of actual violence, the modest value of the stolen property, and the recovery of the drugs which were taken. However, each of the features the applicant referred to were specifically noted by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	What is not addressed by the applicant is the feature of the offending behaviour noted by her Honour that elevated the gravity of the crime, being the nature of the serious indictable offence committed. As the sentencing judge observed, for most offences of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, the serious indictable offence is stealing. Stealing is a much less serious offence than robbery because there is no element of taking property from a person by putting that person in fear by force or threat of force.
	
	
	The difference in the elements of the two offences and the criminality involved is reflected in the maximum penalties fixed for the discrete offences of larceny, contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act, and robbery, contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act. The former carries 5 years imprisonment, the latter 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The fact that the serious indictable offence committed by the applicant was robbery, and not simple larceny, was a feature relevant to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. It had the effect, noted by her Honour, of elevating the gravity of the crime as against similar offences where larceny was the serious indictable offence committed.
	
	
	Additionally, having robbed her, the applicant threatened the victim that he would “come after” her if she contacted police. That also elevated the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	The assessment of the objective gravity of an offence is a matter for the sentencing judge. As was said in Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35, at [33]:
	


“This Court has emphasised that characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]. This Court is slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion, and the question must be whether the particular characterisation was open: Mulato v R at [37], [46]-[47].”


	
	The characterisation made by the sentencing judge here was well open to her and her conclusion does not represent error.
	
	
	The second asserted error raised by the applicant is that the sentencing judge did not give adequate weight to the applicant’s subjective case. Whilst the applicant’s health, and the need to support his daughter are referred to as features of his case that should have ameliorated the penalty, the applicant particularly relies upon a purported failure to treat the applicant’s drug addiction as a mitigating feature.
	
	
	The applicant’s contention in this regard appears to be based upon a mistaken understanding that there is a principle of law to the effect that a drug addiction commenced when an offender was young is a mitigating feature for crime committed thereafter. There is no such principle. The authorities that the applicant relies upon to suggest that there is such a principle do not support the argument advanced.
	
	
	SS v R; JC v R [2009] NSWCCA 114 at [102] and R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [58] are cited by the applicant as authority for the existence of such a principle, but neither does more than allow for the possibility that there will be exceptions to the general rule that drug addiction is not a mitigating feature. One such exception may be that an addiction to illicit drugs was formed in youth, but that is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.
	
	
	In SS v R; JC v R, JC had been introduced to cannabis at the age of 12 years by an abusive uncle who regularly assaulted and threatened him. His addiction continued in the context of a troubled childhood, until he committed the offences the subject of the appeal when he had just turned 17.
	
	
	In Todorovic, the Court was hearing an appeal by the Crown against inadequacy of sentence imposed upon an offender who had a gambling addiction, and had committed the offences the subject of the appeal to obtain funds with which to gamble. The primary judge had been persuaded to deal leniently with the applicant because of her addiction, which was characterised as a psychological condition. Hulme J, with whom Grove and Simpson JJ agreed, rejected that approach, saying, at [57]:
	


“Furthermore if gambling, as a ""way of controlling (an) emotional state and coping with personal problems by avoidance"" in circumstances of ""mild depression"", ""negative emotional states"" and the consequences of dysfunctional relationships, is to be regarded as a reason for leniency, then why should not many of those who seek to ameliorate or blot out their suffering by resort to drugs and then to crime be treated similarly? After all, experience shows that many drug addicts suffer from Attention Deficit, Bipolar, Borderline Personality or other psychological disorders that are said to be causative of, or contributing factors to, their drug addiction.”


	
	It is apparent that the Court in Todorovic was not endorsing that approach, it was affirming the general principle that addictions underlying criminal conduct could not mitigate that conduct.
	
	
	An addiction formed as a child may be a mitigating factor in the particular circumstances of an individual case, but it is an entirely different proposition to suggest that it will always operate in that way, and for any person who began using drugs in youth.
	
	
	In the applicant’s case, he began using illicit drugs at the age of 14, not because he was forced to by an abusive adult, or because his childhood was spent in circumstances of violence and deprivation, but because, as he told Dr Ellis, he wanted to look cool and impress a girl, and there was “peer pressure” to do so.
	
	
	The applicant thereafter continued to use prohibited drugs, and did so despite the many opportunities he was given by sentencing courts over the years to take advantage of community based rehabilitation programs with the support of community corrections authorities, and despite his admission to a methadone program prior to the commission of this offence.
	
	
	An addiction commenced in such circumstances and continued for the next three decades can do nothing to mitigate the applicant’s crime. Indeed, the fact that the applicant continued to use illicit drugs, and to commit crime in support of his habit, arguably elevated the need for the sentence imposed upon him to give particular prominence to specific deterrence in determining the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	In that way, the applicant’s long term unaddressed addiction to prohibited drugs could have legitimately increased the sentence required to be imposed upon him. To the applicant’s benefit, the sentencing judge refrained from taking such an approach.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was not in error in the approach she took to the applicant’s drug habit.
	
	
	The other aspects of the applicant’s subjective case referred to by him in submission to this Court were features considered by her Honour, but they were not matters which could greatly ameliorate the sentence, or even do so at all. The applicant was diagnosed in 2009 with agoraphobia with some anxiety, and he formerly suffered Hepatitis C connected with injecting drugs, but that illness had resolved. He told Dr Ellis that he had had some childhood illnesses, and currently suffered from poor sleep. Her Honour referred to the applicant’s health issues. The applicant’s need to support his daughter was also referred to by the sentencing judge as part of the applicant’s general circumstances. More was not required.
	
	
	In my view, the sentencing judge considered the applicant’s subjective circumstances, and appropriately took them into account when determining the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant. There was no error in this regard.
	
	
	The applicant’s third complaint is that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive. The applicant relies upon a mathematical calculation to argue for an excessive assumed starting point of sentence, and upon sentencing statistics held by the Judicial Commission for an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act for the period April 2008 to March 2015.
	
	
	The applicant contends that the “starting point” of the sentence imposed upon him prior to the application of the 25% discount on sentence must have been a sentence of 8 years imprisonment. Since the corollary non-parole period, applying the sentencing judge’s ratio of head sentence to parole period of 67% would be in excess of the standard non-parole period of 5 years, it is asserted that there must be error.
	
	
	It is generally neither appropriate nor helpful to take an assumed starting point of sentence as a basis upon which to argue that a sentence is manifestly excessive. In Piscitelli v R [2013] NSWCCA 8, at [91], it was said that:
	


“[…] this Court has cautioned against an analysis of starting points in order to determine whether a sentence is manifestly excessive: see SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [40], Rutkowsky v R [2008] NSWCCA 10 at [10] and Yousef v R [2011] NSWCCA 104 at [30]. Instead, attention should be focussed upon the sentence actually imposed.”

 


	
	Even if it is accepted that the starting point for the sentence imposed upon the applicant was one of 8 years, in the circumstances of this offence I would not regard that as manifestly excessive. Neither could it be said that, because the notional non-parole period (argued to be 5 years and 4 months) was in excess of the standard non-parole period of 5 years that there must necessarily be error.
	
	
	A standard non-parole period specified by Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is not prescriptive for an offence in the mid-range of objective seriousness, and the sentencing discretion is not exercised by reference solely to the Table to Division 1A. An offence may be assessed as falling within the mid-range, but a non-parole period greater or lesser than the standard may nevertheless be imposed, having regard to the features of the particular matter, objective and subjective.
	
	
	Section 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:
	


“The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.”


	
	As was held in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, at [26], “it is a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance” to the standard non-parole period. The Court continued:
	


“Section 54B(2), read with ss 54B(3) and 21A, requires an approach to sentencing for Div 1A offences that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen:

 

""[T]he judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case."" (emphasis added).”


	
	In the applicant’s case, her Honour’s conclusion that this crime fell within the mid-range for offences of this nature did not require her to fix a sentence that would ensure a non-parole period of 5 years prior to the discount for the plea and adjustment for the finding of special circumstances. The standard non-parole period was merely one of the features the sentencing judge had to have regard to, as she did.
	
	
	The statistics referred to by the applicant are no more indicative of error than is the notional starting point.
	
	
	Firstly, the statistics do not distinguish between s 112(2) offences where the serious indictable offence is larceny, or a more serious crime. As has been noted, an offence contrary to s 112(2) can encompass a range of serious indictable offences - some are inherently more serious than others.
	
	
	Secondly, the statistics cited are for “All Offenders” and can say nothing about the proper range of sentence for an individual with the applicant’s particular characteristics who committed a crime of the precise nature committed by the applicant. The statistics do not indicate whether the offenders encompassed within them were old or young, whether they had a criminal history or not, whether any prior record included offences of a like nature or not, or whether they had pleaded guilty or been found guilty.
	
	
	Thirdly, the statistics do not take into account whether other offenders were, like the applicant, subject to conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the crime.
	
	
	Fourthly, the statistics are for the “principal offence”. They do not encompass sentences imposed upon individuals who had other crimes taken into account on sentence, as did the applicant, who asked that three offences of supply prohibited drug be considered in the sentence imposed upon him. Although, in the circumstances of these offences, the increase to the sentence imposed for the principal offence would have been very modest, there had to be some increase to reflect the additional criminality of the applicant’s intention to pass some of the stolen drugs on to friends.
	
	
	Statistics such as these permit no meaningful comparison or analysis.
	
	
	In the statutory context of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period specified for an offence of this nature, the sentence imposed upon the applicant had to take into account the features particular to his crime: its objective gravity, the fact that he was on parole at the time of its commission, the applicant’s criminal record more generally, his long standing drug addiction, his relatively poor prospects of rehabilitation, and his personal circumstances more broadly. Those features of the matter had to be considered in conformity with sentencing law and principle. The sentence to be imposed had to be determined having regard to all of those matters.
	
	
	The sentencing judge had regard to all relevant considerations and fixed a sentence which, in my view, is within the range of sentence that was properly open to the court. It is neither unreasonable nor unjust: R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54 at [22]; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to establish this ground.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to him to bring the appeal.
	


order


	
	The order I propose is:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is refused.

		29 June 2016",2016-06-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769822,R v MO (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 145,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: In January 2016 I sentenced an offender for contravening a control order, an offence under s 104.27 of the Criminal Code. In the remarks on sentence I delivered I explained how I had come up with the result that I sentenced him to imprisonment and set a head sentence of two and a half years with an order that he be released pursuant to a recognisance release order after serving 18 months. Matters remained as they were for some time until very shortly before what would have been the expiry of the recognisance release order, 22 June 2016.
	
	
	On a date very shortly before 22 June my associate received an email from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, with a copy sent to the offender’s legal representatives, in which reference was made for the first time to s 19AG of the Crimes Act which provides that where a person is convicted of a terrorism offence a non-parole period of at least three‑quarters of the sentence must be set by the Court. The offence for which I sentenced the offender was a terrorism offence.
	
	
	The Crown then made an application under s 19AHA of the Crimes Act which provides that where a sentencing order has a defect of form the Court must on application by the DPP amend the sentencing order in order to rectify the defect.
	
	
	The matter was listed before me today, a date after 22 June 2016, because the offender is in custody on another matter. I accept that there is a defect. I accept that the non-parole period should have been at least three‑quarters of the head sentence.
	
	
	Therefore there is a need to correct the order I made. This can be done in two ways. The first is to interfere with the non-parole period and to make it longer, the second is to interfere with the head sentence and make it shorter. Not surprisingly, the Crown says I should do the former but Mr Lange, who appears for the offender, says I should do the latter. The Crown submission is, understandably, that the head sentence was selected as to representing the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct and that any reduction in that so as to impose a sentence which complies with s 19AG of the Crimes Act would be to impose a sentence which failed to reflect things such as the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct.
	
	
	While there is something in the Crown submission, it has to be recognised that there is no one correct sentence. I do not consider it can be said that a sentence of two and a half years is appropriate but that necessarily a sentence of two years is not. In any case one has to consider the circumstances in which this error was made. As the judge making the order I fully accept that the error was mine but as the Crown freely admits today it was also at fault in failing to advise me when I sentenced the offender in January 2016 of the requirement of s 19AG. Indeed, as the email to my associate makes clear, the Crown did not realise an error had been made until the Attorney General’s Department advised the prosecution of the defect in the order.
	
	
	In those circumstances I propose to amend the order in such a way that the offender spends no extra time in custody because of the errors made by both the prosecution and by me. Accordingly, I quash the sentence of imprisonment that I imposed on 29 January 2016, it being not one I had the power to make. I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of 2 years, backdated to commence on 23 December 2014. A non-parole period of 18 months is imposed on the offender, expiring on 22 June 2016.
	
	
	The effect of my order is that the offender is now on parole as far as this offence is concerned.

		20 July 2016",2016-06-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769833,Burbridge v R [2016] NSWCCA 128,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J and with his Honour’s reasons. I add the following observations.
	
	
	I emphasise the following as particularly relevant to the correctness of his Honour’s conclusion, with which I agree, that the sentences imposed upon the applicant in this case are not manifestly excessive:
	



	
	In addition to receiving some 129 emails attaching 360 files containing child pornography material, the applicant sent some 41 emails attaching 213 files containing such material. Further he admitted to officers executing a search warrant at the premises at which he resided that he had forwarded child pornographic material to other people via email over 100 times.
	
	
	Although the applicant received the benefit of a favourable finding by the sentencing judge that there was no evidence before him that the applicant “acted with others, or was involved in any collaborative network, of like-minded persons”, it is clear from the foregoing that the applicant was involved to a significant extent in disseminating child pornography materials to others. He was thus not a passive acquisitor of material but was actively involved in its distribution.
	
	
	The applicant was a registered user of a website that published stories about child abuse. A story that he wrote and had published on the website was classified as falling within category 4 on the Child Exploitation Tracking System (“CETS”) scale, this being a category concerned with penetrative sexual activity between children, or adults and children. This conduct had a tendency to assist in generating demand for this type of material.
	
	
	Overall, the sentencing judge found (at p 9) that the applicant “produced, assessed and transmitted or possessed 1,854 files of child pornography or child abuse material. That material depicted approximately 300 different children aged from about 18 months old to 14 years old”.
	
	
	One of the applicant’s offences was committed whilst he was on bail pending the hearing of the charges for his other offences.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for both the Commonwealth offences of which the applicant was convicted was 15 years imprisonment. That for the State offences was 10 years imprisonment. The former were increased from 10 years to 15 years in 2010 and the latter from 5 years to 10 years in 2008. These increases are indications of the seriousness with which the legislatures regard the offences in question.
	



	
	The facts in cases in this field (as in others) will inevitably differ, sometimes markedly, making comparisons difficult. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to note that the sentences imposed in this case are by no means outside the range of sentences imposed by this Court in a number of recent child pornography and abuse cases when it has been necessary to resentence following a successful Crown appeal: in R v Linardon [2014] NSWCCA 247, the Court imposed a total term of imprisonment of 5 years with a minimum term of 3 years (although the offences included one of indecent communication to a child); in R v Martin [2014] NSWCCA 283, the Court imposed a total term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months, with a minimum term of 3 years; in R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174, the Court imposed a total term of imprisonment of 2 years and 9 months, with a minimum term of 1 year and 6 months; in R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183, the Court imposed a total term of imprisonment of 3 years with a minimum term of 1 year and 9 months.
	
	
	As the resentencing in these cases required this Court to impose sentences which it regarded as appropriate in all the circumstances, the sentences in question should not be treated as the highest sentences referable to the facts of those cases that would have withstood an appeal on the grounds of manifest excess if imposed by a lower court. As made clear in Rothman J’s judgment, the question in the present case is not whether the sentences imposed in the District Court are those which this Court would have imposed if called upon to sentence or resentence but whether any of the sentences or their totality is manifestly excessive. For the reasons above as well as those given by Rothman J, I do not consider this to be the case.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: Tristan David Burbridge, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the District Court after a plea of guilty to five (5) charges.
	
	
	The applicant was charged and had a conviction recorded for the following counts:
	



	
	Count 1 - use a carriage service to access child pornography material, contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”), which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment and for which the Court below imposed a head sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment;
	
	
	Count 2 – use a carriage service to transmit child pornography material, contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the Code, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment and for which the Court below imposed a head sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment;
	
	
	Count 3 – produce child abuse material contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and for which the Court below imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months;
	
	
	Counts 4 and 5 – possessing child abuse material, contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is 10 years’ imprisonment and for which the Court below imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months and 12 months respectively.
	



	
	Pursuant to the provision of s 19AC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Commonwealth Crimes Act”), the sentencing judge issued a single recognizance release order for the Commonwealth offences, being a recognizance release order, fixing 9 months as the mandatory period of imprisonment before release, commencing at the same time as the first Commonwealth offence.
	
	
	The overall sentence for all State and Commonwealth offences, imposed by the court below, was described in the judge’s remarks as 4 years’ imprisonment, with the time in custody to be served being 2 years and 3 months. This was sought to be achieved by commencing the sentences for Counts 3, 4 and 5 at 23 June 2014, 23 September 2014 and 23 December 2014 respectively. Each of those sentences expired on 22 December 2014, 22 September 2015 and 22 June 2016 respectively. The two Commonwealth sentences commence on 23 December 2015 and 23 December 2016 respectively.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are manifest excess and failure to apply the principle of totality appropriately, expressed in the following manner:
	


“1. The sentence is manifestly excessive;

2. His Honour erred in the extent to which the various sentences were accumulated.”


	
	As can be seen from the recitation of the offences and sentences, including the commencement dates and conclusion dates, the learned sentencing judge commenced the term for these offences on 23 June 2014 and commenced the last sentence (a federal offence for which an 18 month term of imprisonment was imposed) on 23 December 2016. As a consequence the overall head sentence concludes on 22 June 2018 (i.e. 4 years’ imprisonment) and the overall mandatory period of imprisonment (2 years and 3 months) concludes on 22 September 2016 (i.e. prior to the commencement of the final sentence).
	
	
	The provisions of s 16E of the Commonwealth Crimes Act apply the law of NSW relating to the commencement of sentences and the non-parole periods to the sentencing in NSW for a federal offence. It would seem that the provisions of s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) apply to the commencement of any sentence imposed for a federal offence: Payda v R [2013] NSWCCA 109 at [50]-[60] and see Assafiri v R [2007] NSWCCA 159 at [11].
	
	
	The provisions of s 47(2), s 47(3) and s 47(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are in the following terms:
	


“47    Commencement of sentence

[…]

(2)    A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:

(a)    is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or

(b)    commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.

(3)    In deciding whether or not to make a direction under subsection (2)(a) with respect to a sentence of imprisonment, and in deciding the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced, the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, any of the offences to which the sentence relates.

(4)    The day specified in a direction under subsection (2)(b) must not be later than the day following the earliest day on which it appears (on the basis of the information currently available to the court) that the offender:

(a)    will become entitled to be released from custody, or

(b)    will become eligible to be released on parole,

having regard to any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject.”


	
	Under the State legislation a sentence of imprisonment cannot be imposed so as to commence at a date later than the day of sentence, unless it is to commence no later than the earliest day on which the applicant “will become eligible to be released on parole” for any other sentence. If an offender were released as a result of a recognizance release, is the offender on “parole” within the meaning of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act? And, if so, is the restriction in s 47(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act enacted as federal legislation, given the pointed absence of such a restriction in s 19 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act?
	
	
	Furthermore, even if a sentence of imprisonment were not prohibited by legislation from commencing in the future after an offender’s release on conditional liberty, ought it be done in other than exceptional circumstances? Does such a practice achieve the goals of transparency in sentencing and allow the prisoner and the public to understand the process?
	
	
	None of the foregoing questions have been raised by the parties in this appeal. Rather the appeal, understandably, concentrates on the effect of the overall sentence imposed and its alleged excess.
	
	
	Added to the foregoing complications is the operation of s 19AJ of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which limits the operation of the provisions relating to the fixing of a single recognizance release order (or non-parole period) to Commonwealth offences and not to a combination of Commonwealth and State offences. In the structure of the sentences, the commencement of the recognizance release order is at the conclusion of a period that commences before any Commonwealth offence. Again, this is not a matter raised in the appeal. Nor could it be, because formally the mandatory imprisonment period for a Commonwealth offence starts when the first of them commences and has a 9 month duration.
	


Facts


	
	Before dealing with the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to summarise the facts that have given rise to the offences and the Remarks on Sentence. The facts may be stated briefly.
	
	
	Following the monitoring of a website that publishes child abuse material, the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) identified the applicant as a visitor to, or user of, the site.
	
	
	On 14 May 2013, the AFP executed a search warrant at the applicant’s residence and conducted preliminary investigations of electronic devices. The AFP officers identified a laptop computer containing problematic images and videos.
	
	
	The applicant admitted to the AFP officers that he had created an account with a child abuse website and had written a paedophilic story (Count 3); that he received emails containing paedophilic material (360 files) (Count 1); that he sent child pornography to others by email (41 emails with 213 files) (Count 2); and that he stored paedophilic material on his computer and USB drives (1,122 items) (Count 4).
	
	
	The applicant was charged with Counts 1-4 and, on 11 August 2013, granted conditional bail. One of the bail conditions was that the applicant not use or obtain access to the internet.
	
	
	On 19 February 2014, NSW police officers conducted a random check to ensure compliance with the bail conditions and uncovered another laptop containing paedophilic material (190 files) (Count 5). This conduct occurred, as is obvious, while the applicant was on conditional liberty.
	
	
	The applicant filed a Form 1, List of Additional Charges, containing one offence, being the possession of a prohibited drug (cannabis) to be taken into account in sentencing for Count 4.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing judge held that the following matters were particularly relevant in assessing the seriousness of the offences generally: actual children were used in the material; the age of the children; the gravity of the acts performed and depicted; the depiction of over 300 different children; material was in the applicant’s possession primarily for his own purposes and, in relation to one of the offences, for non-commercial distribution; no sophisticated degree of planning; no collaboration with other persons; no risk that the material would be acquired by vulnerable persons; no risk that the material would be seen by persons susceptible of acting or being coerced to act in the manner depicted; and the material would be seen by persons with similar interests to the applicant. The offence was held to be below mid-range in objective seriousness.
	
	
	General deterrence was said to be of paramount importance and the offences, for that reason amongst others, were appropriate for a custodial sentence. The sentencing judge accepted that the offences formed part of a single course of conduct and could not be regarded as spontaneous or impulsive.
	
	
	The vulnerability and number of victims was not a factor the sentencing judge considered separately, as he had taken them into account in assessing the objective seriousness more generally.
	
	
	In considering subjective factors, the judge noted that the applicant suffered severe abuse and neglect as a child, although more recently his grandparents had provided him with a stable home. The sentencing judge referred to the report of Dr Furst, tendered by defence counsel, which concluded that the applicant developed paedophilic behaviour, in part, as a means of coping with loneliness and emotional distress and otherwise for sexual arousal.
	
	
	The applicant had no prior convictions and was a person of previous good character. While taking those factors into account, the sentencing judge commented that previous good character was to be given less weight in offences of this kind. Of course, as earlier stated, Count 5 occurred at a time when the applicant was on bail for the other counts, which qualifies the good character factor and the learned judge took that into account as an aggravating factor because of the need for specific deterrence.
	
	
	In further mitigation, the sentencing judge considered and took account of the applicant’s plea at the earliest opportunity and provided a 25% reduction for its utilitarian value for all offences and also took account of the applicant’s remorse and assistance in the investigation of the offences.
	
	
	The sentencing judge, taking into account the voluntary early intervention by psychologists, the two pre-sentence reports identifying programmes that may be available (one in particular), considered there were sound prospects for rehabilitation and that the risk of re-offending was medium.
	
	
	Lastly, the learned judge took account of the applicant’s exploitation of the anonymity of the internet to share child pornography with others and considered that each offence was to some extent distinct and required a degree of accumulation.
	


Submissions and Consideration


	
	The applicant submits that the sentences are manifestly excessive and the degree of accumulation too severe in that it does not adequately take totality into account. The question of whether a sentence is excessive (manifestly or otherwise) is a conclusion dependent on the outcome.
	
	
	Manifest error occurs when a sentence is excessive (or lenient) to an extent that there must have been error of principle or the misapplication of principle, even though none can be identified.
	
	
	It is not suggested that any finding of fact is wrong or that the judge relied on any mistaken view of the facts. Nor is it said that the judge failed to rely on any principle or mistook any principle. In other words, the applicant relies on manifest error.
	
	
	In order to do so, the applicant must show that the sentencing discretion miscarried, resulting in a sentence that is beyond the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence and taking account of the subjective circumstances of the offender. In order for this Court to intervene, it is not sufficient that one or all of us may have sentenced differently or less severely or given less or more weight to one or more factors: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [22], [53]; Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321; Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584; Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15].
	
	
	In Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25] Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ said:
	


“As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King, itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender’s appeal, as ‘manifest excess’, or in a prosecution appeal, as ‘manifest inadequacy’.” [Citations omitted.]


	
	In Kentwell v the Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601, the plurality judgment confirmed the foregoing approach at [35], where the High Court said:
	


“In the case of specific error, the appellate court’s power to intervene is enlivened and it becomes its duty to re-sentence, unless in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion it concludes that no different sentence should be passed. By contrast, absent specific error, the appellate court may only intervene if it concludes that the sentence falls outside the permissible range of sentences for the offender and the offence.” (per French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ; see also Gageler J at [42] and Hayne J in AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; (1999) 148 CLR 111 at 160 [150]).


	
	The applicant relies on the conclusion of the sentencing judge that the offence is below mid-range; the overlapping nature of the offences (particularly “accessing” and “possessing” child abuse material); the lack of prior offences; the guilty plea; the positive prospects of rehabilitation and the applicant’s recent improvement in personal circumstances.
	
	
	Reliance was also placed on cases that were said to be comparable and on statistics. A court, particularly at appellate level, must be very cautious of using statistics, or even (although to a lesser extent) comparable cases. Each offence and offender is unique. The legislative guidepost is the maximum sentence and, if one exists, any standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Each of the factors relied upon by the applicant were matters that the sentencing judge considered. The offences were serious; the child pornography fell into the higher categories of depravity and there was a significant amount of it.
	
	
	There is a difference in seriousness between gaining access and possessing child pornography. A person may gain access once and in some cases it may be a prurient but experimental interest. If material is downloaded and possessed, there is greater and easier access and generally it discloses more continuing and greater interest. They are distinct offences, which, in these charges, relate to different material.
	
	
	Further a study of the comparable cases discloses head sentences that vary significantly and range between 18 months’ and 5 years’ imprisonment: R v Linardon [2014] NSWCCA 247; R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174; R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183; and Fitzgerald v R [2015] NSWCCA 266.
	
	
	General deterrence is a most significant factor in offences of this kind and the criminal conduct goes beyond access and viewing for personal use to the production and distribution of child pornography and involves a large number of children and large amounts of material.
	
	
	No individual sentence involves manifest excess and the overall sentence is also within range. The submissions of accumulation were, for obvious reasons, repetitive of the submissions on manifest excess.
	
	
	The complaint about fixing sentences for the State offences to operate first and then accumulating the Commonwealth sentences is wholly without merit. It is an appropriate method of overcoming some of the complexities created by the interaction of the State and Commonwealth sentencing regimes, made more complex by the casuistry in the Commonwealth Crimes Act.
	
	
	As for the questions posed earlier in these reasons, as stated, they have not been raised by the parties. The overall sentence is appropriate and within range.
	
	
	Any difficulty associated with commencing a Commonwealth recognizance release order before the commencement of a sentence for a term of imprisonment to which the release order relates is not expressly prohibited by s 47(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as the prohibition therein deals with parole, which in the Commonwealth legislation is a different concept.
	
	
	In any event, the issue could easily have been resolved by fixing an aggregate sentence for the two Commonwealth offences. It is unnecessary to deal further with the issues.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Rothman J. I also agree with the additional observations of Macfarlan JA.

2769842,State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 914,"Judgment


	
	This matter has some history, which can be fully appreciated by reference to earlier decisions of this Court, and of the Court of Appeal. Chronologically, they are: State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1515; State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1679; State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1871; State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1970; Anderson v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 86; State of New South Wales v Ronald Anderson (Supreme Court (NSW), Fagan J, 23 May 2016, unrep); and State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 828.
	
	
	The State seeks to have the defendant made subject to a continuing detention order (“CDO”) pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (“the Act”) for a period of 8 months. An extended supervision order (“ESO”) has been made by this Court, as varied by the Court of Appeal, for the defendant’s supervision under the Act, for a period of 5 years from, either, the date of expiry of any CDO made at the finalisation of these proceedings, or from the date on which the Court declines to make such an order.
	
	
	The only matter for determination then is the State’s application for a CDO with respect to the defendant.
	


The Application and the Statutory Scheme


	
	A great deal has already been recorded in the judgments referred to above as to the statutory scheme under which the State’s application is made, and the way in which it applies or is argued to apply to the defendant. I do not intend to repeat what has already been said in previous judgments, but adopt what I earlier said as to the legislative framework and objectives of the Act: State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1970 at [8] – [25].
	
	
	Suffice to say that the basis of the State’s application is that the defendant is a “high risk sex offender” pursuant to s 5B(1) and (2) of the Act, and the defendant does not dispute that the evidence establishes that he is. The focus of the evidence and submissions of the parties, and the particular question to be determined by the Court, is whether adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order (s 5D(1)).
	
	
	The State argues that the defendant has a demonstrated capacity to catastrophically sexually offend, and to do so rapidly, without warning, against a stranger, and without regard to legal restraint. The supervision available to him pursuant to an ESO cannot adequately monitor or prevent anticipated risk factors from manifesting, and could not prevent the defendant from sexually offending in the future. Reliance is placed upon the defendant’s history of failing to comply with court orders intended to regulate his conduct, and in particular, his apparent failure to comply with the interim supervision order (“ISO”) imposed upon him by the Court of Appeal on 27 April 2016 (see Anderson v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 86).
	
	
	The defendant’s argument is that, whilst an ESO cannot mitigate all risk to the safety of the community, the 54 conditions imposed upon him by the ESO already made are onerous, impose significant limitations on his liberty, and are sufficient to address the risk. Supervision, either direct or electronic, is available to the defendant 24 hours per day and, in combination with community based support and therapy, provides an adequate means of managing the risk the defendant poses to the community. The apparent breaches of the ISO are referred to as “lapses” which, given that they were detected, demonstrate the efficacy of supervision.
	


The Evidence


	
	The evidence tendered by the State is voluminous. Much of it has been canvassed in earlier decisions of the Court, including in the decision of this Court of 18 December 2015, wherein the evidence of the events prior to 14 December 2015 was set out. As with the detail of the statutory scheme, I do not propose to repeat it.
	
	
	In summary, the defendant is an individual who has gravely offended against the laws of this State, who has done so repeatedly, and with terrible consequences. The index sexual offences of aggravated sexual assault were described by the sentencing judge, without hyperbole, as “despicable, atrocious, [and] dehumanising acts.” They are not the only examples of unlawful violence in the defendant’s criminal antecedents.
	
	
	The defendant has spent most of his adult life in prison, with short periods of liberty ended by the commission of further offences, and further incarceration. When in prison he has repeatedly breached prison discipline. When at liberty subject to supervision, his response has generally been poor.
	
	
	The defendant’s past is indicative of an individual who has been consistently incapable of respecting the humanity of others, or of complying with both the criminal law and specific court orders.
	
	
	The evidence before the Court leaves no basis for anything other than satisfaction to a high standard that the defendant is a high risk sex offender such that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	The focus of the hearing in this matter however has not been whether the Court can be satisfied to the necessary standard of that proposition; it is whether adequate supervision of the defendant cannot be provided by an ESO.
	
	
	The evidence relevant to that question and of most importance in considering that issue is that relating to the defendant’s conduct since December 2015, best revealed in case and counselling notes, and recent psychiatric and risk assessments.
	


Psychiatric Evidence


	
	Each of Doctors Andrew Ellis, Jeremy O’Dea, and Richard Furst examined the defendant in 2015, and gave evidence to the Court on 14 December 2015. Each has provided a further report as to more recent consultations with the defendant. It is that more recent opinion which is summarised below. A summary of the earlier evidence of each can be found in State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1970.
	
	
	Dr Ellis saw the defendant on 30 May 2016 for an hour. His report of 7 June 2016 was in evidence before the Court, and the doctor gave evidence on 24 June 2016.
	
	
	Dr Ellis took a history from the defendant during the May 2016 interview. The defendant described his feelings of hopelessness on being returned to custody in December 2015, and being depressed and anxious thereafter. Craving drugs, he obtained buprenorphine from another prisoner and used the drug by intravenous injection.
	
	
	On release to the community in late April 2016, and struggling to cope, he again used buprenorphine, on this occasion obtained from another COSP resident. He told Dr Ellis that this occurred during the first two weeks following his release on 27 April 2016.
	
	
	Commencing anti-depressant medication after consulting a general practitioner had led to an improvement, and he said that he no longer craved drugs.
	
	
	The defendant said that he is not happy residing at the COSP and wishes to return to the supported accommodation in which he was previously living with Providential Homes.
	
	
	Dr Ellis did not find any evidence of depressed cognition and found the defendant to have a positive, if subdued mood. He confirmed his earlier diagnoses. The doctor thought that the defendant would benefit from an opioid replacement regime and from an anti-depressant of the kind now prescribed to the defendant in the community. He regarded that prescription as serendipitous. He considered a return to custody would be unlikely to yield any positive rehabilitative outcome. He opined:
	


“In this case with the significant monitoring that can be in place with an extended supervision order, including restrictions on accommodation such as residing in a COSP or other approved residence and restrictions on associating with vulnerable persons and antisocial associates the potential greater gains in risk reduction in a structured community setting are considered suitable to manage the current risk profile. At this point he is engaging with supervision and treatment providers at a satisfactory level. Rehabilitation and risk management need not be mutually exclusive goals. Monitoring could detect early engagement in at risk behaviour before offending occurred, and appropriate risk management, up to and including return to custody for breaches can be effected.” (Report of Dr Ellis, dated 7 June 2016, p 9)


	
	In evidence on 24 June 2016, and referring to the defendant’s recent use of prohibited drugs, Dr Ellis noted that use of such drugs was problematic for a number of reasons. He said (at T52:33 – 37):
	


“There's not a clear and direct link between drug use and further serious offending, but there is certainly an association between the two, and during a period of intoxication the person's mental state is altered and they are more likely to act out on impulses or aggression that they already have.”


	
	He considered the detection of a lapse into drug use as of great importance in the supervision of an individual with a high propensity to seriously offend, at least in part because the disinhibition associated with drug intoxication considerably heightens the risk of the defendant sexually reoffending.
	
	
	Whilst the defendant’s use of prohibited drugs was regarded by Dr Ellis as a negative feature, and one attendant with an increase of risk of the commission of serious offences, he also referred to positive features of the defendant’s period in the community after 27 April 2016.
	
	
	The defendant has engaged with his supervisors, accepted regular counselling through the Forensic Psychology Service, attended meetings of Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and complied with scheduling requirements. He has additionally been offered independent accommodation and part-time paid employment through Providential Homes. Those were all features which mitigated risk.
	
	
	Although cautioning (at T58:47-50) that offenders who target strangers (as the defendant has) show a greater level of impulsivity, anti-social rule breaking, and are more likely to behave in a volatile manner, Dr Ellis concluded (at T57:45 – T58:01):
	


“So I think whilst an extended supervision order could never be said to be watertight or impossible for him to seriously offend on, I think the proposed conditions would be adequate to manage the risk, but ‑ and I think the fact that he has lapsed during it, and there's a response, give some evidence to that. But it's not ‑ you couldn't be conclusive and say that extended supervision order will prevent any reoffending, but there's a very significant reduction by being under supervision.”


	
	The only benefit Dr Ellis saw in returning the defendant to custody was that of containment; he could not identify any therapeutic or long term risk reduction benefits from further incarceration.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea saw the defendant on 23 May 2016 for about 90 minutes. He confirmed his earlier diagnoses.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea thought that the defendant was quieter, more reflective and less angry than he had been when assessed in 2015. The defendant told Dr O’Dea that he had craved buprenorphine and heroin and had applied for placement on a methadone maintenance program. He told the doctor that he had stopped using buprenorphine on the day of his release from custody (28 April 2016). He expressed himself as willing to consider anti-libidinal medication if it kept him out of gaol.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea considered that it would be beneficial to the defendant for him to have access to methadone maintenance, and continue in a structured community based alcohol and drug program. He also considered that anti-libidinal medication could be of assistance. His diagnosis of Substance Abuse Disorder and Personality Disorder remained unchanged.
	
	
	In evidence on 24 June 2016 Dr O’Dea referred to a “package of interventions” in the community which could address the defendant’s psychological and behavioural issues, and ameliorate the risk he posed to the community. He felt that the defendant’s engagement with Forensic Psychology Services was positive and helpful in managing risk, although he acknowledged that illicit drug use was a problem, and one not disclosed by the defendant to the doctor. He said, at T89:24 – 36:
	


“[…] the other thing that from my assessment that I took away, particularly from him saying that he was having cravings for heroin and buprenorphine, was that in one sense he was expressing to me that he had ongoing problems with his opiate, at least, use disorder. And what I took away from my assessment was that he had ongoing problems with his substance use disorder that needed assertive and immediate treatment, because as we have discussed today, it is a significant risk factor that was not at that stage being appropriately and adequately managed, even if it was just that he was having cravings for opiates. But I take your point, and I accept it, that the fact that he was not open and honest in disclosing to me indicates, you know, particularly in the nature of that interview and the circumstances, you know, that some level of problems with being honest and open.”


	
	Dr O’Dea saw no utility in custody based therapy, noting that there was no real evidence to suggest that such programs were successful. He did not regard further incarceration as having any rehabilitative benefit to the defendant.
	
	
	Dr Furst saw the defendant for about an hour on 31 May 2016. Dr Furst took a history from the defendant of his progress since December 2015. He told the doctor that, after being returned to custody on 18 December 2015, he had felt confused and distressed. The strain on him was such that he illicitly used buprenorphine in early April, subsequently testing positive on a urine test.
	
	
	He had, however, attended three CUBIT maintenance sessions in custody.
	
	
	On 28 April 2016 he was released from custody and entered the Nunyara COSP. Feeling stressed, unable to sleep, and overwhelmed, he again illicitly used buprenorphine soon after.
	
	
	After consulting a doctor, the defendant was prescribed an anti-depressant, and he feels that the medication is assisting his mood and problems with sleep disturbance. He says he has not felt tempted to resort to illicit drugs since commencing the medication.
	
	
	The defendant is engaged with Forensic Psychology Services for counselling and support, and attends NA meetings. He has been in contact with his family, and travelled to the north of the state to see his mother and sister. He outlined his hopes for the future.
	
	
	Dr Furst did not consider the defendant to be depressed when he saw him in May, although he was anxious about court proceedings. He regarded the defendant’s addiction and the occasions on which the defendant had resorted to illicit drug use as an ongoing concern, particularly so when substance abuse is an important risk factor for sexual offending.
	
	
	Whilst the doctor considered that a CDO would provide containment and short term risk reduction, he thought incarceration carried with it risks that the defendant would become demoralised and that he would not have an opportunity equivalent to that available to him in the community of accessing treatment options. Dr Furst opined:
	


“Despite the extensive and onerous nature of the proposed conditions, I continue to have concerns about the adequacy of such an ESO to adequately manage his risk issues, especially is [sic] he continues to use drugs of abuse and/or becomes more stressed/emotionally unstable. The pattern in past offending has included a lack of warning, impulsivity and catastrophic consequences for victims. The apparent used [sic] of violence and/or sexual violence/threats as a means of revenge was also noted. His overall level of insight into his past offending and individual risk factors is probably superficial.” (Report of Dr Furst, dated 9 June 2016, p 14)


	
	In his evidence on 28 June 2016 Dr Furst referred to the defendant’s use of illicit drugs whilst subject to the ISO as problematic, and a feature which heightened the risk he posed to the community. He said (at T109:25 – 31):
	


“Well, the association between substance abuse and offending is quite well known in the literature, and it is also an individual risk factor which is one of the most significant risk factors for Mr Anderson, and that is having regard to a history of literally now decades of offending, especially starting in his I think teens and 20s which was drug related. And also the presence of drug use at the time of the 2001 index offence, on that occasion I think amphetamines and the general effect of drugs on disinhibition and potential violence for him.”


	
	He regarded the defendant’s performance in the community subject to the ISO as mixed. Positive features included the defendant’s willingness to undertake counselling with Forensic Psychology Services, his attendance at NA, his engagement with his Community Corrections ESO supervisor, his potential employment, and his willingness to seek out medical treatment through his general practitioner and through the Langton Clinic, a service offering opiate replacement therapy and other drug rehabilitation services. The principal negative feature of the defendant’s time in the community was his illicit drug use and the lies he told to supervisors about his use of drugs. As to negative features, he said (at T111:8 – 17):
	


“I think the drug use is probably the most significant, because we have now ‑ we are now looking at the drug use in custody which was reported, even going back to the day before he got released last year, and now again by according to the notes, a month or so prior to release, and then again on release. So in my view, that is evidence that the addiction problem he has had for the last three or four decades is well and truly alive and not resolved, and that he is likely to continue to be at risk of relapsing and or using drugs on an ongoing basis. And the risk for Mr Anderson with his personality structure and profile, and the previous offences he has committed, would clearly be of either offending in a violent way or a sexual manner going forward.”


	
	The doctor thought that it was likely that the defendant’s apparent transparency with his supervisor was probably not as open and honest as it may have been perceived to be.
	
	
	Dr Furst also thought that a methadone replacement program or other opioid replacement therapy was necessary, as was a continuation, at an increased dose, of anti-depressant medication, as a mood stabiliser.
	
	
	He continued to have concerns about the adequacy of supervision, commenting (at T114:19 – 31):
	


“Well, the ‑ one would think that a person who is going through these court proceedings, and with the sort of potential for a CDO or an ESO looming, would be on their best behaviour and would comply with conditions as best they could. I am not saying that he hasn't been ‑ I am not saying that Mr Anderson hasn't being trying his best during this period, but notwithstanding that, there has still been an obvious breach in terms of drug use or a non compliance with the conditions not to use drugs. So my view would be that the concern about the adequacy stems from the fact that drug use is likely to continue, if that is what has happened so far, and it is really more a question of whether that can be tolerated or not, or to what degree that can be tolerated going forward, particularly given the risk factors identified about him as an individual when using drugs and him as an individual even when not using drugs.”

Risk Management Assessment


	
	In evidence are reports from Kristy Murphy (dated 28 January 2015), Kevin Makar (dated 2 March 2015), and Rebecca Kaye (dated 24 May 2016).
	
	
	In January 2015 Ms Murphy assessed the defendant as being at high risk of sexual reoffending relative to other sex offenders. She considered him to be someone with a propensity to use violence, including sexual violence, to have his needs met, and who had difficulties in regulating his own behaviour. Ms Murphy considered that, in the community, intensive supervision would be of benefit.
	
	
	In his March 2015 report Mr Makar noted the risk assessment made by Ms Murphy and considered strategies to address risk, together with potential limitations on risk management strategies. Suggested management of the risk posed by the defendant included weekly interviews with Community Corrections staff, including home visits conducted without warning; weekly interviews with others, such as employers and rehabilitation providers; the defendant’s participation with Forensic Psychology Services and monitoring of the result; conducting random breath and urine tests; electronic monitoring; the imposition of activity schedules and curfews; and continual review of what is in place and what is required.
	
	
	Mr Makar noted some of the limitations upon strategies to manage risk, including the defendant’s potential non-compliance and unwillingness to permit home visits or undergo urinalysis.
	
	
	The most recent risk assessment report was provided by Ms Kaye, the defendant’s ESO team supervisor. Ms Kaye’s report of 24 May 2016 was in evidence, and Ms Kaye gave evidence before the Court on 24 June 2016.
	
	
	In her report Ms Kaye noted that the defendant had been compliant with the ISO since his release in April 2016, until an incident of illicit drug use was discovered, on 20 May 2016. He had otherwise worked well with supervisors and counsellors, and had received an offer of paid part-time employment and independent accommodation.
	
	
	The defendant had had some family contact, including a visit to his mother and sister in the north of the state, and some telephone contact with his daughter.
	
	
	Although aware of what she understood to be one incident of illicit drug use in the community, Ms Kaye assessed the defendant as being at a medium level risk of reoffending. In her report she expressed confidence that, whilst superficial engagement with supervision was a risk factor, she believed that the defendant was open and honest with her.
	
	
	Risk was intended to be managed by weekly interviews, regular urinalysis, interviews with third parties, home visits, and electronic monitoring. She noted that the resources available to the ESO Team operated as a potential limitation on supervision, in that field visits could only be conducted once a month, and it was not possible to observe the defendant constantly.
	
	
	Ms Kaye, who has been employed in her current role since August 2014, was called to give evidence on 24 June 2016. She expanded somewhat on the limitations to supervision. Although she acknowledged that urinalysis was an important part of monitoring the defendant’s compliance with restrictions on his access to drug use, Ms Kaye said that urinalysis was sometimes not able to be undertaken because obtaining a sample from the defendant was dependent upon a male staff member being available to supervise the process, and being in premises in which a sample could be given.
	
	
	In custody, the defendant had used prohibited drugs, a fact that Ms Kaye became aware of on 20 May 2016. A urine sample provided by the defendant whilst in custody on 29 March 2016 had tested positive for buprenorphine, a substance not prescribed to the defendant, with that result being made available to Corrective Services via entry into the relevant database on 10 May 2016. Ms Kaye found out the result through the database ten days later.
	
	
	In the community it was intended to obtain samples for urinalysis from the defendant weekly, although that was subject to the limitations to which I have already referred. Face to face interviews with him were expected to be weekly, with a “field visit”, to his home, workplace, or other location, once a month.
	
	
	During one such face to face interview with the defendant, on 20 May 2016, Ms Kaye discovered drug use by the defendant when she asked him to provide a urine sample, and he said he was not able to, initially attributing that to the fact that he had used the toilet just before the interview and could not produce further urine for a sample. Ms Kaye accepted what she was told, although returned to the question of the provision of a sample after completing her interview with the defendant. He then disclosed that he did not want to provide a sample as it would reveal drug use.
	
	
	By other questions Ms Kaye established that the defendant had used illicit drugs in the period 5 – 10 May 2016. The following evidence was given (at T19:8 - 48):
	


“A. Yeah. And then so I recall that then, towards the end of the interview, when it was winding up, so I said, you know, ""So about that urine."" And Mr Anderson said ‑ sorry, I could read it, but I am just recalling.

Q. No, feel free to refresh your—

A. Okay.

Q. ‑‑recollection if you need to from your note?

A. Yeah. So because ‑ sorry. So I said to him at the end, ""Okay, so about that urine."" And he said, ""Oh, no, not today."" And straight away I was I guess concerned because it is not a usual response from him. And I said, ""Is there a problem? Have you used,"" and he said, ""Yes I have.""

Q. And what did he say?

A. I asked him, you know, what happened. Well, I will have a look at my notes, sorry. So as I recall, I tried to work out when the drug use had happened, and he wasn't that clear on it. So I tried to prompt with dates that I could recall. And I worked ‑ I said to him, you know, you had a urine on 5 May, and he said it was after that. And then I said ‑ he said that he had disclosed the drug use while he went to NA, which is the Narcotics Anonymous group. So then I just estimated that it was somewhere between 5 and 10 May. I asked him what‑‑

Q. And pausing there, that was consistent with what he had told you, that range of dates between 5 and 10?

A. Because he said in the last couple of weeks, so it sort of fell into that time period. And I asked, ""What did you use,"" and he said, ""Gear."" And I just said, ""What does that mean"" and he said, ""Heroin."" And then I asked, ""Did you, you know, use it intravenously,"" and he said, ""Yes."" And then I said, like, you know, ""Where did you get it from,"" kind of thing. And he said, ""Oh, I just got it at the COSP. I didn't have to pay for it."" I didn't ask him who gave it to him or anything like that because at the time ‑ anyway, sorry, yeah. Just I wanted sort of to find out where he was at, so yeah.

Q. And was it the case that his disclosure to you of having used heroin raised significant risk concerns, as far as you were concerned?

A. My concern was at that time more for his health and his well‑being. I didn't have concerns in terms ‑ I obviously it is a risk factor for him; it is an indicator that he is not coping. And but it ‑ so it is, you know, the whole range of warnings, if you like. But my main concern at that time was his health and well‑being.”


	
	Ms Kaye accompanied the defendant to see a medical practitioner that day, to whom the defendant disclosed intravenous use of “bupe” (buprenorphine) one to two weeks previously.
	
	
	Although the time frame given by the defendant to Ms Kaye for use by him of heroin, and the time frame given to the doctor for use of “bupe” did not entirely correspond, and the substance referred to in each case was different, Ms Kaye assumed that the defendant was referring to a single instance, and did not further question him or make other inquiries to establish what drugs had been taken nor when such drugs had been taken. The following evidence was given:
	


“Q. But you didn't question him on whether there were two separate uses?

A. No, because he referred to only using one time, one use, one relapse, one, yeah.

Q. Heroin once, yes?

A. Yep.

Q. And then a second reference to bupe, which you took to be the same use?

A. Yep. I took to be the same use, yep.

Q. And you believed Mr Anderson when he told you that he had used heroin slash buprenorphine? You accepted what he said was true?

A. Yeah.” (T21:20 – 32)


	
	The question of what drugs the defendant used, how frequently and when is not resolved with any clarity on the evidence; there was a gap in the administration of urinalysis with no sample obtained on and from 6 May 2016 to 20 May 2016, and the defendant’s self-reports are inconsistent and unreliable.
	
	
	Ms Kaye had considered the defendant was “going along okay” (T22:23).
	


Consideration


	
	The objects of the Act are set out at s 3. The Act provides for the extended supervision or continuing detention of (relevantly) high risk sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and to encourage such individuals to undertake rehabilitation.
	
	
	How best to meet the second of the stated objects of the Act relevant to the defendant is the most readily determined.
	
	
	The overwhelming weight of the evidence points to a conclusion that the defendant’s rehabilitation needs are better met by services available to him in the community, and he is more likely to engage with community based rehabilitative services than he is with custody based programs.
	
	
	There is a real question as to whether any meaningful programs would in fact be available to the defendant in prison. The period of 8 months for which the State seeks to have a CDO in place is a relatively short period, and it is clear that assessment for and admission to available programs within a custodial setting does not happen quickly.
	
	
	Such programs as are available are limited, and appear to be substantially confined to what is referred to as maintenance. There is presently no day leave available to prisoners for the purpose of attending an external counselling service, specifically the Forensic Psychology Service with which the defendant is presently involved, and so that option would be closed to him, at least for the next three or so months (Affidavit of Vincenzo Camporeale dated 28 June 2016).
	
	
	Each of Drs Ellis, O’Dea and Furst were of the view that there was little or no benefit to the defendant from participation in services available in custody, with Dr O’Dea referring to the lack of evidence as to the efficacy of such services in any event.
	
	
	By contrast, the defendant has access to a wide range of counselling and other therapeutic services in the community, including individual counselling with Forensic Psychology Services, and participation in NA meetings.
	
	
	Additionally, the defendant has been offered part-time paid employment, and Dr Furst deposed that employment is an important means of encouraging and assisting an individual to achieve a crime-free lifestyle.
	
	
	The weight of the evidence is that encouraging the defendant to undertake appropriate rehabilitation will occur only in the community.
	
	
	The only advantage then to a continuing detention order is that of containment, a matter comprehended by the first of the objects of the Act, to ensure the safety and protection of the community.
	
	
	The question of containment, in turn, requires consideration of risk management, and whether supervision is adequate.
	
	
	When earlier considering this issue (in State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1970) I concluded that the risk posed by the defendant was such that an extended supervision order could not adequately supervise the defendant, and his continuing detention was therefore necessary.
	
	
	One of the principal areas of concern militating in favour of that conclusion was the defendant’s drug use, and his apparent unwillingness or inability to remain abstinent from illicit drug use.
	
	
	There is a clear link between illicit drug use and the commission by the defendant of serious criminal offences. Thus drug use by him is a feature that significantly elevates the risk that he will again offend seriously against the criminal law, with the likely consequence the destruction of any future victim that attends that risk.
	
	
	The risk of the defendant abusing drugs has in fact manifested, with the defendant using prohibited drugs at least twice in the period March to May 2016.
	
	
	Referring to the use of buprenorphine by the defendant in custody in October 2015, at the very time this Court was considering whether to order his interim detention, the Court of Appeal in Anderson v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 86 said (at [96]):
	


“This is a matter of significant concern, given the association disclosed by Mr Anderson’s history between his substance abuse and offending, with potentially disastrous consequences.”


	
	The Court went on to conclude that supervision was adequate nevertheless, because the October 2015 use was an isolated incident. At [97] the Court said:
	


“However, on balance, a number of countervailing matters outweigh the concern engendered by Mr Anderson’s use of drugs in October 2015. One is that, on the evidence before this Court, that was an isolated incident, which has not been repeated. Another is that Mr Anderson is well aware that the use (and for that matter merely the possession) of alcohol or illicit drugs is a contravention of the supervision order to which he will be subject, which is itself a serious crime and which, almost certainly, will result in his being returned to prison. In other words, the supervision order may be expected, of itself, to be a powerful motivating factor for Mr Anderson to comply with its conditions.”


	
	Regrettably, the likely deterrent effect and motivating power of the consequences of breaching a supervision order in fact seems to have had little or no effect on the defendant.
	
	
	At a time when his appeal had been filed IN the Court of Appeal and was awaiting the determination of the Court, and when his liberty was at stake, the defendant used nine “points” of illicit buprenorphine. Plainly, the pending court proceeding did nothing to regulate the defendant’s conduct.
	
	
	Having been released to supervision pursuant to an ISO, and at a time when the defendant was well aware of both the prohibition on his use of illicit drugs, and the likely consequences to him of a breach of that prohibition, he again resorted to drug use, probably more than once.
	
	
	The frequency with which he has used illegal drugs in the community cannot be determined, both because the defendant has proven to be capable of falsity in his self-reports of drug use, and because those charged with the defendant’s supervision failed to ascertain the nature and extent of that drug use, despite the risks associated with drug use being well understood.
	
	
	On becoming aware that the defendant had used “gear”, the principal concern of the defendant’s supervisors was the defendant’s health and well-being. Steps were taken to obtain medical treatment for the defendant, but nothing was done to ascertain precisely what drug or drugs the defendant had used, how frequently, and in what circumstances. Nor were steps taken to alert the Court to the breach of its orders, or to initiate criminal proceedings for an offence pursuant to s 12 of the Act.
	
	
	These lapses, both on the defendant’s part and on the part of those supervising him, are a matter of great concern, and of direct relevance to the assessment of the adequacy of supervision.
	
	
	The terms of the current ISO, and of the ESO already made in relation to the defendant, are stringent. The combination of electronic monitoring, regular meetings with supervisors, regulation of activities and associates, and engagement with therapeutic and other appropriate services, provides a level of oversight which ought to be capable of providing adequate supervision to the defendant in the community such that the risk to the community is mitigated. However, an order for supervision is heavily dependent upon the skill and diligence of those administering the order.
	
	
	The efficacy of an ISO or ESO is commensurate with the capacity of those monitoring the defendant’s compliance to provide proper and effective supervision. There will be a comprehensive failure by those charged with the defendant’s supervision, and thus of an ISO or ESO, where those individuals fail to maintain objectivity and rigour in the discharge of their function. The principal function of supervision is to ensure compliance with the Court’s orders, thereby ensuring the safety of the community.
	
	
	There should be little scope for a breach of an ISO or ESO to be excused as an understandable hiccup, it being a criminal offence carrying a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Here, the evidence is that the defendant breached the ISO by using an illicit drug on at least one occasion (if not more), and additionally by failing to be truthful with his supervisors, including Ms Kaye and a supervisor to whom the defendant reported when visiting family in May 2016, as required of him by condition 9 of the Order. That is a matter of some concern when considering the adequacy of supervision.
	
	
	An additional concern relates to the resources available to the ESO team. If the statutory scheme put in place for the supervision of high risk offenders is to have any real utility the agencies implementing the scheme must be adequately resourced for the task.
	
	
	For example, regular urinalysis of the defendant, a supervisory tool recognised as necessary for proper monitoring of him, must be more than merely aspirational, with actual achievement dependent upon staffing levels. Once such testing is undertaken, results need to be obtained quickly, and reviewed with equal speed. A lesser standard could be disastrous, and certainly fails to contain the risk posed to the community by this defendant.
	
	
	These matters, being the defendant’s criminal drug use, and the failure of the supervisory scheme to quickly detect it, suggest that adequate supervision cannot be provided to the defendant in the community, and that a CDO is necessary to protect the community.
	
	
	The factors weighing against the imposition of a CDO are the defendant’s otherwise positive response to supervised liberty, and his engagement with counsellors, family, and employment. To that must be added the question of the impact of a further period of detention upon the defendant’s prospects of rehabilitation. The evidence establishes that rehabilitation will not be achieved or even advanced in custody; further, it suggests that another period of short term detention could seriously undermine it, with potentially dangerous results.
	
	
	Although I have already addressed these matters in a general way, it is necessary to turn specifically to the s 17(4) considerations.
	
	
	I have referred already to matters encompassed by s 17(4)(a) – (h1) when discussing the evidence of the defendant’s offences and his criminal history; the risk and other assessments of him by relevant staff of Corrective Services, and details of proposed measures by that agency for his management in the community; the psychiatric assessments conducted of the defendant; and the defendant’s encouraging level of engagement with counselling and other rehabilitative services. I have also set out the evidence as to his apparent breaches of the ISO to which he has been subject.
	
	
	Section 17(4)(i) requires the Court to consider any other available information as to the likelihood that the defendant will commit an offence of a sexual nature in the future. I have referred to the available information.
	
	
	In reality, the prediction that the legislation calls for is one which is impossible to make. The most that the Court can do is conclude that there is a risk of the commission of further serious sex offences by the defendant, probably more so in the medium to long term than in the immediate future, when the exigencies and ordinary disappointments of life begin to take their toll.
	
	
	Section 17(4)(k) requires the Court to consider any alteration to the circumstances since the ISO was made, and I have referred to the defendant’s positive engagement in the community, and also to his very troubling relapse into criminal conduct.
	
	
	Having considered all of the evidence to determine what is a very finely balanced matter, I have concluded that the Court should not impose a CDO upon the defendant.
	
	
	Particularly since encouraging rehabilitation is one of the objects of the Act the Court must consider the likely consequences of a further CDO on facilitating the defendant’s rehabilitation. The evidence suggests that the defendant would gain nothing from further incarceration. To a degree, it also raises the prospect that his rehabilitation will be adversely affected by a return to custody.
	
	
	Firstly, the defendant would be denied access to the community based services and support networks that appear to be of considerable benefit to him. Secondly, he would lose the opportunity to take up paid employment and the stable accommodation currently offered to him by Providential Homes, in circumstances where employment and accommodation are of considerable importance in achieving a positive and crime-free lifestyle. Thirdly, he would again be cut off from his family and without any family contact or support in custody.
	
	
	Finally, it is possible that the defendant will be plunged into hopelessness and despair by a return to custody, losing all motivation to pursue rehabilitation. In the longer term, such an outcome could be disastrous to the safety of the community. An 8 month CDO can mitigate risk for its duration, but it can do nothing to address the risk that the defendant may pose to others if, on release, he is lost to despair.
	
	
	Strict and objective supervision and monitoring, counselling, opioid replacement therapy, anti-depressant medication at a therapeutic level, stringent and frequent urinalysis, and access to employment, family and stable accommodation, should mitigate the risk posed by the defendant in both the short and longer term. In the longer term those strategies have a better capacity to encourage the defendant to lead a law-abiding lifestyle than does a potentially crushing second return to custody.
	
	
	Since an ESO has already been made by the Court, there will be supervision of the defendant in the community. On the present evidence, I cannot be satisfied that it is adequate. However, that does not mandate an order for continuing detention: State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280, at [71].
	
	
	The defendant has now been released to the community, returned to custody, and again released to the community, in a period of about six months. He has spent an anxious eight weeks waiting to know whether he might not yet be again imprisoned. Those circumstances give rise to the very real prospect that, if subjected to a short term CDO, the man released eight months hence would be lost to rehabilitation, and thus more dangerous to the community than he is presently assessed to be.
	
	
	Although I have reservations as to the adequacy of the current supervisory regime, I am not persuaded that, in all of the circumstances, a CDO should be made.
	


ORDER


	
	The State’s application is dismissed.

	I wish to record on the transcript that in chambers earlier today, in the presence of Mr Creasey SC, Mr Wilson SC directed me to the provisions of s 153 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and to the commentary on that section in the practice edited by R Howie and P Johnson, in answer to my question to him last week about whether, given the plea on arraignment, it was open to the accused to ask the jury for an acquittal of murder and, by implication, also of manslaughter. I am satisfied, having considered the material, that, with respect, Mr Wilson's submission should be accepted.
	
	
	In particular I have had regard to the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Broadbent [1964] VR 333. Having regard to the section and informed by the decision of the Victorian Full Court, I am satisfied that once the Crown elects not to accept the plea of guilty to the lesser offence, at least, where as here, that offence is not pleaded as an alternative count on the indictment, the plea uttered in the presence of the jury is treated as having been withdrawn and the trial continues on the count on the indictment.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, however, that the plea of guilty to manslaughter made in open court in the presence of the jury is admissible against the accused as an admission to which the jury may have regard against the accused when considering what the proper verdict should be.

		26 July 2016",2016-07-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769848,SafeWork NSW v Pegela Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 142,"Judgment

The charge and plea


	
	Pegela Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd (Pegela) is charged that on 4 June 2013 contrary to s 32 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 it breached a duty imposed on it under s 19(1). Pegela has pleaded guilty to the charge.
	


The legislation


	
	Section 19(1) of the Act relevantly provides:
	



	
	A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of:
	



	
	workers engaged, or caused to be engaged by the person, and
	
	
	… while the workers are at work in the business or undertaking.
	



	
	Section 32 relevantly provides:
	


A person commits a Category 2 offence if:


	
	the person has a health and safety duty, and
	
	
	the person fails to comply with that duty, and
	
	
	the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.
	



	
	The section then sets out penalties.
	


The facts


	
	Mr Suey was an operator of earthmoving machinery. He operated as Black Duck Trading. In December 2012, Mr Suey was engaged by a partnership which included the defendant. He worked at different sites of the partnership.
	
	
	On 4 June 2013, Mr Suey was fatally injured when he was crushed between a Mustang skid steer and a Hughes equipment hoe. This equipment was earthmoving equipment and was owned by the partnership. The hoe was attached to the skid steer. Mr Suey was crushed between the gears and metal bars of the hoe and the protective cage of the skid steer. There was nothing wrong with the machinery.
	
	
	The skid steer featured an adapter plate onto which a hoe and other attachments could be mounted. There are three interfacing parts, being upper, middle and lower mounting points.
	
	
	I pick up the description now from the statement of facts, exhibit PX2:
	


“21 The upper mounting points on the Hoe consist of a pair of spear and clevis assemblies, with one pair located on each side of the Hoe. The two spears fit into sockets on the Skid Steer, and the clevises are then lowered over the sockets with screws tightened to hold them in place.

22 The middle mounting point consists of a piece of channel section (or flange), on each of the Hoe and Skid Steer, which meet when the Hoe is mounted.

23 The lower mounting points consist of contact between the lower edge of the Skid Steer adapter plate and the bottom of the Hoe, from which protrudes a “tongue” pierced by a hole.

24 A retaining pin on the Skid Steer’s adapter plate is lowered through the hole in the “tongue” of the Hoe, using a handle which is locked when moved from left to right. With the pin lowered, the lower edges of the Skid Steer’s adapter plate and the Hoe are kept in contact, restricting the Hoe’s vertical movement.

25 Once the Hoe is attached to the Skid Steer, it can be operated from a seat which forms part of the Hoe. The Skid Steer operator’s seat is located within a protective cage, behind the Hoe operator’s seat.”


	
	After the incident inspection revealed that the screws at the upper mounting point were not tightened. It also revealed the handle used to lock the retaining pin in place at the lower mounting point was not in its locking position to the right.
	
	
	The skid steer and hoe were well maintained and both in good order and condition. The hoe had not been correctly fitted to the skid steer.
	
	
	On 12 June 2013 Mr Kent, SafeWork NSW Engineer, observed:
	


(a) the Hoe was partially detached from the Skid Steer and had rotated about its upper mounting points so that its chassis was tilted back towards the Skid Steer’s cabin;

(b) the lower mounting point was not connected because the retaining pin had not been lowered into the tongue protruding from the Hoe;

(c) the handle used to operate the pin was in the disengaged position; and

(d) the hand screws for the upper mounting point were not tightened.

[Statement of Facts - Exhibit PX2, para 54]


	
	In a report – exhibit PX1, tab 2, pages 9 and 10 - Mr Kent explained the mechanism of the lower mounting point. To engage the retaining pin a handle had to be moved from left to right. Moving it from left, the pin’s disengaged position, to the vertical, resulted in the pin then becoming engaged. Moving the handle then from the vertical to the right, engaged a spring-loaded safety function that prevented the handle from moving if an upwards force was applied to the pin.
	
	
	It is not in doubt that, at the time of the incident, the hoe was not properly secured at either the upper or lower mounting points.
	
	
	Dr White, forensic engineer, was of the view that:
	


“…the incident was caused by the retaining pin at the lower mounting point not being engaged, which allowed the bottom edge of the adaptor plate on the Skid Steer to separate from the bottom part of the Hoe and enabled the middle mounting point of the Hoe to lift off the top of the adapter plate.”

[Statement of Facts - Exhibit PX2, para 58]


	
	On 4 June 2013 at about 6.30am Mr Suey had commenced to operate the skid steer and hoe. He was to clear built-up soil from the external walls of a grain shed on a property known as “Brudle Park” located about 35km north-west of Moree.
	
	
	Prior to 4 June 2013, the partnership had an employee document for its properties, “Brudle Park” being one of several. In Mr Suey’s case, the document describes the location as Gunyerwarildi property though, from its context, it applies to all of the partnership properties. The document was marked by, or in respect of Mr Suey, by asterisks placed beside the following items: “Operation Mustang Bobcat”; “Operation of Ramps for Bobcat”; and “Operation of Bobcat Attachments.” It is a 13 page document otherwise unmarked or even dated or signed (Exhibit PX1, tab 4).
	
	
	Mr Dwyer, a general manager of the partnership, inducted Mr Suey at Gunyerwarildi. The induction included a general induction in relation to the skid steer. It did not include an induction in relation to the hoe. The partnership did not have any system in place with respect to the hitching of the hoe or other attachments to the skid steer.
	
	
	In March or April 2013, Mr Morelli, general manager, had described to Mr Suey the method of hitching the hoe to the skid steer. This was oral only. It did not include reference to the operations manuals or where they could be found.
	
	
	The manuals for the skid steer and hoe were located in an office at Gunyerwarildi, about 80km from the site of the work being done.
	
	
	The manual for the skid steer provided information in relation to connecting attachments. Significantly, it included:
	


●   “Move the hitch latch levers until fully engaged. The pin(s) must extend through the hole in the bucket or attachment.

WARNING: Latch pins must extend fully through the hole in the attachment. Lever(s) must be fully down and locked. Failure to secure pin(s) can allow attachment to come off which could cause injury or death.”

(Statement of Facts - Exhibit PX2, para 70)


	
	It also included the following information:
	


“Operators must read instructions before operating this machine. Untrained operators may cause injury or death”.

(Statement of Facts - Exhibit PX2, para 71)


	
	The manual for the hoe included the following information:
	


“…this implement is a heavy piece of equipment capable of inflicting a serious or even fatal injury if taken for granted or misused.

DO Make sure your hoe attachment is securely mounted and the mounting brackets are in good condition.

DO Everytime you use your machine, make sure the attachments are securely mounted and the mounting brackets are in good condition. Remember nothing is forever.”

[Statement of Facts - Exhibit PX2, para 72]


	
	At the time of the incident, Pegela did not have in place a system of work with respect to the attachment of implements to the skid steer. Since the incident, it has developed and implemented Standard Operating Procedures for this task. This is comprehensive – Exhibit PX1, tabs 7 and 8.
	
	
	On 30 May 2013, Mr Churchland, farmhand level 5, provided Mr Suey with a refresher on the skid steer and hoe. He explained the hitching process. Again, this was oral only.
	
	
	On 3 June 2013 Mr Suey asked Mr Gobbert if he knew how to attach the hoe to the skid steer. Mr Gobbert explained the process. Again, this was oral. At the time, they were adjacent to the skid steer and hoe. The explanation was given in relatively rough and ready terms, but in terms that were basically accurate and understood by Mr Suey.
	
	
	On 4 June 2013, sometime after he had commenced to operate the skid steer, Mr Suey was observed on the equipment having suffered his fatal injuries.
	
	
	Mr Suey was highly experienced and skilled in earthmoving operations. In a victim impact statement, his son described him as having “the reputation among colleagues as the last real dirt dragon”. He was an experienced operator of the skid steer. He had operated it many times before the incident. He had operated it with different implements, though not the hoe, attached to it. He had attached and detached these implements. He had done so shortly before the incident. In many respects, the attachment process was the same in each case. Relevantly, it was the same in that at the lower mounting point the retaining pin was engaged by moving the handle in an arc from left to right. This was not a difficult physical task.
	


The sentencing process


	
	I bear in mind the purposes of sentencing as enumerated in s3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I bear in mind the purposes of the Work Health and Safety Legislation, in particular, ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers and others on workplace premises. I bear in mind any relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including any mentioned in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act so far as any of those may be relevant.
	
	
	I start my analysis with a consideration of the gravity of the offence. This may be determined in party by the foreseeability of the risk of injury, the foreseeability of the consequences of the risk coming home and the measures available to avoid the risk.
	
	
	The risk alleged in this case was risk of Mr Suey being struck or crushed due to the hoe being incorrectly attached and becoming detached while in operation. That risk was foreseeable. So much is evident from the content of the operation manuals of the skid steer and of the hoe.
	
	
	Foreseeability of the particular chain of events that brings about an incident is not required, but it may have a relevance. The relevance lies in the defendant’s culpability. In this instance, critical to the risk and the resultant incident, was the failure to attach the hoe correctly to the skid steer. The attachment was done by Mr Suey. That occurred in this case on a background of Mr Suey being an experienced earthmoving operator. He was experienced in the operation of the skid steer. He was experienced in attaching and detaching implements, but not the hoe, to the skid steer. He had done so shortly before attaching the hoe on this occasion. Every attachment and detachment required the operation of a handle to secure and release a retaining pin. That task was physically a simple one. That task was not done on this occasion. The reason for that is unknown. This was the critical failure that caused the incident. The attachment process was undertaken by Mr Suey shortly after the process of attachment was explained to him and he expressed his understanding of it. The risk was foreseeable but, in the circumstances described, the manner of the occurrence of the incident lies very low on a scale of foreseeability.
	
	
	In the event of the risk coming home, the foreseeability of consequences including fatal injury is established and that foreseeability was patent.
	
	
	Measures were available to address the risk. I accept Pegela’s submission that they would not have eliminated the risk. That could be done only by a supervisor inspecting Mr Suey undertaking the attachment process, a step not called for or suggested.
	
	
	The measures suggested in this case would have minimised the risk. The measures were:
	



	
	training, including physical demonstration;
	
	
	provision of safe operating procedures; and
	
	
	having the operation manuals for the skid steer and the hoe readily available.
	


All these matters have since been attended to.


	
	I hesitate to place an offence involving risk of and fact of fatality at a low level in terms of a defendant’s culpability, but I think the circumstances I have described in the case, particularly as to the immediate cause of the incident, warrant my finding the defendant’s culpability to be at a relatively low level.
	
	
	There are other matters that need to be considered. I bear in mind a need for general deterrence. I accept Pegela’s submission that this is not a case of faulty machinery, poor maintenance or inadequate supervision. That does diminish Pegela’s culpability, but I do not consider it diminishes the weight that ought to be given to general deterrence. The use of machinery of this nature is widespread. Operators must be aware of their obligations in respect of the use of such machinery. Risks associated with the use of such machinery can arise as much from a lack of proper and comprehensive training as from other causes. This is a case where the failure lies in the training.
	
	
	I do not consider specific deterrence as a factor in this case. This is because of the extensive and immediate steps Pegela undertook following the incident to ensure safety. I do not propose to detail all this. It is fully set out in the tender bundle – Exhibit PX1, especially tabs 7 and 8 - and the affidavit of Mr Mason, especially paragraphs 13 and 14, and its exhibits (Exhibit DX1, tabs 4, 6, 7 and 10). It is sufficient to note that comprehensive steps have been taken to ensure this type of incident does not happen again, and have also been taken over all manner of activities in the farming industry that involve safety issues. These measures have involved not only the adoption of safety processes, but also their ongoing review and auditing, and recurrent and frequent training of employees.
	
	
	Pegela has fully cooperated with SafeWork in its investigations and this has involved considerable time.
	
	
	Pegela has been an active participant in the community and has supported charities and educational institutions. Details are more fully set out in Mr Mason’s affidavit (Exhibit DX1, para 15). It has been a corporate citizen of good standing.
	
	
	Pegela has pleaded guilty. That also is evidence of remorse. There was an expression of remorse by Mr Mason in giving evidence on the sentence hearing. This was criticised as being late and simply in response to the fact that it had been commented on in the prosecutor’s written submissions. It was late, and it did come in response to those submissions. More telling, however, is what the defendant did. Its plea of guilty and its most extensive overhaul of its safety systems with ongoing review are telling pieces of evidence supporting remorse.
	
	
	I have been provided with a victim impact statement from Mr Suey’s son, James Boss. The hurt and loss to Mr Boss are plain and acknowledged by the Court. The Court’s task, however, is not to put a price on Mr Suey’s life, and no fine I impose could possibly do that.
	
	
	Pegela has no prior convictions.
	
	
	The maximum penalty applicable in this case is $1.5 million. That can be applied only in the most extreme kind of case. It is an indication, however, of the seriousness with which Parliament views these matters.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, without discount for the plea of guilty, I consider the appropriate penalty to be $120,000. The plea of guilty in this case, in my view, warrants a discount on penalty to the extent of 25%.
	


Orders


	
	The defendant is convicted and fined the sum of $90,000 with a moiety to the prosecutor. The defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s costs in the sum of $29,700.

		19 July 2016",2016-07-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769858,Safe Work (NSW) v Matthew Albans t/as Matt & Bella’s Meats [2016] NSWDC 125,"Judgment


	
	Matthew Albans (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 21(2) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), he failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Trent Morton to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $300,000.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts that can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender was a sole trader trading as Matt & Bella’s Meats. The offender conducted a business as a butcher in a retail outlet in Bradbury (the Premises) and was present daily at the Premises. At the date of the incident the offender had been a qualified butcher for around 8 or 9 years.
	
	
	Trent Morton commenced employment with Matt & Bella’s Meats as a second year butchery apprentice on 12 September 2013. He had not worked in the butchery industry prior to commencing this employment. Mr Morton was 17 years old at the time of the incident. He had used a mincer prior to the incident, but had not received training on how to use this particular type of mincer.
	
	
	On Friday 19 September 2014 at approximately 2.30pm, Mr Morton was working at the Premises with another apprentice Bradley Holland on the mincing machine. Mr Morton noticed that a piece of meat was caught on a bar inside the mincing machine and opened the lid of the machine to push the meat down. As he did this, the other bar moved and trapped his right arm in the mincing machine. Mr Morton was unable to reach the emergency stop button. After Mr Morton yelled “stop” a few times Mr Holland was able to hit the emergency stop button.
	
	
	Mr Morton sustained injuries including a broken right arm and right wrist, and torn muscles and tendons with severed nerves to the thumb and little finger of the right hand. He required three surgeries, as well as physiotherapy.
	
	
	The mincing machine did not have an interlock to prevent the blades from moving when the lid was open. The only way to stop the mincing machine was to depress an emergency stop button located on the right side of the machine or to turn the power off at the wall.
	
	
	At the time of the incident Matt and Bella’s Meats did not have any documented risk assessment or safe work procedure related to the mincing machine. There were no documented site inductions containing work health and safety information.
	
	
	On 24 September 2014, the mincing machine at the premises was replaced with a Thomson Mincer/Grinder loaned from the shop next door. The Thomson Mincer had a magnetic electrical interlock that prevented the machine from operating while the lid was open.
	


Standards and Regulations


	
	At the time of the incident there were relevant standards [1]  that stipulated that risk assessments of machinery should be carried out and identified interlock systems as a control measure to protect against risks to workers where access to a hazardous zone cannot be totally prohibited. Further it is stipulated that there shall be an emergency stop device available, operational and readily accessible to machine operators.
	
	
	Managing the Risks of Plant in the Workplace Code of Conduct (July, 2014) stipulated that risk assessments should be carried out to identify hazards and identified interlocks as a control measure.
	
	
	The Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (the Regulation) required, pursuant to cl 208(2), that a person with management or control of plant must ensure that when access to an area of plant requiring guarding is necessary during operation that there be an interlocked physical barrier.
	
	
	Cl 211 of the Regulation required that if a machine includes an emergency stop then the person with management or control of the plant must ensure that the stop control is prominent, clearly marked and immediately accessible to the operator.
	


The Offender’s Evidence


	
	The Offender read an affidavit of Matthew Albans affirmed 20 June 2016 (the first affidavit), and an affidavit of Matthew Albans affirmed 5 July 2016 (the second affidavit). The offender was present in court but was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	In his first affidavit the offender gave evidence that he had worked in the butchery industry for 15 years. He established Matt & Bella’s Meats in around 2012. In around 2014 he leased Foodworks Butchery which had contracts to supply meat to ten IGA stores.
	
	
	The offender acknowledged responsibility and expressed remorse for the offence and injuries to Mr Morton.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that from around September 2014 he began to experience severe financial stress. In around November 2014 he leased a property in Canyonleigh in an attempt to salvage his business and expand it to include breeding his own cattle.
	
	
	Matt & Bella’s Meats became unable to maintain all existing meat contracts. The offender accumulated business and personal debts and closed Matt & Bella’s Meats in February 2015. On 6 March 2015, the offender declared himself bankrupt.
	
	
	The offender lives with his de factor partner Belinda and their 18 month old daughter at a farmstead in Taralga. He is the sole financial provider for the family and is currently working 5 days per week in Goulburn as a casual labourer. He has a net income of approximately $600 per week. He has no intention of working in the butchery industry in the future.
	
	
	The offender deposed that he has a debt of approximately $13,085 with Origin Energy. He gave evidence that Belinda owns two cars; one worth $1000 that he uses and another that he does not use which is under a finance debt liability of approximately $35,000.
	
	
	In the second affidavit, the offender gave evidence of his current assets and liabilities.
	
	
	The offender currently has a taxation liability of approximately $12,070.
	
	
	At 1 July 2016, the offender had an IMB Bank Account with a balance of $1.73 and a St George Bank Account with a balance of -$629.77.
	
	
	The offender deposed that in the 2013 financial year Matt & Bella’s Meats made a loss of $5,249. In the 2014 financial year Matt & Bella’s Meats made a profit of $60,631.
	
	
	The offender also tendered a report of Dr Chris Probets, Forensic Psychologist, dated 10 June 2016.
	
	
	The offender reported to Dr Probets that he was sexually abused for a few years from the age of 9 or 10. Dr Probets administered psychometric tests and diagnosed the offender as suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”). Dr Probets opined that it is highly likely that the PTSD commenced during the youth of the offender and been attributable to his sexual abuse.
	
	
	His present mental condition is characterised by severe levels of depression, extremely severe levels of anxiety and severe levels of stress. Dr Probets describes the offender as being further traumatised by the incident and anxious and fearful of his prospects for the future.
	
	
	Dr Probets opined that there was a causal connection between his PTSD and his failure to properly address the safety requirements of the legislation. Dr Probets opined that the offender’s symptoms of PTSD could be significantly reduced with treatment, but will probably not be cured.
	


Consideration


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Act set out in section 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of foreseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The risk posed to workers when using machines with movable parts is an obvious one. The risk in this case could have been eliminated by modifying the mincer to isolate the power when the lid of the machine was lifted. The offender obtained such a machine on loan within a few days of the incident.
	
	
	The risk could have been minimised by the provision of basic training on the operation of the mincer, or by instructing the employees to turn the power off at the wall socket prior to trying to clear blockages.
	
	
	The risk should have been identified. The offender took over the operation at the Premises a few weeks before the incident and clearly failed to conduct any risk assessment of the machinery on site. A cursory examination of the mincing machine would have demonstrated the danger posed by it.
	
	
	The workers were vulnerable. The offender had employed two apprentice butchers who had not been trained by the offender on how to use the mincer safely.
	
	
	Mr Morton sustained injuries to his right arm, wrist and two fingers which required surgeries and physiotherapy. The risk was one of serious injury. The mincing machine was designed in such a way that the risk amputation of fingers or a hand was only a remote possibility.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	General deterrence may be attributed less weight in cases where the offender suffers from mental condition because such an offender is not an appropriate person to be made an example of: Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-[54]. The authorities do not mandate an entire disregard of general or specific deterrence by the sentencing judge: The extent of the reduction depends on the circumstances of the case: Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [27], R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 and R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91.
	
	
	This is an appropriate case for some slight reduction in the weight to be afforded to general deterrence. There was a causal connection between the offender’s PTSD and his failure to address the legislation. On the other hand, the offender knew or ought to have known the gravity of his actions (or in this case omissions) and the legislation is designed to protect a class of the community from harm.
	
	
	This is an exceptional case where the need for specific deterrence is eliminated. The offender is no longer operating a business in the butchery industry and has expressed that he has no intention to return to the industry in any capacity. The fact that he is bankrupt will affect his ability to operate another business in the future. This incident has had a significant effect upon the offender including an exacerbation of the symptoms of PTSD.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	There are no relevant aggravating factors.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The offender does not have any record of previous convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is 32 years of age.
	
	
	The offender is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender took immediate steps to acquire a different mincing machine that had an interlock system following the incident. The offender has since ceased to operate any business in the butcher industry and is currently working as a labourer. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	The offender has expressed remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender has accepted responsibility for the failures that resulted in the injuries to Mr Morton. The offender has expressed in his first affidavit and to Dr Probets his deep remorse for this offence. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has demonstrated genuine contrition and remorse.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of that discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. This matter was set down for a defended hearing and a plea of guilty was entered around two and a half weeks prior to the commencement of that hearing. The offender pleaded not guilty on the advice of counsel, who is no longer retained. The appropriate discount is 15%.
	


Capacity to Pay a Fine


	
	Section 6 Fines Act 1996 provides:
	


In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider:

(a)   such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably and practicably available to the court for consideration, and

(b)   such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the fixing of that amount


	
	The Court is required to have regard to this provision before imposing a fine. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine. The offender’s capacity to pay is relevant but not decisive: Jahandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178 at [16]. A substantial fine may still be warranted as a result of the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	The offender is currently bankrupt and has no assets. He has a current liability to the Australian Taxation Office of approximately $12,070 that will not be expunged by his bankruptcy.
	
	
	Similarly any fine or costs imposed in theses sentence proceedings are not provable debts in bankruptcy. That means that when he is discharged from bankruptcy that he will still have debts to pay, including the taxation debt. The offender’s family have paid his legal costs of these proceedings.
	
	
	The offender’s ability to earn an income has been adversely affected by the exacerbation of his PTSD symptoms caused by the incident and the failure of the business. He is presently employed as a labourer and his finances are the subject of administration by his trustee in bankruptcy.
	
	
	The offender is the sole financial provider for his young family and the imposition of a substantial fine will have a significant impact on the offender’s family.
	
	
	The offender has agreed to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed. I would anticipate those costs to be more than $20,000, based on previous experience. I have taken that amount into account in deciding the amount of the fine to be imposed: Environmental Protection Agency v Barnes [2006] NSWCA at [78].
	


Penalty


	
	Taking into account all of those matters the offence is one of some objective gravity. The appropriate starting point in the absence of the subjective features, the offender’s capacity to pay and the discount for the plea of guilty would have been a fine of $50,000. However, considering the particular suffering that the incident has caused by way of the exacerbation of the offender’s PTSD, the effect that it has had and will have on his future economic capacity and his status as an undischarged bankrupt, the fine imposed must be significantly less.
	
	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $4,000 that will be discounted by 15% to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $3,400.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.

2769860,Mao v DPP (NSW) [2016] NSWSC 946,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: This is an appeal from an interlocutory decision of the Local Court to refuse to grant leave to withdraw a plea of guilty pursuant to s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).
	
	
	By summons filed 16 December 2015, the plaintiff seeks, firstly, an order that leave be granted to appeal from the whole of the decision below; secondly, an order in the nature of certiorari setting aside the decision of Magistrate Barko dated 23 November 2015 in refusing the application made by the plaintiff; thirdly, an order that the Local Court be directed to deal with the plaintiff’s application according to law; and fourthly, an order that leave be granted to the parties to approach the Court to complete any orders that are necessary to have the matter determined.
	
	
	The plaintiff is Wenju Mao, who was the defendant in the Local Court proceedings. The defendant is the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (“DPP”). The matter was prosecuted by the NSW Police in the Local Court. On 30 March 2016, the DPP took over as defendant in the appeal pursuant to s 9 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW). The plaintiff relied upon the affidavit of his solicitor, Ren Zhou dated 2 May 2016. On 7 June 2016, a joint tender bundle was filed.
	
	
	On 23 November 2015, his Honour Magistrate Barko (“the Magistrate”) dismissed the plaintiff’s application for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty.
	


Ground of appeal


	
	The plaintiff appeals the whole of the decision of the Magistrate on the ground that the Magistrate made an error of law in that he did not grant leave to withdraw pleas of guilty in respect of charge sequence numbers 2 to 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 and 19 (“the 13 charges”) when there was no evidence available to convict the plaintiff.
	


Relevantly, s 53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act reads:

“53 Appeals requiring leave

…

(3) Any person against whom:

(a) an order has been made by a Magistrate in relation to the person in any committal proceedings, or

(b) an interlocutory order has been made by the Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings,

may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court.

…”


	
	Under s 55(3) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, an appeal under s 53(3)(b) may be determined by setting aside the order and making such order as this Court sees fit, or by dismissing the appeal.
	
	
	Insofar as appeals under s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act against refusals to grant leave to change a plea are concerned, in Grant v Local Court of New South Wales [2015] NSWSC 356 (“Grant”), Johnson J stated (at [37]):
	


“It is for the Plaintiff to demonstrate error of law before either of the forms of relief sought may be granted in this case. This Court is not undertaking a rehearing of the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty.”

Background


	
	These facts are not in dispute. On 18 March 2015, the plaintiff was arrested by Police at his residential premises and was transported to Redfern Police Station where he was taken into custody. He declined to be interviewed and was ultimately released on conditional bail.
	
	
	The Police alleged that the plaintiff was connected to a criminal syndicate that conducted identity fraud.
	
	
	On or about 19 March 2015, the proceedings were commenced by the Police filing and serving a total of 19 Court Attendance Notices naming the plaintiff as the offender. The charges set out in sequences numbered 1 and 8 allege contraventions of s 192K of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), sequences numbered 14, 18 and 19 allege contraventions of s 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act and the remaining 14 sequences allege contraventions of s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. I will set out the details of the charges later in this judgment.
	
	
	On 20 April 2015, these proceedings came before the Downing Centre Local Court. The plaintiff appeared in person and was represented by Mr Phillip Green, solicitor. Pleas of “not guilty” were entered to all of the 19 charges and the proceedings were adjourned to enable the Police to serve upon the plaintiff a copy of their brief of evidence.
	
	
	On 1 June 2015, the proceedings were next before the Local Court. On that occasion, Mr John Nathan, solicitor, appeared as agent for Mr Green on behalf of the plaintiff. By this time only a partial brief of evidence had been served upon the plaintiff. The Magistrate fixed the matter for hearing on 27 July 2015. The Magistrate ordered that the balance of the brief of evidence be served not less than 14 days prior to the hearing. The Court also ordered a Mandarin interpreter to assist the plaintiff at the hearing.
	
	
	At some point after 1 June 2015, Mr Nathan was retained by the plaintiff as his legal representative.
	
	
	On 27 July 2015, the proceedings came on for hearing before Magistrate Barko. Mr Nathan appeared for the plaintiff who was assisted on the day by a Mandarin interpreter. Sgt Stromquist appeared as Police prosecutor. When the matter was first mentioned Mr Nathan indicated that he wished to make an application that all of the charges be dismissed pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). The Magistrate refused the application.
	
	
	After the Magistrate refused the plaintiff’s s 32 application, Mr Nathan entered pleas of “guilty” to all 19 charges and made some preliminary submissions on penalty. The Magistrate recorded the pleas of guilty to all charges and adjourned the proceedings part heard for sentence on 17 September 2015.
	
	
	On 17 September 2015, Sgt Alzaim appeared as Police prosecutor. The Court had received from Community Corrections a pre-sentence report of Ms Vivien Weir, Senior Community Corrections Officer, dated 16 September 2015. The Court also received a letter dated 17 September 2015 from the plaintiff stating that he was unfit to attend Court on the day, enclosing a medical certificate to that effect. He also stated that he had “disengaged” Mr Nathan. As a matter of courtesy Mr Nathan appeared and sought an adjournment of the plaintiff’s sentencing and he was granted leave to withdraw. The Magistrate adjourned the proceedings for sentence, part heard, to 29 September 2015.
	
	
	On 29 September 2015, Sgt Coombs appeared as Police prosecutor. Mr Parsons of counsel appeared for the plaintiff. When the matter was mentioned Mr Parsons indicated that the plaintiff sought the Court’s leave to change the plaintiff’s pleas of guilty to not guilty in respect of the 13 charges (“the application”). The plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 24 September 2015. The application was adjourned to 23 November 2015 and the Magistrate ordered that any further evidence or written submissions were to be filed and served by 20 November 2015. He also ordered that the plaintiff and any of his witnesses in support of the application be available for cross examination.
	
	
	On 23 November 2015, Sgt Gorman appeared as Police prosecutor and Mr Parsons again appeared for the plaintiff. The plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 24 September 2015. The Police prosecutor relied on the statement of police facts. The Magistrate heard oral evidence from the plaintiff, the former Mandarin interpreter, Mr Au, and the plaintiff’s former solicitor, Mr Nathan. Mr Parsons also provided the Magistrate with written submissions.
	


The charges


	
	It is convenient that I now set out the charges against the plaintiff. According to the Police facts sheet, the plaintiff was allegedly involved in a criminal syndicate that obtained the details of members of the community and fraudulently altered their details to procure credit cards from financial institutions. The facts sheet alleges that the plaintiff applied for, activated and used two credit cards using false identity documents. The plaintiff was linked to the online applications via his name and internet ‘Cookies’ address.
	
	
	Offence 1 alleges that on 24 September 2014, the plaintiff applied for a credit card (“CC1”). On 17 October 2014, the plaintiff attended a Westpac Bank branch to collect and activate CC1 using fraudulently altered identification documents. Offence 8 alleges that on 13 October 2014, the plaintiff applied for a credit card (“CC2”). On 24 October 2014, he attended a different Westpac Bank branch to collect and activate CC2 using identity documents that did not belong to him. Both of these occasions were captured on CCTV. Offences 2 to 7 allege that between 17 October 2014 and 22 October 2014 the plaintiff made a number of transactions using CC1 at various ATMs, withdrawing in total a sum of $11,050. Offences 9 to 19 allege that between 24 October 2014 and 31 October 2014, the plaintiff used CC2 to withdraw cash from various ATMs and to purchase luxury goods from retail stores. The total value of cash and goods acquired using CC2 was the sum of $12,769. The Magistrate noted (at J [15]) that the only photographic evidence implicating the defendant related to the charges to which he maintained pleas of guilty, ie, Charges 1, 8, 10, 11, 15 and 17. There is no photographic evidence identifying the plaintiff as the person using the cards in respect of the 13 charges that are the subject of this appeal.
	


The law


	
	The relevant law in relation to entering and withdrawing guilty pleas is contained in ss 193 and 207 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Section 193 provides:
	


“193 Procedure if offence admitted

(1) If the accused person pleads guilty, and does not show sufficient cause why he or she should not be convicted or not have an order made against him or her, the court must convict the accused person or make the order accordingly.

(2) This section does not apply if the court does not accept the accused person’s guilty plea.”


	
	Section 207 provides:
	


“207 Power to set aside conviction or order before sentence

(1) An accused person may, at any time after conviction or an order has been made against the accused person and before the summary proceedings are finally disposed of, apply to the court to change the accused person’s plea from guilty to not guilty and to have the conviction or order set aside.

(2) The court may set aside the conviction or order made against the accused person and proceed to determine the matter on the basis of the plea of not guilty.”

The Magistrate’s decision


	
	After setting out the procedural history and the details of the application, the Magistrate set out the relevant legislation. There is no dispute that the plaintiff was entitled to bring the application as the Magistrate had accepted the plaintiff’s pleas of guilty for the 19 charges before him on 27 July 2015.
	
	
	At paragraphs [22] to [28] of the Magistrate’s reasons, his Honour set out the relevant case law in relation to changing pleas from guilty to not guilty. I will set out the relevant case law later in this judgment, but for present purposes it is important to note that the Magistrate referred to the following passage from R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 (“Boag”) per Hunt CJ at CL (with McInerney and James JJ agreeing) (at 36):
	


“In stating the test to be applied in determining whether the applicant should be permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty, the judge correctly said that such a course should be allowed where it has been shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. The judge also correctly said that the applicant bore the onus of showing the existence of that miscarriage.”


	
	The parties in this appeal agree that Boag is authority for the proposition that the plaintiff’s task in his application to the Magistrate to change his pleas from guilty to not guilty was to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice had occurred.
	


Evidence given in the Local Court


	
	The plaintiff, his interpreter, Mr Au, and his solicitor, Mr Nathan, each gave evidence and were cross examined at the hearing.
	
	
	The Magistrate set out the evidence upon which the plaintiff relied in support of his application. It is as follows. The plaintiff admits he committed the offences in Charges 1 and 8. With respect to Charges 2 to 7, the plaintiff says he has “no recollection” of obtaining any funds from an ATM in the manner alleged in the statement of facts (Aff, [7]) and that after he obtained CC1, he “handed it to another male outside the bank. That male person was one of the persons in charge of the criminal operation.” (Aff, [8].) He states that he has “no recollection” of obtaining the cash from the ATMs and carrying out the transactions at the retail stores as alleged in charges, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 and 19. The plaintiff stated he was only shown five photographs by the police concerning five of the alleged 19 offences when he was arrested and that he had difficulty reading the facts sheet (J [31]; Aff, [16]-[17]).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence is that on 20 April 2015, at his first court appearance, he instructed Mr Green, solicitor, to mention the matters. No brief of evidence had been served and he did not discuss the issue of how he would plead with Mr Green. On 1 June 2015, the plaintiff met Mr Nathan, whom he subsequently retained as his legal representative. The plaintiff said that he recalled that he had a telephone conversation that morning with Mr Nathan, in which Mr Nathan referred to the fact that the plaintiff had admitted to doing “some of the things” and referred the plaintiff to Dr Diment, psychologist, for an application under the mental health law. On 27 July 2015, the plaintiff recalled being in court when this application was refused and that he told Mr Nathan he wished to plead guilty “but not to all, it’s not all”. He says that he intended to instruct Mr Nathan that he had not committed all of the offences and was only guilty of some. He says he did not have the assistance of the interpreter at this time (J [32]-[34]; Aff, [18]-[31]).
	
	
	The defendant subsequently instructed Mr Parsons of counsel and, through a different interpreter, prepared and swore his affidavit (J [35]; Aff, [34]-[36]).
	


The plaintiff


	
	In his oral evidence, the plaintiff maintained that he instructed his solicitor that he was not guilty of all of the offences. When asked by the Magistrate about the use of the phrase “no recollection” in his affidavit, the Magistrate observed that the plaintiff “appeared somewhat confused with my questioning but ultimately stated that he did not attend the three stores the subject of the charges set out in sequences numbered 14, 18 and 19.” (J [36].) The Magistrate made a finding that the plaintiff was not credible when using the phrase “no recollection”. The Magistrate also said that the plaintiff’s credibility was affected by his failure to say anything about giving the second credit card to someone who could have committed the offences in relation to that card as well as his failure to explain how he came to commit the offences he has maintained pleas of guilty to and how the other offences may have been committed by someone else (J [40]).
	


Mr Au


	
	Mr Au, the interpreter, assisted the plaintiff during his initial conversations with Mr Green and Mr Nathan, solicitors. In his oral evidence he recalled that the plaintiff said he was involved in some of the charges but not all, although he did not overhear any discussion between the plaintiff and the solicitors concerning pleas of guilty or not guilty. The Magistrate considered the interpreter’s evidence in this respect to be “somewhat vague” (J [42]).
	


The plaintiff’s former solicitor


	
	So far as Mr Nathan’s oral evidence is concerned, the Magistrate observed the following:
	


“He was adamant that his instructions had always been to enter pleas of guilty to all charges and that the instructions were given both by the Defendant himself and through the Interpreter. He denied that the Defendant has said that he would only plead guilty to some of the charges and stated that he would never have entered pleas [of] guilty to such offences unless he had the defendant’s instruction.”

(J [39].)


	
	With respect to Mr Nathan’s credibility, the Magistrate recorded:
	


“There was no uncertainty or hesitation in the evidence given by or the presentation of Mr Nathan. He was adamant that he had received instructions from the Defendant to enter pleas of guilty to all charges. He is an experienced criminal practitioner who became somewhat indignant when it was suggested to him that he had entered pleas of guilty to charges without instruction. Mr Nathan presented in the most credible and reliable fashion compared to the other witnesses.”

(J [43].)


	
	The Magistrate made a finding that the plaintiff had in fact instructed Mr Nathan to enter pleas of guilty to all of the 19 charges (J [44]). His Honour then set out the matters in favour of and the matters unfavourable to granting leave to the plaintiff to change his pleas from guilty to not guilty (J [45] & [46]). Relevantly, the Magistrate considered the following matters which “tend not to favour such leave being granted”:
	


“(j) When interviewed by Ms Vivien Weir, Senior Community Corrections Officer, prior to 16 September 2015 the Defendant is recorded as stating to Ms Weir that he “did not dispute the Police facts” and that he “was very sorry for what he had done”;

(k) When interviewed by Mr Diment for the purpose of his section 32 application the Defendant did not deny that he committed all of the offences and simply stated that “he felt very sorry about what he had done” and that “when I look back on it all now of course I regret about doing harm to society. Am going to pay this back too. In the end I only got about $1k and I have informed the Solicitor about this.”

…”

(J [46].)


	
	The Magistrate concluded as follows:
	


“DETERMINATION:

47. I am satisfied that when the Defendant provided Mr Nathan with instructions to enter pleas of guilty to all charges he did so by reason of his consciousness of guilt understanding the nature of the charges brought against him and the quantity of the money and goods obtained. There is no suggestion by the Defendant that he was unduly influenced to enter the pleas of guilty. I infer that it was when the Defendant became aware of the “weaknesses” in the Police case as to identification evidence that he instructed Mr Parsons to seek to have his pleas of guilty reversed. I am satisfied that the Defendant's pleas of guilty were a true admission of guilt.

48. The Defendant has failed to satisfy me that there would be a miscarriage of justice should he not be permitted to change his pleas of guilty to the nominated charges.”


	
	The main issue raised in this appeal is whether the Magistrate misunderstood the law in relation to the withdrawal of a guilty plea. It is convenient that I now refer to the relevant law.
	


Relevant case law


	
	The Magistrate referred to extracts from the following cases: Boag at 36; R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122 (“Liberti”); Meissner v R [1995] HCA 41; 184 CLR 132 at 157 (“Meissner”); R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61; 121 A Crim R 472 at [32] (“Hura”) and Ming Yuk (Raymond) Wong v The Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 129; 155 A Crim R 37 at [15], [16], [19] and [40] (“Wong”).
	
	
	In the parties’ submissions they referred to a number of cases, some concerning applications to withdraw a plea after it is entered but before conviction and some on appeal after both conviction and sentence. In the present case, the plaintiff’s pleas of guilty had been entered but he had not yet been sentenced. In R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377, Hodgson JA noted (at [49]) that “while more caution might be required where leave to withdraw a plea is sought after conviction and sentence, the principles that apply where the application is made before conviction and sentence are to similar effect”.
	
	
	In R v Van [2002] NSWCCA 148; 129 A Crim R 229, James J (Hodgson JA and Kirby J agreeing) set out the relevant principles in relation to an appeal where an accused seeks to withdraw a plea. At [48] to [50] James J stated:
	


“[48] What is necessary to be shown before an appeal might be successful from a conviction entered up as a consequence of a plea of guilty, has been variously expressed: see Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35; Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132; 80 A Crim R 308; Maxwell (1995) 184 CLR 501; 87 A Crim R 180; Ross (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 20 February 1994); Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 and the cases referred to by Spigelman CJ in Hura (2001) 121 A Crim R 472 at 477-478 [32]-[33]. The principles have been conveniently summarised in the applicant's submissions taken from Hura as follows:

“• Where the appellant ‘did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered’: Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 233.

• Where the plea was not ‘a free and voluntary confession’: Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218 at 220D-E.

• The ‘plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt’: Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191.

• Where there was ‘mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt’: Sagiv (at 80).

• Where the ‘plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the appellant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty … some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt’: Concotta (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 1 November 1995).

• The ‘plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt’: Maxwell (at 511).

• If ‘the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt’: Davies (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60418 of 1992, 16 December 1993); see also Ganderton (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60364 of 1998, 17 September 1998) and Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320.”

[49] To the cases cited should be added reference to Iral [1999] NSWCCA 368 in which the failure of the appellant to appreciate the nature of the charge and difficulties with an interpreter lead to the appeal being upheld; Wilkes (2001) 122 A Crim R 310 where the advice of trial counsel to enter the plea was held to be imprudent and inappropriate thus occasioning a miscarriage of justice; McLean (2001) 121 A Crim R 484 in which senior counsel's inappropriate advice on the applicant's ability to challenge a relevant matter of fact occasioned a miscarriage of injustice; KCH (2001) 124 A Crim R 233 involving improper pressure by counsel and Bercheru [2001] NSWCCA 102 and Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533.

[50] In Liberti (at 122), Kirby P referred to the Court's approach to a proposed change of plea or to an asserted want of understanding of what was involved in a plea of guilty as with “caution bordering on circumspection”, since such a plea in law is an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence and is the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: see Lee J in Sagiv. In Meissner, Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ said (at 141; 313):

“A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in the exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if the Court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not indeed guilty of the offence.””


	
	In Wong, after setting out [32] to [33] from Hura, Howie J stated:
	


“[16] The authorities referred to in the above passage show that the issue is one of the integrity of the plea of guilty and the question to be determined is whether a miscarriage of justice would arise if the court acted upon the plea of guilty to convict and sentence the defendant. I simply do not comprehend how a court can resolve that issue or determine that question without evidence from the person who entered the plea of guilty. It may well be the case that evidence from the legal representatives who acted for the defendant at the time the plea was entered might need to be placed before the court.”


	
	The defendant also referred to Grant in which Johnson J at [36] similarly set out a summary of “well settled” principles governing an application to withdraw a plea of guilty.
	
	
	In Wong, Howie J, on the question of whether an accused must in truth be guilty of the offence to which he or she has pleaded, stated:
	


“[33] A court is entitled to accept a plea of guilty that is given in the exercise of a free choice in a defendant’s own interests and there will be no miscarriage resulting from reliance on the plea even though the person entering the plea “is not in truth guilty of the offence”: Meissner at 141. Justice Dawson stated the following at 157 (footnotes omitted):

“It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. But the accused may show that a miscarriage of justice occurred in other ways and so be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and have his conviction set aside. For example, he may show that his plea was induced by intimidation of one kind or another, or by an improper inducement or by fraud.””


	
	In R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73, Lee J (McInerney and Campbell JJ agreeing), after citing a number of cases involving withdrawals of a plea of guilty, made the following observations at 80-81:
	


“The substantial general proposition which emerges from these cases is that it is a matter for the discretion of the judge presiding as to whether a plea of guilty should be permitted to be withdrawn and that each case must be looked at in regard to its own facts and a decision made whether justice requires that that course be taken.

It is clear that in the case of mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt the court should readily grant leave. But if the plea has been entered in full knowledge of all the facts and intentionally as a plea to the charge which is made, the court is plainly entitled to exercise its discretion against a withdrawal of the plea. The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence… and as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made, for the court is prepared to act upon it and proceed to conviction or final disposition of the proceedings.”


	
	In Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 (“Rotner”) Simpson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing) said at [49]:
	


“There are, in fact, two components to the test so stated – first, some circumstance that permits a conclusion that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt, and, second, an “issuable” question about the guilt of the applicant. Neither, alone, is sufficient. As I understand the test, it is necessary for the applicant to point to circumstances that create a doubt about his guilt, as well as circumstances that raise a doubt about his own perception.


	
	In R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299, Smart AJ (Heydon JA and Simpson J agreeing) at [39] stated:
	


“An accused seeking leave to withdraw a plea of guilty prior to conviction must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking that course. The cases reveal many specific examples of when an accused is permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty prior to conviction and I have mentioned some of them. The categories are not closed. The general statement that an accused must show that a miscarriage of justice will occur if he is not given leave to withdraw his plea of guilty or that an accused must show that it is in the interests of justice that leave be granted provide a useful principle against which to evaluate new categories or new factual situations.”


	
	In Ishac v R [2011] NSWCCA 117, McColl JA (RS Hulme and Hislop JJ agreeing) stated at [30]:
	


“Any miscarriage of justice is to be found in the circumstances in which the applicant came to enter his plea. The question in a case where the applicant seeks to challenge a conviction following a plea of guilty is not guilt or innocence as such, but the integrity of the plea.”


	
	The defendant submitted that the formulation of what must be shown in order for leave to be granted was stated in R v Kouroumalos [2000] NSWCCA 453 where Wood CJ at CL (Studdert and Whealy JJ agreeing) at [19] said:
	


“What is required for an exercise of the relevant discretion is the identification of some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or that otherwise the integrity of the plea is bona fide in question.”


	
	This approach was endorsed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rotner by Simpson J at [47].
	
	
	In R v Khan [2002] NSWCCA 521, Giles JA (Sully and Dowd JJ agreeing) at [28] stated:
	


“Putting aside cases where on the admitted facts the accused could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged, R v Davies also shows that the fact the accused can point to some doubt about his guilt, absent the plea of guilty, does not mean that leave to withdraw the plea will be granted.”


	
	For completeness, the Magistrate also referred to the following passage from Wong at [40]:
	


“Nor would the fact that the plaintiff’s present legal representatives have instructions inconsistent with the plea of guilty be a reason to permit the withdrawal of the plea. If by his submission to the first Magistrate that he was not able to “put to the Court a plea of guilty” the plaintiff’s solicitor meant that he could not represent the plaintiff on a plea of guilty because of his instructions that the plaintiff was not guilty, the submission was with respect without foundation. It should be clear from what I have written above, that there is no difficulty, either ethically or otherwise, with a solicitor appearing for a defendant on a plea of guilty notwithstanding that the person has given instructions denying guilt. If it were otherwise, the defendant could avoid the consequences of a plea of guilty simply by changing legal representatives. Meissner makes it quite clear that there is nothing necessarily inconsistent in the fact that a person pleads guilty and yet asserts that he is innocent of the crime charged.”


	
	Finally, in Sagiv, Lee J observed at 82:
	


“Where a person, having pleaded guilty, goes into the witness-box and seeks to put forward a version which ameliorates the effect of the charge from the point of view of criminality, it is always for the judge to evaluate that testimony and he may either reject it or accept it. There is no compulsion upon him to accept an assertion as to fact and allow a plea to be withdrawn merely because it can be said that that fact, if established, would result in an acquittal.”

Submissions

Plaintiff’s submissions


	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the circumstances warranting the exercise of the discretion in favour of permitting a change of plea (constituting a miscarriage of justice) include an absence of evidence sufficient to convict the plaintiff and the Magistrate did not consider whether there was an absence of evidence sufficient to convict the plaintiff. The plaintiff referred to the following passage in Boag where Hunt CJ at CL (with McInerney and James JJ agreeing) stated at 37:
	


“A miscarriage of justice may occur in many different situations if a prisoner is not permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty. Such a miscarriage will be established not only where the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the plea which he had entered but also, for example, if there was no evidence upon which he could have been convicted, or if he had not intended to admit that he was guilty or if his plea had been induced by fraud or threats or other impropriety, when he would not otherwise have pleaded guilty…

As Badgery-Parker J said in Davies [(unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 16 December 1993)] (at p 8), there must be shown to be some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt… The requirement that a miscarriage of justice be demonstrated before leave is granted to withdraw a plea is well settled in the authorities to which I have referred.” (My emphasis added.)


	
	The plaintiff submitted that the Magistrate failed to appreciate the relevance of this passage for the purpose of determining the question of whether to grant leave to the plaintiff to change his pleas and in so doing fell into error. According to counsel for the plaintiff, this was a case where there was “no evidence upon which [the plaintiff] could have been convicted” and that this was established by the evidence and the Magistrate’s observations at the hearing. The plaintiff pointed to the lack of photographic evidence of the 13 charges, which was confirmed at the hearing (T22.38-45, 23/11/2015), the plaintiff’s affidavit evidence in which he stated that he had “no recollection” of carrying out the relevant transactions and the fact that, although the Magistrate referred to Boag, his Honour did not refer to the passage “such a miscarriage will be established… if there was no evidence upon which he could have been convicted”. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that by not taking this passage into account, his Honour erred in his understanding and application of the relevant law.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff referred to the following excerpts from the transcript in the Local Court:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Sergeant, do you know anything further about the brief?

PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour, no. The only way to find a resolution in respect to that is to call the informant. I have only just come into the brief this morning – into the matter this morning.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, well, they are serious matters, some of which carry on indictment ten year gaol terms, others seven year gaol terms. So it’s certainly something that has to be very closely considered. Do you have any prospects of getting the information here today or no prospects at all?

PROSECUTOR: I could try, your Honour. I give an undertaking to try and get him here today. I don’t even know if he’s on.

...

HIS HONOUR: … So look, what I’ll do, Mr Parson – I’m going to stand this for the moment to allow Sergeant Gorman – who at the moment of course is on the higher ground, I would have thought – to see what enquiries he can make about the other film. And it may well be your client – if he has an opportunity and there is other film, he has an opportunity of seeing it. It may refresh his memory.

…

PARSONS: I just notice there is a schedule of items that were served.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

PARSONS: Now I note that it doesn’t include any identification evidence from any of the three stores. So his sworn evidence seems to be that he’s categoric that he didn’t commit any of the offences as they apply to the three stores. So there is no identification evidence, whether it be eye witness or even evidence in terms of the transaction taking place from any of the employees of those stores.

HIS HONOUR: Are there statements from them?

PARSONS: No.

HIS HONOUR: At all?

PARSONS: No, there’s none.

HIS HONOUR: That’s what I’m saying. The police couldn’t prove a thing without it.

PARSONS: There’s a DVD and a search conducted at his house. And that appears to be it. The only other things that were forming part of the brief of evidence were the police officer’s statements. I’ll just let my friend confirm what I’m saying.

HIS HONOUR: You see, the informant may well – and this is of course a matter for police if they want to prove it strictly. But the informant may well say, “I got a telephone call from Mr Nathan. He said, ‘Call off the troops, don’t provide any further evidence because I have certain instructions.’” And it may well be that he still had those matters outstanding. I don’t know. Anyway, make those enquiries and see how we go. If it can be taken no further today, then I will hand down a decision at 3.45. If it can be taken down further, we may have to adjourn it. All right. I’ll just stand the matter down in the list til 3.45 and if we can discern these issues earlier, let me know.

MATTER STOOD IN LIST

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Any developments?

PROSECUTOR: There have been, your Honour. I contacted the informant during the lunch adjournment, and he indicated that that was the entirety of the brief, what has been served. And I asked, “Was there any video of the ATMs? And he said, “No.””

(T19.50; T20.1-12; T20.32-36; T21.47-50; T22.1-41, 23/11/15.)


	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this exchange demonstrates that the Magistrate recognised there was an absence of evidence upon which the plaintiff could be convicted.
	


Defendant’s submissions


	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that the Magistrate applied well established principles to the facts of the present case on the evidence before him and that the plaintiff has not made out any error of law. While the Magistrate did not specifically refer to the passage in Boag (at 37), counsel for the defendant says that that passage was referred to in the plaintiff’s written submissions handed to the Magistrate (Ex A in this Court). Counsel for the defendant also submitted that the plaintiff made oral submissions to the Magistrate to the effect that references to the plaintiff’s use of the relevant cards in the police facts sheet were based on inferences and that there was no evidence to support such inferences and that the Magistrate’s enquiries to the prosecutor to contact the informant demonstrated his understanding of the plaintiff’s submission.
	
	
	According to counsel for the defendant, the Magistrate’s reasons for decision show his understanding that the critical issue was the integrity of the plaintiff’s plea. The defendant accepted that the integrity of a plea may be challenged, as in R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481, where it is entered by a person with “no recollection” of committing the offences, who is not in possession of all the facts and who did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt. However, counsel for the defendant submitted that this case is distinguishable from Davies, insofar as the Magistrate made findings that the plaintiff was in possession of the entire brief at the time the pleas were entered and he understood the nature of the charges against him (J [46], [47]). The Magistrate found the plaintiff not to be credible when using the phrase “no recollection” and his Honour accepted Mr Nathan’s evidence that his instructions at all times had been to plead guilty to all charges. The defendant also submitted that the Magistrate had regard to the plaintiff’s interview for the purpose of a pre-sentence report in which he was recorded as stating that he did not dispute the police facts. As well, the psychologist who interviewed him for the purposes of his s 32 application recorded that the plaintiff said he felt sorry about what he had done, that he felt regret and that he would pay back the money he had gained (J [46(j)-(k)]).
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that the Magistrate found that the plaintiff’s pleas were a true admission of guilt and that the plaintiff had instructed his former solicitor to enter them by reason of his consciousness of guilt (J [47]). While the Magistrate did not make a specific finding that there was no evidence in relation to any of the offences charged in respect of which the plaintiff sought to withdraw his pleas of guilty to the 13 charges, he did not err in law in failing to make such a finding, in light of the other findings he made as to the integrity of the pleas. Counsel for the defendant drew this Court’s attention to the fact that the plaintiff did not put the police brief with which he had been served into evidence to enable the Magistrate to assess its contents.
	
	
	Finally, counsel for the defendant submitted that the Magistrate applied appropriate principles of law in refusing to grant leave to withdraw the plaintiff’s pleas by firstly, making factual findings on the evidence before him and being satisfied on those facts that the pleas were entered with a genuine consciousness of guilt; and secondly, the plaintiff had an understanding of the nature of the charges; and finally, he concluded that there would be no miscarriage were the plaintiff not permitted to withdraw his pleas.
	


Consideration


	
	The majority of cases referred to by the Magistrate and this Court in this judgment on the topic of whether a plea of guilty can be withdrawn emphasise the importance of an assessment of the integrity of the plaintiff’s plea by reference to the circumstances in which it was entered. His Honour had the benefit of submissions from the plaintiff that identified the passage in Boag (at 37) which states that a miscarriage of justice will occur when an accused has entered pleas of guilty in circumstances where there is no evidence upon which the accused could have been convicted. This is the only Court of Criminal Appeal decision drawn to this Court’s attention that states that a miscarriage of justice will occur on this basis. The Magistrate made no such finding in relation to the plaintiff because, as he observed, the plaintiff had made admissions consistent with guilt to both Dr Diment, psychiatrist, for the purposes of his s 32 application, and Ms Weir, Senior Community Corrections Officer, for the purposes of a pre-sentence report, both of which he took into account at [46(j) & (k)] of his reasons. In other words, his Honour was satisfied that there was evidence available in respect of the 13 charges upon which the plaintiff could have been convicted. In these circumstances it would have been contradictory and wrong if his Honour expressed the view that there was no evidence available to convict the plaintiff. In my view, the Magistrate did not make an error of law. The result is that the appeal is dismissed. The decision of Magistrate Barko dated 23 November 2015 is affirmed.
	


Costs


	
	Costs are discretionary. Costs usually follow the event. The plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs on an ordinary basis as agreed or assessed.
	


The Court orders that:

(1)   The appeal is dismissed.

(2)   The decision of Magistrate Barko dated 23 November 2015 is affirmed.

(3)   The summons dated 16 December 2015 is dismissed.

(4)   The plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs on an ordinary basis as agreed or assessed.

		08 July 2016",2016-07-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769865,R v Lamb; R v Mason; R v Hill [2016] NSWCCA 135,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: At the conclusion of the hearing of an application for leave to appeal against the decision of a District Court judge to discharge all of the members of a jury towards the end of a criminal trial, this Court made the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.


	
	This judgment constitutes our reasons for making those orders. Because we have thought it important that these reasons be given before the jury returns to the District Court on Monday 11 July 2016 (his Honour having adjourned proceedings for a number of days, as against the possibility of an appeal), our judgment will be concise.
	
	
	Although the Crown was the applicant before us, and the three accused were the respondents, for ease of comprehension we shall refer to them by their roles in the proceedings at first instance.
	


Background


	
	The background of the application may be shortly stated.
	
	
	On 20 June 2016, the three accused were arraigned before Judge Hoy SC and a jury panel in the District Court at Sydney on an indictment containing two counts.
	
	
	The first count averred that, on 21 December 2013 at Narrabri, they entered a dwelling house with intent to commit the serious indictable offence of intimidation, in circumstances of aggravation (in that each was in company of others), and in circumstances of special aggravation (in that each recklessly inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the complainant). The indictment contained a lesser, alternative, count, and we infer from the judgment of his Honour under consideration that other alternatives were to be left to the jury as well.
	
	
	We infer, again from the judgment of his Honour, that the Crown case against at least some of the accused was founded upon principles of joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The trial was a special fixture, had proceeded for 11 days, and his Honour was part way into his summing-up when the question of discharge was raised. That occurred as follows.
	
	
	On Tuesday 5 July 2016 his Honour received a note from the jury. In its entirety, it was as follows:
	


This morning one juror was entering the carpark opposite the juror entrance to the courts. Waiting at the ticket machine was Mr Joey Lam. The juror then parked his car, which took a few minutes and Mr Lam was still waiting at the carpark entrance when the juror emerged. He followed the juror across the lights and into the jury entrance to the courts, where he spoke to another juror on this case and said “Is this the juror entrance?” She ignored him, and he turned and left through the glass doors (approx. 10.05).

We are uncomfortable, as we feel that this was an attempt to intimidate the jury. In addition, he knows which vehicle one juror drives.

[underlining in original]


	
	It was subsequently confirmed that the person to whom the note referred was the accused Mr Joseph Lamb.
	
	
	As one would expect, his Honour discussed the note with all four legal representatives. By agreement, the foreman was examined on oath by his Honour, but in the absence of the rest of the jury. The following portions of the transcript of that examination are relevant:
	


Q. Mr Foreperson - forgive me if I use that, that's the way we do it - as you probably know we've received a note. Yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you aware of its contents and the concerns expressed?

A. I am aware of those.

Q. Is the balance of the jury aware of its contents and the concerns

expressed?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. I've got another question, do more than one juror presently have those

concerns?

A. Yes.

Q. Do more than two jurors presently have those concerns?

A. No, but may I check with you the concerns expressed at the end of that

note?

…

Q. You see there in the last paragraph that's written there, ""We are uncomfortable as we feel that this was an attempt to intimidate the jury. In addition he knows which vehicle one juror drives.""

A. Yes.

Q. That's the concerns that I was referring to.

A. There is some discomfort amongst the jurors, but mainly it's between two of them and they have expressed that it's only of minor concern to them. That they would be -I don't want to go on too much and say too much if it's not required, but they're happy to continue if that's - -

Q. But they've expressed concerns?

A. Yes.

Q. And more than two have expressed concerns?

A. No, just two.

Q. Are they the two who were those nominated in this note?

A. Yes.

Q. That is the car park person and the other person near the entrance? A. Yes.

…

Q. Mr Foreperson, thank you, I wanted to clarify those issues. I thought I would do it just in the absence of everyone else because I wanted to get you as the foreperson your overview, so that certainly makes sense to me now when I read the note, but I wanted to clarify.

A. Can I add - if you don't mind, clarify a bit more about the uncomfortable nature. They don't feel overly uncomfortable. They're uncomfortable at what happened, but they're not uncomfortable to the point where they're not willing to continue. They're happy to continue.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you very much for that. Leave that, you pop outside. We'll get back to you all as soon as I can.


	
	Counsel for Mr Lamb provided the trial judge with an innocent explanation for the conduct. It was that Mr Lamb was waiting for his cousin outside the courthouse, was a little lost, recognised a juror, started walking in the same direction as the juror towards the court, and then enquired of the juror whether the door in question was the jury entrance. But it was said that that enquiry was made due to confusion, not with intent to intimidate.
	
	
	Thereafter, his Honour received submissions in the absence of the entirety of the jury. Ultimately, it was agreed by all parties that the two jurors who had had contact with Mr Lamb should be discharged, pursuant to s 53B(b) and s 53B(d) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW)(the Act).
	
	
	The point of contention before his Honour was whether his Honour should go further, and discharge the remaining 10 jurors. That question called for consideration of s 53C(1)(a) of the Act. The entirety of that section is as follows:
	


53C Discretion to continue trial or coronial inquest or discharge whole jury

(1) If a juror dies, or the court or coroner discharges a juror in the course of a trial or coronial inquest, the court or coroner must:

(a) discharge the jury if the court or coroner is of the opinion that to continue the trial or coronial inquest with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or

(b) if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors.

(2) A court or coroner that discharges a jury under subsection (1) (a) may stay the proceedings on such terms as the court or coroner thinks fit if a party gives notice of an intention to lodge an application for leave to appeal for review of the decision under section 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(3) Where a jury in civil proceedings is discharged under this section, the proceedings may, without any new process for that purpose, be set down for trial either at the same or any subsequent sittings, as the court may order.


	
	As recorded in the judgment of his Honour, the position of the Crown was that there was no real sense of discomfort on the part of any of the jurors, particularly the 10 remaining, and that the trial judge should not exercise his discretion to discharge the remainder of the jury.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the innocent explanation put forward on behalf of Mr Lamb was within the range of possibilities, although the Crown did not concede that that explanation should be accepted. It was also submitted that the trial judge could ensure a fair trial by providing the jury with the innocent explanation given by Mr Lamb, and thereafter giving a strong direction to the jury that they disregard the occurrence and focus upon the evidence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the other two co-accused were not prejudiced in any way, although it was accepted that the Crown case alleged a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The position of Mr Lamb, and the other two accused, was that there remained a risk of contamination of the balance of the jury, and that, pursuant to s 53C(1)(a) of the Act, the remainder of the jury must also be discharged.
	


Judgment of the trial judge


	
	In a judgment that was necessarily delivered ex tempore, but is, with respect, cogent and comprehensive, his Honour recounted the factual and procedural background, and summarised the contending submissions of the Crown and the three accused.
	
	
	His Honour referred explicitly to the test contained in the sub-section to which we have referred. His Honour also noted two decisions of this Court with regard to the question, namely Trieu v R [2012] NSWCCA 169 and Munn v R; Miller v R [2006] NSWCCA 61, and referred briefly to the facts of those decisions. With regard to Trieu v R (an unsuccessful appeal against conviction founded in part on a ground that the jury should have been discharged but was not), his Honour noted that this Court had emphasised the fact that a trial judge is undoubtedly in a better position to judge the atmosphere in a trial court room than this Court. With regard to Munn v R; Miller v R (a successful appeal against conviction founded in part on the refusal of the trial judge to discharge a jury), his Honour noted that its facts were broadly similar to those here, but did not analyse it more deeply.
	
	
	The trial judge also noted that the concern of the jury, expressed explicitly in the note, was to do with an attempt at intimidation of its members. His Honour regarded as important the fact that the primary count in the indictment was an offence of violence, and featured, as an explicitly pleaded element, intimidation.
	
	
	His Honour also placed some emphasis on the fact that the centrepiece of the Crown case was an alleged joint criminal enterprise, and took the view that the allegation of the three accused working together in a criminal purpose could have the effect of causing the jury to come to the view that the alleged actions of Mr Lamb reflected adversely on the other two accused as well.
	
	
	Ultimately, his Honour came to the view that the test contained in the relevant sub-section had been made out.
	
	
	In the result, however, his Honour did not formally discharge the jury, but rather adjourned the trial for a short period. That was done so that the Crown could, if it wished, pursue an application for leave to appeal against that decision, pursuant to s 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In the event, that is precisely what has occurred. The provision is as follows:
	


5G Appeal against discharge of whole jury

(1) The Attorney General, Director of Public Prosecutions or any other party to a trial of criminal proceedings before a jury may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal for review of any decision by the court to discharge the jury, but only with the leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal.

(2) The Court of Criminal Appeal is to deal with an appeal as soon as possible after the application for leave to appeal is lodged.

(3) The Court of Criminal Appeal:

(a) may affirm or vacate the decision appealed against, and

(b) if it vacates the decision, may make some other decision instead of the decision appealed against.

(4) If leave to appeal under this section is refused by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the refusal does not preclude any other appeal following a conviction on the matter to which the refused application for leave to appeal related.

(5) This section does not apply to the discharge of a jury under section 51, 55E, 56 or 58 of the Jury Act 1977.

Evidence before this Court


	
	The matter came before us at 10am on Thursday 7 July 2016. In the circumstances, we make no criticism of any party for the fact that the materials with which we were provided were quite limited. We had before us the indictment, a Crown case statement, the transcript of the questioning of the foreman, the judgment of 5 July 2016, and a report to this Court from his Honour. We did not have a transcript of the entirety of the trial, a copy of any exhibits, or the transcript of the submissions that had been made to his Honour before and after the examination of the foreman, and before the delivery of the judgment in question.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	In this Court, the Crown prosecutor accepted that the decision of his Honour could only be impugned upon the well-known principles enunciated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. She submitted that, in the circumstances we have outlined, the result was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. She emphasised that, by the end of the evidence of the foreman, it was clear that the remaining 10 jurors were untroubled by what had occurred. She also submitted that any remaining problem could have been dealt with by way of an appropriate direction to the remaining 10 jurors ameliorating any residual concerns that they may have held.
	
	
	As for the test to be applied by the trial judge, the Crown submitted that, despite the existence of an explicit statutory test in the sub-section to which we have referred, the well-known test for the discharge of a jury enunciated by the plurality in Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427 had a role to play; namely, whether there was “a high degree of necessity for the jury’s discharge”. She submitted that that test could inform the meaning of the phrase a “substantial miscarriage of justice” contained in s 53C(1)(a) of the Act.
	
	
	In short, she submitted that error had been established, the order discharging the remainder of the jury should quashed, and the trial should continue to verdict.
	


Submissions of the accused


	
	Before us, Mr Lamb was represented separately from Mr Mason and Mr Hill, but it is convenient to consider the submissions made on behalf of the three of them together.
	
	
	Counsel simply submitted that the decision of his Honour was soundly based, both factually and legally. It was said that his Honour was perfectly entitled to take into account the prima facie import of the note that the whole jury was concerned, whatever the foreman may subsequently have intimated. Emphasis was placed upon the reference by the foreman to “discomfort… mainly… between the two of them” [emphasis added], which suggested that the other jurors were also not entirely comfortable.
	
	
	His Honour was also entitled, it was said, to take into account the conjunction between the count contained in the indictment (founded on intimidation), and the concern of the jury (founded upon alleged intimidation).
	
	
	Contrary to the submission of the Crown, it was said that Parliament has prescribed a particular statutory test that is to be applied in the particular circumstances that pertain when one or more jurors has been discharged, and thereafter the trial judge needs to consider the question of the discharge of the remainder. In other words, it was said that, in these circumstances, the general test in Crofts v The Queen was not the relevant one, nor does it inform the statutory test.
	
	
	Counsel emphasised the fact that the statutory test does not focus upon satisfaction that a substantial miscarriage of justice would occur, but rather upon whether continuation of the trial would give rise to the risk of such an outcome.
	
	
	In short it was said that, applying the principle in House v The King to a decision that must to be characterised as either an exercise of discretion or an evaluative judgment with regard to a statutory test, error had not been demonstrated.
	


Determination


	
	The procedure adopted by his Honour of deciding that the jury should be discharged but thereafter adjourning proceedings for a short time was appropriate, in that it permitted the parties to exercise their rights with regard to the decision, and permitted this Court to exercise its jurisdiction: Barber v R; Zraika v R [2016] NSWCCA 125 at [49].
	
	
	Secondly, the joint submission of the parties before us that only House v The King error will suffice to overturn a decision of this kind is soundly based: see Trieu v R at [21]; and Barber v R; Zraika v R at [24].
	
	
	Thirdly, in the circumstances, we do not feel it necessary to resolve the subsidiary controversy as to whether or not the statutory test contained in s 53C(1)(a) of the Act is to be considered on its own, or whether it can be informed by the seemingly higher test contained in Crofts v The Queen. The matter was not fully argued before us in any event. It is sufficient to observe that, whatever be the correct position, we would have come to the same conclusion.
	
	
	Fourthly, minds may differ about what could have been the way forward in the trial after the discharge of the two jurors. Factors that argued against the course adopted by his Honour included that the trial had proceeded for 11 days; it had been specially fixed in Sydney. No doubt the witnesses had travelled a lengthy distance from the place of the alleged offence. His Honour was part way through the summing-up. Whatever the contents of the note, one could have interpreted the evidence of the foreman as a whole as having been that the remainder of the jury were not unduly troubled. The trial judge could have come to the view that a firm direction against distraction or prejudice would have sufficed, and that the trial should have proceeded thereafter.
	
	
	Having said that, merely because a different judge may have come to a different view in all of the circumstances, does not mean that the test in House v The King for appellate review of the exercise of judicial discretion (or the making of an evaluative judgment) has been made out.
	
	
	To the contrary, we consider that, just as there was no error of fact or law demonstrated in the judgment of his Honour, neither can it be said that the result itself bespeaks error, in that it is “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. That is especially so when one takes into account that we did not have the benefit of a transcript of the entirety of the trial, and, even if we had been provided with that transcript, the trial judge would have been in an immeasurably better position than we to judge the atmosphere in the courtroom at the time when the decision needed to be made: see Crofts v The Queen at p 458 (Dawson J) and p 464 (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ); and Trieu v R at [28].
	


Conclusion


	
	The question raised in this appeal was important, including with regard to the correctness of the procedure adopted by the trial judge. For that reason, we were content to grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	For the reasons we have provided above, however, we came to the view that the appeal should be dismissed.

2769876,Anargiros v R [2016] NSWCCA 134,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	PRICE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the following charges:
	



	
	Sequence 1: between 15 January 2013 and 18 March 2013, the applicant supplied firearms three times or more, being one sawn-off .22 calibre rifle, one .22 calibre Remington rifle, one .22 calibre Winchester rifle and eleven .22 calibre pen guns contrary to s 51B(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). Maximum penalty – 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	Sequence 13: between 15 January 2013 and 18 March 2013, the applicant manufactured prohibited firearms, being pen guns, without being authorised by licence or permit contrary to s 50A(2) of the Firearms Act. Maximum penalty – 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Sequence 14: on 8 April 2013, the applicant supplied a prohibited drug, namely ephedrine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Maximum penalty – 15 years imprisonment and a fine of 2,000 penalty units ($220,000).
	



	
	Upon being committed for sentence to the District Court, the applicant adhered to his pleas. He asked Bennett SC DCJ to take into account eight matters on a Form 1 when imposing sentence for the charge of supplying firearms three times or more (Sequence 1). These offences were:
	



	
	One charge of selling a prohibited firearm part on 18 March 2013 contrary to s 51BA(2) of the Firearms Act. Maximum penalty – 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Five charges of selling ammunition without a licence or permit, contrary to s 65(1) of the Firearms Act. Maximum penalty for each offence – a fine of $5,000.
	
	
	Two charges of possessing ammunition without holding a licence, permit or authority contrary to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act. Maximum penalty for each offence – a fine of $5,000.
	



	
	A discount of 25% was allowed by the judge for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The indicative sentences specified by his Honour were:
	



	
	For the supplying firearms charge (Sequence 1), 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years;
	
	
	For the manufacturing prohibited firearms charge (Sequence 13), 6 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months; and
	
	
	For the supply of ephedrine (Sequence 14), imprisonment for 1 year.
	



	
	The judge sentenced the applicant to an aggregate sentence of 10 years imprisonment commencing 5 June 2013 and expiring 4 June 2023, with a non-parole period of 5 years, expiring 4 June 2018.
	
	
	The applicant sought leave to appeal on two grounds but as the second ground was not proceeded with, it is only necessary to state the remaining ground which contends that the judge erred in finding that the applicant’s poor health was relevant to the setting of the non-parole period, but not the head sentence.
	
	
	As the focus of the appeal is confined to this issue, it is unnecessary to refer at length to the facts of the case and the applicant’s personal circumstances, other than his health.
	
	
	A convenient summary of the agreed facts is found in the respondent’s written submissions (RWS pp 2-3):
	


“5. In May 2012 police began an investigation into the supply of firearms and drugs in Metropolitan Sydney. This included the use of telephone intercepts, surveillance, a registered source and an undercover operative. The applicant (then aged 51) was identified as an illegal firearms dealer and police targeted his activities. Between January 2013 and June 2013 the applicant supplied a firearm on four occasions to either the source or the undercover operative (Sequence 1). On each occasion the applicant supplied ammunition that could be used with the firearms (Form 1 matters). At the first sale the applicant stated that he could supply 20-30 ‘pen pistols’ at a time and they could be delivered within three days. The source ordered ten ‘pen pistols’ which were later supplied with 1,693 rounds of ammunition. The applicant manufactured and assisted in the assembly of the ‘pen pistols’ (Sequence 13). During this period the applicant also made it clear that he had the capacity and motivation to supply more firearms and ammunition if needed. In April 2013 the applicant supplied the undercover operative with a prohibited drug, ephedrine (Sequence 14). All of the firearms were later test fired and were in working order.

”


	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence but a psychologist’s report, a number of medical reports, hospital notes and some character references were tendered.
	
	
	During the remarks on sentence, the judge referred to the applicant’s subjective circumstances in some detail. Other than those matters relevant to the applicant’s health, the judge’s remarks included:
	



	
	The applicant was born in 1962 and was 54 years old at the time of sentence.
	
	
	He had one offence on his criminal history of driving unlicensed in 2007. His Honour observed that it was unusual to see someone embarking on such serious criminal conduct without a greater antecedent criminal history.
	
	
	He had been in custody since the date of his arrest and was on protection due to concerns for his safety. He had been compliant in custody and was not considered a management concern.
	
	
	He was born in Greece and came to Australia as a child. He grew up in a supportive family and there was nothing in his background to explain his criminal actions.
	
	
	He was previously married and has an adult daughter. A relationship of two years ended while he was on remand.
	
	
	He made representations to the author of the pre-sentence report that he committed the offences because a friend’s debt was placed on him when the friend could not be located. The applicant attributed his decision to offend due to concerns for his safety after being threatened by others involved. He stated that he was “so sorry” for his actions. His Honour was circumspect about these representations in accordance with the statement of principles in cases such as R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369; [2001] NSWCCA 353.
	



	
	The judge found that the applicant’s explanation for his misconduct was inconsistent with his electronically recorded conversations and even if he had committed the offences to fulfil a debt it would make little difference to the punishment he would face.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant had committed the offences for financial reward and expressed concern that the firearms would have found their way into the community and the use to be made by criminals of the manufactured pen guns.
	
	
	The applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were said by the judge to be good but his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant was appropriately remorseful and contrite.
	


The applicant’s health


	
	The medical reports disclosed that the applicant suffered from dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnoea, dyslipidaemia and impaired liver function.
	
	
	In a report dated 7 October 2014, Rima Nasr, psychologist, stated that the applicant reported that he was diagnosed with sleep apnoea and cardiomyopathy approximately two years ago, causing a rapid decline in his physical health. The primary symptoms that the applicant suffered from reportedly related to breathlessness, fatigue, dizziness and a lack of energy making daily responsibilities and self-care difficult to maintain. He engaged in fewer activities to avoid exertion. While this assisted with his breathing, the applicant said that his symptoms persisted.
	
	
	The applicant told Ms Nasr that he fainted approximately monthly, requiring him to be placed in a ‘safe cell’ to be monitored regularly by prison staff. He had previously been placed at Long Bay Hospital for seven months where he spent large amounts of time in the clinic. The applicant said that his symptoms were worsening over time, causing him to feel anxious about dying in custody without the presence of his family. He stated that approximately seven months ago, he had a pacemaker and cardioverter defibrillator inserted. The applicant told Ms Nasr that while this had assisted with breathing, his symptoms persisted. He had been consulting with a cardiologist, Dr Phong Nguyen, in order to manage his heart condition. His medications included Lasix, Bicor and Plavix. Based on the information provided by the applicant, Ms Nasr opined that “[the applicant] is a high needs person medically, ingesting a large amount of medication to assist him with daily functioning.” (Ex 1, p 5.)
	
	
	In a report dated 23 February 2013, Dr Nguyen stated that the applicant was “a 51 years [sic] old man who was recently diagnosed of [sic] having cardiomyopathy and AF.” (Ex 1, p 19.) Dr Nguyen stated that the applicant was reasonably stable with no sign of any acute heart failure. Dr Nguyen reported that “mostly his underlying cardiomyopathy is caused by perhaps the combination of viral induced [sic] and the heavily [sic] use of ice.” (Ex 1, p 20). He advised the applicant that he needed to be on Warfarin.
	
	
	Dr Sze-Yuan Ooi, in a report dated 28 January 2014, stated that the applicant had a dilated cardiomyopathy, persistent atrial fibrillation and recurrent syncopal episodes. A biventricular defibrillator had been implanted for the applicant’s cardiac conditions.
	
	
	In a Justice Health report dated 20 October 2014, Dr Suresh Badami noted that the applicant had cardiac disease with a pacemaker which was inserted in January 2014. He was housed in Parklea Correctional Centre and managed according to the advice of cardiologists in Prince of Wales Hospital. In an acute situation, the applicant would be taken to the nearest hospital for assessment and management.
	
	
	Following a careful review of the medical evidence and Ms Nasr’s report, the judge said that notwithstanding what appeared to be successful medical intervention, he accepted that “[the applicant] is at risk of his heart failing and it is a matter that I must bring into account when determining the extent to which [the applicant] should be kept in custody, which will impact more heavily upon him than it might on someone who was not so afflicted.” (ROS p 23.)
	
	
	The judge said, “[b]ecause of the severe physical impairment that is described in the medical reports, I propose to reduce the custodial component significantly in this case.” (ROS p 25.)
	
	
	As a result of the finding of special circumstances, the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence was varied to 50%.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the applicant’s poor health was relevant to the setting of the non-parole period, but not to the head sentence

Submissions


	
	The applicant contended that, by confining the relevance of his poor health to the assessment of the non-parole period, the judge fell into error. The applicant argued that his poor health was relevant not only to the question of special circumstances, but also to the overall sentence. The applicant submitted that there was no certainty that he would be released on parole upon completion of his non-parole period; consequently, there was a real risk that he would experience a more onerous period of imprisonment, which may be defined by the head sentence rather than the non-parole period.
	
	
	The applicant cited Betts v R [2015] NSWCCA 39 where RS Hulme AJ (Meagher JA and Hidden J agreeing) concluded that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant’s injuries were relevant only to the question of special circumstances.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that had the judge taken into account the applicant’s state of health in reducing the head sentence and in finding special circumstances, his Honour would have been erroneously double counting. The respondent cited R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172; Bell v R; Jelisavac v R [2009] NSWCCA 206.
	
	
	The respondent pointed out that the judge raised this very issue with the applicant’s senior counsel who submitted that the judge’s approach was an appropriate course.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s reliance on Betts, the respondent argued that the Court did not analyse how the applicant’s poor health would be taken into account by mitigating the head sentence where the finding of special circumstances was made only for the reason of the applicant’s poor health. Furthermore, the Court did not allow the appeal.
	
	
	Another submission was that there was nothing in the applicant’s case to support a conclusion that there was a real risk that his health would adversely affect his ability to make or comply with conditions of parole.
	


Consideration


	
	During the proceedings on sentence, the following discussion took place between the judge and senior counsel for the applicant (Tcpt, p 12(4)-(19)):
	



	
		
			
			“SUTHERLAND:
			
			
			…I don’t labour the point but I do seek to bring to your Honour’s appropriate consideration the ongoing and very serious medical condition that this man labours under. Can I point one other thing out just in--
			
		
		
			
			HIS HONOUR:
			
			
			--special circumstances, but if it rests there it would be double counting wouldn’t it, to bring into account on the overall head sentence. I would be minded to impose an aggregate sentence I should indicate but--
			
		
		
			
			SUTHERLAND:
			
			
			Yes, I would have thought that was an appropriate course, if I may say so.
			
		
		
			
			HIS HONOUR:
			
			
			Special circumstances I would have thought is the place where that would sit. 
			
		
		
			
			SUTHERLAND:
			
			
			Yes. …” [Emphasis added.]
			
		
	



	
	It is evident that the applicant’s senior counsel considered that it was appropriate for the applicant’s poor health to be taken into account as a special circumstance but not as a matter that would impact upon the head sentence. No submission was made to the judge that to do otherwise would not amount to double counting.
	
	
	This Court has emphasised that appeals do not provide an occasion to revise or reformulate cases argued before a sentencing judge. Arguments that are raised on appeal that retract or contradict submissions made below will not be entertained unless it can be demonstrated that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [79]-[83].
	
	
	The applicant’s argument seeks to resile from a concession made by senior counsel in response to the judge’s indication that his consideration of poor health would be confined to a variation of the non-parole period.
	
	
	I do not think that, on the facts of this case, senior counsel’s concession was inappropriate. Poor health rendering imprisonment more burdensome may establish special circumstances but does not mandate a lesser head sentence: see, for example, R v Sellen (1991) 57 A Crim R 313. Furthermore, this Court has warned against double counting for matters already taken into account in calculating the head sentence, when finding special circumstances: Fidow at [18]; Trindall v R [2013] NSWCCA 229 at [17]; Bell; Jelisavac at [73].
	
	
	In Betts, the Court determined that the serious injuries suffered by the offender in that case might impact upon the period of his sentence whilst at liberty and the judge erred in limiting the significance of these injuries to the non-parole period.
	
	
	In the present case, there was simply no evidence before the judge which established that the applicant’s medical conditions will limit his ability to comply with terms that may be imposed as conditions of parole. In any event, it is reasonable to expect that his parole conditions will be crafted in such a way to take into account his health at the time he is to be released on conditional liberty.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the judge erred. Moreover, as the applicant’s attempt to resile from a concession made to the sentencing judge has not been justified, I would refuse leave to appeal.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose the following order:
	


Leave to appeal against sentence refused.


	
	McCallum J: I agree with Price J.

		11 July 2016",2016-07-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769877,Vu v R [2016] NSWCCA 136,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The appellant, Mr Vu, was convicted by a jury of one count of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity (352.2g), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	He was sentenced by Lakatos DCJ in the District Court to a term of imprisonment for 7 years, comprising a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months commencing on 15 March 2013 and expiring on 14 December 2017 and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months expiring on 14 March 2010. The maximum penalty for the offence of which the appellant was convicted was 20 years imprisonment, a fine of $350,000 or both. A standard non-parole period of 10 years applied.
	
	
	The Crown case, in summary, was that on 9 February 2012, the appellant and his co-accused (his former wife) had heroin in their possession for the purposes of supply, the heroin being found by police in a packet of tortilla chips in the footwell of the front passenger seat of a car then being driven by the appellant. The Crown case was that the appellant was given the chip bag shortly beforehand by Mr Tan Phong Le at a convenience store in Newtown. The appellant had come from Melbourne to Sydney to acquire the drug. The police had intercepted telephone communications between Mr Le and the appellant prior to the meeting at which the appellant was given the chip bag containing heroin. The quantity of heroin contained in the chip bag was subsequently certified as being 352.2g, with a purity of 47%. It had a street value of between $90,000 and $150,000.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded not guilty.
	
	
	On the second day of the trial, the jury forwarded the trial judge a note in which the jury expressed the desire to handle a bag with weight equivalent to 352g of heroin and a normal chip bag, as a comparison. Objection was raised by Counsel for the appellant to the demonstration, on the basis that the probative value of the demonstration was low and that it would result in unfair prejudice to the accused. The trial judge allowed the demonstration, determining that the evidence was probative, carried no attendant unfair prejudice and had little prospect of misleading or confusing if conducted in open court in front of all the parties.
	
	
	By notice of appeal filed 8 February 2016, the appellant appealed his conviction on the following grounds:
	


(1)   The trial Judge erred in permitting the demonstration, which demonstration resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

(2)   The Summing Up on knowledge of the quantity of drugs alleged to have been supplied.

(3)   The directions on circumstantial reasoning and inferences reversed the onus of proof and obscured the standard of proof.


	
	Written submissions were filed on behalf of both the appellant and the Crown on each of the grounds of appeal. Relevantly, the Crown accepted that knowledge of the involvement of a commercial quantity of a particular drug was an essential element of the offence in question (Fung v R [2007] NSWCCA 250; (2007) 174 A Crim R 169 at [42]) and that the trial judge erred in failing appropriately to direct the jury as to this element. Nevertheless the Crown (in its written submissions) suggested that this may be an appropriate case for the application of the proviso pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	At the outset of the hearing of the appeal, Senior Counsel for the appellant (Mr Game SC) advised the Court that the parties would be asking the Court to deal first with ground 2 (i.e., that in respect of which the Crown conceded error) and to quash the appellant’s conviction in respect of the contravention of s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. He invited the Court to substitute a verdict of guilty on the statutory alternative charge (which he accepted was open on the jury’s verdict) of supplying a prohibited drug in an amount not less than the indictable quantity under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Mr Game indicated that, in that event, the appellant would not press grounds 1 and 3 of his appeal and would ask the Court to re-sentence him rather than remitting the matter to the District Court for sentencing on the s 25(1) conviction.
	
	
	The Crown agreed with that approach and indicated that it would not be pressing the proviso point in relation to the error the subject of ground 2 of the grounds of appeal. Insofar as leave was required to raise ground 2 (because it had not been the subject of a complaint at trial as to the trial judge’s directions to the jury), the Crown did not raise any objection to such leave being granted.
	
	
	For the appellant, an affidavit sworn 6 July 2016 by his solicitor was read, without objection, going to the re-sentencing issue. Mr Game also helpfully provided the Court with notes on re-sentence.
	


Determination


	
	The Court, having had the opportunity prior to the hearing of the appeal to read and consider the submissions of both parties in relation, inter alia, to ground 2, was satisfied that there was error established in that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that they needed to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that he was in possession of a commercial quantity of the drug in question. Ground 2 was therefore made good (and was quite properly so conceded to be by the Crown). For completeness, the Court proceeded on the basis that leave to raise ground 2 as a ground of appeal was not opposed.
	
	
	As to the re-sentencing, Mr Game indicated to the Court that the Court could proceed on the basis that there was no contest as to the matters referred to by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence (though submitting that on re-sentencing the Court would not treat the planned and organised nature of the criminal activity as an aggravating feature).
	
	
	For the appellant, it was submitted that the Court should proceed to re-sentence him on the basis that the quantity of the drug involved was substantial but not exceeding 250g (the threshold for the s 25(1) offence). The Crown’s position was that the Court should accept that the quantity was close to but not exceeding 250g. The Crown submitted that this was at the upper end of the indictable offence pursuant to s 25(1).
	
	
	The Court adjourned following the hearing of the submissions for both the appellant and the Crown and then proceeded on 6 July 2016 to re-sentence the appellant as follows, indicating that reasons would be provided in due course:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Quash the conviction of the appellant for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	Pursuant to the power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), convict the appellant of one count of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	Sentence the appellant to a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months commencing 15 March 2013 and expiring 14 August 2016 and a balance of term of 1 year and 1 month expiring 14 September 2017.
	
	
	Note that grounds 1 and 3 of the appellant’s grounds of appeal are not pressed.
	


Reasons


	
	At the hearing of the appeal Mr Game asked the Court to note that the appellant was content for the Court to provide brief remarks only on sentence. The following are the Court’s reasons (in brief compass) for making the above orders.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the s 25(1) offence is 15 years. There is no applicable standard non-parole period. Having regard to the evidence at the trial as to the quantity of heroin in the chip bag, the appellant should be re-sentenced on the basis submitted by the Crown, namely that he supplied close to but not exceeding 250g of heroin. That is, on any view, a substantial quantity. The street value of that amount of heroin at the relevant time may be assumed (by extrapolating from the value of the larger quantity of drugs as found by the trial judge) to have been somewhere in the range between $64,000 and $105,000.
	
	
	There was no issue taken by the appellant with the finding by the trial judge as to the probability that he proposed to take the drugs to Melbourne and deal with them in some manner; nor as to the conclusion (based on the purity of the drug) that it was the intention of the appellant or his associates further to cut the heroin prior to its on-supply; nor as to the appellant’s role being more than that of a mere courier and being part of a planned and organised criminal activity. There was no evidence of money changing hands or that this was other than an isolated incident, but the trial judge concluded (and again the appellant does not cavil with this conclusion) that since the appellant was not a drug user he was involved to further the supply enterprise.
	
	
	As to the appellant’s subjective circumstances, the evidence before the trial judge was that the appellant did not have any significant criminal history and was largely a person of good character. The trial judge considered that there was not sufficient material to make a reliable forecast as to the likelihood of re-offending or prospects of rehabilitation. However, before this Court, there is evidence (in the form of his solicitor’s affidavit) that while in custody the appellant has participated productively in work and has completed a course in construction work, from which it may be concluded that there are favourable prospects of rehabilitation. The evidence also supports the conclusion that the appellant has the support of his family, who regularly travel some distance to visit him in prison. He is now 45 years of age and, when released from custody, will reside with his partner and two younger children in Melbourne. His solicitor has deposed that the appellant intends to complete further studies and, in due course, seek employment as an electrician.
	
	
	The finding of special circumstances in the appellant’s case is warranted, for the reasons given by the trial judge. Further, it should be noted that, by proposing and submitting to this manner of resolution of his appeal, the appellant is facilitating the course of justice.
	
	
	Balancing the above matters, the Court concluded that the sentence to be imposed on the appellant for the s 25(1) offence should be as stated above.

2769887,Erazo v R [2016] NSWCCA 139,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft Davies J’s reasons, with which I agree.
	
	
	As to ground 9 of the grounds of appeal, I share the reservation expressed by Davies J as to the restrictiveness of the view expressed by McClellan CJ at CL in Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [112], following the line of authority since R v Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125, as to the lawfulness of the offender on the premises leading to a conclusion that it will not be an aggravating circumstance when a victim is assaulted in his or her own home. I consider that there is force in the observations made by RA Hulme J in Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 at [44] and by Wilson J in Aktar v R [2015] NSWCCA 123 at [43]-[63] on that issue. However, for the reasons given by Davies J, I agree that on the present state of the law the finding that it was an aggravating factor that the offender had used the family home “as a means of committing the offences” was in error and that the distinction that the trial judge sought to draw in that regard was not available.
	
	
	As to grounds 5 and 7, which RS Hulme AJ would uphold, I respectfully agree with Davies J that the findings complained of in those grounds were open when regard was had to the Agreed Facts and the Victim Impact Statement. The first was a composite finding that the victim was “at an age when she was battling with puberty, battling with being in a new country and speaking a different language and trying to come to terms with her new school environment”. The second was a reference to the victim’s traumatic teenage years. It is clear that the offences occurred at and around puberty (not least because of the victim’s age when they commenced and the fact that she then became pregnant towards the end of year 10 of her schooling as a result of one of the assaults). The victim referred in her Victim Impact Statement to her difficulties at school (compared to her experience of school in South America), to not having a good command of English and to being a target for bullies. She felt ashamed, guilty and scared that friends, the Catholic school she attended, and the community would find out about the abuse and the termination of her pregnancy; and her embarrassment and shame when she had to ask a school friend how to do a pregnancy test. While I accept that the trial judge used somewhat emotive terms in describing the victim’s vulnerable situation at the time of the offences, I would conclude that the inferences he drew were open to him.
	
	
	Moreover, even if the trial judge erred as identified by RS Hulme AJ in relation to the matters the subject of grounds 5 and 7, I agree with RS Hulme AJ that they do not demonstrate that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	As to the re-sentencing exercise to be carried out by this Court in light of the errors identified by Davies J, I agree with RS Hulme AJ that the sentence imposed on the appellant was manifestly inadequate. Elsewhere, it has been recognised that the risk of harm to a child exposed to an abusive parent or guardian must self-evidently be very high (see Sackville AJA in DC v State of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 15 at [52], his Honour there observing that it is difficult to think of a more vulnerable class of persons than children subjected to sexual abuse by such persons).
	
	
	Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, the matters referred to in Davies J’s reasons (at [71]–[73]), the submissions made by counsel for the appellant, and the material that is before this Court, I am firmly of the view that no lesser sentence than that imposed by the trial judge should be imposed. The manifest inadequacy of the original sentence makes it quite outside the available range.
	
	
	I therefore agree with the orders Davies J has proposed.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant pleaded guilty on 3 March 2014 in the Campbelltown District Court to six counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He asked that six other offences be taken into account on Form 1 documents. Three of those counts were also aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, two were aggravated indecent assaults and one was aggravated incite act of indecency.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the principal offences is 20 years’ imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of ten years for offences committed after 1 February 2003. The maximum penalty for aggravated indecent assault is seven years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years for offences committed after 1 February 2003. The maximum penalty for aggravated incite act of indecency is five years’ imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	On 9 May 2014 the Applicant was sentenced by Acting Judge Williams to an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of ten years commencing 4 March 2014 and expiring 3 March 2024 with an additional term of four years expiring 3 March 2028. The indicative sentences were these:
	


Count 1 taking into account the Form 1 (aggravated indecent assault) – minimum term of six years with an additional term of three years commencing 4 March 2014;

Count 2 taking into account the Form 1 (aggravated indecent assault and aggravated sexual intercourse without consent) – minimum term of six years with an additional term of three years commencing 4 September 2014;

Count 3 taking into account the Form 1 (aggravated incite act of indecency) – minimum term of seven years with an additional term of three years commencing 4 March 2015;

Count 4 taking into account the Form 1 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent) – minimum term of seven years with an additional term of three years commencing 4 September 2015;

Count 5 taking into account the Form 1 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent) – minimum term of nine years with an additional term of four years commencing 4 March 2016;

Count 6 – minimum term of nine years with an additional term of four years commencing 4 September 2016.


	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


His Honour erred in:

the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive

finding ""when the victim was adjusting to the fact of living in a new country, learning to speak a new language and attending a different school system"" as there was no evidence to find that, (page 2.3 of sentence)

finding ""that she always would have been substantially at a physical disadvantage"" as this occurs in almost all cases of having sexual intercourse between an adult male and a complainant of the age of this girl.

taking into account charges not proceeding in respect of count 4

finding at page 8.4 ""at an age when she was battling with puberty,

battling with being in a new country and speaking a new language and trying to come to terms with her new school environment … vital and difficult times to develop..."" when there was no evidence to that effect.

finding at page 8.7 ""I have no doubt that what happened to her will affect her and be with her for the rest of her life. It is to be hoped that appropriate counselling Mr Erazo's appalling behaviour"" when there was no evidence to that effect.

finding at page 9.2 ""throughout her traumatic teenage years"" when there was no evidence they were traumatic aside from these offences.

finding as aggravating features at page 9.3 that the attentions were ""....painful and causative of harm"" as that is generic to the offences themselves with the age difference and anal intercourse as well as not being aggravating features included in section 21A (2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

finding that using the family home was an aggravating feature when it is unlikely to occur anywhere else. It is generic to most offences of this type,

taking into account the pregnancy termination '""her body was physically invaded again .... constituting another emotional and actual assault on her caused by the prisoner"" an uncharged criminal offence(s)

in failing to take into account his good character.

in failing to make a finding as to the discount for the plea of guilty and remorse.

in his findings at page 12.5 re physical violence as what occurred is typical and generic to offences of the type committed by the prisoner.

in specific deterrence given the findings and evidence of remorse,

the evidence from the prisoner and the report of Dr Pusey and his willingness to undergo counselling/treatment and coursed whilst in custody.

in finding at page 15.3 that the falling pregnant at the same time as the mother to the same man must have been humiliating as there was no evidence to this effect particularly in the victim impact statement.

in failing to warn the prisoner's representative of the findings in these grounds denying the opportunity to be heard (i.e. procedural fairness

That the cumulative effects of all of the grounds is such that the appellant was not sentenced according to law.


	
	The Notice of Appeal was not filed until 21 January 2016. A Notice of Application for Extension of Time for Leave to Appeal was filed on the same day. The reason given on the Notice was this:
	


Elver Erazo has not been able to raise the funds to appeal this matter until now, he has now the funds available.

The Crown opposed an extension of time.

The offending


	
	The victim in the offending was the Applicant’s stepdaughter.
	
	
	The victim’s mother migrated to Australia from Peru in 1994. In 1998 she met the Applicant and formed a de facto relationship. Two children were born to that relationship. In June 1998, the victim and her half-brother migrated to Australia with their grandmother. The victim was then aged ten.
	
	
	The offence in count 1 of the indictment took place in October 2000 when the victim was aged 12 years. She was in year 7 at the local Catholic school. The Applicant followed her to the bedroom and shut the door behind them. He said, “Can you do something for me”. He quickly pulled his pants down and started rubbing his erect penis with his hand. He grabbed the back of the victim’s head, pulled her head forward and pushed his penis into her mouth. She tried to push his hand away from the back of her head and pull away from his penis. The Applicant thrust his penis back and forth for about 30 seconds and then withdrew. He did not ejaculate. This was the first offence committed by the Applicant against the victim.
	
	
	Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2003 the Applicant came into the bedroom of the victim’s grandmother where the victim was playing a computer game. He unzipped his jeans and took out his penis which became erect. The Applicant grabbed the victim’s left hand and pulled it onto his penis. He kept his hand on top of her wrist and forced her hand up and down his penis, masturbating him. The victim tried to pull her hand away but the Applicant held her hand tightly and would not let her do it. The offence lasted for about a minute when the grandmother entered the room. This offence constituted the Form 1 matter relating to count 1.
	
	
	Count 2 took place between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2002. The victim was 14 years old. The Applicant came into the victim’s bedroom and sat on her bed. He forced her to access a porn site on her computer. As he was perusing the images on the screen he started rubbing his crotch. He asked the victim “Do you want to see it?” but she shook her head and said “No”. The Applicant took his erect penis out of his pants and forced the victim to rub his penis with her hand while they looked at the pictures. He then grabbed his penis and told her to put it into her mouth. She said that it made her feel sick so he then suggested that they do something else. That constituted the first of the two offences on the Form 1 (aggravated indecent assault) relating to count 2.
	
	
	The Applicant then pulled the victim’s underwear down. He forced her legs open and spread her labia open using his fingers. The victim tried to close her legs. The Applicant then put his tongue in her vagina. He kept her legs apart with his hands and was biting and hurting her. That lasted for 15 minutes until the Applicant became frustrated and said to the victim “Why can’t you come?” The Applicant then continued to perform cunnilingus on her. That constituted the second offence on the Form 1 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent) relating to count 2.
	
	
	The Applicant then inserted two fingers into her vagina. After two minutes he stopped and said he would finish himself off in the bathroom. That constituted count 2.
	
	
	In 2003 when the victim was 15 years old the Applicant started to fondle her whilst she was on her bed. He took his erect penis out of his pants and said to her, “Come here and put it in your mouth.” The victim said, “It makes me want to throw up”, so the Applicant said, “Do it with your hand”. He forced her to masturbate him for about five minutes and he then ejaculated in his hand. That constituted the Form 1 offence relating to count 3 (aggravated incite act of indecency).
	
	
	About six months later, somewhere between 1 June 2003 and 12 September 2003 the Applicant came into the victim’s bedroom. He took off all of her clothes. He spread the victim’s legs and rubbed his erect penis on the outside of her vagina. He then pushed his penis into her vagina. She told him it was hurting but he told her to relax. He continued to push his penis in and out of her vagina.
	
	
	They were interrupted by the victim’s half-brother who opened the door slightly. Thereafter the Applicant told the victim to go to her bedroom. She went to the toilet and noticed some bleeding from her vagina. This was the first time she had experienced penile-vaginal intercourse. This constituted count 3.
	
	
	On 13 September 2003 the victim was watching television. The Applicant was present but the rest of the family were in bed. The Applicant placed his hands down the victim’s pants and touched the front of her vaginal area. He placed the victim’s hand underneath his tracksuit pants against his penis. During this time he was pushing his fingers inside her vagina even though she was sitting down. This constituted the Form 1 matter relating to count 4.
	
	
	The Applicant went upstairs for about 20 minutes and then returned. He led the victim into the kitchen. He pulled her pants down and lifted her onto the dining table. He pulled his own pants and underpants down and put his penis inside her vagina while holding her up. The victim said, “It hurts a lot”. The Applicant lifted the victim up and carried her to an adjacent bathroom saying, “So that your mum doesn’t hear us”.
	
	
	The Applicant continued to move his penis up and down in her vagina for about 90 seconds when one of the bathroom doors opened. The victim’s mother was at the door. She called out, “What are you doing?” The Applicant directed the victim to sit on the toilet and pretend she was using it. The Applicant walked out of the bathroom into the garage through the other door.
	
	
	The victim’s mother then confronted the Applicant. He denied any wrongdoing. She called the police who attended and arrested the Applicant. The victim was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital in a very distressed state. The doctor who examined her found vaginal tears consistent with the sexual abuse complained of.
	
	
	Charges against the Applicant did not proceed because the victim did not make a statement. She was pressured by her mother not to make a statement and not to talk to the police. The Applicant was allowed to return to the family home. This incident constituted count 4.
	
	
	In early 2005 when the victim was 17 the Applicant entered her bedroom. He told the victim to lie down. As she did so he pulled her clothes off. The Applicant then proceeded to have penile-vaginal intercourse with her over the space of about a minute. This was the Form 1 matter relating to count 5.
	
	
	The Applicant then turned the victim around on the bed and told her to get onto her hands and knees. He then proceeded to have penile-anal intercourse with her. The victim said, “It’s really hurting me, stop”. Despite her protestations he continued to thrust very hard into her anus for about 30 seconds. This is count 5 on the indictment.
	
	
	The Applicant then pulled his penis out of her anus and penetrated her vagina. After about three minutes he ejaculated inside her vagina. As a result of this act of intercourse the victim became pregnant. This was at the same time as the victim’s mother was also pregnant by the Applicant. This incident was count 6 on the indictment.
	
	
	On 16 May 2005 the victim attended a clinic where her pregnancy was terminated. Not long afterwards the Applicant approached the victim to try to have sex with her again. She refused but he persisted for some time in asking for oral sex.
	
	
	From 2000 to mid-2005 the Applicant assaulted the victim on numerous occasions in addition to those occasions referred to above. At no time did the victim consent to these sexual assaults.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant gave evidence at the sentence proceedings but little evidence concerning his background was led from him. Rather, reliance was placed on a psychological report from Dr Paul Pusey, a clinical and forensic psychologist.
	
	
	That report disclosed that the Applicant was born in Colombia being the ninth of 11 children. He lived there for 29 years until he migrated to Australia. He met his wife, the victim’s mother, and they married in 1998.
	
	
	His childhood was unremarkable. He had a good relationship with his parents and his siblings. He left school at the age of 16 and completed an apprenticeship in diesel mechanics. He has continued to work as a diesel mechanic both in Colombia and Australia. Until his incarceration he owned and ran a diesel mechanics business in the western suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	He and his wife have two children, a son aged about 17 and a daughter aged about ten. The Applicant’s wife appears to have had two children from prior relationships, one of whom was the victim of the present offences.
	
	
	Dr Pusey, after administering various tests, concluded that the Applicant had a mild degree of cognitive impairment or intellectual disability. He said that there was no evidence, however, that would suggest the offending behaviour was in any way influenced by any degree of neuropsychological or cognitive impairment. His profile for one of the tests suggested that he was likely to demonstrate a degree of impulsivity, a lack of adherence to social standards and that he was likely to engage in rationalisations which support those behaviours. At the time Dr Pusey assessed the Applicant he found him to be experiencing symptoms of depression at a moderate level.
	


Extension of time


	
	An affidavit of the Applicant’s solicitor, Thelma Gray, was read in support of the application for an extension of time. The affidavit is entirely inadequate in providing any explanation for the delay between the sentence date of 17 October 2014 and the filing of the Notice of Appeal on 21 January 2016. There is a generalised reference to the Applicant’s difficulty in contacting Legal Aid to obtain the NIA and Extension forms which were apparently completed and sent to Legal Aid in May 2015. The Court was informed from the bar table that when Legal Aid was refused sometime late in 2015 the Applicant thereafter, at a date unable to be specified, retained his present solicitor, leading to the filing of the Notice of Appeal on 21 January 2016.
	
	
	The file discloses that a Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 27 August 2014 with the Registrar granting an extension of time to file that Notice to that date. Thereafter on 24 October 2014 the Applicant’s present solicitor wrote to the Court to advise that she was instructed by the Applicant to act for him in the appeal proceedings. Legal Aid then applied for an extension of time for the Notice of Intention to Appeal on 27 February 2015. An extension of the Notice was granted by R A Hulme J until 27 May 2015. That information does not easily accord with what is contained in the affidavit of Thelma Gray.
	
	
	There is in the circumstances an explanation for the delay from August 2014 until February 2015. There is thereafter no explanation from 27 May 2015 until the Notice of Appeal was filed on 21 January 2016. Although the Crown opposed an extension of time being granted it was not able to point to any specific prejudice from the delay.
	
	
	Interests of justice in a particular case might favour permitting an appeal or an application for leave to appeal to be heard notwithstanding that it was not brought within time. The prospect of success if the extension were to be granted is relevant to the determination of the interests of justice on an application to extend time: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [32] and [33].
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the Applicant made it clear that grounds 2 – 16 were, in essence, particulars of the ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive (ground 1). He accepted that establishing any individual ground would not of itself lead to the appeal being upheld. It was the cumulative effect of the matters in grounds 2 – 16 that were said to produce the result that the sentence was manifestly excessive and in that way that the Applicant was not sentenced according to law (ground 17).
	
	
	During the course of addressing each of the grounds counsel abandoned reliance on grounds 4, 13 and 15. Although ground 16 was a ground that asserted a denial of procedural fairness, a ground that could not be regarded as a particular of a manifestly excessive sentence, nothing was said in oral or written submissions about it.
	


Grounds 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 – factual findings


	
	These findings were amply open to the Sentencing Judge when regard is had to both the Agreed Facts and the Victim Impact Statement. The Victim Impact Statement was not challenged in any way. The fact that some of the findings could be made in any case involving similar offending provides no basis for objection to them when they were not taken into account as aggravating factors by the Sentencing Judge. In addition, this Court has said in a number of cases that psychological and emotional damage to children from sexual abuse can be assumed: R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8 at [56]; R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56; (2014) 239 A Crim R 469 at [110]; R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 at [49].
	


Ground 8 – ‘generic” finding as an aggravating factor


	
	The ground as framed wrongly describes the finding made by the Sentencing Judge. It is not that the attentions were “painful and causative of harm” which was said to be the aggravating feature but rather the repetition of the offending behaviour over the years when there was evidence from the beginning that his attentions were unwanted, painful and causative of harm. Further, the factors listed in s 21A(2) do not comprise an exclusive list of aggravating factors that may be taken into account: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168.
	


Ground 9 – offences in the home of the victim


	
	The Applicant’s written submissions in relation to this ground said that there was nothing further to add to the ground as expressed. Reliance might have been, but was not, placed on the line of authorities generally commencing with R v Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125. The principle was succinctly expressed by McClellan CJ at CL (with whom James and Davies JJ agreed) in Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [112] where his Honour said that it will be an aggravating circumstance when a victim is assaulted in his or her own home by an unauthorised intruder but it is otherwise when the offender is lawfully on the premises.
	
	
	Although a number of cases have followed Ingham some doubt has been recently cast on the principle by RA Hulme J in Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 at [44] (with Simpson J agreeing at [1]-[2] and Price J agreeing at [3]); see also the discussion by Wilson J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and RA Hulme J agreed) in Aktar v R  [2015] NSWCCA 123 at [45]-[63].
	
	
	Although I was a member of the Court in Ingham I am now of the opinion, in the light what has been said in Melbom and Aktar that the view expressed in Ingham may be a too restrictive view of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), and the issue should be revisited. However, the present is not an appropriate case in which to do that for two reasons. First, although the Crown provided lengthy and useful submissions on the point, no assistance was provided by counsel for the Applicant, presumably because the ground is said only to be a particular of a ground relating to manifest excess. Secondly, the disagreement with Ingham and Comert and the cases which have followed them would require a bench of five judges to resolve the competing views.
	
	
	On the present state of the law (Ingham and the cases which have followed it) I consider that the Sentencing Judge’s finding that it was an aggravating factor that the offence took place in the home is an error. The Sentencing Judge sought to distinguish Ingham in this way. His Honour said this:
	


I agree that the demonstrated criminality is of a high order. In Ingham [2011] NSWCCA 88, it was stated that the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(EV scil. eb), did not operate in those circumstances. That case involved many counts of sexual depredation, most of which occurred in a domestic environment, but in circumstances which are quite different to the matters before me. Whilst I accept that what was said by McClellan CJ at CL para 111 is binding on me, I do not see the two cases as similar in any way or indeed, similar to the authorities referred to by his Honour in that paragraph. It seems to me that where an offender uses the family home, where he may well be entitled to be, as a means of committing the offences in question, then that does become an aggravating feature. Looked at logically, on the one hand, the victim is supposed to feel secure, safe and in a loving and supportive environment in the family home, in a haven where no malicious harm can come to her. Whereas on the other hand, we have an offender who takes advantage of that very situation in order to commit the offences for which he is charged. That must suggest that such a breach of the sanctity of the home, is an aggravating factor. It is understandable that an unpremeditated assault by one partner on another partner, in the family home, may not be aggravated because it occurs within the family home. But that is a far different situation to the present one where the home becomes the means by which the offending occurs. In those circumstances it seems to me the fact that it occurred in the home, can be regarded as an aggravating factor.


	
	The problem with that analysis is that Ingham concerned an offender who stayed in the house of one of the victims because of his friendship with that victim’s mother. The offending took place in that house which was not the offender’s house. The present is a relevantly stronger case because the house where the present offending took place was also the house of the Applicant, unlike in Ingham. What the Sentencing Judge said of the use of the house by the Applicant was equally applicable, and the more so, to the offender in Ingham. Yet this Court held that offending in the house was not an aggravating factor.
	
	
	Despite Counsel for the Applicant’s submission that each of the grounds was a mere particular of a manifestly excessive sentence, the Sentencing Judge’s holding that offending in the victim’s home was an aggravating factor is an error. The sentencing exercise thereby miscarried. The enquiry is not how that error influenced the sentence imposed. Rather, this Court must exercise the sentencing exercise afresh: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	


Ground 10 – taking into account the termination of the pregnancy


	
	This finding was self-evidently true. The use of the word “assault” is not to be understood in any technical or legal sense, and there is no basis for the assertion that the reference to the termination of the pregnancy in this way amounted to the taking into account of an uncharged criminal offence.
	


Ground 11 – good character


	
	The Applicant submitted that although good character does not have the force that it can in other matters it should have been taken into account by the Sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge said this:
	


Mr Erazo has no criminal record, but that does little to assist him in the present case. Whilst I am satisfied he did not use his prior good character to assist him to commit the offences as per s 21 (5A), any sort of good character

he had at the beginning of his offending in this case, was totally dissipated by his continued offending over many years.


	
	The way good character is to be employed in sentencing was discussed by the High Court in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267.
	
	
	In Ryan, the appellant had committed more than 50 offences against young boys over a 20 year period. The sentencing judge found that, apart from the offending charged, the appellant was a man of unblemished character and reputation. Nevertheless, he held that the appellant was not entitled thereby to any leniency whatsoever. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld that approach.
	
	
	In the High Court McHugh J said at [36]:
	


In considering a prisoner's good character when sentencing, the court must distinguish two logically distinct stages. First, it must determine whether the prisoner is of otherwise good character. In making this assessment, the sentencing judge must not consider the offences for which the prisoner is being sentenced. Second, if a prisoner is of otherwise good character, the sentencing judge must take that fact into account. However, the weight that must be given to the prisoner's otherwise good character will vary according to all of the circumstances of the case.

See also Kirby J at [112] and Callinan J at [178].


	
	The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge had acted in accordance with what was said in Ryan by having regard to and considering the issue of good character although concluding that it was totally dissipated by the continued offending. I do not consider that that submission should be accepted. In Ryan there was continued offending over a 20 year period. In the present case there was offending from 2000 to 2005. The first of the offences charged was the first occasion on which the Applicant offended against his stepdaughter. His otherwise good character prior to that offending should have been a mitigating factor at least to a small extent.
	
	
	Again, although this matter was submitted only to be a particular of a manifestly excessive sentence, error is demonstrated.
	


Ground 12 – discounts for pleas and remorse


	
	The Applicant submitted that his Honour’s sentencing Remarks were limited “to finding more than 10% at page 11.6 [of his Remarks] but given the sentence handed down this could not have been taken into account”. The Applicant submitted that the failure to state the actual discount for the plea and for the remorse shows that either insufficient weight or no weight was given to those matters.
	
	
	At page 11 of his Remarks the Sentencing Judge said:
	


I accept that he has expressed contrition and remorse, both in Court to the victim, to Mr Pusey (sic) and by way of the plea of guilty.

There was no finding of any percentage at that stage of the Remarks. On page 14 of the Remarks his Honour said:

These indicative sentences take into account the plea of guilty and the Form 1 matters, allowing a discount in the order of 12% for the plea of guilty.


	
	No quantified discount should be allowed for remorse by itself or combined with the plea of guilty: R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159. Contrary to the submission of the Applicant his Honour quantified the discount for the plea of guilty at 12%.
	


Ground 14 – specific deterrence


	
	The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge’s finding in relation to specific deterrence flies in the face of the Applicant’s “realisation of his culpability”, in his own evidence of wishing to do courses and undergo counselling so as not to fall into similar behaviour again, his apology, his statements to Dr Pusey as well as his low risk of recidivism.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge said in relation to specific deterrence:
	


It also seems to me that there needs to be a substantial element of specific deterrence, given the failure by the prisoner over many years to recognise that his behaviour was fundamentally wrong.


	
	The matters identified by the Applicant do not lead to the conclusion that specific deterrence was not a significant consideration in the matter. Although Dr Pusey said that the Applicant presented with a low risk of recidivism he went on to say:
	


Despite this, he presents with clear factors which have likely influenced his offending behaviour and which in my view should form the basis of any treatment intervention mandated by the court.

Those factors are likely to be what Dr Pusey had earlier referred to, namely that he demonstrated a degree of impulsivity, a lack of adherence to social standards and that he was likely to engage in rationalisations which supported his behaviours.


	
	The other matter suggesting the significance of specific deterrence was the fact that he was arrested in 2003 after the victim’s mother caught him and confronted him. The only reason he was not ultimately prosecuted was because the victim was persuaded not to make a statement. Where, notwithstanding that experience, he continued to offend, and where in any event the offending had occurred over a five year period, specific deterrence assumed considerable significance notwithstanding stated intentions of the Applicant to do something about his problems.
	


Ground 16 – procedural fairness


	
	As noted earlier, no written or oral submissions were made in support of this ground. It is difficult to understand its basis. The particular findings (presumably grounds 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and, subject to what has earlier been said concerning the topic, 9) were all clearly open to the sentencing judge on the basis of the agreed facts, the Victim Impact Statement or as a matter of inference and/or knowledge from that material. It cannot be said that the Applicant’s counsel at the hearing was not on notice that such findings were available to be made.
	


Ground 1 – manifestly excessive sentence


	
	Since error has been demonstrated in relation to grounds 9 and 11 it is not necessary to consider whether the sentence is manifestly excessive. Rather, the Applicant’s submissions in relation to this ground will be considered on the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	


Re-sentence


	
	The Applicant submitted that an examination of the statistics in respect of offences against s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) show that the sentence imposed was one of the highest imposed in New South Wales including for cases where there were pleas of not guilty. The submission should be taken to be one that this Court should impose a lesser sentence than the Sentencing Judge imposed.
	
	
	This Court has said in a number of cases that the statistics offer no guidance about the propriety of an aggregate sentence: Tweedie v R [2015] NSWCCA 71 at [47]; Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222 at [88]; AG v R [2016] NSWCCA 102 at [92]. Rather than reliance on statistics, two significant starting points in respect of any sentence are the maximum penalty provided as well as any standard non-parole period. Each of the offences carried a 20 year maximum penalty. Four of the offences (those committed from 2003 onwards) carried a standard non-parole period of ten years. Three of the offences on the Form 1 carried a 20 year maximum and two of them had a standard non-parole period of ten years.
	
	
	As the sentencing judge found, the offending demonstrated criminality of a high order. Two matters in particular are significant. The first has already been mentioned. The Applicant was arrested in 2003 and only escaped charges being brought against him because the victim was persuaded not to make a statement. Despite that warning the Applicant continued to offend. Secondly, the last offence and the last occasion of the offending where the Applicant was subjected to painful anal intercourse and became pregnant as a result of the vaginal intercourse that followed immediately thereafter resulting in her having a termination of the pregnancy was offending of a very high order.
	
	
	The findings of the Sentencing Judge concerning the Applicant’s subjective matters are accepted. Nothing in Dr Pusey’s report explained the offending although the Applicant saw a link between his alcohol consumption and the offending. He did not, however, blame the offending on alcohol as he reiterated in his evidence at the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	The evidence suggested that the Applicant was a person of prior good character. However, since the offending was persistent over the five year period that prior good character counts for very little in the synthesis of considerations relevant to the appropriate sentence. Although his prospects of reoffending are low there are concerns arising from the matters in Dr Pusey’s report referred to above at [31] and [59].
	
	
	I do not consider it necessary to deal further with matters relevant to an appropriate sentence. I consider that no lesser sentence than that imposed by the Sentencing Judge should be imposed notwithstanding the two relatively minor errors his Honour made. Even allowing for pleas of guilty an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period equal to the standard non-parole period for one such offence can only be regarded as a very lenient sentence. This was a shocking course of offending that required condign punishment. No basis whatever has been shown for any lesser sentence than that imposed.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the light of the two errors demonstrated an extension of time should be granted and leave to appeal given notwithstanding that the appeal will be dismissed because no lesser sentenced is warranted.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Extend time for the application for leave to appeal to 21 January, 2016;
	
	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	R S HULME AJ:   I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J and, apart from his Honour’s discussion of Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 and Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 which I do not need to canvass, and the matters referred to in the immediately succeeding paragraph, with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	Although the complainant was going through puberty and a teenager through much of the time that the Applicant was abusing her and it is common knowledge that many people experience difficulties at those times, there was no evidence that would justify the somewhat emotive statements that the complainant was “battling” with puberty and that her teenage years were, except in consequence of the Applicant’s treatment of her, “traumatic”. To this extent I would accordingly uphold grounds 5 and 7.
	
	
	However, as counsel for the Applicant remarked, the only substantive ground of appeal is that the sentence imposed in the District Court is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	It is not. It is manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Davies J has detailed the six indicative sentences specified by his Honour. Two were of 13 years including non-parole periods of 9 years. Two were of 10 years including non-parole periods of 7 years. Two of 9 years including non-parole periods of 6 years.
	
	
	How his Honour could have progressed from those six indicative sentences, none of which could sensibly be suggested to be excessive, to the sentence he imposed of 14 years including a non-parole period of 10 years, he did not explain. No rational explanation is apparent.
	
	
	Aggregate sentencing was introduced to avoid the complexity of judges having to specify multiple start and finish dates of a number of sentences. It was not introduced to enable judges to avoid the imposition of sentences that properly reflect criminality, aggregation, and totality. In that connection, it is apposite, though it should be unnecessary, to repeat what this Court said in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 at [44] – [46]:
	


Implementation of the principle of totality is perhaps the most common circumstance where concurrency of sentences is justified. However it is important that that principle be properly understood and applied. Perhaps the leading statement of it is an extract from D A Thomas, ""Principles of Sentencing"" endorsed in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR at 59 at 63:-

""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is 'just and appropriate'.""

Two points may be made. Firstly, the principle is expressed in terms of coming back from the result of a simple aggregation. Secondly, if each individual sentence is appropriate for the criminality of the offence to which it relates, prima facie additional criminality requires an increase in sentence. Obviously the totality principle imposes limits to that last proposition but those limits will rarely if ever go so far as to justify wholly concurrent sentences for all of a series of offences such as those here. Subject to those limits, in general, sentences significantly cumulative should be imposed for separate serious offences of which those here are all examples.

In this connection the Court endorses the remarks of Sully J, though as a member of a two judge bench, in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34. At [36] - [37] his Honour said:-

""... (There) is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose.

It needs to be clearly understood by all concerned that a person who commits a deliberate series of discrete offences, - and the present applicant's case, is a good example of the kind, - he must not be left with the idea that by intoning references to the principle of totality as though it were some magic mantra, he can escape effective punishment for the offences which follow successively one upon another throughout the whole course of a studied and deliberate course of criminal behaviour.""
