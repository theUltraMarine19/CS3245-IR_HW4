2761616,R v Steele; R v Mahoney [2013] NSWDC 288,"SENTENCE

1I am sentencing Mitchell Mahoney and William Steele for their parts in a housebreaking and theft which occurred on 14 February 2012. I will first set out very briefly what happened then I will say something about each of the offenders. I will then look at the arguments for the prosecution and the defence and finally I will sentence each of them.

2What happened is set out in a document which has been agreed between the prosecution and the defence. A home was broken into in Kingsford during the day on 14 February 2012. It was broken into by Mr Mahoney. He stole from the home an X-Box console and games, jewellery, watches, cologne, foreign and local currency. He was then seen shortly afterwards in a car. He was seen to get out of a car and hide something. The number plate of the car was identified as belonging to his co offender, William Steele. Mr Mahoney got away as did Mr Steele, who was apparently driving the car. 

3The police investigation showed that Mr Mahoney's details matched the break in and both he and Mr Steele were arrested. Everything was recovered except for $1000 in Australian currency and an iPod. 

4As a result of that activity Mr Mahoney was charged with the offence of break, enter and steal. That is a crime against s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards the crime as very serious and has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to the offence. I should add that Mr Mahoney was arrested about two weeks later. 

5Mr Steele, on the other hand, although charged and committed for a similar offence, eventually pleaded guilty to the crime of accessory after the fact to break, enter and steal. That carries a maximum of 5 years imprisonment. He had spent about 2 days in custody before being bailed. 

6I formally convict each man of those offences that they have pleaded guilty to. I should have added that Mr Mahoney also pleaded guilty to the crime that he was charged with.

7I should now say something about the background of each man. Mr Mahoney is still only 23 years of age, whereas Mr Steele is 51. Both men have criminal records. Mr Mahoney's criminal record started when he was a teenager and the Children's Court dealt with him regularly for assaults and burglary and trespassing offences. His first offence as an adult was committed when he was only about 18½ and he was sent to gaol for 9 months for yet another burglary and possession of house breaking implements. In fact he committed two of those offences. He came before the Local Courts again but was dealt with more leniently for a receiving property. He was given a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and then for another receiving property and another attempted burglary and goods in custody he received a series of intensive correction orders from the Local Court. One of the intensive correction orders was imposed after the bond (under s 9) had been revoked. 

8Mr Mahoney's criminal activity is explained but not excused by what is described in a pre-sentence report as ""a long history of substance abuse from the age of 15 years, particularly in relation to heroin use"". Apparently at its peak he was using about three grams a day which cost about $1000 every day. At present he is on the methadone program and is bail refused in custody. 

9Mr D Price, the counsel who appeared for Mr Mahoney, called his client to give evidence. Whilst he was in custody bail refused there was an incident. He was in a fight with another inmate and as a result he was bitten on the face which has left him with a noticeable scar. He expressed remorse for the crime which he had committed. He acknowledged that he had opportunities to use heroin in custody but has declined and is maintaining his place on the methadone program. His relationships with his parents are strained. In his father's case he has only met him a few times. But he has a good relationship with an aunt and she provides him with support and encouragement. He also has a partner, [name], with whom he shares two children, a 15 month old boy and a 6 year old girl. She is still supporting him personally but has indicated that she is not prepared to tolerate his criminal behaviour any longer. 

10This is probably his last chance. He broke his leg at one stage and was bedridden for five months. He says that he is committed to remaining drug free when he is released from gaol. He says that he was encouraged by speaking with the officer who assessed him for the intensive correction order and his experience in prison has led him to form the view that he does not want to be in there as a 50 year old. He wants to get on with his life, support his wife and children with a job and put his drug addiction, which he acknowledges he will have for the rest of his life, behind him as a practising addict.

11The pre-sentence report noted his ongoing issues with prohibited drugs and observed that Mr Mahoney would benefit from participation in further interventions regarding this and thought that he would be suitable for a medium level of intervention and support through that service. An updated report noted that he took responsibility for the offence which he did when he gave evidence and noted that he ""appears to be motivated to address his addiction"". 

12What Mr D Laird - who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions - observed, of course, is that he committed this offence when he was on the good behaviour bond and on bail. I need to take those factors into account in sentencing him. 

13Mr Price tendered a letter from his client's partner, [name], who expressed her support for Mr Mahoney and thought that his participation in an intensive correction order ""would play a major role in his rehabilitation"". She said the he has support from his family and from her. 

14Mr Steele also has a long history of criminal offending. His record is much longer than Mr Mahoney's because Mr Steele is now 51. He has been addicted to prohibited drugs since his teenage years. He started off with offences dealt with by the Children's Court and then was sentenced by adult courts both in this State and in Queensland for drug related offending and offences involving fraud and assault and stolen property. He has received a range of sentencing options including full time gaol, good behaviour bonds, home detention and suspended sentences. 

15There is a pre-sentence report in respect of Mr Steele which notes that his association with the Probation and Parole Service dates back to 1979. It noted that he lives with his partner of nearly 30 years who still supports him. It noted his very long history of drug dependence, with his drug of choice being heroin. The author thought that he would be suitable for a medium to high level of supervision, although the report expressed the view that he was unsuitable for community service. A later report from the same Probation and Parole officer, Simon West, noted an up to date doctor's report and as a result of that he was assessed as now suitable for undertaking community service work. 

16Mr Marr, who appeared for Mr Steele, tendered a report from the forensic psychologist, Tim Watson Munro. Mr Watson Munro diagnosed a major depression and, not surprisingly, a poly substance abuse disorder. He also noted that Mr Steele is suffering from an anxiety disorder. He thought that Mr Steele had not had any consistent therapy over the years and expressed the view that Mr Steele would benefit from cognitive behaviour therapy focused on various aspects of his behaviour. He noted that he had started using heroin at the age of 12. He used some other substances which is what prompted the diagnosis of poly substance disorder. Mr Watson Munro agreed with a report from a GP which expressed the opinion that Mr Steele's ""mental state and mental capacity will definitely be clouded by his problems"". His ability to function normally in the community will be compromised. 

17Mr Marr also tendered material which indicated that Mr Steele had had a back and shoulder injury as a result of an accident and noted an epilepsy problem as well. He also tendered some correspondence which indicated that Mr Steele had offered to plead guilty to the offence which he has now been convicted of at a much earlier stage but that offer was rejected by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

18So far as Mr Mahoney is concerned, his plea of guilty was late and Mr Laird suggested that a discount in the range of 5 to 10% would be generous. Mr Laird realistically observed that, given the length of Mr Mahoney's drug history, he needs supervision on parole. Mr Laird fairly acknowledged that the nature of the offence would be in the lower half of the range of seriousness for burglaries. I agree with that assessment. Most of the property was recovered. Mr Laird indicated that Mr Mahoney obviously needs a good deal of time on parole. 

19There is a complication brought about by the fact that when Mr Mahoney received a series of intensive correction orders it is not known whether the Magistrate took into account, at the time that she imposed those orders, the fact that he had spent a good deal of time in custody, bail refused, in respect of this offence. Mr Price indicated that her Honour noted the history but did not expressly say that she had taken it into account. Both lawyers acknowledge that Mr Mahoney has spent enough time in custody and should be released but spend some time on parole. 

20Mr Price argued that there were special circumstances for adjusting the normal relationship between a non-parole period and the full sentence. Normally a non-parole period is three quarters of the full sentence. Mr Price pointed to his client's age and his young family as well as the need for him to deal with his addiction and the injury he received in custody. Mr Price also realistically acknowledged that the plea of guilty was entered at a time that should not attract more than 10% discount. 

21I think this is a case where I need to impose a custodial sentence. The maximum fixed by Parliament for this crime is 14 years imprisonment. The sentence I have in mind is one of 2½ years imprisonment. I would discount that by 5% for his plea of guilty but round that discount up to 2 months, so that I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 28 months imprisonment. A sentence of 28 months imprisonment would normally have a non parole period of 21 months but in this case I would reduce it to 14 months or whatever the period of time is that Mr Mahoney has spent in custody.

22So far as Mr Steele is concerned, Mr Laird fairly and frankly acknowledged that this was not a case which should attract a sentence of full time custody. Mr Steele's role was no more than to pick up Mr Mahoney and to drive him away. Mr Laird argued that a community service order was not appropriate because of Mr Steele's physical health issues and the need for him to be limited to light work. A community service order could be further frustrated. On the other hand Mr Marr argued that Mr West, the Probation and Parole officer who revised his assessment about the community service order, knows Mr Steele well and in fact had made inquiries and had found a place suitable for light work. Mr Marr argued that a community service order would keep his client occupied and would be therapeutic for him. 

23I think Mr Marr has a point and I propose in due course to fix a community service order. I take into account the fact that he was prepared to plead guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I would regard an appropriate sentence as one being of 150 hours community service.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Laird, Mr Price, do we know how long Mr Mahoney has been in custody? Because that's the non-parole period, we need the days.
LAIRD: My instructing solicitor has dealt with it as 447 days your Honour. My friend says 5 April 2012 backdated another 34 days. He was taken back into custody on 15 April.
HIS HONOUR: You two work it out. In the meantime I will sentence Mr Steele.

24In respect of Mr Steele, if you would stand up Mr Steele, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment I make a community service order directing you to perform community service for 150 hours.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Marr I will just look at Pt 7.
MARR: I think he has to report to the city district office within 7 days.

25I should add that I am satisfied with the matters set out in s 86 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

HIS HONOUR: Any conditions Mr Marr? I notice that s 90 provides that I can impose conditions for a community service order. I don't know whether you and Mr Laird would recommend conditions or not:

""the conditions may require an offender to participate in development programs and may require the offender to undergo testing or assessment for alcohol or drug use""

LAIRD: I am not asking for anything like that your Honour.
MARR: No your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: I think that's the CSO - Mr Steele has been around for long enough to know that he's just got to go and cut out the hours and I think to require some testing is going to set him up for another breach.
LAIRD: I think just leave it in the hands of the Probation and Parole Service who have to deal with him. They'll set out the terms of the order that they want from him.
HIS HONOUR: That makes sense Mr Marr.
MARR: Yes your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: All I do is make a community service order. And you say I've got to tell him to report somewhere.
LAIRD: Yes your Honour, on the updated pre-sentence report he should report to the Community Service or the organiser at the city district office within 7 days.

26I direct Mr Steele to report to the Community Service organiser at the city district office of the Probation and Parole Service on or before next Friday 7 June 2013.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Steele, so you have got 150 hours of community service, you understand that?
OFFENDER STEELE: Yes your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: You know Simon West, by the sounds of it. 
OFFENDER STEELE: I do know the location where the Wentworth offices are.
HIS HONOUR: You do, good. And Mr West has dealt with you before.
OFFENDER STEELE: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Now, it is up to you. You have been in enough Courts to know what to do and how to do it and to manage your life as best as you can. The idea is to stay out of gaol. You know that if you breach you are at risk of going back into gaol which you do not want to do and you have just got to do your best to complete those hours. Let Mr West help you. Good luck.
OFFENDER STEELE: Thank you your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Price, what's happening?
PRICE: Our calculation, if your Honour wants days is 447 days.
HIS HONOUR: 447 days?
PRICE: That equates to just under 15 months. So if your Honour just backdates it 14 months from today your Honour will be well within that range. If your Honour wants the exact days that he has been in custody as of today, our calculation is 447 days, which is more than 14 months but just under 15 months.
HIS HONOUR: So if I back date it 14 months and give him a 28 month sentence, that means some of the time has not been taken into account.
PRICE: But only a matter of 20 days. And so it gives a good leeway if there's any error in my instructing solicitor's mathematics.
HIS HONOUR: If you are saying that that's okay? 
PRICE: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Because I normally should take into account time served.
PRICE: That could possibly have been what was in Magistrate Huber's mind, I don't know. I don't think it really makes any difference, bearing in mind there was a bit of give and take in relation to that. But it allows any margin for error.
LAIRD: I don't have a problem with that your Honour.

27I am going to sentence you now Mr Mahoney. I set a non-parole period of 14 months for your sentence commencing 31 March 2012 and expiring yesterday 30 May 2013. The balance of the term will be 14 months commencing today, 31 May 2013, expiring on 30 July 2014. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I make an order directing your release on parole today. Conditions of parole I have to fix because of the sentence being less than 3 years. Conditions of parole are these:
(1)That the offender be of good behaviour.
(2)That he notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address.
(3)That he attend Court if he receives a notice to do so.
(4)That he accept supervision from the Probation and Parole Service and all reasonable recommendations and directions by that Service, particularly regarding unresolved illicit drug issues and vocational skills.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Mahoney, as you know, as well as I do, it is over to you now. I have, as Mr Price suggested and as Mr Laird fairly acknowledged, you have done your time in custody, it is 14 months up to today. You are under sentence for another 14 months until the 30 July next year. You are still under sentence and you are on parole and I have fixed your parole at 14 months. There are obvious conditions, you have got to stay out of trouble. If you change your address you have got to write to the Court and tell them and if you get a notice in the mail telling you to turn up, you turn up, you do not have the police and the sheriff chasing after you. But the most important one is that you allow Probation and Parole to supervise you and the two areas are your illicit drug use, which has obviously been a problem for a long time in your short life, and getting yourself a job. That is going to be important. Have you ever had a job?
OFFENDER MAHONEY: No.
HIS HONOUR: No. Look you have got to let them help you with that. You are still a young man. Let them train you, they know what they are doing, or let them organise or give you advice about training. It's in your hands. Your partner has been very supportive. You have got your aunt. They are behind you. But if you mess up again and come back before me I have very little option but to just send you back into gaol, revoke your parole, or the Parole Authority will and you will be back into gaol. This is your chance. If you do not want to be sitting around in the yard when you are aged 50 then just stick to letting other people help you, particularly those that know what they are doing and they will help you. All right.
OFFENDER MAHONEY: Thank you your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Good luck.
LAIRD: I'm sorry your Honour. In relation to the Probation and Parole Service you have got to specify that he has to turn up within a specified time.
HIS HONOUR: Yes. Which one Mr Price?
PRICE: In the city, Wentworth Avenue, your Honour.

28Mr Mahoney is to attend the Probation and Parole Service at Wentworth Avenue, before next Friday 7 June 2013.

LAIRD: Then whatever the ICO orders will then be brought into effect and he'll be bound by those.
HIS HONOUR: Yes. I forgot the ICO, that is hopefully going to come into force and that is going to be restrictive and that's the idea, for what you have done, but at the same time they are going to help you get your life back on track. So you have got to put up with the inconvenience because that is the price you are paying. But you have got to let them help you. It is up to you. I cannot do anything more than what I have done and if you want to enjoy your life with your partner and your children from now on, there is plenty of time to turn it around and now is the time.

2761617,R v Lockett [2013] NSWSC 860,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Smith makes an application that a verdict of not guilty should be directed. He submits that there is no evidence that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased. The submission is that the Crown cannot prove that the accused deliberately discharged the firearm, and, in a case where the sole cause of death is that discharge, the case must fail. 

2The accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge that he on 12 October 2010 at Mt Pritchard in the State of New South Wales did murder Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez. In order for the jury to find the accused guilty of the charge, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt all of the following essential legal elements: 

(1)it was the deliberate act (or acts) of the accused that caused the death of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez; and 

(2)the act (or acts) causing death were done with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. 

3The test to be applied in a no prima facie case submission is that referred to in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1991) 171 CLR 207 in the joint judgment of the High Court where it was said at 212:

""The question whether a trial judge may direct a jury to return a 
verdict of not guilty if, in his or her opinion, a guilty verdict would be unsafe or unsatisfactory was adverted to but left unanswered in Whitehall v The Queen. There is no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct such a verdict if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict."" (citations omitted) 


4Further, at 214:

""It follows that if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague), which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty."" 

5The Crown case must be taken at its highest and it is for the jury, not the judge, to resolve conflicts of evidence: see Doney at 215. 

6Furthermore, it is not sufficient to find that a conviction would be unreasonable within the statutory formula for criminal appeals found in s 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

7For the purpose of the application, the accused accepts there is clear evidence that the accused struck the deceased to the head with the firearm. Rhiannon Knaggs and Ashley Riddell say that occurred once. Ms Psaroudis said it occurred a couple of times. There is a deal of evidence that the firearm discharged when the deceased was struck with it. 

8Mr Smith submits that there is no evidence that the accused knew that the object with which he struck the deceased was a loaded firearm. He contends that the act which killed the deceased was the discharge of the firearm and not the use of it to hit the head of the deceased. 

9He argues that the discharge of the firearm was not voluntary and in that sense the discharge of the firearm was unwilled and not a deliberate act of the accused. 

10Mr Smith cited what was said by the Chief Justice in Ryan v The Queen (1967) 121 CLR 205 at 218, where the Chief Justice said:

""For if the presentation of the gun which subsequently discharged without the willed act of the applicant is to be chosen, a question of causation is involved. That presentation in the setting of its circumstances must cause the death. It seems to me that it could only be held to do so if the unwilled discharge of the gun ought to have been in the contemplation of the applicant at the time...""


11On the other hand, it is the Crown case that it was the deliberate act of the accused, in hitting the deceased on the head with the shotgun, that caused the death of the deceased. 

12It is well established that there must be a causal relationship between the doing of an act by the accused and the death of Mr Ruiz-Sanchez. The direct cause of his death was the discharge of the firearm which, taken at its highest, the evidence does not establish that the accused deliberately discharged that firearm, nor is there evidence that the accused ought to have contemplated that the firearm would discharge. 

13However, as Brennan J observed in Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; (1991) 172 CLR 378 at 398: 

""The basic proposition relating to causation in homicide is that the accused's conduct, whether by act or omission, must contribute significantly to the death of the victim. It need not be the sole, direct or immediate cause of death..."" (citations omitted)


14The question of the cause of the deceased's death is to be determined by the jury in a common sense way. In my view, taking the Crown case at its highest, the jury could capably conclude: 

(1)that the accused deliberately hit the deceased on the head with the firearm;

(2) that, although that deliberate act was not the direct or immediate cause of death, it made a substantial contribution to the death; 

(3) that at the time the accused hit the deceased on the head with the firearm, he had the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on him. 

15There is evidence, in my view, taking the Crown case at its highest, from which the jury could capably conclude that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused Mr Ruiz-Sanchez's death. 

16I reject the application.

		27 June 2013",2013-05-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761634,"R v MADDEN, Neil [2013] NSWSC 710","REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender, Neil Madden and another man, Stephen Perry, were charged with the murder of Daniel Sullivan at Lalor Park on 8 January 2011. The offender's plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the Crown in discharge of that indictment. He is guilty of manslaughter on the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act, that act being his throwing a quantity of methylated spirits onto the coat of the deceased and igniting it with a cigarette lighter.

2For his part in the incident, Stephen Perry pleaded guilty to concealing a serious offence and has been sentenced: R v PERRY, Steven William (a/k/a BABBAGE, Steven William) [2012] NSWSC 1645.

Facts

3I have an agreed set of facts. The offender had been living with a woman at Parramatta until 31 December 2010. He was a chronic alcoholic, who had for many years been homeless. His relationship with the woman ended on New Year's Eve, when she told him to leave her home. 

4He and his close friend, Stephen Perry, who was also a homeless alcoholic, then went to the home unit of the deceased at Lalor Park, where they stayed until the night of the offence. The deceased lived alone in what was a Housing Commission unit. He suffered serious ill health, malnutrition and alcoholism, and was reputed to have weighed about 35 kilograms at the time of his death. 

5While the offender and Perry were staying at the unit, they consumed large quantities of alcohol and reportedly some illicit drugs, mainly cannabis. The deceased, like the offender, was known to become aggressive or at least argumentative when intoxicated, and in the days before his death he told neighbours that he wanted the offender to leave. Arguments between the deceased, the offender and sometimes Perry were overheard by neighbours during that time.

6At about 10pm on 8 January 2011, neighbours heard arguing and loud voices coming from the deceased's unit. A neighbour below the unit heard loud voices from an argument shortly before hearing a thud on the floor, which she believed was not furniture falling, which she had earlier heard, but a person falling to the floor. A few moments later other neighbours observed that the unit was on fire and that the front door was closed. One of the neighbours tried unsuccessfully to open the door, believed it was locked, and kicked it in. He was unable to enter the unit because of the heat and flames that had engulfed the interior. 

7The body of the deceased was found, severely burned, on the floor of the living room adjacent to the lounge. The fire had indeed engulfed the unit, and the complex was severely damaged. Post-mortem examination was unable to establish a cause of death. However, the absence of inhaled soot, fire or heat injury to the trachea or lungs, and a normal carbon dioxide limit in the blood conveyed that the deceased had died before the fire took hold. The most likely mechanism of death is that he suffered some form of cardiac arrest upon, or immediately following, having been set on fire. 

8The offender's case was that he was woken by an argument between the deceased and Perry, which continued while he went to the toilet. Having left the toilet, he told the deceased to calm down. He then threw methylated spirits upon the deceased's coat and ignited it with a cigarette lighter. The deceased collapsed almost immediately after he had done so. The offender then left the apartment. At the time of the incident all three men were intoxicated, having been drinking almost continuously over the preceding days.

9Within minutes of the fire starting, a passer by saw and spoke briefly to a man who was standing near the letterboxes outside the unit complex. That man was Perry. He was joined a few moments later by another man, wearing only shorts and carrying some cloth, who said to him, ""Let's go."" That man was the offender.

10A little later, the offender was seen hiding in the garden of a house in a nearby street, and later still he flagged down and spoke to fire rescue officers in that street. At the time they were driving away from the scene of the fire, it having been brought under control. The offender returned to the vicinity of the units at about 12.20am, where he was spoken to by police before being treated by ambulance officers and conveyed to Westmead Hospital. He was in a distressed condition, having suffered full thickness burns to the right side of his body from his neck down to about his waist, and to his right arm. He had a minor burn on his left arm.

11He was subsequently taken to Concord Hospital Burns Unit, where he remained undergoing treatment until April 2011. The duration of his hospitalisation and treatment was extended by his non-compliance and his poor state of general health, resulting in skin grafts failing and requiring further grafts.

12The offender gave various different accounts of the events of that night to hospital staff, police, friends and acquaintances over the months following the incident. Some of those accounts were captured on telephone intercepts or by a listening device. A common theme of his accounts was that when he returned from going to the toilet he saw that the deceased had set himself alight and that he, the offender, tried to extinguish the flames unsuccessfully. He himself was burned and then left the unit.

13There was a disputed issue whether the offender suffered his burns in the course of an attempt to rescue Mr Sullivan from the conflagration. That was to be the subject of evidence, particularly expert evidence from a plastic surgeon who examined the offender at Concord Hospital. He claimed that he had returned to the unit when it was on fire and attempted to move the deceased out of it. However, he was unable to do so because of the intensity of the heat. The Crown prosecutor did not accept that he had suffered his burns in this way.

14In the event, the dispute did not need to be resolved. At the sentence proceedings the offender's counsel, Mr Dalton SC, said that his client did not recall at what stage of the events he had sustained his burns, and the proposition that he had suffered them in the course of a rescue attempt was not pressed. Nevertheless, he maintained that he had attempted to rescue the deceased at one point, and the Crown prosecutor acknowledged that he was unable to deny that. That is the basis upon which I approach the matter.

15It was common ground that the offence was attended by several aggravating features under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in that the offence involved the use of a chemical agent: par (ca), was committed in the home of the victim: par (eb), and, given that the fire in the unit threatened the whole building, was committed without regard for public safety: par (i). That said, the offence was plainly the result of the offender's level of intoxication which, without excusing his conduct, affords some explanation of it. Plainly enough, he did not intend to cause serious harm to the deceased, let alone kill him. 

16This tragic death was the result of the impulsive, foolish act of a drunken man. As I have said, I accept that he made some attempt to rescue the deceased, and it is appropriate to take into account in mitigation the fact that he himself suffered serious burns. The facts which I have recited record that he spent some months at Concord Hospital. However, he spent a further lengthy period at Long Bay Hospital, and the whole of his treatment for his burns extended over a period of some ten months. He is left with permanent scarring.

17The offender was 50 years old at the time of the crime, and is now 52. He has a sporadic criminal history, comprising a variety of offences dealt with summarily, which is of little or no significance for present purposes. His background is sketched in a helpful report of Mr Sam Borenstein, psychologist. There is no need to recount it in any detail. Mr Borenstein fairly described his life as ""tragic."" He is the only surviving member of his family. His parents died some years ago. He had five siblings. Of his three brothers, one died in a motor car accident, another of cirrhosis of the liver and another of acute methadone poisoning. His two sisters suicided. 

18He was educated to year 10 standard, and was employed for some years in the magazine publishing industry. He was married for 12 years, and the union produced two adult children. The marriage failed as a result of his excessive alcohol consumption, as did a number of short-lived relationships thereafter.

19To Mr Borenstein he frankly acknowledged that he is a chronic alcoholic. Attempts at abstinence had consistently failed, although he found that treatment by the drug Campral helped to control his tendency to drink to excess. He has a history of depression, and from time to time has been on antidepressant medication. He told Mr Borenstein that he would like to resume Campral treatment, building upon his enforced abstinence during his period in custody.

20Mr Borenstein described his prognosis as ""guarded."" He noted his social isolation. Indeed, it seems that the deceased and Mr Perry were counted among his very few friends. Mr Borenstein considered that he should be ""party to ongoing therapy, monitoring abstinence from alcohol and relapse prevention, and also instructing [him] in developing strategies to ensure he does not return to depressive episodes, during which he is more inclined to return to chronic alcoholism."" Mr Borenstein also wrote that he ""has suffered cumulative and significant losses, which contributes to his propensity towards depression which needs to be targeted in the context of counselling, focusing on grief work and resolving past losses."" 

21Mr Borenstein reported that he ""spoke fondly"" of the deceased, and ""appeared genuinely grief stricken and remorseful with regards to the circumstances of his friend's death."" I do not doubt that that is so, and I am not dissuaded from that view by the fact that in the period after the incident he sought to deflect responsibility for it from himself. 

22None of this is to deny the seriousness of the offender's crime, or the tragic consequences of it. Nevertheless, there are mitigating factors properly to be taken into account in his favour. I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable, and that it is unlikely that he would re-offend in any serious way. He will need support and supervision upon his release for the reasons identified by Mr Borenstein and, to that end, I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 

23He has been in custody since his arrest on 28 March 2011. I recognise the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty by a reduction of 15% of the sentence I otherwise would have imposed. But for the plea, I consider that a sentence of imprisonment for 8 years would be appropriate. The reduction leads to a sentence, in round figures, of 7 years. Finding special circumstances, but being mindful of the need for a minimum term to reflect his criminality, I shall set a non-parole period of 4 years. Accordingly, he will be eligible for release on parole on 27 March 2015, and the sentence will expire in its entirety on 27 March 2018. 

24Neil Madden, for the manslaughter of Daniel Sullivan you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing on 28 March 2011 and expiring on 27 March 2015, and a balance of term of 3 years, commencing on 28 March 2015 and expiring on 27 March 2018.

2761640,Honeysett v R [2013] NSWCCA 135,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  Late on 17 September 2008, after closing time, three armed men entered the Narrabeen Sands Hotel, confronted the three employees present and robbed the business of $4,800 in cash.  One offender (referred to in this judgment as the ""First Offender"") carried a pink-handled hammer, another a shortened shotgun and the third ""something long"".  Each offender was wearing dark clothes with ""a white pillow or T-shirt wrapped around his head"".  They fled in what was later alleged to have been a stolen Audi RS 4 vehicle which bore separately stolen number plates.
2Subsequently the appellant was charged with armed robbery contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, it being alleged that he was the First Offender.  After a plea of not guilty and a trial before a jury, he was convicted of the offence charged.  He appeals against his conviction on the following grounds:
""Ground 1
His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of Professor Henneberg to the effect that the appellant was similar in appearance to one of the offenders
Ground 2
The verdict of the jury was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence"".
3Before considering these grounds of appeal, it is necessary to give the following summary of the presently relevant evidence at the trial.
EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL
The hotel employees
4Ms Sarah Copperwheat, the manager of the hotel, described the First Offender as follows:
""He was quite thin, tall, probably about 6' or so, thinnish guy, brown eyes, was kind of brown around the eyes as well so I wouldn't say he's not like a white looking guy but yeah"".
5She thought that he was the offender who ""had the jumper around his head"" and that he ""wasn't an old, old looking guy"". 
6Mr Matthew Sim, a barman at the hotel, described the First Offender as having ""some sort of accent that wasn't solely Australian"" (""maybe Middle-Eastern""), ""with a white pillow case or a T-shirt wrapped around his head"" and ""dark skin, dark eyebrows"" (""he looked Indian or ... "").  He saw the offenders leave after the robbery in a dark silver car that he recognised by the sound of its engine to be an Audi RS 4.  He had had experience with motor vehicles that he said enabled him to do this.
7Mr Silionel Nadureira, head of security at the hotel, said that the First offender had ""like a white T-shirt over his hair"" and that his skin colouring was ""dark"".  He said that he ""wasn't like a big guy.  He was, you know, I reckon five two - he was like just normal size"".  Mr Nadureira is six foot four inches tall and said that the first offender was ""shorter, a lot shorter"".  He said that the offenders fled in a dark coloured sedan.
The get-away car
8Senior Constable Christopher Papallo, after being given notice by radio of the robbery, engaged for a period in a high speed chase of an Audi sedan, thought to be the get-away vehicle.  It bore the number plate AZF16B.  Constable Brendan Allen also gave chase to the same vehicle, as did Senior Constable Michael Haley.  They were in separate vehicles.
9On 25 November 2008 police officers recovered a grey Audi RS 4 vehicle.  It had an engine number that identified it as a vehicle stolen from Mr Michael Curtin's home on 14 September 2008.  Mr Curtin's number plates for the vehicle, XXX77Z, were found inside it.
10The number plates displayed on the vehicle chased by police on the night of 17 September 2008 were proved to have been stolen from a vehicle owned by Mr Barry Knight on the night of 16 September 2008, the night before the robbery, but were not recovered on 25 November 2008 or otherwise.
11During the chase of the Audi sedan by Senior Constable Haley, a speed camera took a photo of it (Exhibit F), revealing that a person was sitting in the passenger seat with white material wrapped around his or her head. 
12Evidence was also given that only one Audi RS 4 sedan had been stolen in New South Wales during 2008.
DNA on the pink-handled hammer
13The pink-handled hammer carried by the First Offender during the robbery was later located at the crime scene.  On analysis, DNA of the same profile as that of the appellant was found on it, with a trace amount of another person's DNA.  Ms Vivienne Bielby, a forensic biologist, gave evidence that the appellant's DNA profile could only be expected to occur in fewer than one in 10 billion individuals in the general population.
14The appellant contended that the significance of this evidence was considerably diminished by the fact, evident from CCTV footage taken during the robbery, that the First Offender wore gloves.
The T-shirt DNA
15A white T-shirt was found in the Audi RS 4 recovered on 25 November 2008.  DNA of the same profile as the appellant's DNA was found on the inside back of the neck of the T-shirt.  Mr Clinton Cochrane, a forensic biologist, said that the amount of DNA recovered from the T-shirt was inconsistent with secondary transfer and that the same profile of DNA could be expected to occur in fewer than one in 10 billion individuals in the general population.
Professor Henneberg's evidence
16Prior to the trial, the trial judge ruled on a voir dire that evidence proposed to be called from Professor Henneberg, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Adelaide, would be admissible.  The proposed evidence related to his comparisons between the offenders shown on CCTV footage taken during the robbery and videos and photographs of the appellant taken subsequently at the Surry Hills Police Station.  The evidence in fact led from Professor Henneberg at the trial was narrower than that foreshadowed by the Crown on the voir dire.
17At the trial, Professor Henneberg described his extensive academic experience over many decades at universities in Poland, the United States, South Africa and Australia.  His written curriculum vitae (Exhibit L) referred to his authorship, or co-authorship, of some seven books and 240 papers.  It also referred to his experience as a forensic expert including, from 1996 to the present, in ""identification from security camera photographs"".  He gave oral evidence of having practised ""in forensic identification, that's specifically identifying anatomical characteristics, since 1976 in various countries"" and in anatomical comparison ""in relation to various kind[s] of images, mostly from closed circuit television"".  He said that he began to prepare expert reports ""in relation to closed circuit whole body comparisons"" in 2000, his first court appearance being in 2003.
18Professor Henneberg deposed that he had been given, for comparison, discs containing CCTV footage relating to the robbery at the Narrabeen Sands Hotel and film and still photos taken of the appellant at the police station.
19He said that he attempted to identify any anatomical features common to the First Offender and the appellant.  He said that he was able to identify the eight common features referred to below but said, speaking generally, that the anatomical features that are known to be variable between individuals are numerous, a list of them being ""many pages long, I think 14 pages"".  
20He described experience he had had in photography as part of his work activities and referred in detail to the nature and extent of image distortions that can occur in CCTV footage.  He described how he sought to take account of such distortions in performing his work.
21Professor Henneberg said that he went through the images in this case repeatedly, over several hours, and that he formed an anatomical description of the First Offender using his experience in the study of anatomy and in ""measuring or describing body shapes and face pictures"".
22For reasons that he gave, he first concluded that the First Offender was an adult male.  
23Next, he concluded that that offender had a ""skinny body build"", that is, that he was ectomorphic.  He explained how he was able to discern this notwithstanding that the offender was clothed.  
24Thirdly, he concluded that the offender was of medium body height and, fourthly, that:
""[H]e carries himself very straight so that his hips are standing forward while his back is very clearly visible and here's an anatomical term, lumbar lordosis, which means well-bent small of his back, and this is overhung by the shoulder area"".
25Fifthly, Professor Henneberg concluded that the offender's hair was short and, sixthly, that he had a head shape that was more like a football than a soccer ball.  He described the latter distinction as one of ""the best studied variable features in the human population"".  He gave reasons for being able to identify these features notwithstanding the existence of the cloth wrapped around the offender's head.
26Next he described the offender as being right-handed.  To support his ability to discern this he said that he had undertaken his Masters thesis in 1973 on the topic of handedness and had published papers on it in 1999 and 2007.
27Finally, he said that he was able to discern that the offender had skin that was a dark colour.  He described how he took account of colour distortions in the images and why he reached the conclusion that he did.
28He said that his examination of the footage and images taken at the police station indicated that the appellant shared these eight features and that he was not able to discern any differences between the offender and the appellant.
29Professor Henneberg's evidence was attacked in cross-examination, largely on the basis of the views of Dr Meiya Sutisno and Mr Glenn Porter which were later given in evidence in the course of the appellant's case at the trial.
30Dr Sutisno is a forensic anatomist and senior lecturer in forensic biology at the University of Technology, Sydney.  She said that it was not possible to tell from the CCTV footage that the First Offender was an adult male, that the body shape was ectomorphic or that lumbar lordosis was exhibited.  Nor could she discern the shape of the offender's head, hair length or skin colour, or whether the offender was right-handed. 
31Mr Porter is a senior lecture in forensic science at the University of Western Sydney.  He said that he was unable to detect the colour of the hammer held by the offender nor any anatomical features of the offender.
The appellant's evidence
32The appellant denied any involvement in the robbery at the Narrabeen Sands Hotel or in the theft of Mr Curtin's Audi RS 4.  
33He said that he is an Aboriginal person who shares his personal possessions with ""friends, family, whoever needed it"".  He denied any knowledge of the pink-handled hammer and could not explain how his DNA was found on it.  He agreed that the white T-shirt found in the Audi RS 4 was medium sized, which would have fitted him, but denied that it was his. 
34The appellant also called Mr Lyle Munro, an expert in Aboriginal affairs, to give evidence.  He said that the appellant's father's home, where the appellant stayed from time to time, was in the area of Redfern known as ""The Block"".  He described the culture in this area as ""an extended family situation"" and said that ""Aboriginal people look after one another, their homes are available and most of their possessions are also available for the extended family"".
GROUND 1:  THE EVIDENCE OF PROFESSOR HENNEBERG
35This ground of appeal complains of the admission of evidence of Professor Henneberg ""to the effect that the appellant was similar in appearance to one of the offenders"".  However Professor Henneberg did not, at least expressly, give evidence to this effect.  Rather he identified eight features that the First Offender had in common with the appellant and said that he was not able to identify any differing features.  He did not express a conclusion as to the common identity of the persons or, in any general sense, any similarity between them.  
36Before addressing this Ground, I shall refer to relevant legislation and authorities.
Section 79 of the Evidence Act 1995
37The appellant contended that Professor Henneberg's evidence was opinion evidence which was inadmissible because it did not conform with s 79(1) of the Evidence Act.  The appellant did not submit that the evidence was not relevant, or that it should have been excluded under either s 135 or s 137.  Section 79 is in the following terms:
""Exception: opinions based on specialised knowledge
(1) If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.
 ... ""
Relevant case authority
38The first proposition to note is that evidence of similarities between persons, falling short of identification of the persons as the same, is admissible (Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593).  As observed by McHugh J in that case:
""[56] Unfortunately, another class of evidence is sometimes called 'circumstantial identification evidence'. It is evidence that asserts that the general appearance or some characteristic or propensity of the accused is similar to that of the person who committed the crime. It may be evidence of age, race, stature, colour or voice or of a distinctive mark or gait. It differs from positive-identification evidence in that the witness does not claim to recognise the accused as the person who committed the crime or was present in circumstances from which it can be inferred that the accused committed the crime. Although such evidence does not directly implicate the accused in the crime or as being present in incriminating circumstances, it is admissible evidence. It is proof of a circumstance - usually, but not always, weak - that with other evidence may point to the accused as the person who committed the crime. It will be weak evidence, for example, when it merely proves that the perpetrator and the accused are persons of the same ethnic background. It may be nearly conclusive evidence of identity when it proves that the accused and the perpetrator have used a unique modus operandi which is admissible in accordance with the principles concerning the admission of similar fact evidence"" (citations omitted).
39A jury may draw conclusions about similarities between an accused on the one hand and on the other hand an offender depicted in, for example, security camera photographs (see Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650).  It may be assisted in its interpretation of such footage by expert evidence but, as Smith demonstrates, the evidence of a witness, such as a police officer who is no more qualified to undertake a comparison than members of the jury is not admissible (at [9] - [11]).
40In R v Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167; 65 NSWLR 681, Dr Sutisno (who also gave evidence in the present case) gave evidence for the Crown that after studying CCTV footage of the offence and subsequent photographs of the appellant, she could identify the appellant as the offender.  Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) concluded in relation to the first limb of s 79(1) of the Evidence Act, that whilst there was a body of expertise which supported Dr Sutisno's evidence of common facial characteristics, the evidence did not indicate that that expertise was of such a character that it could support an opinion of identity such as that given by Dr Sutisno ([135] and [146]).  His Honour thus drew a distinction between evidence of points of similarity in facial anatomy and evidence of identity.  His Honour observed:
""120 As indicated above, in the circumstances of this case, the evidence of particular similarities between the two categories of photographs of the accused and the third offender was admissible. The process of identification and magnification of stills from the videotape was a process that had to be conducted by Dr Sutisno out of court. Furthermore, the quality of the photographs derived from the videotape was such that the comparison of those stills with the photographs of the appellant could not be left for the jury to undertake for itself. The identification of points of similarity by Dr Sutisno was based on her skill and training, particularly with respect to facial anatomy. It was also based on her experience with conducting such comparisons on a number of other occasions. Indeed, it could be supported by the experience gained with respect to the videotape itself through the course of multiple viewing[s], detailed selection, identification and magnification of images. By this process she had become what is sometimes referred to as an 'ad hoc expert'. (See Butera v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180 at 195; R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405 at 413 [37]-[68]; Li v The Queen (2003) 139 A Crim R 281 at 286 [39]-[44].) In any event, as noted above, no complaint is made of this evidence.""
41In Butera, to which Spigelman CJ referred, Dawson J observed:
"" ... The production and playing of an original tape recording remains the best means of proof of its contents, at least where it is audible, intelligible and the words used are in the English language. Where it is inaudible or unintelligible, expert evidence of its contents may be required and it has been held that an ad hoc expertise may be acquired by a witness by playing and replaying a tape so as to become more familiar with its contents than could be done by playing it only once or twice ... "" (at 195 citations omitted).
42Butera was applied in R v Leung [1999] NSWCCA 287; 47 NSWLR 405 to evidence of a qualified interpreter who, in translating tape recorded conversations, had become familiar with the accents and use of language of the voices on the tapes.  This ad hoc expertise entitled him to give evidence of voice comparison ([48]).  
43The same approach was adopted in Li v The Queen [2003] NSWCCA 290; 139 A Crim R 281 towards the evidence of an experienced interpreter and translator who had become familiar with the voices on tapes which he had analysed ""for many hours over many days"" (at [32]).
44In Murdoch v The Queen [2007] NTCCA 1; 167 A Crim R 329, Dr Sutisno again gave evidence of comparisons between CCTV footage of a suspect and images of the appellant.  She explained to the jury what she perceived to be the similarities and differences between the persons depicted and concluded:
""The multiple number of features matched, which includes the most noticeable or most recognisable features, the distinctive, unique identifiers, the habitual characteristics and racial traits indicate the level of identification is the same person"" (at [263]).
45The Court held that Dr Sutisno's evidence of similarities between the persons depicted was admissible, but not that of positive identification (at [300]).  It said that her training and experience enabled her to give evidence of the points of similarity in the facial features of the persons.  In addition, her detailed study of the images qualified her as an ad hoc expert entitled to give evidence of similarities of body and movement (at [296] - [300]).
46In addition to Tang, the Court in Murdoch relied upon United Kingdom decisions, including R v Gardner [2004] EWCA Crim 1639, establishing that whilst evidence of similarities in the face and body characteristics between an offender and an accused is admissible, facial imaging or mapping evidence of identification is not.
47In Morgan v R [2011] NSWCCA 257; 215 A Crim R 33, Professor Henneberg gave evidence of comparisons he made between images of an offender shown in CCTV footage taken during robberies at two hotels and photos and moving images of the appellant.  Having identified similarities between the persons depicted, he concluded:
""Based wholly or substantially on the above knowledge, I am of the opinion that there is a high level of anatomical similarity between the Offender and the Suspect (Mr MORGAN).  My opinion is strengthened by the fact that I could not observe on the Suspect any anatomical detail different from those I could discern from the CCTV images of the Offender"" (see [76]).
In response to a question posed in a note from the jury, Professor Henneberg calculated that the combination of features that he identified in the offender would be present in 1.6 per cent of the male population.
48Having referred to relevant authorities, Hidden J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed in relation to the relevant grounds of appeal) said:
""140 [Professor Henneberg's] task was to make an anatomical comparison between relatively poor quality CCTV images of a person covered by clothing from head to foot with images of the appellant. Applying his specialised knowledge, Professor Henneberg claimed, he was able to detect not just a measure of similarity but 'a high level of anatomical similarity' between the two persons. How he was able to do that when no part of the body of the offender in the CCTV images was exposed was, in my view, never satisfactorily explained.
141 It may be that his experience enabled him to make appropriate adjustments for photographic distortion in the CCTV images. However, it is not apparent on the evidence how his undoubted anatomical expertise equipped him to take account of the clothing. Notably, he said that he could make observations of the 'head shape, nose and face profile' of the offender, notwithstanding that his head was covered by a balaclava. True it is that that garment appeared to him to be 'well adhering to the surface of the skin' and, as noted at [56] above, Mr Brooks at the Willoughby Hotel described the balaclava worn by the relevant offender as 'close fitting'. Nevertheless, this is no answer to the cogent criticisms of this part of the evidence by the other experts.""
49His Honour then referred to evidence of Dr Sutisno, Dr Kemp and Mr Porter disputing Professor Henneberg's evidence and concluded:
""144 Whatever might be made of the professor's observations of the offender's body shape through his clothing, his observations about the shape of his head and face were clearly vital to his conclusion that there was a high degree of anatomical similarity between that person and the appellant. It does not appear to me that those observations could be said to be based upon his specialised knowledge of anatomy. Generally, I am persuaded by Mr Stratton's submission that his description of the offender was 'simplistic'. It may well be that the jury would have required expert evidence explaining the effect of photographic distortion in the CCTV images. Subject to that, I am not persuaded that the comparison of the images of the offender with those of the appellant was a task which the jury would not have been able to undertake for themselves: cf Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50, 206 CLR 650. 
145 Indeed, with every respect to Professor Henneberg, I am of the view that his evidence raised the very problem about expert evidence in this area described by Dr Kemp [that juries are heavily influenced by expert opinions]. It tended to cloak evidence of similarity in a mantle of expertise, described by Mr Stratton as a 'white coat effect', which it did not deserve.""
50In R v Dastagir [2013] SASC 26, Nicholson J considered the admissibility of evidence of Professor Henneberg of similarities between the appellant and a person depicted on CCTV footage.  His Honour had earlier ruled that proposed evidence of Professor Henneberg that the persons were the same was inadmissible.
51His Honour said:
""I was satisfied that Professor Henneberg had acquired, over many years, substantial practical expertise in the understanding and examination of digitally produced images.  I was satisfied that he had acquired a level of expertise sufficient for the task at hand which was to bring his undoubted expertise as a human anatomist to bear to observe and describe anatomical features of the person of interest shown in the ... service station's CCTV footage"" (at [46]).
52He rejected criticism that Professor Henneberg did not employ a satisfactory or acceptable methodology, concluding that Professor Henneberg's task was ""essentially observational and descriptive"" (at [46]).
53His Honour distinguished the decision in Morgan on the basis that in Morgan the person of interest was fully clothed and wearing a balaclava and in that case Professor Henneberg had expressed the view that there was ""a high level of anatomical similarity between the offender and the suspect"", a view which bordered on expressing a view on the ultimate issue.  In addition, his Honour pointed out that the evidentiary base before the Court in Morgan was different from that in the case before him.  Furthermore, his Honour expressed the view that Professor Henneberg had in the case before him acquired an ad hoc expertise of the type to which Spigelman CJ referred in Tang (at [54]).
54His Honour agreed with the analysis and observations of the Northern Territory Court of Appeal in Murdoch and concluded that the limited evidence given by Professor Henneberg, of similarities between the persons depicted, was admissible (at [61]).
Conclusions on Ground 1
55The appellant submitted that the decision in Morgan required this Ground of appeal to be upheld.  For the following reasons, I do not agree.
56First, of central importance to the decision in Morgan was Professor Henneberg's evidence that there was ""a high level of anatomical similarity"" between the offender and the appellant.  Although this was not evidence identifying the appellant as the offender, it was conclusory in character and went a long way towards constituting identification.  As such, it was strongly arguable that its admission would have conflicted with the decisions in Tang and Murdoch, in addition to those in the United Kingdom to which I have referred.  The principal difficulty with it was that it was not founded upon any established criteria for determining how many and what type of similarities between people result in ""a high level of anatomical similarity"" between them when considered as a whole.  As Professor Henneberg pointed out in the present case, the respects in which persons may differ are numerous.  Indeed, he referred to a list some 14 pages long (see [19] above).  
57Contrary to the appellant's submissions (Reply [4]), the evidence of Professor Henneberg in the present case and in Morgan was not ""essentially identical"".  Critically, in the present case Professor Henneberg did not give evidence of any conclusions to be drawn from his observations of identified common characteristics.
58Secondly, I do not regard as determinative of the present case the Court's conclusion in Morgan that the evidence in that case did not establish that Professor Henneberg's expertise equipped him to express views about the shape of the offender's head and face, notwithstanding that his head was covered by a balaclava.  This was a conclusion based on the evidence in that case. 
59The relevant part of Professor Henneberg's evidence-in-chief in the present case was as follows:
""Q. What was your next feature, that is his feature?A. Oh, it was part of the face.  I said in my report, although the offender covers his head and face with a cloth, with what looks like a T-shirt, the knitted fabric is elastic and adheres closely to the vault of the head, meaning to the brain case.  And this shows that his hair is short because the shape that is revealed by the adhering fabric is consistent with a very characteristic shape of the human brain case.  And I then proceeded to assess the shape of his brain case as elongated which has Greek term, Dolichocephalic, as opposed to brachycephalic, which is simply round.  And after this I went straight to my comparisons of football to a soccer ball.  These are extremes but that is the difference.  A Dolichocephalic head is more similar in its shape to a football whereas a brachycephalic head is similar to a soccer ball.  And this is one of the best studied variable features in the human population and it is also used in clinical diagnosis.
Q. That was able to be determined by you through the fabric of what he had over his head?A. Yes, the fabric showed, closely adhered to his head around it and showed the shape of the skull vault.  If I may make a direct comparison, excuse me, but if we put elastic fabric onto a your head with the wig obviously it would be clear that there is a wig under the fabric because it wouldn't look like the normal shape of the brain case"" (Transcript p 117).
60In addition to his specialised knowledge based upon his training, study or experience occurring prior to the present case, Professor Henneberg's detailed consideration over a lengthy period of the CCTV footage in the present case rendered him an ad hoc expert of the type described in Tang and other decisions to which I have referred.  His individual and detailed examination of the footage could be expected to have put him in a superior position to that of the jury which would have had a collective viewing over what would, in practical terms, be likely to have been a far shorter time.  Professor Henneberg's prior training, study and experience would of course have added to that advantage.  The potential assistance of Professor Henneberg's evidence to the jury is highlighted by Dr Sutisno's evidence that it was not possible to discern even the gender of the First Offender.  It could not in these circumstances be said that Professor Henneberg's evidence was simply of obvious matters that the jury could have necessarily have discerned for itself.
61In summary, I agree generally with the approach of Nicholson J in Dastagir and in particular with the following conclusion which is worthy of repetition:
""64.  Evidence of similarity is relevant and admissible as part of a circumstantial case.  In short, Professor Henneberg offered an expertly trained eye for observation of anatomical features, an expert capacity to compare a feature in one set of images with the cognate feature in another set of images and to describe them, insofar as anatomical considerations permit, as similar or dissimilar, an expert capacity to position anatomical features on a categorical scale accepted in the profession as a useful means of categorising like as opposed to unlike anatomical presentations of a particular feature and a common language for the descriptions"".
Whilst in Dastagir, in contrast to the present case, the offender's head was not covered, I have concluded in [58] to [60] above that Professor Henneberg's evidence concerning the First Offender's hair length and head shape was admissible.  As a result, I regard Nicholson J's remarks as applicable to the present case.
62Dr Sutisno gave evidence that she had given evidence in other cases about the shape of an offender's head where the offender had been wearing clothing including a baseball cap which covered the top of the head.  She said that those cases were different from the present because ""[t]he cap was tightly fitted to the skull unlike in this case it's loose covering of the head"" (Transcript p 187).
63It was open to the jury to prefer Dr Sutisno's view on this issue to that of Professor Henneberg but it cannot in my view be said that the latter's evidence was clearly groundless and not fit to be left to the trier of fact for consideration.  In addition to his formal qualifications in anatomy, Professor Henneberg is a person of extensive practical experience in examining CCTV footage, with all its deficiencies, and attempting to identify characteristics of persons depicted in it.  The view he expressed on this topic is necessarily subjective and not amenable to elaboration beyond the reasons he gave, or to measurement and calculation.  The present case differs from Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 where the evidence did not enable the Court to understand how the witness' training, study or experience permitted him to provide the numerical estimates that he proffered.
64Thirdly, I note that the Court in Morgan was not persuaded ""that the comparison of the images of the offender with those of the appellant was a task which the jury would not have been able to undertake for themselves"" ([144]).  It referred in this respect to the decision in Smith (see [39] above).  This point concerned the relevance of the evidence in that case.  However, relevance is not in issue in the present case.  The appellant's express disavowal of an argument that Professor Henneberg's evidence would not, if supported by appropriate expertise, have been relevant carries with it the implicit acceptance that, unlike the position in Smith, the witness' evidence would have assisted the jury in attempting to determine whether the appellant was depicted in the security images taken during the commission of the offence.  
65Fourthly, I note that in adverting to the ""white coat effect"" of expert evidence, the Court in Morgan appeared to be referring to discretionary considerations that would arise under s 135 or s 137 of the Evidence Act if those sections were relied on.  The appellant in the present case however expressly disavowed reliance on either of those sections.
66In these circumstances, I conclude that the challenged evidence of Professor Henneberg was admissible and that this ground of appeal should be rejected.  For the reasons I have given, he has specialist knowledge based on his training, study and experience and his evidence was based on that specialised knowledge (see s 79(1) Evidence Act - [37] above).  
67Professor Henneberg's evidence was limited to identifying similarities between the depictions of the offender and the appellant.  Contrary to the appellant's contention in Ground 1, this evidence was not to the effect that the offender and the appellant were similar in appearance.  Professor Henneberg stated that they had limited, identified characteristics in common, a statement that falls well short of asserting that ""the appellant was similar in appearance to one of the offenders""; particularly when he had pointed out to the jury the common sense proposition that there are multifarious respects in which individuals may differ.
68Professor Henneberg's evidence that he did not identify any differing characteristics did not mean that his evidence, taken as a whole, was to the effect that the offender and the appellant were similar in appearance.  His evidence, and the CCTV footage itself, would have made it clear to the jury that the clothing of the offender made it very difficult to do more than identify a very limited number of characteristics.  Contrary to the appellant's submission (Reply [17]), the jury could not reasonably have interpreted Professor Henneberg's evidence as being that there were ""no points of difference"" between the individuals.  It was obvious from his evidence that he was in no position to express such a view.
GROUND 2:  WHETHER THE VERDICT WAS UNREASONABLE AND UNSUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE
69Consideration of this Ground requires the Court to undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether it has a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt which cannot be resolved by attributing the verdict of guilty to the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence of the witnesses (SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11] - [14]).  
70As there was no witness who was able to identify the appellant as the First Offender, (the person who carried the pink-handled hammer during the robbery) the case against him is a circumstantial one.  In such a case, the Court must have regard to the whole of the evidence to determine whether the accused's guilt was established beyond reasonable doubt.  As was stated in The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618:
""49. In the present case, there was evidence (such as the evidence of unidentified DNA on the pyjama top) which was consistent with Mr Hillier's innocence. But the question for the Court of Appeal was whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty. 
50. In that regard it is important to recognise that Mr Hillier gave evidence at his trial. The Court of Appeal made no reference to this evidence when considering whether the jury's verdict should be set aside. One question which the jury was bound to consider was what they made of Mr Hillier's evidence. Did they believe that Mr Hillier may have been telling the truth when he denied responsibility for Ms Hardwick's death? Or were they, as the verdict revealed, positively persuaded on a consideration of all of the evidence (including his) that he was not?""
See also The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at [128].
71The principal evidence against the appellant was in summary as follows.  Most of this evidence has been referred to earlier in [4] to [34].  
72Of primary significance was the evidence of what can be taken as the appellant's DNA on the pink-handled hammer held by the First Offender during the robbery and found afterwards at its scene.  It is deprived of conclusiveness by the fact that that offender wore gloves during the robbery but it remains as strong evidence linking the appellant with the robbery.  
73The hotel employees' descriptions of the First Offender, although referring only to characteristics of a most general nature, were consistent with the appellant's involvement, as was Professor Henneberg's evidence, referred to earlier, and the CCTV footage which the Court viewed.  The jury may have been able to discern from the latter some of the characteristics of the First Offender to which Professor Henneberg pointed.
74Of considerable significance also was the evidence linking the appellant to what was clearly the get-away vehicle used in the robbery.  As noted earlier, DNA which can be taken to have been that of the appellant was found on the inside back of the neck of a white T-shirt found in the car, the T-shirt being of a type consistent with the description given by the hotel employees of the item wrapped around the head of the First Offender and with the clothing seen in the speed camera photograph wrapped around the head of the front seat passenger in the get-away vehicle.
75My assessment of the evidence leads me to the conclusion that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the person shown in the CCTV footage holding the pink-handled hammer and was therefore guilty of the offence charged.  In these circumstances, Ground 2 should be rejected.
ORDERS
76For these reasons, I consider that the appeal should be dismissed.

2761642,Stanyard v R [2013] NSWCCA 134,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Fullerton J.

2FULLERTON J: On 25 May 2012, following a judge alone trial, Berman DCJ convicted the applicant of two counts of driving in a manner dangerous to the public occasioning grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (see R v Stanyard [2012] NSWDC 78).

3The two young women injured in the driving episode that gave rise to the charges were back seat passengers in the applicant's four wheel drive four-seat convertible which became airborne when it was driven over a sand dune in Boat Harbour Park (a small private park at Kurnell) before impacting with the sand on its descent and flipping over. As a result of the collision Nicole Crawford was rendered a tetraplegic and Kirsten Free suffered broken arms. At the time of the driving episode the vehicle had a canvas roof attached. No roll bars were fitted.

4The applicant was bail refused on 25 May 2012 and has been in continuous custody since that date.

5The offence of dangerous driving contrary to s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act attracts a maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment. For the offence involving Ms Free, and after a finding of special circumstances, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of term of 1 year. The sentence was ordered to date from 25 May 2012. For the offence involving Ms Crawford, also after a finding of special circumstances, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years. The sentence was ordered to commence on 25 May 2013. The sentences were partly accumulated resulting in an effective sentence of 5 years and 6 months, consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years.

6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence and relied upon three grounds of appeal:

Ground 1: His Honour wrongly determined the applicant's moral culpability as high.

Ground 2: His Honour failed to apply the totality principle.

Ground 3: The individual sentences and the overall sentence were manifestly excessive. 

7The applicant was also disqualified from driving for four years commencing on 25 May 2012. There is no challenge to that order. 

8His Honour published detailed reasons for the verdicts entered on both counts. His assessment of the objective gravity of the offending, and whether the features of aggravation relied upon by the Crown were made out for sentencing purposes, are necessarily related to the factual findings inherent in his Honour's finding of guilt. The appeal against sentence calls for some scrutiny of these findings. 

9The applicant's subjective circumstances were the subject of evidence tendered on sentence only. The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He did not give evidence at his trial.

The evidence at trial

10On the morning of 7 February 2009 the applicant drove to Kurnell to spend the day at the beach with Ms Free, Ms Crawford and another friend, Mr Sayers. After being at the beach for some unspecified time they went to nearby Boat Harbour Park where recreational four-wheel driving over sand dunes was an approved activity. The applicant drove while Ms Free and Ms Crawford occupied the rear passenger seats and Mr Sayers the front passenger seat. A speed limit of 20 kph was designated within the confines of the park. 

11After entering the park (again at some unspecified time) the applicant drove up and over a sand dune. It had what was described as a flatter gradient on approach and a steeper gradient on the descent. Each of the three passengers were in the vehicle during that manoeuvre. It was executed without incident. The manoeuvre was then repeated. On this occasion, however, Mr Sayers got out of the vehicle before the ascent and positioned himself at the base of the descent to photograph the vehicle as it came over the crest of the sand dune. At the crest the wheels of the vehicle left the sand, pitched forward, and impacted with the descending face of the dune before rolling forward and onto its roof.

12The only issue in dispute at trial was whether the applicant was driving his vehicle in a manner dangerous to other people at the time that it impacted with the sand on its descent causing the injuries suffered by the back seat passengers. 

13The Crown put its case on three bases: 
1. The accused was driving at excessive speed; 
2. The accused's decision to drive the vehicle off such a steep sand dune was dangerous in itself, no matter what speed the vehicle was travelling; and 
3. It was dangerous to drive this particular vehicle in that manner where it was not equipped with a protective roof or roll bar. 

14As the trial judge, his Honour approached the question as to whether the Crown had proved guilt by focusing on whether it had proved to the criminal standard that the applicant drove at excessive speed. His Honour reasoned to the conclusion that if he were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the speed at which the applicant executed the driving manoeuvre over the sand dune was dangerous then he need not resolve whether the other features of the driving relied upon by the Crown were capable (alone or in combination) of constituting dangerous driving for the purposes of criminal liability. 

15Both the Crown and the defence called expert evidence concerning the likely speed of the vehicle at the time it ascended and crested the sand dune. The Crown also relied upon the evidence of eyewitnesses to establish that the vehicle was ""revving"" on the ascent and that it became airborne as it breached the crest of the dune, and the evidence of an ambulance officer and a fire brigade officer that they saw no vehicle tracks on the descending gradient of the dune to further support the Crown case that the vehicle was airborne at the crest. 

16The applicant gave an account to police in his ERISP that he was travelling on the approach to the dune at a ""walking pace"" and that as he approached the top of the dune he slowed down to ""pretty much a stop"". 

17It was submitted on the applicant's behalf at trial that the evidence did not establish that the speed range at the point of the vehicle being effectively launched into the air (namely at between at least 22.6 and 25 kph as agreed between the experts) was an excessive speed when viewed against the speed limit in the park of 20 kph. It was also submitted that it was reasonably possible that the vehicle flipped forward at the crest of the sand dune (without becoming airborne) as a result of the vehicle breaking through the surface of the sand at the crest causing the front wheels to sink, thereby imparting rotational movement to the vehicle and causing it to flip over. 

18His Honour found that the vehicle did become airborne at the crest of the dune such that the tyres lost contact with the sand, and that driving at a speed that achieved that result was driving in a manner that was dangerous to another person or persons. As to the issue of speed he said at [103]:
It will be noted of course that I have not ascribed here a precise speed to the vehicle as it became airborne. This is because it largely does not matter. Whatever the precise speed was it was sufficient to cause the vehicle to become airborne. Thus whether the speed of the vehicle was 25 kilometres an hour or 22.6 kilometres an hour does not really matter. 

19He went on to hold:
[107] The manner of the accused's driving, including the speed at which he travelled, was such as to cause the vehicle to become airborne as it went over the crest of the sand dune with the result that the vehicle rotated forwards and the accused could do nothing to prevent the vehicle falling under the influence of gravity, rotating as it did so, the significant vertical distance to where it hit the ground below. By causing the vehicle to become airborne the accused could not slow down its descent by using the brakes - in effect he had brought about a situation where he was unable to control the vehicle in any way whatsoever. And he brought about a situation where the vehicle would rotate as it flew through the air.

[108] This created a real danger to the passengers in his vehicle. Driving in such a way that the vehicle became airborne as it went over this sand dune was a serious breach of the proper conduct of the vehicle. This was such a serious breach as to be in reality potentially dangerous to the passengers in his vehicle. The accused caused a situation to come about where his vehicle fell through the air, rotating as it did so, without being in contact with the sand, and without the accused being able to arrest the descent of the vehicle until it collided with the sand at the base of the dune, its momentum causing it to then overturn. 

20Although not essential to the finding of guilt, his Honour also found that the passengers expressed concern at the danger they perceived they would be exposed to were the applicant to repeat the driving manoeuvre (presumably under speed). His Honour said:
[110] Ms Free gave evidence that immediately before the vehicle went over the sand dune and overturned she asked to get out of the vehicle. Her evidence was that she was scared by what the accused had just done and by what he was planning to do. She gave evidence that she didn't actually get out because Ms Crawford asked her to ""stay and hold my hand"". Ms Crawford gave evidence that she too was scared and asked to get out of the vehicle and that she remembered Ms Free asking the same thing. She said that the accused did not reply to her request and the next thing she remembers was the vehicle nose diving. 

... 

[112] Mr Sayers gave evidence that whilst initially Ms Free asked to get out when he did, she changed her mind. This is broadly consistent with Ms Free's evidence. This suggests that Ms Crawford's recollection, clearly affected by the awful injuries she suffered, may have been faulty in a minor way. In any case there is evidence from three of the four people in the vehicle that day that immediately before it overturned Ms Free asked to get out, two of the witnesses, including Ms Free herself, explaining that she didn't do so after changing her mind...

Additional factual findings on sentence

21For sentencing purposes his Honour made additional findings of fact. He found Ms Crawford's injuries to be in the worst category of grievous bodily harm. He made no assessment of Ms Free's injuries. This was not the subject of any criticism or comment on the appeal. In his assessment of the objective gravity of the offending (which I take to be comprehended by both counts), his Honour found that although the applicant was driving on the sand dune at well in excess of a safe speed, the offence was not of the same gravity where serious injury has resulted from a driver travelling at high speed and becoming airborne due to an uneven road since a driver in those circumstances should be taken to appreciate the high risk of an accident and consequential injury to other road users. By contrast, his Honour expressed the view that the consequences of driving over a sand dune at high speed are not widely known. While he accepted that in one sense the offences were a consequence of the applicant's youthful exuberance and his failure to appreciate the danger to others (and himself) of driving as he did, his Honour was also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant failed to heed the warnings and concerns of his passengers on approach to the second ascent. He also found that the applicant was ""showing off"" by driving intentionally at an excessive speed so that the vehicle would become airborne (in the sense that all four wheels would leave the surface of the sand). 

22In considering the interplay of these factors as aggravating circumstances for the purposes of applying the guideline judgment in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209; 101 A Crim R 259, his Honour assessed the applicant's moral culpability as high. In R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252; 134 A Crim R 53 at [223], Spigelman CJ regarded the moral culpability of an offender as one way of describing an abandonment of responsibility and which, when present to a material degree, is a matter relevant to determining an appropriate sentence. 

23In further consideration of the list of aggravating factors identified in Jurisic at 231E (set out in full at [28] of this judgment) his Honour noted the seriousness of the injuries suffered by Ms Crawford and the fact that more than one person was put at risk because of the two passengers in the rear seat. It will be necessary to consider whether his Honour was in error in taking both factors into account for the purposes of assessing moral culpability, as contended for by the applicant's counsel in support of the first ground of appeal, and/or whether his Honour was entitled to have regard to the risk that presented to the two injured people as an aggravating factor at all. 

Subjective circumstances 

24The applicant was 27 at the time of sentence and 24 at the time of committing the offences. He was a fire systems tester and was in full-time employment in that capacity at the time of the trial. He was the father of a young child with a former partner and of an infant daughter with his current partner. He had considerable family support. His expressed remorse on sentence was accepted as genuine. 

25The applicant had no relevant criminal record but had regularly infringed traffic laws resulting in a loss of his licence. These infringements included relevantly, so far as the question of speed is concerned, the following:
11 August 2003: Exceed speed limit by more than 15km/h but not more than 30km/h; 
12 April 2005: Exceed speed limit by not more than 15km/h;
2 June 2008: Exceed speed limit by more than 15km/h but not more than 30km/h;
24 August 2009 (after the accident): Exceed speed limit by more than 15km/h but not more than 30km/h. 

26His Honour concluded that although the applicant was young his traffic history distinguished him from the typical case of a young offender with good character with limited or no prior convictions for the purposes of the guideline judgment.

Ground 1: His Honour wrongly determined the applicant's moral culpability as high

27The applicant's counsel did not submit that the sentencing judge's factual findings concerning the offender's conduct were not open on the evidence. The focus of his submission was that those findings, in particular that the applicant was ""showing off"" and that the speed he was driving at was excessive, needed to be significantly tempered when assessing his degree of moral culpability, in part because of his Honour's related finding that the offences were not of the same gravity as offending which involved high speed travel along a public road and because the speed at which the applicant's vehicle was travelling was only marginally above the speed limit set by the owners of the private park. 

28In Whyte, when considering the second limb of the guideline judgment in Jurisic, Spigelman CJ said the following: 
[215] The second limb of the guideline in Jurisic at 231 was as follows:
""With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional.""

[216] I had earlier set out a list of aggravating factors which had been established in the authorities as follows:
""(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted.
(ii) Number of people put at risk.
(iii) Degree of speed.
(iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse.
(v) Erratic driving.
(vi) Competitive driving or showing off.
(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk.
(viii) Ignoring of warnings.
(ix) Escaping police pursuit.""

[217] Further consideration of the authorities would cause me to amend this list by changing (v) to read ""erratic or aggressive driving"" and adding:
(x) Degree of sleep deprivation.
(xi) Failing to stop.

[218] I went on to say at 231:
""Para(i) and para(ii) focus on the occurrence, whereas para(iii)-para(ix) refer to the conduct of the offender. The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence.""

[219] It was after this passage that the two limbs of the guideline in Jurisic were set out.

[220] I said at 231 that the formulation of whether ""the relevant aggravating factor manifest[s] in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct"" involves an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ.

[221] I also said at 231:
""The period of three or two years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence.""

...

[223] As set out above, the guideline in Jurisic was expressed in terms of an aggravating factor involving the offender's conduct being present ""to a material degree"". The factors identified all related to the moral culpability of the offender. The reference to 'abandonment of responsibility' was one formulation for describing a high degree of moral culpability. The case law subsequent to Jurisic does not suggest that it has been applied as if it were a statutory test.

29In my view, it was open to the sentencing judge to regard the combination of excessive speed (iii); showing off (vi); and ignoring warnings (viii) as constituting moral culpability of a high order. Although his Honour regarded driving at excessive speed in a private park as in a different category of offending to where drivers travel at excessive speed on a public road, as I see it, the critical finding supporting the assessment of a high degree of moral culpability was his finding that the applicant drove at excessive speed with the intention that the vehicle would become airborne and that it was this that led directly to the rear seat passengers suffering grievous bodily harm. It is an unexceptional observation that a safe speed depends upon a range of factors, including the posted speed limit and prevailing conditions. In this case, in my view, a safe speed had little to do with what private park owners considered might be an appropriate speed for recreational driving, or the fact that the applicant exceeded that limit by a relatively modest margin. To drive at a speed which was intended to launch the vehicle over the crest and into the air was dangerous on any view. I would also add that for my part, although his Honour gave the applicant the benefit of a finding that the consequences of driving over a sand dune at high speed might not be widely known, I regard the dangers inherent in driving a car (with or without a hard roof) under speed up and over a sand dune, with the intention that all four wheels leave the ground thereby depriving the driver of any control over the vehicle or how it might land, as obvious. 

30Counsel also submitted that the significance of the concern expressed by the two passengers should be similarly tempered since the evidence was that this occurred immediately before the vehicle went over the sand dune and therefore at a time when there was nothing the applicant could do to heed the warning. This submission is contrary to the evidence summarised by his Honour and set out in [20] above.

31In considering whether there is error in the way his Honour dealt with the nature of the injuries and the degree of risk to others as aggravating features, it is necessary to set out that part of his Honour's sentencing remarks: 
A number of aggravating factors were also suggested for consideration relating to the moral culpability of the offender.

I have mentioned repeatedly because of its importance in the sentencing decision the terrible injuries suffered by Ms Crawford. Mr Dailly concedes that it is an aggravating circumstance that more than one person was put at risk with Mr Stanyard driving over that dune with two girls in the back of his vehicle. 

32I am persuaded that it was not open to his Honour to find that more than one person was put at risk because of the two young women in the rear seat of the applicant's vehicle and to treat it as an aggravating circumstance under the guideline judgment, whether in the assessment of moral culpability or as aggravating the occurrence of the offence. The applicant's trial counsel was in error in making that concession. In promulgating the guideline judgment in Jurisic, where the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted has been recognised as a discrete aggravating factor and where, as here, the suffering of grievous bodily harm is an element of the offence of dangerous driving, I am satisfied that the number of persons who may have been exposed to risk by the offender's dangerous driving must refer to people other than those identified as victims in the particulars of charge. Were it otherwise there is a danger of double counting and a corresponding risk that the sentence imposed will be excessive. In addition, even were there evidence of other park users being put at risk (which in this case there was not) this would not have been relevant to the moral responsibility of the applicant but rather to the consequences of his conduct (see [218] of Jurisic). The first ground of appeal is made out.

33However, in taking into account the extent and nature of the injuries that were sustained by Ms Crawford as an aggravating feature for the purpose of determining sentence on the count that concerned her (as his Honour was entitled to do under the guideline judgment), I am not persuaded that in the reasons for sentence or in the sentences imposed it is open to infer that those injuries were taken into account in the sentence imposed on the count involving Ms Free. To the extent that the applicant submitted that this was an additional basis for upholding the first ground of appeal, I would reject it. 

Ground 2: His Honour failed to apply the totality principle 

34On sentence it was the agreed position of counsel that partial accumulation of the sentences was necessary in order to ensure that the totality of the criminality involved in the single episode of dangerous driving was reflected in the sentences imposed. On the appeal it was submitted that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried because the non-parole periods were wholly accumulated and, by that approach, there was a failure to account for the overlapping features in the separate offences. In the result, so it was submitted, the total sentence exceeded what was necessary to reflect the gravity of the overall offending.

35The Crown submitted that this case was unusual in that there was a marked difference in the nature and extent of the injuries suffered by the two young women. The Crown submitted that, unlike other cases of dangerous driving involving multiple victims (but where death was not occasioned), where the injuries sustained are such that comparable or similar sentences are imposed with a marked degree of concurrence, in this case there was a principled basis for the sentence for the offence involving Ms Free to be markedly less than for the sentence for the offence involving Ms Crawford, and for the non-parole periods to be accumulated to reflect the very grave injuries Ms Crawford suffered despite the commonality of circumstances in which her injuries, and those of Ms Free, were sustained. 

36The Crown emphasised that it is also evident from the sentencing order (that is, by sentencing the counts in reverse order to the way they appeared on the indictment) that his Honour was concerned to ensure that the periods of mandatory custody specific to each count were fully served. 

37This Court has repeatedly emphasised that, subject to the application of established principle, questions of accumulation (and necessarily the extent of any order for partial accumulation) are discretionary (see R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]). Given the catastrophic nature of the injuries suffered by Ms Crawford, and the injuries suffered by Ms Free which were also serious, a period of mandatory custody in the overall sentencing order attributable to the particular harm each young woman suffered was appropriately reflected in the effective sentence imposed. While the effect of the sentencing order is that the minimum periods of mandatory custody have been wholly accumulated, there has been partial accumulation of the total sentences of imprisonment. I am not satisfied that there has been any failure to apply the totality principle or that his Honour's discretion miscarried in its application.

Ground 3: The individual sentences and the overall sentence were manifestly excessive

38The applicant submitted that the sentences imposed on both counts were excessive and the effective sentence was also excessive having regard to the applicant's subjective circumstances and what counsel described as the applicant's misjudgement as the overriding feature of the offending. He also submitted that, contrary to his Honour's findings, the applicant's moral culpability was not high. I have already resolved to the view that the assessment of moral culpability in that degree was a finding open to his Honour. Furthermore, I am unable to see how, in all the circumstances, the applicant's actions can be fairly viewed as reflecting an error of judgment. While the applicant's subjective circumstances were entitled to weight, his traffic record was not unblemished. 

39Counsel also submitted that the guideline judgment operated such that a head sentence of less than 2 years and 8 months should not be imposed where an offender is convicted after trial even where moral culpability was found to be high.

40The guideline judgment in Jurisic, and the further consideration given to it in Whyte, is not designed to operate in the way contended for by counsel. In so far as the guideline judgment refers to a numerical guideline it is directly referable to a typical case (which this case was not). Guideline judgments are not absolute directions for sentencing judges and not to be applied as if they operate as a minimum sentencing or standard sentencing regime. In accordance with the procedure provided for in s 37A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, guideline judgments are attempts to achieve consistency in sentence with the ultimate goal of achieving equality and justice and to provide an opportunity for this Court to analyse sentencing principles for those offences where some unevenness or uncertainty of sentencing practice has emerged. Whilst guideline judgments are to be regarded as persuasive, they are not prescriptive (see R v Read [2010] NSWCCA 78 at [49]). 

41In this case the applicant was given the benefit of a finding of special circumstances on both the individual counts which was also applied to the effective sentence, thereby altering the statutory ratio to a significant degree. Although his Honour provided no reasons for that approach, it had the effect of reducing the time the applicant is required to serve in custody and extending the time on parole. It is not to the point when considering whether a ground of manifest excess is made out that this Court might have exercised its sentencing discretion differently. The question is whether the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust.

42I am not persuaded the sentences imposed are unreasonable or plainly unjust. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.

Re-sentence

43Since the applicant has made out error in the risk posed to the passengers in the vehicle being treated as an aggravating circumstance, the question then arises whether the applicant should be re-sentenced or whether, despite the error, no lesser sentence is warranted in law (s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). For my part, given the interplay of other aggravating factors about which there is no sustained challenge, I am not satisfied that the error is reflected in any material way in the sentences imposed. I am of the view that no lesser sentences were warranted in law.

44The orders I propose are:
1. Leave to appeal granted.
2. Appeal dismissed.

45CAMPBELL J: I agree with Fullerton J.

		05 June 2013",2013-06-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761645,"R v BURNS, Renae [2013] NSWSC 1851","REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown alleges that Tanya Lane murdered Steven Quire in the evening of 20 February 2010 at Rutherford by shooting him at close range with a flare gun which she had purchased early in that month. His body was found buried in bushland in the Watagan State Forest on 13 March 2010. The offender, Renae Burns, has pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to that murder. She stands for sentence for that offence. 

2Senior counsel for the offender, Mr Ramage QC, told me that it is not agreed that the murder occurred on 20 February, although it is accepted that it was on or about that day. Nor is it agreed that the murder occurred at Rutherford. For present purposes, however, nothing turns on those matters. Subject to them, I have been presented with a lengthy statement of agreed facts, containing a comprehensive summary of the evidence against the offender. It is not necessary to recite them in these remarks. A brief summary will suffice.

3The offender had been in a relationship with the deceased, Steven Quire, for some years prior to his death. They had a daughter and she had a daughter from a previous relationship, whom Mr Quire treated as his own. Over a period prior to the murder their relationship had soured. The offender formed a relationship with Tanya Lane, which became intimate. They conducted this relationship in such a way as to conceal its full extent from Mr Quire.

4By her plea of guilty the offender admits that over a period after the murder, knowing that Ms Lane had committed that crime, she told lies on a number of occasions about material matters in an effort to conceal Ms Lane's crime and prevent her being brought to justice. In conversations with some people in the period immediately after the killing, before Mr Quire's body was found, she advanced various explanations for his disappearance: that he was fruit picking in Cessnock, that he had gone to Mackay with friends, or that he had gone ""up north"" to work in the mines. 

5After the body was found she denied to investigating police that she had been in an intimate relationship with Ms Lane, and claimed that she had maintained a loving relationship with Mr Quire. She also falsely claimed that Ms Lane had been ""like a sister"" to Mr Quire and that the three of them were close friends. These falsehoods were designed to avoid any suggestion that her relationship with Ms Lane might have provided a motive for the murder. 

6She also falsely claimed to police and to a number of other people, including the mother, grandmother and sisters of Mr Quire, that he had been involved in drug dealing and owed a substantial amount of money to bikies who were his suppliers. She made up a story that on 20 February 2010 he had been confronted at his home by two men who threatened him with violence if he did not attend to the matter, and that thereafter he went into hiding. She suggested that his criminal associates might have killed him. 

7The offender was arrested on 23 September 2010, and at that stage was charged with complicity in the murder of Mr Quire. Both she and Ms Lane were put on trial for the murder in October of last year. However, on 30 October, while pre-trial issues were being determined and before a jury was empanelled, an alternative count of accessory after the fact in her case was added to the indictment. She pleaded guilty to that offence on that day.

8The Crown prosecutor tendered victim impact statements by Mr Quire's mother and brother, and by the offender's older daughter. Mr Ramage objected to them and, after hearing argument, I indicated that I would consider their admissibility. I have decided that they are not admissible in these proceedings, given that the offender is being sentenced not for the murder of Mr Quire but for being an accessory after the fact to that offence. As his death is not the result of her offence, the relevant provision of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 27(2)(a), is not applicable. This was the approach taken by Grove J in R v Scowen [2007] NSWSC 792 at [3] - [5], an approach with which I respectfully agree. 

9Ms Lane is yet to face trial for the murder and, if she is found guilty, these victim impact statements would properly be received in her sentence proceedings. That said, I think it appropriate at this stage to acknowledge the pain and loss no doubt suffered by Mr Quire's family, and to express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by his violent death.

10The offender was 31 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 34. She has a minor criminal history, of no significance for present purposes. She has been in custody since her arrest, having never before been in prison. 

11Her background is sketched in a statement which she made for the purpose of the sentence proceedings, together with a psychological report of Mr John Machlin. Given the view I have formed of the matter in the light of the period she has been in custody, it is not necessary to examine this material in any detail. It is sufficient to say that she had a difficult upbringing because her father left the family when she was very young, leaving her mother to care for her and her three siblings. She left school after year 9, but appears to have had a satisfactory employment record thereafter.

12Her older daughter was the product of a relationship which came to an end when her partner left her after she had told him she was pregnant. As I have said, her relationship with Mr Quire proved not to be a happy one, but she acknowledged that he had always been a father to her older daughter. Her relationship with that young lady has been fractured by her criminal behaviour, but she hopes eventually to restore it. 

13Mr Machlin, who interviewed her in prison recently, found her to be suffering from a major depressive disorder. She has been undergoing treatment for that condition while in custody. Fortunately, she has the continuing support of her family. 

14Her offence is a serious one, involving a sustained pattern of falsehood. Clearly, however, it was the product of her relationship with Ms Lane and was emotionally based. By way of explanation of her behaviour to Mr Machlin she said, among other things, that she wanted to protect Ms Lane and could not bear the thought of losing her. No doubt, that relationship has also come to an end.

15In her statement she expressed remorse for her crime, and I have no reason not to accept it as genuine. She will need a deal of support and supervision to readjust to life at liberty upon her release, and to that end I find special circumstances justifying a departure, albeit a modest one, from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period.

16Counsel supplied me with details of twenty-two cases of sentence for accessory after the fact to murder. Two of them were sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal after an appeal was allowed: R v Farroukh (CCA, Unreported, 29 March 1996) and R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345, 132 A Crim R 408. The others were sentences passed at first instance. In all but two of the cases there had been pleas of guilty. Nine of them were disposed of other than by full time custodial sentences (in which I include suspended sentences and periodic detention). 

17Of the remaining thirteen cases, the lowest head sentence was (in round figures) 1 year, 4 months (with a non-parole period, again in round figures, of 12 months): Scowen (supra). The highest head sentence was 5 years (with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years): R v Galea [2003] NSWSC 465. The lowest non-parole period was 12 months: Scowen, and the highest was 3 years and 2 months (with a head sentence of 4 years and 3 months): R v Almirol (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 323. 

18Of course, all these cases turned on their own facts, as does the present case. Nevertheless, the sentence I propose for this offender falls within such pattern of sentence as emerges from them. But for her plea of guilty, I would have imposed on her a head sentence of the order of 5 years. In recognition of the utilitarian value of her plea, the sentence will be 4 years. I shall set a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, which is only a little more than the period she has been in custody. The sentence will commence on the date of her arrest, 23 September 2010. Accordingly, she will be eligible for release on parole on 22 June 2013, and the sentence will expire in its entirety on 22 September 2014. 

19Renae Burns, for the offence of accessory after the fact to the murder of Steven Quire, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, commencing on 23 September 2010 and expiring on 22 June 2013, and a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 23 June 2013 and expiring on 22 September 2014.

2761648,Hughes v R [2013] NSWCCA 129,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.

2HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J.

3DAVIES J: On 17 February 2012 the Applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing eight counts of make a false statement with intent to obtain money contrary to s 178BB Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of cause unauthorised computer function with the intent to facilitate the commission of a serious indictable offence contrary to s 308C Crimes Act. In addition the Applicant admitted five further offences of obtaining a benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA Crimes Act which were taken into account on a Form 1. 

4All of the sentences carried a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. 

5The Sentencing Judge, Judge Williams, imposed an aggregate sentence of a non-parole period of two years and six months imprisonment with an additional term of one year and six months with the sentence commencing 24 February 2012, the non-parole period expiring on 23 August 2014 and the additional term expiring on 23 February 2016. His Honour gave an indicative sentence in relation to Count 1 taking into account the offences on the Form 1 of three years imprisonment and in relation to Counts 2 - 9, on each count two years imprisonment. 

6Count 1 was that between 13 November 2004 and 6 June 2006 with intent to obtain money for herself, the Applicant made a statement that she was not being paid by RailCorp knowing it to be false in a material particular, namely, that she was being paid by RailCorp during that period of time.
7Counts 2 - 7 and Count 9 were that between various specified dates the Applicant with intent to obtain money for Kuipers Excavations made a statement on an identified docket number that services requiring the payment of a specified sum had been rendered by that company between specified dates knowing that to be false in a material particular, namely, that Kuipers Excavations had not rendered the said services. 

8Count 8 charged that between specified dates the Applicant caused an unauthorised computer function, namely, that she accessed the PHIPS (Plant Hire Internet Procurement System) and altered the email address of Robert Katz to her own email address, knowing that function to be unauthorised and with the intent to facilitate the commission of a serious indictable offence, namely, obtaining a benefit by deception by herself. 

9The offences arose from an enquiry in 2007 by the Independent Commission Against Corruption which reported in August 2008 on an investigation into bribery and fraud at RailCorp. 

Background facts

10The agreed facts were contained in a 17 page document which the Sentencing Judge annexed to his Remarks on Sentence. They may be conveniently summarised as follows.

11The facts disclosed offending between 13 November 2004 and 5 May 2006 when the Applicant was employed by RailCorp, first, on a contractual basis from about November 2001 and then from 20 June 2005 as a temporary employee. 

12Her initial position, whilst as a contractor, was the PHIPS Support Officer/Administrator within the Infrastructure Procurement Section at Railcorp. On 22 September 2003 she was promoted to the position of Contracts Relationship Manager in that Section. From that time she was required to submit her own invoices to Railcorp for the work she did. From 20 June 2005, when she became a temporary employee, her remuneration package was $91,500.

13The Applicant admitted that during this period she and a sub-contractor Kuipers Excavations caused RailCorp to pay out $509, 637.70 through the creation of false records for work not actually carried out. Ultimately Kuipers Excavations obtained $489,108.20, of which $366,000 was passed onto the Applicant with approximately $20,000 being retained by Plant Service Managers (PSMs) who processed the invoices as administrative/management fees.

14The Applicant in her position of trust with RailCorp, supervised the payments through the RailCorp computer system to contractors for various works carried out by them for RailCorp. External PSMs were organisations that were retained by RailCorp to provide the 'plant' or 'equipment.' They organised subcontractors and charged an administrative/management fee for doing this.

15The key PSMs were Total Plant Services (TPS) and Kingston Rail Management (Kingston). One of the subcontractors they both used was Kuipers Excavations which was owned by William Kuipers. TPS and Kingston would send invoices to RailCorp which were then paid through the RailCorp computer system. The PSM would then pay the relevant subcontractor such as Kuipers Excavations.

16The Applicant was a personal friend of Mr Kuipers having worked with him previously. In around November or December 2004 the Applicant falsely told Mr Kuipers that she was not being paid by RailCorp and was in financial difficulty. The Applicant also falsely told Mr Kuipers that her boss had approved him paying her and that Mr Kuipers would then be reimbursed through the use of the Plant Service Management scheme.

17As a result of these false statements Mr Kuipers gave the Applicant $5000 on the spot and then from around 12 December 2004 a series of payments were regularly made from Kuipers Excavations' bank account to the Applicant's bank account. They were generally $5000 and made on a weekly basis. The last amount was transferred on 5 June 2006. The total amount the Applicant received in her account from Kuipers Excavations over the 18 month period was $366,000. The Applicant repeatedly told Mr Kuipers during this period that she was owed wages by RailCorp.

18The way that the Applicant recouped the funds she was receiving from Kuipers Excavations during this period was generally by falsely creating documentation in relation to work (orders). When invoices came from Kuipers Excavation falsely claiming the work had been done she authorised them to be paid from the RailCorp side.

19These false invoices were processed through the external PSMs - TPS and Kingston. After they submitted the invoices RailCorp paid the PSM who then reimbursed Kuipers Excavations less an administrative/management fee that the PSM retained.

20The charge in Count 1 was representative of the scheme outlined above. It related to the entire period between 13 November 2004 and 6 June 2006. It related to the Applicant making false statements to Mr Kuipers that she was not being paid by RailCorp during that period of time with the intention of obtaining money for herself (the $366,000) rather than Kuipers Excavations. 

21The other 7 charges of make false statement on the indictment were representative counts. They identified particular RailCorp dockets where the Applicant falsely stated that services had been rendered with the intention of Kuipers Excavations receiving money for those services which the Applicant knew had in fact not been supplied. In each case Kuipers Excavations received the relevant payment less the administrative fee retained by the PSM. The various docket numbers and amounts were set out in the terms of the indictment and the agreed facts.

22The one charge (Count 8) of cause unauthorised computer function with the intent to facilitate the commission of a serious indictable offence (obtaining a benefit by deception) related to the Applicant accessing the RailCorp system in order to re-route her supervisor's emails to her own email address so that false orders created with her supervisor as the approver would not be actually received by her supervisor. Instead, it would be forwarded to the Applicant's email address and they could be approved without her supervisor's knowledge.

23The offences on the Form 1 related to further false dockets/orders created by the Applicant for the purposes of payment being made to Kuipers Excavations. In conjunction with creating some of the false dockets the Applicant also had, on occasions, to make misrepresentations about the dockets to other people (including the general manager of TPS (Paul Knowles) and the rail manager at Kingston (Paul Roberts)) in order to ensure Kuipers Excavations were paid for work she knew they hadn't done. There were five counts of obtain benefit by deception in relation to these on a Form 1 attached to Count 1.

Subjective factors

24The frauds appear to have been carried out to sustain the Applicant's gambling habit. The Applicant gave evidence to that effect before the Sentencing Judge. In addition, the Sentencing Judge had reports from a psychologist, Mr Peter Champion, from Mr George Bowie, a gambling addictions counsellor who had been seeing the Applicant after a referral by Gamblers Anonymous in October 2006, and from the Probation and Parole Service, all of which provided largely consistent information about the Applicant's gambling addiction. 

25The Plaintiff had been sentenced on 15 August 2000 by Penrith Local Court for a number of offences of making a false representation to obtain a benefit from the Commonwealth. Those offences concerned frauds on CentreLink in respect of amounts totalling more than $100,000. The Applicant was sentenced to a six month period of periodic detention. 

26The Applicant resigned from RailCorp on 4 April 2006. She obtained the position of Club Secretary at the Penrith Junior Rugby League Football Club. Whilst in that position she defrauded the club of about $9000 in August and September 2006. She was ultimately charged with six counts of obtain money by deception and sentenced by Penrith Local Court on 20 December 2006 to 9 months home detention.

27Prior to being charged with those offences and prior to the ICAC investigation the Applicant attended Gamblers Anonymous in October 2006. The evidence suggests that she has not gambled since that time.

28The Applicant's mother gave birth to her when she was 16 years old. The mother, who was of Aboriginal descent, was an alcoholic. The Applicant's father was physically violent towards the Applicant and her mother. The relationship between the Applicant and her mother was poor.

29The Applicant was physically and sexually abused by her uncle who lived with them from the time she was six years old until she was about 12 years old. In addition, the Applicant was raped by the local shopkeeper when she was 14 years old and became pregnant as a result. With support and financial assistance from her school friends the Applicant had an abortion but had to lie about her age to have the procedure done. She was also sexually abused by another man who lived near her grandfather's place. 

30The Applicant said that from a young age she would sit and watch her father gambling on card machines and betting on the trots at the local pub. The Applicant herself had been gambling on poker machines for the past 19 years before she came to treatment with Mr Bowie shortly after attending at Gamblers Anonymous. 

31The Applicant has three children. Her eldest daughter was born when the Applicant was 18, the father being a person with whom the Applicant was in a de facto relationship. By the time of the daughter's birth she was in a relationship with another man. That relationship did not last and she married her first husband in about 1994. A son was born to that relationship. She said her husband was a controlling, materialistic man who became violent. She ended the relationship in 1998 after he had an affair.

32She met her present husband in 1999 when she was 30 years old. Although there were problems in the relationship because of her gambling and his over-use of alcohol each managed to resolve their issues and they were married when the Applicant turned 40 in about 2009. A daughter was born in 2010 and is now aged about 2 years and 8 months.

33As mentioned, the evidence was that the Applicant has not gambled since 9 October 2006 when she first went to Gamblers Anonymous and thereafter to Mr Bowie. She continued to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings. She became a sponsor to others who were dealing with gambling issues and she has given lectures to various groups to assist people to deal with gambling problems.

Grounds of appeal

34The Applicant appeals on four grounds as follows:

1. The sentencing judge erred by failing to have regard to the considerable assistance provided by the applicant and her entitlement to a discount pursuant to section 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

2. The sentencing judge erred in the conclusion that the delay in the prosecution of this case was only worthy of ""some"" mitigation on penalty.

3. The sentencing judge erred by having regard to criminality;

(a) in respect of which the applicant was not charged and

(b) which gave rise to a more serious criminality than that in respect of which the applicant was charged falling foul of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383.

4. The sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case.

Ground 1: Discount for assistance

35The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge said nothing about her offers to assist in the prosecution of the co-offender Mr Kuipers and said nothing about the operation of s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 23 enables the Court to impose a lesser penalty having regard to assistance which has been given or is undertaken to be given to law enforcement authorities.

36In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said only this:

On 24 May 2007 she agreed to speak to ICAC investigators. She fully disclosed her wrongdoing and indicated a willingness to provide further information. 

In addition, his Honour noted a submission by her counsel at the sentencing hearing that a number of matters including ""her help to the investigators"" justified a custodial penalty that could be served in the community. 

37His Honour did not make further reference to her assistance. He gave a discount of 25% for her plea of guilty and said she was entitled to a further discount (which he did not specify) for the delay in prosecution and her remorse and rehabilitation. 
38No charges were laid against Mr Kuipers arising out of the arrangement between the Applicant and him. He was prosecuted only for giving false evidence to ICAC that the Applicant was the only Railcorp officer that he had paid. In fact he had paid another person, Alan Walker. The evidence given by the Applicant to ICAC (both to the investigators and at hearings) did not relate to payments by Mr Kuipers to Mr Walker. The Crown submitted, therefore, that the value of her offer of assistance was extremely limited.

39The Applicant pointed to two letters from the Applicant's solicitor who represented her at the ICAC enquiry which were tendered to the Sentencing Judge. The first letter dated 9 July 2007 addressed to ICAC relevantly said:

Ms Hughes and myself met with you prior to the hearing and Ms Hughes showed you some documentation she had brought with her as potentially relevant. These comprised:

* File relating to a previous workplace assault discussed in the first hearing
* PHIPS system (sic) testing manual
* Chart describing the Plant Hire procurement process (2002)
* An OH&S manual developed by a Railcorp employee and apparently sold independently to a 3rd party company.

You suggested that these be tendered as exhibits per s35 and this subsequently occurred

During the pre-hearing discussion, Ms Hughes volunteered a number of subject areas you might wish to question her on, including the abovementioned OH&S manual.

...

You confirmed that Ms Hughes' evidence had been useful to ICAC's broader investigation of Railcorp, although the actual value would have to be assessed in some detail as the investigation progressed. Only then could ICAC provide documentation which could be used on sentencing Ms Hughes in relation to future criminal charges.

40The second letter dated 21 December 2011 relevantly said:

It appeared to me that Renea's cooperation with the ICAC investigation, including a lengthy interview and compulsory examination, could scarcely have been more complete. From ICAC's initial contact she appeared to be at pains to at least partially atone for her wrongdoing by making full and frank disclosure not only as to her own activities but as to the activities of others. It was understood at the time that ICAC would acknowledge Renea's assistance by providing a letter which could be used in sentencing proceedings. 

No letter or documentation was provided by ICAC as the letters envisaged.

41The Applicant drew attention to the particular matters in s 23(2) which the sentencing court is bound to consider and submitted that a combined discount of 60% should have been given for the early plea and the assistance.

42Subsequent to the hearing of the appeal, and with leave, the Applicant filed two affidavits annexing portions of ICAC's report into corruption at RailCorp and into the fraud concerning the Applicant and Mr Kuipers. The report acknowledged the extensive admissions made by the Applicant both in the course of her evidence before the public enquiry (given following a declaration made pursuant to s 38 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988) and also to the previously made admissions when she was interviewed by ICAC investigators on 24 May 2007. 

43In referring the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions the report noted that there were numerous witnesses who would be potentially available to the DPP to attest to relevant activities on the part of the Applicant. Nevertheless, that is not to diminish the significance of the early admissions made by her. 

44The particular part of the report dealing with Mr and Mrs Kuipers found that Mr and Mrs Kuipers were aware that the Applicant was not entitled to the money she obtained through their assistance and that Kuipers Excavations' recovery of the funds was dishonest. The report summarised the evidence ICAC relied on to reach that conclusion. It is clear from that summary that there was a great deal of evidence, quite independent of admissions made by Ms Hughes, that enabled the ICAC to reach that conclusion.

45It is clear, nevertheless, that the Applicant did assist, and undertook to assist, law enforcement authorities in the investigation of or in proceedings relating to the offences for which she was charged. She did so at an early time (s 23(2)(e)), the evidence was truthful and reliable (s 23(2)(c)) and its nature was such that, as ICAC recognised, her evidence would have been relevant if Mr and Mrs Kuipers had been prosecuted for their part in the fraud (s 23(2)(d)). The assistance was of limited usefulness but that was partly because Mr and Mrs Kuipers were not prosecuted for their involvement in the fraud (s 23(2)(b)).

46Section 23(4) requires the Court, which imposes a lesser penalty because the offender has assisted or undertaken to assist law enforcement authorities, to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed and to state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced by taking into account the assistance. The Sentencing Judge did not do that.

47Where his Honour made no express reference to any discount for assistance nor to s 23 of the Act it is reasonable to infer that no discount was provided for the assistance: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 234 per Hunt J. The assistance was given but it was limited. In my opinion a discount of 10% ought to have been given.

48This ground is made out.

Ground 2: Delay in prosecution

49The Applicant appears to have first been interviewed by ICAC investigators on 24 May 2007. At that time she made relevant admissions. Public hearings followed and the report was issued in August 2008. The matter was referred to the Office of the DPP but Court Attendance Notices were not sent to the Applicant until 17 March 2011. 

50In relation to delay his Honour said this:

It is not disputed that there has been a significant delay in the prosecution by which she is entitled to some mitigation of penalty.

A little later he said:
As to delay, where an offender has been left in uncertain suspense and has demonstrated rehabilitation in the intervening period, as well as the public interest in serious offending being dealt with quickly and fairly, then that requires that the delay be taken into account on sentence and I refer there to the case of R v Blanco (1999) NSWCCA 121. Ms Hughes was of course in a trusted position, administering payments within a system designed to try and minimise fraud and/or corruption.

Finally he said:

She is entitled to a twenty-five per cent discount for her plea of guilty and she is also entitled to a further discount for the delay in prosecution and her remorse and rehabilitation.

His Honour did not specify what the further discount was.

51In Blanco v R [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 Wood CJ at CL (with whom Bell J and Smart AJ agreed) said:

[15] His Honour, as I have already indicated, expressly stated that he had not overlooked the fact of delay, however, it does not appear from the reasons for sentence precisely what reduction was given for that factor.

[16] The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: See, in addition to Todd and Mill, the decisions in Harrison (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199 and King (Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 24 February 1998).
...

[26] Having regard to those decisions, I have reached the conclusion that the present sentence falls outside the legitimate range once allowance is made for the inordinate and unexplained delay in the prosecution of the appellant... The adjustment, however, is not an adjustment which I consider should be particularly significant having regard to the very substantial criminality of the present offender.

52In R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 the delay in sentencing the appellant arose from a sentence he was serving in Queensland for offences committed in that state just after he committed offences in New South Wales. The sentencing judge had said that the only relevance of the Queensland sentence was the light that it might shed on his rehabilitation.

53Street CJ (with whom Moffitt P and Nagle CJ at CL agreed) said (at 519):

I have formed the conclusion that his Honour fell into error in thus
placing aside the sentences served by the appellant in Queensland as having no relevance except in so far as they may shed some light upon his present state of rehabilitation.

...

Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether
due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls
for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue
degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.

54This reasoning was endorsed in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 65-66 where it was made clear that the principle is not confined to the fixing of the non-parole period but applies also to the fixing of the head sentence.

55Two matters are significant in the present case relevant to the issue of delay. First, the Applicant married her present husband and gave birth to their child (her third child) in the period between the first admissions made by her to investigators in May 2007 and when she was first charged on 17 March 2011. Secondly, there was significant evidence of rehabilitation from the time she first approached Gamblers Anonymous in October 2006 and the time she was sentenced.

56Mr Bowie said in his report dated 16 February 2012:

Based on my experience in the last 13 years of treating people with gambling addiction and the associated underlying issues, I would go as far as to say that of any recovering problem gambler I have treated were to relapse, Renea would be the last person I would expect to do so. Therefore the likelihood of Renea re-offending as a result of gambling appears to be significantly minimal.

57In his report dated 17 July 2011 Mr Champion said:

[20] ... She reported that she had not gambled for 4 years, 9 months and 7 days (as of the day I saw her), and not unreasonably took some pride in this; she also speaking of the role she was playing in assisting other gamblers in various ways, including public speaking.

...

[39] In regards to her prognosis the obvious concern is that Ms Hughes has now on 3 separated occasions and in 3 different contexts been involved in personal dishonesty. The further concern is that she gives a history of gambling from age 18 or so until some 4 1/2 years ago. The further concern is that she does not appear to be psychologically well. If she can continue to avoid gambling and can utilise treatment in various forms then this could serve to limit the risk of further similar offending. I note her report that she has assisted other gamblers either through the Wesley program (including public speaking) or those involved in home detention. If as she says she has avoided gambling for 4+ years then this is clearly as positive sign, though in the end, given the risk factors I could not rate her prognosis as better than guarded, though on the face of it progress has been made in addressing some of the major risk factors.

58 As in Blanco the delay is unexplained. By comparison with Todd, the delay was not connected with other criminality of the Applicant. If it is appropriate to provide leniency (even ""undue leniency"") in the case of delay brought about by wrongdoing on an applicant's part it must follow that where there is unexplained delay of a lengthy period during which there has been progress towards rehabilitation and/or a change of circumstances that increases the hardship brought about by a custodial sentence it may be appropriate for a court to impose a sentence that would otherwise be considered to fall below the range of an appropriate sentence taking into account all other matters.

59Although the Sentencing Judge said that the Applicant is entitled to some discount for delay he has neither specified what that discount was nor what his notional starting point for the sentence was. It must be assumed that he has discounted for the delay but in the absence of any figures it is not possible to determine if this ground of appeal has been made out. Application of the principles discussed above will be considered further when dealing with Ground 4. 

Ground 3: Having regard to matters not the subject of the charges

60In her written submissions the Applicant pointed to a number of findings made by the Sentencing Judge concerning moneys taken totalling $366,000. It was submitted that the Remarks showed that the Sentencing Judge sentenced the Applicant as if she had been charged with larceny by a servant whereas the charges only concerned amounts totalling $125,000 from the time that she was employed by RailCorp. 

61In her oral submissions the Applicant acknowledged that the Crown was entitled to rely upon the fact of $366,000 being obtained pursuant to the first count. The argument in relation to this ground was put on the basis that the Sentence Judge had found as an aggravating feature that the Applicant was an employee of RailCorp throughout the time of the fraudulent scheme and that she was being paid $91,000 per year as salary there. This was said to offend the principle articulated in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.

62The approach taken by the Applicant in her oral submissions of accepting the relevance for sentencing purposes of the receipt of the $366,000 was entirely appropriate bearing in mind the agreed facts upon which the Applicant had been sentenced. Those facts made it clear that the counts on the indictment and the Form 1 were representative counts and that the payments made to the Applicant had totalled $366,000. 

63Whilst it is certainly the case that the Sentencing Judge appears to have assumed that the Applicant became an employee of RailCorp in November 2001, and made reference elsewhere in his remarks to her annual salary of approximately $91,000, two things are clear. First, when the Applicant became an employee of RailCorp she was paid $91,000 per year and she continued with the fraudulent scheme during the whole time she was so employed. Secondly, even when she was not an employee of RailCorp but was contracted to them she was in an undoubted position of trust by reason of the contractual arrangements. 

64Although not directly employed by Railcorp before 20 June 2005 her position (as noted earlier) from 22 September 2003 was Contracts Relationship Manager in Infrastructure Procurement. It was by reason of that position, and later as a direct employee of RailCorp, that she was able to implement and pursue the fraudulent scheme. The positions were ones of trust as she acknowledged in the agreed facts. 

65It seems to me that the Sentencing Judge's error in referring to her as an employee with RailCorp from November 2001 is an error of no substance in all of the circumstances. It cannot be said that the Sentencing Judge regarded her position as an employee as one of aggravation in a manner inconsistent with the principle in De Simoni at 389 per Gibbs CJ. The significant point was not her employment so much as the breach of trust involved in the positions which she occupied that enabled the fraud to be perpetrated.

66This ground is not made out.

Ground 4: Sentence manifestly excessive

67If it is assumed that the only discount provided by the Sentencing Judge was the 25% for the early plea the notional starting point was a little over 5 years and 4 months. As noted earlier, although no discount was specified for ""delay in prosecution and her remorse and rehabilitation"", the Sentencing Judge said that she was entitled to further discount for those matters. It must be assumed, therefore, that the notional starting point was higher. The Applicant, in her written submissions, said:

The sentence in this case reflects a starting point of just shy of five and half (sic) years full time imprisonment. This starting point presumably reflects some amelioration on account of delay.

Where that starting point is derived is not apparent.

68If the Sentencing Judge discounted a further 5% for delay, remorse and rehabilitation the starting point would have been approximately 5 years and 9 months. If discounted by 10% the starting point would have been a little over 6 years. The latter seems to be the minimum discount likely because it embraced three matters.

69Because Ground 1 is made out it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the Applicant. On the assumption that 6 years imprisonment was the notional starting point I do not consider that that sentence is manifestly excessive. Even bearing in mind the Applicant's gambling addiction and favourable subjective circumstances this was a systematic fraud planned and perpetrated over a lengthy period of time involving a large amount of money. It was only possible because of the position of trust the Applicant enjoyed with Railcorp. It is difficult to see how such a sentence could not be said to be within the range of sentences that might have been imposed by the Sentencing Judge. 

70The Applicant already had a conviction for a number of offences involving frauds concerning more that $100,000 from CentreLink. Despite that conviction the Applicant does not appear to have done anything to deal with her addiction. The further frauds on the football club, although taking place after the RailCorp frauds, were at least relevant to questions of personal deterrence and retribution. 

71As noted earlier, the Sentencing Judge erred in not providing a further discount for assistance given and offered by the Applicant. That discount should have been 10%. The discount for delay, remorse and rehabilitation provided for by the Sentencing Judge has been assumed at 10%. I consider that that is an appropriate discount. With the discount for the early plea the sentence of 6 years should be discounted by 45% to produce an overall sentence of 3 years and 3 months. 

72The Sentencing Judge found special circumstances and was correct to do so. The Applicant's chances of rehabilitation were demonstrated to be good from the various reports tendered at the sentencing hearing. His Honour fixed the non-parole period at 62% of the overall sentence. It is appropriate to maintain that proportion on the re-sentencing. With slight rounding down the non-parole period is 2 years commencing 24 February 2012 and expiring 23 February 2014 with an additional term of 1 year and 3 months expiring 23 May 2015. I would not alter the indicative sentences. 

73It can be seen from the above discussion that assumptions have had to be made about the approach the Sentencing Judge took to the sentencing process. That has made the re-sentencing more difficult because care needed to be taken to avoid a higher notional starting point than the primary judge apparently employed. 

74There is a tension in the authorities about whether specific figures ought to be put on discounts for various factors that are taken into account on sentencing. Many of the authorities were discussed in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. Cases in related areas include R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 and Kite v R [2009] NSWCCA 12 (remorse); Lewins v R [2007] NSWCA 189; (2007) 175 A Crim R 40 at [17], [19]-[20] (""Ellis"" discount).

75The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 23(4) requires the court to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed if no discount for assistance was given. The common law position was similar: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [51]. The Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 21E requires a discount for future assistance to be specified for Commonwealth offences. Thomson at [160] encourages the quantification for the plea of guilty. Recent authority in this Court points to a need to specify each discount separately: LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70 at [44] - [46].

76In R v PPB [1999] NSWCCA 360 Kirby J (with the agreement of Simpson J) discussed a discount for assistance. He said at [29]:

It was said to be unnecessary to quantify the precise level of the discount (Regina v Gallagher, per Gleeson CJ at p 227), although that remark was made before the Crimes Act and the Criminal Appeals Act were amended. In 1992 s442B was introduced into the Crimes Act, and s5DA into the Criminal Appeals Act. I believe, in the light of these provisions, it is prudent for a sentencing judge to include the arithmetic by which he or she arrives at the appropriate sentence. When the starting point is not identified, and the discount not specified, a person who has provided assistance may be left with a sense of grievance.

(Section 442B was the predecessor to s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 5DA deals with Crown appeals where a person whose sentence was discounted for assistance fails to provide that assistance.)

77The dangers adverted to in SZ v R at [4] -[11], Lewins at [20]-[21] and R v MAK at [44] need to be heeded, and it must be remembered that sentencing is an intuitive process and a formulaic approach should ordinarily be avoided (Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624; Thomson at [56] ff), but unless either the discount for discrete matters (cf remorse or perhaps the ""Ellis"" discount) or the notional starting point is disclosed there will be difficulties for this Court in any re-sentencing process. This is particularly so where, as in this case, the Sentencing Judge has said that the Applicant was ""entitled to a further discount for the delay"". Further, in cases involving co-offenders challenges on the basis of parity may not be able to be easily resolved. 

78A reading of Wood CJ at CL's judgment in Blanco at [15] suggests that he was of the view that the primary judge in that case ought to have specified what the reduction was for the delay.

Conclusion

79I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Allow the appeal.

(3)Quash the sentence imposed by Judge Williams. In lieu impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 24 February 2012 and expiring 23 February 2014 with an additional term of 1 year and 3 months expiring 23 May 2015.

2761660,R v Shailer [2013] NSWDC 338,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: It is rare to find an offence of break enter and steal being dealt with in this Court where the offender is not motivated by a desire to obtain money for drugs. This case is no exception. Mark Shailer is now to be sentenced for three offences of break enter and steal committed on 18 May, 30 June and 29 June 2012. When I sentence him for the first of those matters he asks that I take into account a further offence of break enter and steal also committed on 18 May 2012. The two offences on 18 May were committed while Mr Shailer was on parole, he having been released a relative short time earlier.
	
	
	Mr Shailer accurately says that at the age of 36 he has done nothing with his life to date. He has never worked, he has barely studied and drug abuse has been a significant feature of his life. It is a terribly sad state of affairs to see someone wasting the only life he has as Mr Shailer has been up till now.
	
	
	In each case the offender broke into business premises where he stole in, some cases, significant items, whilst in other cases all he got was a few coins. In all cases he caused damage to the property as he broke in so the overall loss that Mr Shailer has been responsible for is significant, but it must be recognised that these offences are less serious than those where offenders break into residential premises and steal items, often of little monetary value but of great sentimental value. I am not attempting at all to minimise the seriousness of Mr Shailer’s wrongdoing but it is to be recognised that most offences of break enter and steal do involve residential premises where, in the ordinary course of events, householders suffer greatly not only through financial loss but also through loss of sentimental items and through very real feelings of apprehension at having their homes broken into and their security invaded. No doubt the owners of these business premises also feel similar things but that would be to a much lesser extent. Mr Shailer himself appreciates something along the lines of what I have just been saying, he does not want to commit an offence where he is likely to come face to face with a person against whom he is committing that offence.
	
	
	It is not necessary to go through the facts of these offences in any detail at all. In each case physical force was used to break into premises causing damage on the way and Mr Shailer took whatever he could. With one possible exception he did not, as is unfortunately common, take the opportunity of gratuitously vandalising any property whilst inside, the one possible exception is that on one occasion the owner of the premises discovered that a cash box which had held money was now filled with liquid soap.
	
	
	Mr Shailer was arrested having helpfully assisted the police by leaving behind on two occasions blood containing his DNA and on the other two occasions his fingerprints. It was not a terribly difficult job to work out who was responsible for these offences and when confronted by police Mr Shailer accurately described things as an open and shut case. He committed these offences to get money for drugs having had problems with drug addiction for a very long time indeed.
	
	
	Mr Shailer’s upbringing was unstable, his parents separated before he was born and he was brought up by his mother. She was described by Mr Shailer as a workaholic who worked in pubs and nightclubs and who moved around fairly regularly. He was brought up by his grandmother for a little while but she died when Mr Shailer was 12 or 13. A rather obvious feature of Mr Shailer’s upbringing was the lack of any parental guidance as regards proper behaviour. There appears to have been little rule setting by his mother and after Mr Shailer’s grandmother died he lost all pro-social supports. He left school at around this time, not because he was incapable of learning, indeed the evidence would suggest to the contrary, but because of his poor behaviour.
	
	
	He is described in a psychological report tendered on his behalf as something of a risk taker. The comment is made in the report about the number of broken bones for example. Mr Shailer has described himself as something of an Evel Knievel as a child, seemingly having little concern for his own safety.
	
	
	Mr Shailer recognises more than anybody else probably the difficulties that he now faces in rehabilitating himself. He said to me in evidence that he was afraid of getting out of gaol and would not have a clue on how to live a normal life. Those things are probably fairly accurate. Mr Shailer appears to have spent almost half his life, not half his adult life, but half his life in gaol and since his first custodial sentence the longest that he has ever been out of gaol appears to have been just over a year. There is a depressing history of release from custody and then in only a matter of months going back inside after new offences were committed. At 36 nothing appears to be changing. As I mentioned very early in these remarks on sentence Mr Shailer’s first offence, for which he must be sentenced today, came about when he was on parole.
	
	
	But what do we do with Mr Shailer and more importantly what do we do to protect the community, because every time Mr Shailer commits an offence someone is harmed? The answer is simply not to put Mr Shailer inside for longer and longer periods of time, the answer must be that efforts must be made to break the cycle that Mr Shailer is currently in. The psychological report concludes by referring to programs that Mr Shailer can undertake in order to promote his rehabilitation. One of those is the compulsory drug treatment correctional centre program. As it turns out the sentence that I have decided to impose upon Mr Shailer will make him eligible for that program.
	
	
	I should mention one matter concerning Mr Shailer’s rehabilitation. He is currently an E-classification prisoner, having an offence of escape on his criminal history. It is not for me to question the wisdom of that classification remaining for a short period of time after an offence of escape, but it must be recognised that prisoners with that classification receive much fewer opportunities for rehabilitation. Things such as work release are often denied prisoners with E classification and yet sometimes that is exactly what is required for a prisoner to be able to learn how to live outside gaol. It is my firm recommendation that early attention is given to Mr Shailer’s classification and that unless there are clear and demonstrable reasons for the classification remaining it should be removed.
	
	
	Mr Shailer has been serving unrelated sentences from when he first went into custody on 6 August last year until 5 January 2013. Since that date his custody is solely referrable to these offences. I will commence the sentences I will shortly announce from 5 January 2013 but of course in selecting the sentences that I will impose I have taken account of the principle of totality. The fact that my sentences will be accumulative on other sentences is also a matter relevant to the finding of special circumstances that I will make, but that is not the only reason I will find special circumstances at all. If Mr Shailer is to be rehabilitated so that future members of the community are not harmed, as Mr Shailer has harmed people in the past, then a great of attention is going to have to be paid to Mr Shailer after his release from custody. It may be, for example, that it will be a condition of his parole that he enter a residential rehabilitation program. It will not be for me to decide what is going to happen to Mr Shailer but I can say that he is one prisoner who, unless serious efforts are made to rehabilitate him whilst he is on parole, will commit further offences which will see him not only back in gaol but other members of the community suffering as a result.
	
	
	Mr Shailer, consistent with his acknowledgement of his guilt when he was first spoken to by police, pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences I have decided to set are 25% less than they otherwise would have been.
	
	
	I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence. Where if I were to have imposed individual sentences I would have sentenced Mr Shailer to imprisonment for two and a half years for the first offence, taking into account the Form 1 and the fact that he was on parole and that there was a more significant loss in that matter than other offences, and for the second and third offences I would have sentenced him to imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	Instead I impose an aggregate sentence, consisting of a non-parole of two and a half years and a head sentence of five years to commence from 5 January 2013. That means that Mr Shailer will be eligible to be released to parole on 4 July 2015. I recommend that he be referred to the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre program for assessment whether he is suitable for the program.
	
	
	I will note that it appears that Mr Shailer’s usual place of residence is within the locations covered by the compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre order.

		16 September 2015",2013-06-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761664,R v Shelford No 2 [2013] NSWDC 158,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 19 April 2013 I delivered some remarks concerning the offences committed by Mr Shelford and his subjective circumstances. For reasons I then explained I determined that the length of the sentence was such that an ICO would be an option. The matter was therefore adjourned so that Mr Shelford could be assessed as to his suitability to serve his sentence by way of an intensive correction order. That report has now become available. It indicates Mr Shelford's suitability. Consistent with what I said earlier I will impose a sentence of imprisonment but order that it be served by way of an intensive correction order.

2There are two offences for which Mr Shelford must be sentenced. The first is a State offence of possessing child abuse material and the second is a Commonwealth offence of using a carriage service to transmit child pornographic material. When sentencing him for that Commonwealth offence he asked that I take into account another Commonwealth matter, this appearing on a schedule under s 16BA of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. That is an offence of using a carriage service to access child pornographic material.

3The offences are interrelated representing various things that Mr Shelford did involving the internet and in particular chat logs and photographs and other images including videos. Because they are interrelated I have decided to impose concurrent sentences on the two separate offences. 

4The order I make is this. For the State offence of possessing child abuse material, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two years. For the Commonwealth offence taking into account the matter to be taken into account the offender is also sentenced to imprisonment for two years. Those sentences are to be served concurrently. 

5I order that the sentences be served by way of an intensive corrections order. Those sentences will commence on 17 June 2013. The intensive corrections orders are subject to the mandatory conditions prescribed. It is important that Mr Shelford understand that he must obey those rules. If he fails to do so, the intensive correction order can be cancelled and he can be required to serve his sentence by way of fulltime imprisonment. A full copy of the mandatory conditions will be provided to Mr Shelford at the Registry.

		28 August 2013",2013-06-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761665,R v Hua [2013] NSWDC 115,"SENTENCE

1 The offender Mr Hua, Dai Huy Hua pleaded guilty at an early stage to one offence against s 400.9(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime, sometimes described as an offence of money laundering. 

2The amount involved in Mr Hua's offending was very large indeed, more than $3 million. Anyone wanting to know how much space $3 million takes up need only look at exhibit 2 in this case. It is a significant amount, not only in terms of the dollar amounts but also in terms of the volume that such a sum of money occupies. 

3How did Mr Hua get involved in this offence? His de facto wife Maggie Quan gave evidence to the court which was not challenged in cross-examination. She and the offender came with their two sons to Australia for a holiday. When they came to Sydney at first they stayed with a friend of Mr Hua's called Ms Lee, however Ms Quan was uncomfortable. One of the reasons she was uncomfortable was that there were large sums of cash being dealt with by Ms Lee. The family therefore moved to a hotel. However when the time came to return to Hong Kong Mr Hua told Ms Quan that he was going to stay. He said that Ms Lee had asked him to stay to look after the money because she had to go overseas to visit her daughter. 

4Despite Ms Quan's sensible wishes that her husband not do what he was planning to do, he remained in Australia when she and their two sons returned to Hong Kong. It was after that, until the offender's arrest on 9 January 2013, that the offender committed the offence. It seems to be accepted that Ms Lee was involved in an enormous money laundering operation and that Mr Hua's involvement was to step into the breach when Ms Lee was unable to do what she had been doing because she was overseas. In other words it seems to be accepted that Mr Hua's involvement was for a closed period and that he was doing so at the request of someone much more significantly involved in crime than he was.

5On the other hand he was told that he was going to be paid $10,000 for a little over a month's work. He clearly was aware at least of the possibility that what he was doing was wrong, but obviously the money was too much of an attraction. It was probably the money that overcame what should have been his proper response to his wife's objections. His wife also gave evidence that he was a trustworthy person and had known Ms Lee for a long time and trusted her.

6In terms of assessing the objective criminality, the amount of money is enormous but balanced against that is the circumstance of the offender's limited involvement. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for three years. Mr Hua pleaded guilty at an early stage so I will reflect his willingness to assist in the administration of justice by imposing a sentence which is twenty-five percent less than it would otherwise have been. Mr Hua is not a man of unblemished character, he has served time in prison in Canada, a country of which he is a citizen, for offences involving ecstasy. 

7When not in custody in Australia he lives with his de facto wife in Hong Kong. That relationship has been in place for about twelve years and the relationship is clearly a positive one and ongoing, Ms Quan returning to Australia from Hong Kong to support her husband including giving evidence in his sentencing proceedings. 

8Because he is not a Hong Kong citizen he is unable to work there at least not officially. He works as a tennis coach apparently but he has been unemployed and financially dependent on Ms Quan despite that work. 

9Both Mr Crown and Mr Wilkinson for the offender rely on a number of other cases in order to assist me in determining the appropriate sentence in this case. It is clear that offences such as these are serious. The authorities seek to deal with illegal behaviour not only by taking steps to prevent it occurring in the first place but also by taking steps to ensure that the proceeds of crime are not available to those criminals. We do not know where this money came from but it was unlikely to be regular lotto winnings, it was clearly the proceeds of crime. The amounts involved demonstrate just how lucrative the crimes were, whatever the criminal behaviour turned out to be. For those reasons a sentence of imprisonment is required, Mr Hua has been in custody for almost five months. There is not a great deal of difference between the sentence suggested by Mr Wilkinson and the sentence suggested by Mr Crown. 

10I have taken into account in formulating the appropriate sentence that Mr Hua will be serving his sentence in a foreign country away from regular visits by his family in a country where the language most often spoken, English, is not his first language. Of course not too much can be made of this as it was Mr Hua's decision to commit his crime in a foreign country and he can scarcely complain if he is required to serve a sentence there. 

11The offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a head sentence of eighteen months to date from 9 January 2013. Mr Hua is to be released on a recognisance release order self in the sum of $100 after serving a period of imprisonment of nine months. That means that the earliest date on which Mr Hua will be released is 8 October this year.. The recognisance release order will run for a further nine months.

12Mr Hua do you understand what I've done?

13OFFENDER: Yes.

14HIS HONOUR: You must serve nine months in gaol but that starts from when you first went into custody, so you've got about four months to go before you will be released. It is not a matter for me but I expect that once you are released you will be deported.

2761666,R (Commonwealth) v Paul James [2013] NSWDC 113,"SENTENCE CORRECTION

1This is a case where I sentenced a man for a series of child pornography offences. I sentenced him on 4 November 2011. 

2The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions prosecuted the case. The Director has now made an application under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for me to re-open the proceedings. The Director argues that some of the penalties which I imposed are contrary to law. 

3Ms M Catsanos appears for the Director and Mr R G Turnbull of counsel appears for the offender whose name is Paul James. 

4The Court of Criminal Appeal has said that the power given by the section should be construed widely. 

5Ms Catsanos has pointed to two errors. 

6The first is mathematical and straightforward. In respect of count 5, I sentenced the offender to a term of 6 years and 3 months to date from 14 May 2012 and I said in my order that that sentence expired on 13 September 2018. Obviously my mathematics were wrong and the date 13 September 2018 is contrary to law because it exceeds the sentence which I specified; or perhaps better expressed it does not represent the sentence required to be imposed by law which I had just announced. 

7Accordingly, I amend my sentence in respect of count 5 by deleting 13 September 2018 and substituting 13 August 2018. 

8I should add at this point that I have heard from both Ms Catsanos and Mr Turnbull on the issues that I am determining and they are both in agreement. 

9The other item which needs correction concerns my sentence for count 16 and the non-parole period which I fixed for all of the sentences. My sentence in respect of count 16 is recorded as being a fixed term of 1 year from 14 September 2011 expiring 13 September 2012. The mathematics were right in that case but Ms Catsanos argues that I overlooked s 19AB(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I think she is right. There appears to be no power for me to fix a fixed term. 

10Accordingly, the sentence in respect of count 16 will be simply expressed as a sentence. That sentence is the same length with the same commencement and expiry dates. I would amend the order which I made to delete the word 'fixed' in respect of count 16. 

11Ms Catsanos pointed out that my order in respect of the single non parole period needs to be consequently adjusted to take into account my need now to fix the non-parole period in respect of count 16. 

12Accordingly, I will amend the order which I made in respect of the single non parole period by deleting the number 15 and substituting the number 16 in the expression 1-15; by deleting 3 years 11 months and substituting 4 years and 3 months; by deleting 14/1/12 and substituting 14/9/11. The effect of that is that the non-parole period which I intended to fix still expires on the same day, namely 13 December 2015. The overall non parole period is still 4 years and 3 months which was my intention expressed in my remarks on sentence. The single non-parole period now also applies to count 16. 

HIS HONOUR: I think that's it, Ms Catsanos. Do you agree? 

CATSANOS: I agree, your Honour. Seems appropriate to me. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Turnbull, do you agree? 

TURNBULL: I agree, your Honour, nothing further. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you, both.

2761678,R v Ray [2013] NSWSC 767,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Jole Ki Ray, the offender, is to be sentenced for the murder of Ms Priscilla Perry at The Entrance on 9 April 2011. He was found guilty of this offence by a jury on 9 May 2013 after a trial at Newcastle. 

2The killing of Ms Perry was not something that the offender intended or planned. What he did intend was to inflict really serious bodily harm upon her in a savage assault with his fists and feet. This occurred when he exploded in rage as a result of a combination of relatively trivial matters at a time when Ms Perry was particularly vulnerable. 

3The offender is a violent man, particularly against women. He killed Ms Perry only two months after having been released on parole in respect of the brutal assault of another young woman.

4The crime of murder is one that is punishable by imprisonment for life. The maximum penalty for an offence is reserved for those falling in the worst case category of their type. It has not been suggested by the Crown that a life sentence should be imposed in this case and that concession is realistic.

5In determining the appropriate sentence it is necessary that the statutory guideposts of the maximum penalty and the prescribed standard non-parole period of 20 years be borne in mind, along with all other facts and circumstances pertaining to the offence and the offender.

Pricilla Perry

6Before turning to the offence and the offender I want to say something about Ms Perry. 

7She was 37 years old. She completed Year 12 at high school and thereafter worked in the food and hospitality industries. She is described as having ""worked very hard to become a very good pastry cook"" and she was skilled at cake decoration. She had her own difficulties in life but remained a kind, caring and loving family member. In turn she was much loved and her passing has left a considerable void in the lives of many.

8I wish to acknowledge the grief of Ms Perry's mother, step-father and brother who bravely made victim impact statements that were tendered at the sentencing hearing this morning and two of which were read. I again thank them for providing such valuable insights into the life of their beloved Priscilla and I extend my sincere condolences. 

Criminal history

9Before turning to the facts of the case I will also say something about the offender's criminal history in order to provide some context. It includes offences of violence as well as of dishonesty but I will focus largely upon the former.

10The offender was born in 1981 and so he is now aged 32. His criminal history commenced at the age of 14 when he was dealt with for a number of offences including three of assault. The worst of these attracted a custodial sentence of 3 months.

11At the age of 15 he was placed on probation for two years for breaching an apprehended violence order. 

12Six months later, at age 16, he was cautioned for breaching an apprehended domestic violence order (""ADVO"") on two separate occasions. 

13A little over a year later he was placed on probation for 2 years for contravening an ADVO and resisting a police officer in the execution of the officer's duty. 

14A couple of months after that he was put on an 18 month bond to be of good behaviour for another offence of resisting a police officer.

15At age 18 he was dealt with for two offences of assaulting a police officer. 

16At 20, and while on probation for a dishonesty offence, he was convicted for an assault and placed on a good behaviour bond for 2 years. This assault was upon a security guard at a hospital.

17Within 6 months he was charged with an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was sentenced to 6 months weekend detention. That incident involved an unprovoked attack using a steering lock implement upon a total stranger, causing a large cut to the victim's head which required sutures as well as grazing, swelling and bruising to the body. The victim ran off and the offender chased him for a short distance but then came back and set about damaging the victim's car by smashing various windows. This occurred, of course, while the offender was the subject of a good behaviour bond.

18Having to attend gaol two days a week did not deter Mr Ray. A month after that sentence was imposed he was charged and convicted of assault and of resisting a police officer in the execution of the officer's duty. He was sentenced to full-time gaol for 6 months. The assault concerned the offender's father. He went to his parents' home one day asking for money. Eventually his father gave him some money and he left. However, a short time later he returned and punched his father in the head a number of times. Police went to the offender's home the following day to arrest him. He violently resisted the officers, even after having been sprayed with capsicum spray and struck with batons in attempts to quell his aggression. 

19While still the subject of the earlier mentioned 2 year bond, and also while serving the 6 month gaol sentence, he contravened another ADVO. Prior to going to gaol he had been in an intimate relationship with a 14 year old girl, Jasmine, which was against her parents' wishes. He wrote numerous love letters and the like and made telephone calls to her from gaol in breach of a condition of the order which prohibited him having any contact with her. He was placed on another good behaviour bond, this one for 12 months.

20Two months later, on 26 December 2002 and having been released from gaol only days before, he breached this ADVO again by calling the child, telling her that he loved her and that ""if someone is giving you any crap, I'll get them for you"". For this he was sentenced to a nominal term of imprisonment.

21In about early 2003 the offender commenced a relationship with a woman by the name of Kiera. She ended the relationship on 15 November 2003. But the following morning he went to the home where Kiera was with her mother and younger siblings. He was aggressive and abusive and threatened Kiera that he would ""punch her fucken face in"". He was convicted for two offences of intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm and was sentenced to 7 months gaol, with a non-parole period of 21 days. It was recommended that he receive counselling whilst in custody for drug and alcohol issues as well as anger management and he was to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service following his release on parole. 

22A little over a month after being released on parole he was charged and convicted for assault and contravening an ADVO. He was gaoled for a further 6 months and his parole for the previous matter was revoked. These offences involved him having moved to live with Kiera in a caravan park in Maitland. This alone constituted a breach of the ADVO. One day in January 2004, after drinking a considerable amount of alcohol, he assaulted Kiera by pulling her by the hair back into the caravan as she had attempted to leave. She then ran away but he pursued her and then assaulted her, including by punching her to the nose and mouth.

23In November 2004, at the age of 23, he was charged with aggravated enter dwelling with intent to steal. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months. Offences of assaulting and resisting a police officer in the execution of the officer's duty were taken into account. They involved him kicking and head-butting the officers who arrested him for the primary offence. It ultimately took four officers to bring him under control when he continued his violent conduct at the police station. The primary offence involved the offender and another person entering a home and assaulting the occupants whilst demanding money. I was told that the sentencing judge found that the offender required an extended period of parole supervision and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.

24He was released on parole at the age of 25 on 15 February 2007. He was back before the Local Court the following December when he was gaoled for a total of 12 months, with a non-parole period of 9 months, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault. These offences were committed while he was on parole. They involved assaults upon Ms Tyla Singleton (a prosecution witness in the trial) and Ms Kristy Woods (his cousin) after leaving a hotel at closing time. Ms Singleton sustained bruising to an eye and a small laceration to the back of her head. Ms Woods sustained soreness to an eye, lip and lower back. The offender was arrested immediately afterwards and it was found that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for having breached his parole; it having been revoked by the Parole Authority in August 2007.

25The offender served his sentence and was again released on parole on 5 December 2008. A little over 3 months later he was charged with damaging property. The offender and Ms Singleton had been in a relationship but she ended it. About two weeks later he argued with her to the extent that she sought to flee in her car. He jumped onto the bonnet and smashed the front windscreen. Although the 3 month sentence he received for this offence expired in July 2009, he remained in custody serving the balance of parole from earlier sentences until 21 October 2009.

26In April 2010, he was charged with assaulting Ms Shantell Dargan and causing her actual bodily harm. They had been in a relationship for about 6 months. On the day in question they had consumed alcohol and drugs. He became angry with her. He punched her in the face and kicked her to the body and face. Her nose began to bleed and some of the blood got onto his shirt. For this he punched her to the face, grabbed her hair, punched her to the face again and pushed her to the floor. He then left her to clean his shirt and some towels. A short time later he spat on her and punched her to the face again. She ended up on the ground where he kicked her to the body. She suffered a broken nose as well as bruising and soreness to her torso. Photographs taken of her in hospital show large areas of her face were dark purple and both eyes were so swollen they were completely closed.

27For this the offender was sentenced in the Local Court to 20 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months. He appealed against the severity of the sentence and the District Court reduced it to one of 16 months with a non-parole period of 10 months. He was released on parole on 11 February 2011. It was a condition of his parole that he accept supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and counselling as to alcohol and anger management issues.

28The murder of Ms Perry occurred 2 months later, at which time the offender was not only on parole but also the subject of an ADVO. The conditions of the ADVO included that he not go within 100 metres of premises in which Ms Dargan worked or lived and that he not approach or contact her. 

Facts

29The facts of the matter, based upon the evidence given in the trial and, in respect of critical matters of which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, are as follows.

30I have mentioned that the offender had been in a relationship with Ms Shantell Dargan from sometime in 2009 until he committed the last of the offences mentioned above and went to gaol. For some reason she agreed to resume the relationship after he was released from gaol in February 2011, notwithstanding the currency of the ADVO. 

31Ms Dargan and Ms Perry had met in 2010 and they became friends. In about February 2011 they decided to lease and move into a two-bedroom apartment at The Entrance. The offender moved in and shared one of the bedrooms with Ms Dargan.

32On 8 April 2011, there was an informal social gathering at the unit. By about 10.00pm some other people had left and there was just the offender, Ms Dargan, Ms Perry and another young woman, Catherine Wills present. All were drinking, although the offender claimed that, in contrast to the others, he was only drinking in moderation. There was loud conversation and music and also, albeit it seems relatively briefly, some physical violence involving the women. A neighbour was driven to get out of bed in the middle of the night and go to the unit to tell the occupants to quieten down.

33Ms Perry and Ms Wills seem to have become significantly intoxicated. The three women went to sleep at around 3.00 or 4.00am. The offender said in his evidence in the trial that he stayed up and cleaned the house. He said that he laid down for about half an hour but did not go to sleep. The fact that he had been using the drug known as ""Ice"" might explain that. He said that he got up at around 6.00am and cooked breakfast for everyone.

34There was an argument between Ms Dargan and the offender. She said that he slapped her in the mouth and threw food in her face. According to Ms Wills he grabbed Ms Dargan by the hair and flung her to the ground. (The difference in the two accounts is immaterial). Ms Wills told him to stop fighting and to leave Ms Dargan alone. Ms Dargan hurriedly fled the unit and ran towards a nearby service station. The offender chased after her and pleaded with her to return but she did not. According to the statement that Ms Dargan made on 10 April 2011, he threatened to ""flog Priscilla"" and that he would ""smash the house up"" if she did not return. When she got to the service station, which according to CCTV material was at about 10.30am, she asked the attendant to call her a taxi. The attendant saw she was in some distress and inquired about her health. She told him that her boyfriend had been hitting her. She then went to her mother's home in a nearby town on the Central Coast.

35Meanwhile, Ms Perry had spoken by telephone with a friend who lived in a suburb of Gosford at about 9.30am. She then went to this friend's home at about 10.30am and gave her a lift to a shopping centre at Tuggerah and then returned to the unit at The Entrance. 

36Ms Perry, Ms Wills and the offender remained in the unit for the balance of the day. The offender spent considerable time calling and texting Ms Dargan. Much of these conversations related to how they loved each other but she also expressed exasperation about arguments and fighting between them. Ms Dargan said that in one of those calls he said he was going to drive Ms Perry's car over (presumably to Ms Dargan's mother's home) and that ""Priscilla's going in the boot"". She also said that the offender spoke of ""wigging out"" (which seems to be an expression he used to indicate that he was stressed) and that Ms Perry was arguing with him. 

37A neighbour in the unit block said that at about 11.30am she heard sounds of arguing in the unit and that a male voice said in a forceful, aggressive tone, ""Just do it now"". 

38The same neighbour said that at about 4.00pm she passed by the unit and she heard more arguing. She heard a female voice (I am satisfied this was Ms Perry) saying, ""I've had enough. You don't pay rent, you don't pay for anything. I'm sick of it. I just want you to get out"". 

39At about 4.30pm, another neighbour heard noises from the unit which included a female crying and whimpering.

40At around this time the offender had a telephone conversation with Ms Dargan. Ms Dargan said that she could hear Ms Perry in the background. According to Ms Dargan, what the offender said included:

You'd better get here. I'm going to wig out. Priscilla is carrying on. I can't handle it. 

41Ms Dargan told him to stop arguing with Ms Perry and to ""just go"".

42Soon after this the offender sent a series of text messages to Ms Dargan and others, including her sister Angelene. The content indicates that he was in a distressed state. I am satisfied that this was after he had seriously assaulted Ms Perry. For example, in a message split over two texts sent at 5.21pm he said:

I lost it ange prescilla carry on I tie her up n dnt know what 2 do she carry on bout shanny [a reference to Shantell Dargan] bash her n Katie [Ms Wills] last nite n try call cops plz get shanny asap im wiggn n dnt know what 2 do

43Various calls and texts which followed involved the offender presenting a false picture of what had occurred and minimising his culpability. Later communications included reference to him wanting to kill himself.

44I am satisfied that what occurred was this. Ms Perry and the offender did not get on. It seems that she was annoyed at him for living in the unit that she and Ms Dargan had rented. On 9 April 2011, Ms Perry (and Ms Wills for that matter) were drinking heavily as they had done the night before. The offender's evidence was to the effect that whilst he consumed some alcohol, his intake was relatively minimal. 

45As early as the morning to that day the offender was expressing displeasure and a contemplation of assaulting Ms Perry. Later in the day, in her disinhibited state, Ms Perry gave vent to her displeasure about the offender's presence in the unit. This was the argument overheard by a neighbour at about 4.00pm. 

46At this point the offender completely lost his temper and savagely assaulted Ms Perry. He kicked her more than once to the mouth, causing the complete dislodgement of both of her upper front teeth. Given the number of injuries she sustained it is highly likely he punched her a number of times. I am satisfied that he also stomped on her head given the severe injuries to the same areas on both sides of her head. The assault was likely over by about 4.30pm when the neighbour heard a female in the unit crying and whimpering. 

47The offender may have tied Ms Perry up, but of this I cannot be certain. He made reference to doing so in subsequent statements that he made. Rope was present with blood on it, but there were no rope marks on the body.

48After Ms Perry had died, the offender rolled her up in a doona in her bedroom, placed pillows or cushions on top, and then positioned a mattress over her. As a further indignity he stuffed toilet paper in her mouth. He then set about an amateurish effort to clean up all the blood stains in the unit.

49Police came to the unit at about 9.30pm. It was locked and in darkness. They pressed the intercom button and the offender saw on a video screen that it was the police. When the officers tried to access the unit via a bedroom window, the offender fled via the front door. He made his way on foot to Ms Dargan's mother's home where he hid in the garage. He endeavoured to avoid being located by the police by taking the battery out of his mobile phone. He claimed in his evidence in the trial that he simply wanted to see Shantell before turning himself in or being arrested. That was nonsense; hiding in the garage was not going to achieve that aim. Ultimately the police found him there and he was taken into custody.

50The offender's defence at trial was that the injuries to Ms Perry that caused her death were sustained by her through a combination of having been assaulted by Ms Dargan the night before and by various falls that Ms Perry experienced because of the extent of her inebriation. He reluctantly acknowledged some involvement in her death but this was limited to a single kick and a push in reaction to her assaulting him.

51The Crown called Professor Lyons, a most experienced forensic pathologist. He noted ""thirty plus injuries"" to Ms Perry's head, neck, torso and upper and lower limbs. It was the combination of injuries to the head which caused death. The most significant of the injuries included a prominent area of blue-black bruising to the left eye orbit; significant bruising and injury to and around both ears; boggy swelling and oedema around the right ear; minor injuries in the nature of abrasions to the right ear lobe; a laceration and bruising to the upper lip; a laceration and blue-black bruising to the lower lip; avulsion of both upper front teeth, including the loss of the root structure of these teeth; and a discoloured abrasion underneath the chin.

52These injuries resulted in significant brain injuries. Professor Lyons found a marked sub-scalp haemorrhage around the swelling of both the left and right ear areas, spreading to the parietal and occipital areas; extensive sub-dural and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage; cerebral oedema and transtentorial herniation; and bruising and shearing within the tissue to the brain at the inferior temporal lobes. It was his view that the head and brain injuries were consistent with there having been a severe beating. The avulsion of the two upper teeth was consistent with being caused by forceful kicking to the mouth. I am satisfied that there were at least two forceful kicks, given the two wounds on the offender's left ankle which were at right angles to each other. The injuries to the ears were typical of what is seen if an individual's head is on its side on the ground and is stomped upon. The combination of injuries were inconsistent with Ms Perry having fallen.

53The defence called Dr Byron Collins who spoke in general terms about how blunt force trauma can cause injuries to the head, and how victims of such trauma can experience a ""lucid interval"" of up to 24 hours or more before succumbing to death as a result of injuries to the brain. The inference being advanced in the defence case was this was consistent with the fatal injuries having been sustained the previous night.

54The significant distinction between the evidence of the two pathologists was that Professor Lyons related his opinions to the specific injuries sustained by Ms Perry, whereas Dr Collins spoke about general concepts and general propositions. He did not explain how it was that a person could suffer the specific injuries Ms Perry sustained by the mechanisms suggested by the defence case theory. The jury obviously preferred the evidence of Professor Lyons.

55Aside from the forensic pathology evidence, two other matters brought about the offender's undoing at trial. The first was that his evidence was completely incredible. I say this not only because of what he said and but also because of the manner in which he presented in the witness box. His account gave the distinct impression that it was well rehearsed and tailored to meet the evidence given in the prosecution case. For example, where he had occasion to repeat his evidence on a particular topic, he often did so in almost verbatim terms. There were many features of his account that were implausible; one example which was quite absurd was that after kicking Ms Perry in the mouth, once, she complained of having a chipped tooth and said, ""Look what you done to me you fucking cunt"". A short time later he apologised, cuddled her and tried to comfort her by telling her a lie that his cousin was a dentist.

56A number of statements made by the offender after the killing were also his undoing. One was a telephone call to Ms Dargan that, unbeknown to him, was recorded by a police officer. During the course of this conversation he told Ms Dargan:

I was trying to drink a glass of fuckin wine, trying to drink a fuckin bit of port today. And she fuckin, I grabbed her by the hair babe and fuckin, I kicked her teeth out, like I kicked her and fuckin I got her tooth stuck in me foot, me foots all sore and that.

57Another was in a telephone conversation just after midnight with Detective Sergeant Vanderwolf who was trying to encourage the offender to turn himself in. The offender told him:

It wasn't fuckin like meant to happen or anything, it was just a split second fuckin, she's screaming her fuckin head off ... Goin, 'Ah I'm gonna ring the cops you scum bag', and that, 'Fuck you', in me face and fuckin carrying on. Talke to me girl [i.e. Ms Dargan], she's been doin it fuckin like a lot lately ... and getting on the wine and we've been good and we haven't been drinking and that cause we've had drinking problems. And, and fuckin trying to do the right thing and she's been drinking in the house every day and fuckin, just fuckin doing me head in like, I'm fuckin.

It was like, fuckin, I know how easily like you can fuckin like someone can hit their head and die and things like that but I never fuckin planned it or thought of anything it just went bang, fuckin, next minute I think she's alright, I was talking to her too, and like cause I chipped her tooth"".

58Another was a telephone conversation he had with a former girlfriend, Ms Tyla Singleton, in a call he made at about 1.00am. In it he referred to having ""kicked"" and ""stomped"" upon the deceased. When he called Ms Singleton from gaol after his arrest (Exhibit X), what he said included:

This chick's just drunk carrying on and that and that and fuckin' I couldn't handle it ... I got a bad temper at times so I could only take so much of it.

59The offender is not to be punished more for the fact that he has been dishonest in his account of the circumstances of Ms Perry's death. The significance of his evidence being so incredible is that claims that he made, such as that Ms Perry assaulted him, and that he only kicked her once and otherwise did not assault her, must be rejected out of hand. It is also significant in that is indicative of a lack of insight into the extent of his violent propensities and that in turn bodes unfavourably in terms of his rehabilitation prospects.

60Various statements by the accused in the hours and days following Ms Perry's death included that, ""it was an accident"". I am satisfied that all he meant by this, although he does not truthfully acknowledge it, was that it was not planned. He just lost his temper; he snapped and exploded in a fit of rage and extreme violence. 

61It would seem likely that his temper was developing over a period of time; he told Ms Singleton and his brothers Korri and Dayn in telephone calls from gaol that his assault upon Ms Perry was a result of ""a big build-up of things"". And he acknowledged his bad temper not only in the excerpt from the call to Ms Singleton I have just referred to but also in a call to his brother Dayn when he said:

I've got a fuckin' anger problem anyway and fuckin' people should've helped me fuckin' more to start with.

62That there was this ""build up"" is further indicated by his statement earlier in the day to Ms Dargan that he would ""flog Priscilla"" if Ms Dargan did not come back to the unit.

63I accept the Crown submission that another matter relevant to the objectivity gravity of the offence is Ms Perry's extreme vulnerability. She was a woman well affected by alcohol and the drug quetiapine to an extent that her cognitive function and motor skills would have been substantially impaired. Her ability to physically defend herself against a fit and strong man would have been virtually negligible. This, and all of the other matters I have mentioned which are relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence leads me to accept the submission by the Crown that it is one that is ""gravely serious and requires the imposition of a significant custodial sentence"".

64I will mention shortly some evidence given this morning by Dr Wayne Reid, clinical neuropsychologist. It was his opinion that the offender possibly suffered from a brain injury and this was the subject of a submission that this rendered the offence less seriousness than it otherwise might be. I will say something more about this later but for the moment I simply record that, having regard to his criminal history, any reduction of the offender's moral culpability for the offence is minimal.

Matters personal to the offender

65The evidence on sentence comprised a report and oral evidence by Dr Reid and oral evidence by the offender himself. 

66The offender's background, in terms of what he told Dr Reid, is summarised in the doctor's report as follows:

Mr Ray's parents divorced seven years ago. He has three younger brothers. His parents are both unemployed and he told me had problems with drug and alcohol abuse [sic].

He described a disturbed and what seemed chaotic childhood associated with domestic violence and he told me he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder and was uncontrollable.

At school he said he excelled in sport and was good at school work until problems started in primary school when he began to be bullied by other children and this continued when he went to high school.

He told me he started to use marijuana and then amphetamines at the age of 13 and by the age of 14 he began to get into trouble with the law and entered the Juvenile Justice system.

He left school in year 8 and obtained his first job pushing trolleys at a supermarket. This was short lived and he was out of work for a number of years. His last job was five years ago working in Western Australia building a railway for the mines. He told me this lasted for five months.

Around the age of 18 or 19 he told me a mate of his killed himself with an overdose of heroin and in 2000 he found his friend hanging in the schoolyard. From that point on he said he attempted to get off drugs but began to drink heavily although made some attempts at settling down.

He reported he then started to experiment with new drugs, it seems steroids and he said he became physically bigger and more violent towards people.

Over the last couple of years he said his drug taking and alcohol intake escalated and he was in a relationship however due to his violence an AVO was placed on him.

At the time of the alleged offence he told me he was using ice and alcohol.

...

He told me he has seen many mental health practitioners throughout his life and has previously seen counsellors for management of his aggression and domestic violence.

He complained of having problems sleeping as he has thoughts running through his head and he suffers from depression. He told me he has previously attempted suicide many times whilst in prison by trying to hang himself and overdose on heroin.

67Under the heading ""Neuropsychological Examination"", Dr Reid noted that ""observations of [the offender's] behaviour revealed he was impulsive and had a low frustration tolerance"". 

68Under the heading ""Emotional State"", Dr Reid recorded that the offender presented as ""tense and mildly depressed in effect. He reported a long past history of antisocial behaviour, symptoms consistent with conduct disorder and substance abuse disorder"". 

69A battery of psychometric tests were administered by Dr Reid. They revealed nothing of any particular relevance in terms of intelligence and memory. But Dr Reid's conclusions included:

Examination of his frontal executive cognitive skills revealed no deficits in his planning and organisational abilities however marked impairment was evident in those aspects of his frontal executive skills affecting his verbal and non verbal reasoning, ability to think quickly and flexibly, impulse control and monitor his on-going behaviour.

Overall from his long history of antisocial behaviour, violent outbursts, and pattern of cognitive functioning found on neuropsychological assessment I am of the opinion Mr Ray's behaviour and type of cognitive deficits are consistent with those seen in patients with damage to the region of the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex of the brain. This area of the brain plays a key role in impulse control and in regulation and maintenance of set and ongoing behaviour. Damage to this region can result in disinhibition and impulsivity with such associated behaviour problems as aggressive outbursts and sexual promiscuity.

It is reported many patients with ventromedial pre-frontal cortex damage develop problems with social conduct, as well as defects in planning judgment and decision making. 

Damage to this region has been likened to ""sociopathy"". (Citation of references omitted)

70Dr Reid acknowledged in his evidence that there was an element of speculation in the suggestion of the offender having damage to the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex of the brain. No scans or other procedures have been carried out to confirm this. Persons who exhibit problems with impulse control, the ability to learn from negative experiences, and low frustration tolerance, as the offender's history demonstrates that he exhibits, are apparently more likely to be found to have such brain injuries. The offender told Dr Reid that he had received a number of knocks to the head during the course of his life which the doctor opined could have a cumulative effect in causing such injury. There is, however, no remedy or cure. The solution lies in the hope that with advancing age there will be a greater level of maturity, but more so if the offender was to engage in intensive rehabilitation programs in a controlled environment, something the doctor thought that he had the intellectual capacity to do. Whether he has the motivation to do so, however, is another matter.

71The offender's criminal history is replete with opportunities that have been available to him to engage in rehabilitation. Whatever attempts he has made to date have all resulted in utter failure. And he blames others for this; I have mentioned how in one of his telephone calls from gaol he spoke of it being other people's fault. He claimed in the course of his evidence today that he did acknowledge the problem he had with anger management and violence and that he was committed to doing something about it; engaging in programs and completely abstaining from drugs and alcohol. However, the offender's evidence, both at trial and now, is such that I am not prepared to accept any of it. The overall impression it left me with was that he was prepared to make any excuses for his past behaviour and offer whatever promises about the future that would advance his own interests. 

72Despite submissions to the contrary, I am not satisfied that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. Indeed, in the light of his criminal history, whether he has any prospects of rehabilitation is something that I am unable to forecast. This is not only because of his failure to pursue rehabilitation notwithstanding many past opportunities but also because of his lack of respect for orders made by courts and the Parole Authority when he has been permitted to live in the community under conditional liberty. The submission by the Crown that his prospects of rehabilitation are ""bleak"" is one I must accept.

73I am also not prepared to accept that the offender is genuinely remorseful. I accept that he expressed some shock and sorrow for Ms Perry's death in the immediate aftermath but this was not ""contrition and remorse"" as his counsel described it. His concerns at that time were mostly for himself and the predicament he had found himself in and it seems that the latter become his predominant concern as time went on. For example, in a conversation with his father on 27 June 2011, he was adamant that the charge of murder would fail (""there's no fuckin' way they're gunna fuckin' make me fuckin' murder shit stick on me"") and that he would ""get off on manslaughter"". He added, ""I just fuckin' feel sorry for meself think of fuckin' no kids fuck and things like that you know"". Claims in his evidence today to be remorseful smacked of being rehearsed and insincere.

Other sentence considerations

74I am prepared to accept, perhaps generously, that the offender's moral culpability for the offence is less than it otherwise might be on account of the possibility of him having the brain injury of which Dr Reid spoke. I have indicated that the extent that this is so is minimal; that is because the offender must have been well aware by 2011 at the age of 30 of his violent proclivities and of the situations in which he was more likely to snap. I am also prepared to accept that there should be a reduction of the extent to which general deterrence should be given weight, but that too should only be minimal. 

75On the other hand, in light of the offender's history, personal deterrence remains of significance. And, there is also the fact that the offender has exhibited a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law in relation to crimes of violence. Unless he successfully engages in appropriate rehabilitation programs while serving his sentence, he will continue to represent a danger to the community, especially to women. 

76That does not mean that his sentence can be extended merely to protect society; the law is clear that a sentence must remain proportionate to the offence. But with that constraint in mind, protection of the community is a significant consideration in this case

77The fact that the offence occurred in breach of both parole and an ADVO is a significant aggravating factor.

78The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 10 April 2011. Ordinarily that would mean that the sentence should be back-dated until then. However, his parole in respect of the sentence imposed for the assault upon Ms Dargan in April 2010 was revoked and he served the balance of that sentence until 11 August 2011. I appreciate that I have a discretion to order the commencement of the sentence at any time from the date of arrest until then. The principle of totality is the primary consideration. The period in question is four months. The offence concerning Ms Dargan was an entirely different matter. I have concluded that it would be appropriate to commence the sentence on 12 August 2011. 

79No submission was made that I should make a finding under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) that there are special circumstances warranting a reduction in the non-parole period of the sentence. I have considered the question nonetheless and have concluded that there should not be.

Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW)

80I am required to warn the offender that the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) applies to him because of the nature of the offence. In short, this means that the State may make an application at the end of his sentence for him to be made the subject of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order for up to 5 years and that the State may continue to make applications for further such orders so as to keep him in custody or under extended supervision. I expect his legal representatives will explain this in more detail to him but the short message is that it would be in his interests to engage with rehabilitation programs whilst serving his sentence. If he does not, there is the potential for him to remain in custody for the rest of his life.

Sentence

81Convicted.

82Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 6 years. The sentence will date from 12 August 2011. The offender will become eligible for release on parole after the non-parole period expires on 11 August 2029. 

83That is a total sentence of 24 years with a minimum period in custody of 18 years.

		13 June 2013",2013-06-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761703,Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: By notice of application filed on 2 August 2012, the applicant seeks an extension of time to file an application, and, if an extension is granted, leave to appeal against a sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon him on 14 November 2001 (see R v Phuong Canh Ngo [2001] NSWSC 1021; 125 A Crim R 495, per Dunford J) following his conviction after a jury trial on a count of murder.

2It will be seen that the delay in making the application has been very lengthy. The Crown opposes the grant of an extension of time. It will be necessary to refer to the circumstances in which that delay occurred.

Background

3On 5 September 1994 Mr John Newman was shot dead in the driveway of his home in Cabramatta, Sydney. Mr Newman had been an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of the Parliament of NSW. On 13 March 1998 the applicant was arrested and charged with Mr Newman's murder. A trial in the Supreme Court commenced in June 1999, but, for reasons it is unnecessary to explore, aborted. A second trial commenced in February 2000, but, in May, the jury was unable to agree on a verdict and was discharged. A third trial, before Dunford J and a jury, began on 7 March 2001. This trial resulted in the conviction of the applicant by jury verdict delivered on 29 June 2001. Two co-accused who stood trial with the applicant were acquitted. 

4On 25 July 2001 (that is, before sentencing) the applicant filed a notice of appeal to this Court against the conviction. Thirteen grounds of appeal were identified. On 14 November 2001 Dunford J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for life. In doing so, he declared that he was satisfied that the level of the applicant's culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. This language reflects the test laid down in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""). Dunford J clearly intended to sentence the applicant having regard to the provisions of that section. Whether that course was legitimately available to him is a principal issue in the present application.

5Dunford J found that the murder of Mr Newman had been committed by another at the instigation and direction of the applicant, and that the applicant's motive in securing the murder was ""naked political ambition and impatience"". Whether that finding can be sustained is the subject of one of the proposed grounds of appeal. 

6The applicant has never previously filed a formal application for leave to appeal against sentence. However, on 5 August 2002, on his behalf, an amended notice of appeal against conviction was filed, pleading 17 grounds. The ground numbered 17 raised the issue of what was said to be the excessive severity of the sentence.

7Both the applicant and the Crown filed written submissions in respect of the appeal against conviction and in respect of what can be treated (for present purposes) as an application for leave to appeal against sentence. On 7 November 2002, again on the applicant's behalf, a notice of abandonment of the proposed appeal against sentence, signed by his solicitor, was filed. (It appears that, by that date, r 3 of the Criminal Appeal Rules required applicants for leave to appeal personally to sign notices of abandonment. The non-compliance with this rule is of no present materiality.)

8On 3 April 2003 the applicant's appeal against conviction was dismissed: R v Ngo [2003] NSWCCA 82; 57 NSWLR 55. The applicant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia. On 28 May 2004 special leave was refused: Ngo v The Queen [2004] HCATrans 185.

9In 2008 and 2009, at the direction of the Chief Justice, and pursuant to Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, an Inquiry into the applicant's conviction was conducted by Mr David Patten (""the Patten Inquiry""). On 14 April 2009 Mr Patten reported that he found nothing to cast doubt upon, or raise a sense of unease or disquiet in respect of, the applicant's conviction.

10On 15 February 2010 a second application, under the same legislation, for a direction for an Inquiry into the conviction was made (by a person other than the applicant). In June 2010, the applicant himself sought a direction that a further Inquiry be held. On 15 October 2010 McClellan CJ at CL refused the applications: Phuong Canh Ngo - Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2010] NSWSC 981.

11On 2 August 2012 the applicant filed the present applications, for extension of time, and for leave to appeal against the sentence. He pleads three grounds for the proposed appeal, formulated as follows:

""1. Dunford J erred in sentencing the applicant pursuant to the provisions of s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

2. Alternatively, Dunford J erred in the application of s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by concluding that the applicant had a political motive for killing Mr Newman. 

3. Alternatively, Dunford J erred in failing to take into account subjective factors relevant to the applicant.""

The Remarks on Sentence

12In sentencing the applicant, Dunford J reviewed the evidence that had been given in the trial, and made detailed findings of fact. His factual findings were to the following effect.

13Mr John Newman was a member of the Australian Labor Party (""the ALP""), and the elected member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW for the seat of Cabramatta. The applicant was also a member of the ALP, and lived and worked in the Cabramatta electorate. He was active in local politics, and held the position of Deputy Mayor of the City of Fairfield Council (in which Cabramatta is located). He was the founder of a local institution known as the Mekong Club, and was its Honorary President. The Mekong Club operated for the benefit of the local Vietnamese community, of which the applicant was a member. He had greater political ambitions. [Precisely what those ambitions were is the subject of the second ground of the proposed appeal.]

14The applicant's political ambition, on the findings made by Dunford J, was to replace Mr Newman as the ALP endorsed candidate for the Legislative Assembly at the next election. He had, however, given an undertaking to the ALP ""hierarchy"" that he would not contest preselection for the seat while it was held by Mr Newman. Accordingly, it was necessary that Mr Newman be removed from the position. The applicant's selected method of achieving that result was to have Mr Newman killed.

15The applicant therefore took steps to arrange for Mr Newman's murder. He initially recruited two men, identified as ""W1"" and ""W2"", who were employees of the Mekong Club. Their task was to purchase appropriate firearms. This they did, purchasing a .22 rifle and a Beretta pistol. W2 was asked to identify a person who would be prepared to carry out the murder. This attempt failed, because of Mr Newman's high profile. W1 and W2 therefore took on the task and made three attempts on Mr Newman's life - one outside a restaurant, one at a greyhound club, and the third at Mr Newman's house. For various reasons, all these attempts failed. There were also other, somewhat farfetched, plans considered. W1 withdrew from the arrangement. 

16W2, on the applicant's instruction, acquired a third weapon, a Ruger semi-automatic pistol, and, through a third person, arranged for another to kill Mr Newman. This plan failed when the proposed killer also withdrew, and the Ruger was lost. A fourth weapon, a .45 Magnum, was acquired. A silencer was fitted to the Beretta. 

17On the evening of 5 September 1994 Mr Newman attended an ALP Branch meeting, and drove to his home, arriving there at about 9.30pm. He and his fiancée were in the driveway of their home, securing a tarpaulin over his car, when a man alighted from a nearby vehicle and fired four shots at Mr Newman with the Beretta. Two of the shots entered Mr Newman's chest and proved fatal. The gunman re-entered the car, which drove off at high speed with no headlights illuminated. 

18The verdict of the jury established that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the instigator of the murder. Dunford J found that, although the applicant did not discharge the gun, he was the principal offender (at [22]).

19His Honour said:

""15 I am satisfied to the criminal standard that Phuong Ngo's motive for the killing of John Newman was naked political ambition and impatience. He wanted to be the Legislative Assembly member for Cabramatta, but had given the Labor Party hierarchy an undertaking that he would not run for preselection whilst John Newman was the sitting member. He could not wait until the next general election due in 1999; and so he needed to remove John Newman as the sitting member in order that he could run in the preselection ballot which, on the numbers, he had a very good chance of winning. The method he chose was to have John Newman killed.

...

23 Not only is the deliberate, premeditated killing of another human being a most serious offence at any time, the criminality in the present case is greatly aggravated because it involved the killing of a member of Parliament for political ends. It therefore constituted an offence not only against the individual victim, but it was also a direct attack on our system of democratic representative government, and struck at the very fabric of our public institutions.

...

25 In particular our system of parliamentary elections and preselection of parliamentary candidates operates without physical violence or intimidation, and a clear message must be sent that there is no room in this country for killings, violence or intimidation as part of the political process.""

20In reaching these conclusions, Dunford J noted and rejected an argument advanced on behalf of the applicant (who had not given evidence in either the trial or the sentencing proceedings) that the applicant's political ambition was, not a seat in the Legislative Assembly, but a seat in the Legislative Council, and that Mr Newman's continued hold on preselection for the Legislative Assembly seat was no inhibition to that ambition. If that were so, then the finding that the motive for murder was ""naked political ambition and impatience"" would not be available (so the argument went) and the motive for the murder may have been ""no more than personal animosity arising from mudslinging at the [applicant] by [Mr Newman]"": ROS [16]. In support of this contention reference was made to evidence that, on the day of the murder, the applicant had had lunch with the then State Secretary of the ALP, at which he had been told that he would be favourably considered for a Legislative Council seat.

21His Honour gave a number of reasons for rejecting that proposition:

(i) the applicant had previously contested the Legislative Assembly seat of Cabramatta as an Independent, before taking up membership of the ALP;

(ii) he was Councillor and Deputy Mayor of the Fairfield City Council which largely encompassed the Cabramatta electorate;

(iii) his ""power base"" was in Cabramatta, with its large Vietnamese and other Asian population;

(iv) in statements made on the day after the murder, and on 14 and 15 September 1994, the applicant indicated his wish to replace Mr Newman if preselection were held locally;

(v) the applicant had sufficient support, if a local ballot were to take place, to achieve preselection;

(vi) the applicant had, some months prior to the murder, told another person, a witness in the trial, that he wished to enter Parliament, to be ""the leader of the area"" and all that stood in his way was Mr Newman;

(vii) as a matter of logic, if the applicant's ambition had been election to the Legislative Council, there was no need to proceed with the murder of Mr Newman;

(viii) (perhaps somewhat inconsistently with (vii)) that, even if it were a Legislative Council seat that attracted the applicant's interest, he needed the support of the sitting Legislative Assembly member (Mr Newman) and he did not have that support.

22Dunford J then turned his attention to s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That section took effect on the commencement of the Sentencing Procedure Act, on 3 April 2000 - more than five years after the murder. It is set out below. There is no indication that any argument was directed to the proposition that, because s 61(1) was not in force at the time of the murder, it was inapplicable to the sentencing of the applicant. 

23His Honour considered the mercifully small number of previous Australian cases in which a killing or other crime had been politically motivated, or committed against a public persona (R v Kocan [1966] 2 NSWR 565; R v Eastman (Supreme Court of ACT, Carruthers J, 10 November 1995, unreported)), together with others in which a life penalty was imposed or considered and rejected: R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41; R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469; 50 NSWLR 409; R v Rose [1999] NSWCCA 327; R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66. He expressed his conclusion as follows:

""32 In my opinion, the killing of a member of Parliament for political purposes, involving as it does an attack on our constitutional system of parliamentary democracy, and particularly when committed for personal political gain gives rise to such culpability that the 'community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence' can only be met by the imposition of a life sentence.

33 These features are aggravated in the present case by the long period of planning and organisation which preceded the killing, and by the [applicant's] corruption of other persons such as W1, W2 and the persons who actually carried out the killing on his behalf."" (italics in original)

24He then held that it was necessary, having regard to s 21(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, to consider whether there were any subjective features including prospects of rehabilitation such as to render a life sentence inappropriate, while bearing in mind that in some cases the culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the subjective features should be disregarded. He accordingly set out the applicant's personal circumstances. The applicant was born in Vietnam in July 1958, and was 43 years of age at sentencing, 36 at the date of the murder. His parents were, in Vietnam, moderately successful, but the family circumstances changed in 1975 with the fall of Saigon. The applicant entered Australia as a refugee in 1982, at the age of 24, with his brother. He took on employment in a flyscreen company but became successful and eventually became the founder and President of the Mekong Club, and Deputy Mayor of Fairfield. He owned and published a Vietnamese newspaper.

25Dunford J accepted that the applicant had made significant contributions to the Cabramatta community, instancing that he had been instrumental in the establishment of a Fairfield Drug Intervention Centre. He also noted the applicant's conduct since being in custody; he described him as a ""model prisoner"", who assisted and encouraged young prisoners, especially Asian, to take advantage of such educational opportunities as were available to them. He then said:

42 I have taken all these matters into account but, for the reasons already given, I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the subjective features must be disregarded and the community interest as defined in s 61(1) can only be adequately met by a sentence of life imprisonment.""

26He acknowledged that the court has no power, where a life sentence is imposed, to fix a non-parole period (see Harris supra, at [122]), and said that, although satisfied that the applicant should remain under sentence for the remainder of his life, he did not believe that it was necessary that he remain in custody for the whole of that time and said that if he had the power to do so he would fix a non-parole period ""but it would be a very long one"". 

Ground 1: did the Sentencing Procedure Act, s 61(1), apply to the offence?

27Section 61(1), appearing in the Sentencing Procedure Act under the heading ""Mandatory life sentences for certain offences"" is in the following terms:

""(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.""

Sub-sections (2), (4), (5) and (7) of s 61 are directed to the imposition of life sentences in respect of certain drug offences. Sub-section (3) preserves, in relation to sub-s (1), the operation of s 21(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act (which provides that, if, by any provision of an Act, an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term). Sub-section (6) excludes from the operation of the section offenders who were under 18 years of age at the time of the commission of their offences.

28The Sentencing Procedure Act, including s 61 in its present form, received Royal Assent on 8 December 1999 and took effect as from 3 April 2000. Thus, s 61(1) was not in force as at 5 September 1994, the date of Mr Newman's murder.

29The first thing to observe about s 61 is that, on analysis, it is difficult to conclude other than that sub-s (1) is devoid of any content. Purportedly, in substance, it creates an obligation in a court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment on a person convicted of murder - but only in the circumstance specified in the balance of the sub-section. That circumstance is the satisfaction of the court that the level of culpability of the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life. Given that the fundamental obligation of all sentencing judges is to impose a sentence that is appropriate in all the circumstances, taking into account the objective gravity of the crime, and the personal circumstances of the offender, where a judge reaches the satisfaction specified - that the offender's culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that stated community interests can only be met by the imposition of a life sentence - there remains no room for the imposition of a sentence other than life imprisonment. This was the view taken by Hunt CJ at CL in Kalajzich, and by Bell J (at first instance) in R v Harris [2000] NSWSC 285; 111 A Crim R 415, endorsed by this Court on appeal at [88].

30The second thing to observe about s 61 is that it is difficult to reconcile the mandatory terms of sub-s (1) with the preservation, in sub-s (3), of s 21(1). In Harris, and again in R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557, Wood CJ at CL described this as a ""tension"".

31Dunford J, having reached the requisite level of satisfaction, was, whether by reason of s 61(1) or otherwise, bound to impose the sentence that he did.

32On behalf of the applicant, however, a contrary argument was advanced. That argument calls for consideration, first, whether s 61(1) did apply, given that it was not in effect at the date of the murder. That, in turn, brings me to consideration of historical relevant legislation. I will annex to these reasons the full text of the relevant provisions. 

33On the consolidation of the criminal law that became the Crimes Act 1900, s 19 provided that the crime of murder was punishable by death. That remained the case until 1955. By the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1955 (""the 1955 Amendment Act""), the Parliament of NSW abolished the death penalty. Thereafter, by s 19 of the Crimes Act, the penalty for murder was penal servitude for life.

34At that time, s 442 of the Crimes Act provided that, where an offender was liable to penal servitude for life, or for any other fixed term, the sentencing judge may nevertheless impose a lesser sentence. However, the 1955 Amendment Act further amended s 19 by excluding the operation of s 442 in respect of offences of murder (s 5(b)). The effect of that exclusion was that convictions for murder resulted in mandatory sentences of penal servitude for life.

35However, as a matter of practice, few offenders actually served out the whole of their sentences in custody. A system of executive licences was in operation. This was spelled out by the Honourable E P Pickering, Minister for Police and Emergency Services, in 1989, introducing the Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Bill: New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 7 December 1989 at 14528 and following.

36Also relevant in this context is the Sentencing Act 1989. The Sentencing Bill was put before the Legislative Assembly by the then Minister for Corrective Services, Mr Yabsley: New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 10 May 1989 at 7905 and following.

37The Sentencing Act effected radical reform to pre-existing sentencing procedures - Mr Yabsley described it as ""turn[ing] the sentencing process on its head"". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that the Sentencing Act introduced new procedures in sentencing. Relevantly for present purposes, by s 5 it required sentencing courts: first, to set a minimum term of imprisonment that the offender must serve, and, second, to set an additional term during which the offender might be released on parole. It further specified that the additional term was not to exceed one third of the minimum term, unless special circumstances justified that course. This was the first time that legislation had, with such specificity, regulated the sentencing process see, for more detail, R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112, at p 120. The Sentencing Act took effect on 25 September 1989.

38When passed, the Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Bill became the Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989 (""the 1989 Act""), which commenced operation on 12 January 1990. Relevantly, it brought about the repeal of s 19 of the Crimes Act and its replacement by s 19A. Section 19A then provided as follows:

""Punishment for murder
19A(1) A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to penal servitude for life.
(2) A person sentenced to penal servitude for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life.
(3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 442 (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than penal servitude for life).
(4) This section applies to murder committed before or after the commencement of this section.
(5) However, this section does not apply where committal proceedings (or proceedings by way of ex officio indictment) for the murder were instituted against the convicted person before the commencement of this section. In such a case, section 19 as in force before that commencement continues to apply.
(6) Nothing in this section affects the prerogative of mercy.""

39Three things may be noted about the effect of the enactment of s 19A: 


first, the maximum penalty for murder remained penal servitude for life; 
second, by sub-s (3), removing the exclusion of the operation of s 442 in cases of murder, a court was empowered to impose a lesser penalty - that is, the penalty of penal servitude for life in cases of murder was no longer mandatory; 
third, by sub-s (2), where a sentence of penal servitude for life was passed, the offender would serve the whole of that sentence in custody (unless the prerogative of mercy, preserved in sub-s (6), were to be exercised).

Section 19A, remains, in substance, in that form. (It has been varied by the substitution, in 2000, of ""imprisonment"" for ""penal servitude"", and, also in 2000, in sub-s (3), the substitution of a reference to s 21(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act for the reference to s 442 of the Crimes Act. The latter variation was effected by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001.)

40The 1989 Act also introduced s 431A into the Crimes Act. By sub-s (2) of that section, the penalty of penal servitude for life was restricted to crimes of murder and certain offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. By sub-s (3), where, but for that sub-section, no penalty would be provided for an offence that was formerly punishable by penal servitude for life, that offence was made punishable by penal servitude for 25 years. The intent of this section appears to have been to ensure that any legislation not specifically amended, that formerly provided a penalty of penal servitude for life, was encompassed.

41Section 431A is not relevant to the present issue. I mention it only because some reliance was placed upon it in the course of argument. 

42The next relevant amendment was the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Act 1996, which took effect on 30 June 1996. By that Act, s 431B was introduced into the Crimes Act. Section 431B was the forerunner of s 61 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Sub-sections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (8) of s 431 were in relevantly identical terms to the present sub-ss (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) respectively of s 61. Accordingly, where a court was satisfied that the level of culpability in the offence was of the character described in sub-s (1), it was obliged, by reason of that section, to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life. It remained, in any case, the duty of a court that had reached that level of satisfaction, to impose such a sentence. However, s 431B(7) provided that the section did not apply to offences committed before the commencement of the section. There is, in s 61, no equivalent of s 431B(7).

43The language of s 431B(1) was modeled on the decision of this Court in R v Garforth (NSWCCA, 23 May 1994, unreported). In that case, the Court, constituted by Gleeson CJ, McInerney J and Mathews J, said:

""There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty.""

44With effect from 3 April 2000, the Sentencing Act was repealed and replaced by the Sentencing Procedure Act. The Sentencing Procedure Act resulted from a reference to the NSW Law Reform Commission concerning ""the formulation of principles and guidelines for sentencing as well as the rationalisation and consolidation of current sentencing provisions"" and related matters, following which the Law Reform Commission issued a report on sentencing (New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Sentencing - Report 79 (December 1996)). The long title of the Sentencing Procedure Act is:

""An Act to consolidate and amend the law with respect to the sentencing of offenders; and for other purposes.""

45In introducing the Sentencing Procedure Bill to the NSW Parliament, the Minister, Mr Debus, said:

""The recommendations chiefly concern the mechanics of sentencing, streamlining and clarifying the existing sentencing law, and reforming those areas of the law that have been the subject of judicial complaint and some community concern ... A principal object of this bill is to amalgamate and re-enact provisions in [a number of Acts insofar as they concern sentencing, including the Sentencing Act]."" (New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 28 October 1999 at 2324) 

Section 431B of the Crimes Act was repealed, and substantially (with the important exception of sub-s (7)) re-enacted as s 61 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That is an important difference between s 431B and s 61. 

46The Sentencing Procedure Act adopted and confirmed the level of regulation of the sentencing process that had begun with the Sentencing Act. As initially passed, s 44(1) required the court first to set the term of the sentence, and then the non-parole period. It was amended by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, which took effect on 1 February 2003. Section 44 again requires a court first to set a non-parole period, being the minimum period for which the offender is to be held in custody, and, second, to specify a balance of term which, again, is not to exceed one third of the non-parole period unless special circumstances are found to justify that course.

47Cognate with the Sentencing Procedure Act was the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999, which, inter alia, repealed s 442 of the Crimes Act. The effect of s 442 was re-enacted in s 21(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which provides:

""If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.""

48It is convenient here to mention also s 19 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which was, and is, in the following terms:

""19 Effect of alterations in penalties
(1) If an Act or statutory rule increases the penalty for an offence, the increased penalty applies only to offences committed after the commencement of the provision of the Act or statutory rule increasing the penalty.
(2) If an Act or statutory rule reduces the penalty for an offence, the reduced penalty extends to offences committed before the commencement of the provision of the Act or statutory rule reducing the penalty, but the reduction does not affect any penalty imposed before that commencement.
(3) In this section, a reference to a penalty includes a reference to a penalty that is expressed to be a maximum or minimum penalty.""

49Because the enactment of the Sentencing Procedure Act coincided with the repeal of the Sentencing Act, certain transitional provisions were considered necessary. They were, however, limited. Clause 37 of Sch 2 appeared under the heading ""General Saving"" and provided as follows:

""Subject to the regulations:
(a) anything begun before the appointed day under a provision of the old legislation for which there is a corresponding provision in this Act may be continued and completed under the old legislation as if the [Sentencing Procedure Act] had not been enacted, and
(b) subject to paragraph (a), anything done under a provision of the old legislation for which there is a corresponding provision in this Act (including anything arising under paragraph (a)) is taken to have been done under the corresponding provision of this Act.""

The ""appointed day"" was 3 April 2000. 

The ""old legislation"" included the Sentencing Act. 

50That is, the Sentencing Procedure Act preserved anything begun before 3 April 2000 under a provision of the Sentencing Act for which there was a corresponding provision in the Sentencing Procedure Act. Otherwise, from 3 April 2000, the Sentencing Act was defunct. 

51Another consequence of the passing of the Sentencing Procedure Act was the abolition of the pre-existing distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, and the abolition of the punishments of penal servitude, and imprisonment with hard or light labour. Thenceforth, custodial penalties (for adult offenders) are known simply as ""imprisonment"". Consequential amendments to, for example, s 19A of the Crimes Act were made.

52Notwithstanding this apparent plethora of legislation, the relevant statutory provisions in force as at 5 September 1994 were s 19A of the Crimes Act, and the Sentencing Act. The Sentencing Act was, in substance, procedural. By s 19A of the Crimes Act the applicant was liable, in respect of Mr Newman's murder, to a penalty of penal servitude for life, but, by reason of sub-s (3) and s 442, a fixed term could be imposed. However, by sub-s (2), if a sentence of penal servitude for life were imposed, then the applicant would, subject to executive clemency, be required to serve the whole of that sentence.

53On behalf of the applicant, it was argued that Dunford J was in error in sentencing the applicant ""under the provisions of s 61(1)"". The simple argument was that, as the section was not in force as at the date of the murder, it had no application. On its face, that is a persuasive argument. However, the Crown has advanced three discrete arguments to the contrary. The three arguments were:

(i) The applicant was liable to be sentenced to imprisonment for life under s 19A and s 431A of the Crimes Act 

54I have already expressed my view that s 431A is irrelevant. It is plain that the applicant was liable to a sentence of life imprisonment under s 19A(1). That that was so does nothing to advance the Crown's argument that he was also liable to a sentence of life imprisonment under the later enacted provisions of s 61(1). I would reject the Crown's first argument.

(ii) Since 2000 this Court has consistently applied s 61(1), even in cases where the murder was committed prior to 3 April 2000

55The cases to which reference was made include: R v Lewis (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Ireland J, 9 June 2000, unreported); on appeal R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448; R v Gilham [2009] NSWSC 138. In the latter case, Howie J accepted the joint position adopted by the parties, that, notwithstanding that the murders for which the offender was being sentenced occurred before the enactment of s 61(1), that section applied. He added that the sub-section in any event generally reproduced the approach taken at common law.

56A contrary approach is to be discerned in R v Debs [2012] NSWSC 119, which concerned a murder committed in 1995, well before the enactment of s 61(1). Again, the approach taken by the Court (R S Hulme J) resulted from the position adopted by the parties - in that case, the Crown accepted that s 61(1) had no application.

57Although I accept that a lengthy history of practice by judges of this Court can be a relevant pointer to statutory interpretation, its relevance is somewhat diminished when it becomes apparent that the issue was not litigated. Moreover, the instances given are few in number.

58Of far more assistance is the decision of Bell J in R v Harris [2000] NSWSC 285; 111 A Crim R 415. In that case, her Honour was sentencing in respect of three murders committed in 1998, pre-dating s 61(1). Bell J referred to cl 37(a) of Sch 2 (the transitional provision, see above) of the Sentencing Procedure Act and said:

""74 I do not know what is embraced by the words 'anything begun ... under a provision of the old legislation'. The proceedings were on foot prior to the appointed day at a time when the Sentencing Act was in force. They had been commenced, on one view, not later than the date on which the prisoner was arraigned. It is not clear to me that anything had begun under a provision of the old legislation for which there is a corresponding provision under the [Sentencing] Procedure Act. The proceedings had begun by virtue of the presentation of the indictment. For this reason, I consider the [Sentencing] Procedure Act and not the Sentencing Act to apply to any determinate sentence imposed.""

That finding was not challenged on appeal. In effect, what her Honour found was that the Sentencing Procedure Act (including s 61(1)) had retrospective application.

59For reasons which will appear below, I respectfully agree with her Honour's conclusion. As did her Honour, I find it impossible to identify anything ""done under a provision of [the Sentencing Act]"" that could have been continued and completed under the Sentencing Procedure Act. No steps relevant to the applicant's sentencing had been taken before 3 April 2000, the day of the repeal of the Sentencing Act. The two previous trials did not involve anything ""done under a provision of the [Sentencing Act]""; nor could they. The applicant was not convicted until 29 June 2001, well after the commencement of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That means that the only sentencing legislation that could apply was the Sentencing Procedure Act. There is no basis upon which to excise s 61(1) from the Sentencing Procedure Act for the purposes of sentencing the applicant.

(iii) The Sentencing Procedure Act, including s 61(1), is intended to apply to sentencing for offences from its commencement, whenever the offences were committed 

60In support of this argument, the Crown relied upon the circumstances of the enactment of the Sentencing Procedure Act, and the long title that I have set out above. As was indicated in the Second Reading speech, the Sentencing Procedure Act drew together provisions relating to sentencing that had previously been the subject of various other pieces of legislation. It was passed in tandem with several other Acts relevant to criminal punishment. To the extent that its provisions are procedural, it may readily be accepted that it was intended to apply to offences committed before, as well as after, its enactment. It is where (if at all) the provisions are seen to be substantive, particularly where (if it all) they can be seen to worsen the position of an offender (see s 19), that their applicability to pre 3 April 2000 offences may be questioned.

61The sentencing regime prior to 3 April 2000, found in the Sentencing Act, was replaced with the sentencing regime of the Sentencing Procedure Act, with, as I have pointed out above, limited transitional provisions. That the transitional provisions were limited is, in itself, a clear indication that the legislature intended that the new procedures would apply to sentencing taking place after the enactment, whenever the offence in question was committed. Were that not the case, there would be a lacuna in relation to the sentencing of offenders whose crimes were committed prior to 3 April 2000. Thus, it can be seen that the intention was that, save for sentencing proceedings already in train, the Sentencing Procedure Act procedures would apply. There is absolutely no indication that s 61 should be excepted from that conclusion.

62Also of significance is what was effectively the transfer of the provisions of s 431B of the Crimes Act to s 61 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The transfer was of the complete bundle of provisions contained in the section, with the important exception of sub-s (7). Section 431B expressly did not apply to sentencing in respect of offences committed before the section took effect. It can hardly be thought that the omission of sub-s (7) from s 61 was other than deliberate. That, to my mind, is a further powerful indication that Dunford J was correct in treating s 61(1) as applicable to the sentencing of the applicant. 

63The oral argument advanced on behalf of the applicant was based upon two fundamental misconceptions.

64The first was that the sentencing alternatives were (i) sentencing the applicant ""under s 61(1)"" and (ii) sentencing the applicant ""at common law"". That is to misunderstand the role of s 61(1). It assumes, wrongly, that s 61(1) is a penalty-creating provision in the same way as s 19A(1) is a penalty creating provision (although the applicant's argument ignored s 19A(1)). It is incorrect to treat s 61(1) as a penalty-creating provision. While s 19A(1) renders a person convicted of murder liable to imprisonment for life, s 61(1) does no such thing. It is a provision that directs a court (although, perhaps, superfluously) that, in the circumstances it specifies, a life sentence must be imposed. 

65Any sentence imposed in respect of a conviction for murder is imposed under s 19A(1), even where, by reason of the application of s 21(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, it is a sentence for a determinate period.

66Sentencing ""at common law"" was simply not an option. Underlying the argument was an assumption. That was that if sentenced at common law, the applicant would have been eligible for the specification of a non-parole period, which Dunford J clearly would have done, had he been empowered to do so. That is the second, related, fundamental misconception in the applicant's argument - that, while s 61(1) precluded the specification of a non-parole period, sentencing under s 19A(1) did not. Specification of a non-parole period is quite incompatible with s 19A(2) - requiring that a life sentence be served in its entirety in custody.

67That was confirmed by the decision of this Court in Harris. The Court said:

""110 Section 19A(2), which provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment for murder 'is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life', provides some support for a legislative intention that would exclude release on parole. However, it needs to be borne in mind that a sentence can be served on parole. Section 132 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW), provides that an offender who is released on parole, 'is taken to continue serving the sentence during the period' beginning with the date of release and ending when the sentence expires ...

111 To the extent that a possible ambiguity arises in this respect, it is appropriate to refer to the Second Reading Speech: Legislative Assembly 30 November 1989 14052 to 14057. That speech unequivocally discloses that the intention of s 19A was to ensure that an offender, sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder, or for the most serious cocaine and heroin trafficking offence, was to be physically incarcerated for the term of his or her natural life."" (underlining and italics in original)

68The conclusion that s 61(1) was applicable also disposes of another area of contention between the parties. On behalf of the applicant it was argued that, by applying that sub-section, Dunford J deprived the applicant of the benefit of his case in mitigation, by reference to his personal circumstances. The Crown argued that his Honour did have regard to those circumstances. I have set out above the reference made in the Remarks on Sentence to those circumstances. But his Honour explicitly stated that, because of the conclusion to which he had come with respect to the applicant's culpability, he disregarded those circumstances. There was no error in taking that approach. It is consistent, not only with s 61(1), but also with Garforth. 

69A circumstance that exposes the fatal flaw in the argument advanced on behalf of the applicant is that it is limited to the contention that, of all the provisions of the Sentencing Procedure Act, only s 61 (or s 61(1)) is excluded from application to the sentencing of the applicant. There is no indication anywhere that s 61 ought to be treated differently from the remaining provisions of the Sentencing Procedure Act. If s 61(1) did not apply to the sentencing of the applicant, then neither did any of the other provisions of the Sentencing Procedure Act, including the abolition of the penalty of penal servitude.

70Senior counsel for the applicant also invoked s 19 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Section 19, it will be remembered, gives an offender the benefit of any reduction in penalty the enactment of which post dates the offence, but excludes any subsequently enacted increase in penalty - as explained by Spigelman CJ in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368.

71The argument was that, because s 61(1) increased the maximum penalty for an offence of murder, s 19(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act precluded its application to the applicant's offence.

72The argument is based on a false premise. Section 61(1) did not enact an increase to the maximum penalty applicable to the offence of murder. As I have observed above, it did not enact any penalty at all. The penalty for murder is the penalty provided by s 19A(1) - imprisonment for life. Whatever content is otherwise assigned to s 61(1), it did not increase the available penalty.

73In my opinion, ground 1 is without substance and should be rejected.

Ground 2: a political motive?

74Ground 2 was pleaded as an alternative to ground 1. It is that, even if s 61(1) is held to be applicable, it was nevertheless invoked on the basis of a flawed finding of fact - that fact was the applicant's motivation for the murder.

75A fundamental finding of the sentencing judge was that the murder of Mr Newman was motivated by the applicant's ""naked political ambition and impatience"". The applicant's ambition, Dunford J found, was preselection for the seat of Cabramatta in the Legislative Assembly.

76It was the applicant's case, to the contrary, that his political ambition lay in the Legislative Council, as to which Mr Newman was no impediment. That was an issue fully litigated in the trial and in the sentencing proceedings, as is apparent from the extracts from the Remarks on Sentence set out above. 

77However, the applicant now seeks to rely upon what was initially said to be fresh evidence derived from the Patten Inquiry (see [9] above). Senior counsel who appeared for the applicant on the application accepted that the evidence was neither new nor fresh. The circumstances in which new or fresh evidence may be taken into account were spelled out by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 and by Latham J in Stumbles v R [2006] NSWCCA 418. The evidence upon which the applicant now seeks to rely does not come within those principles. At most, the witnesses who gave evidence in the Patten Inquiry might have added some bulk to the contention made on his behalf in the trial. The issue was fully litigated and determined in the trial. I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 3: failure to take into account subjective factors 

78Much that is relevant to this ground has already been dealt with in respect of Ground 1. The complaint is that, ""in sentencing under s 61(1)"", Dunford J excluded from his consideration personal circumstances about the applicant not relevant to the objective culpability of the crime.

79The point Dunford J made was that the objective circumstances of the crime were of such a nature that personal circumstances, however favourable, could not affect the assessment of culpability. Included in those circumstances were, importantly, the applicant's political motive in arranging the murder, the threat such a murder poses to the institution of government, and also the detail of the planning and previous attempts that I have outlined above. I agree with Dunford J that the relatively favourable personal circumstances of the applicant, as they were known at the time of sentencing, could not in any way dislodge the finding that he made. In those circumstances I would also reject this ground of appeal.

Extension of time

80The application for extension of time pushes to its outer limits the latitude on occasion extended by this Court, which has traditionally taken a rather liberal approach to applications to extend time to appeal.

81In November 2001 (as is still the case), when the applicant was sentenced, s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 permitted an application for leave to appeal to be made within 28 days of the imposition of the sentence. Provision was made for extension of that time to be granted. This Court has traditionally been generous in the exercise of that discretion. It is worth restating some of the history I have outlined above.

82The applicant did not initially formally apply for leave to appeal against the sentence, although, by pleading ground 17 to the conviction appeal, he clearly signalled his intention to challenge the sentence. On 7 November 2002 he abandoned that proposed appeal. It was not until 16 July 2012 that he again set in motion an application. In other words, the application now made is about 11 years out of time.

83Time limits are fixed by legislation for the making of applications (of any kind) for good reason. While it is relatively commonplace for this Court to permit a substantial degree of latitude in sentencing matters, there must be boundaries. The Court will, especially in cases of substantial delay, look for a satisfactory explanation for the failure to pursue a remedy at the appropriate time: see Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424.

84Such explanation as was provided is to be found in an affidavit sworn by the applicant on 18 July 2012. He said that he had abandoned the initial application because he had been advised that ""there was insufficient evidence"" upon which to appeal. He gave a number of reasons for the subsequent delay as follows:

that he was initially devastated by the unfavourable outcome of the Patten Inquiry (the report of which was delivered in April 2009);


that in 2008 and 2009 he suffered significant health problems which depleted his energy and interfered with his capacity to file an application;


that in April 2009 ""a very dear close friend"" died, causing him further devastation and distraction;


that in 2010 his brother, the only relative who had come to Australia with him, was diagnosed with cancer and died;


that, from early 2009, he devoted considerable time to applying for transfers within the Correctional Services' facilities in which he was housed from time to time.

85The reasons given by the applicant are entirely unconvincing. As set out above, the statutory time for filing an application expired on 12 December 2001. An application (of sorts) was in fact filed on the applicant's behalf, shortly after conviction, but abandoned (also on his behalf). He makes no complaint that the application was abandoned without his informed authority and consent.

86The circumstances to which the applicant now attributes the delay began in 2008, with the beginning of his health issues, and continued to 2009, with the publication of the report of the Patten Inquiry, and to 2010. That is a minimum of seven years after the statutory time expired. That is hardly a credible explanation for the failure to institute the proceedings within time.

87The applicant did not give oral evidence on the application and was not cross-examined on his affidavit. Nevertheless, it does not seem to me to be unfair to describe his explanation as disingenuous. 

88Moreover, as can be seen from the above analysis, the grounds advanced have no merit. That, in my opinion, points to the real reason for the delay - that the applicant was advised, in 2003, that the proposed sentence appeal was futile and doomed to failure, and that he accepted that advice. 

89I am conscious of the significance of refusing an extension of time in relation to a proposed sentence appeal. I am very conscious that that significance is at its most extreme when the sentence sought to be appealed is one of imprisonment for life. In proposing the order I do, I have taken into account the absence of any merit in the proposed grounds of appeal. 

90In my opinion, the appropriate order is to refuse the extension of time. I have not reached that conclusion without satisfying myself that, if an extension of time were granted, an appeal would fail.

91I propose the following order:

(1)The application for an extension of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal is refused.

92JOHNSON J: I agree with Simpson J.

93GROVE AJ: I agree with Simpson J.

2761709,Khazaal v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 140,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN JA:  Following the remittal of the applicant's sentence appeal by the High Court to this Court, I have reconsidered my earlier judgment having regard to the further submissions of the parties. My opinion has not altered. Although I would grant leave to appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.
2As McCallum J records, the Crown asked this Court to consider whether, having regard to the fact that the applicant was for a time released on bail, it was possible to reconsider his sentence so that he serves the whole of the non-parole period imposed by the primary judge.
3This Court's jurisdiction is confined by the terms of the remitter order. In R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; (2010) 77 NSWLR 45, a five-judge panel considered the scope of this Court's jurisdiction in cases that the High Court remits to it for further consideration. Allsop P and Johnson J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby and Howie JJ agreed, said at [27]:
It is undoubted that the scope of the authority of a court to which a matter is remitted under s 37 is confined by the terms of the remitter and that such court can make no order nor undertake any task inconsistent with the remitter order: Peacock v DM Osborne & Co [1907] HCA 42; 4 CLR 1564 at 1567-1568; R v Weiss (No 2) [2006] VSCA 161; 164 A Crim R 454 at 472 [99]-[102].

4Applying that principle, this Court's jurisdiction under the remitter extends only to the determination of the offender's application for leave to appeal against his sentence. Despite whatever other course might better reflect justice in this situation, as to which I make no comment, this Court cannot make an order of the kind sought by the Crown.
5Even if the remitter did not preclude the Court from increasing the applicant's sentence to account for the time he has spent at liberty, the Court has no statutory power to make such an order. I agree with McCallum J's reasons for so finding.
6HALL J:  I agree with the reasons of both McClellan JA and McCallum J in relation to the grounds relied upon in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence.
7I agree with the reasons and conclusions expressed by McCallum J at [74] to [84] of her Honour's judgment.
8I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan JA and McCallum J that leave be granted and the appeal be dismissed.
9McCALLUM J:  Belal Saadallah Khazaal seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the Supreme Court on 25 September 2009 after he was found guilty by a jury of an offence of making a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act knowing of that connection, contrary to s 101.5(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).  The jury was unable to agree as to a further charge of attempting to incite an act of terrorism contrary to ss 11.1, 11.4 and 101.1 of the Code.  
10The maximum sentence for the offence of which the applicant was found guilty is imprisonment for 15 years.  The trial judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
Circumstances in which the present application is to be determined  
11The application for leave to appeal against that sentence was brought together with an appeal against conviction, which was ultimately unsuccessful.  The conviction was quashed by this Court (by majority) and a new trial ordered: Khazaal v R [2011] NSWCCA 129; (2011) 265 FLR 276.  In that decision, Hall J and I upheld a ground of appeal that the trial judge should have left to the jury a defence under s 101.5(5) of the Code (that the making of the document was not intended to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act), as to which the offender bore an evidential burden: per Hall J at [407] to [442]; in my judgment at [470] to [489].  Having so held, neither Hall J nor I dealt with the appeal against sentence.  McClellan JA (as his Honour now is) would have dismissed the ground on which the appeal was allowed (at [125] to [129]) and accordingly addressed the sentence appeal.  His Honour proposed that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed, for the reasons stated at [137] to [174] of the judgment.
12The decision upholding the conviction appeal was overturned by the High Court: R v Khazaal [2012] HCA 26; (2012) 289 ALR 586.  The High Court set aside the orders of this Court and, in lieu thereof, dismissed the appeal against conviction and remitted the matter to this Court for consideration and determination of the appeal against sentence: at [95] per Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ; French CJ agreeing at [37]; Heydon J agreeing at [120].
13For a period between the decision of this Court quashing the conviction and the determination of the appeal to the High Court, the applicant was at liberty on conditional bail, initially pending the new trial ordered by this Court and, later, pending the determination of the Crown's appeal.  Following the remittal of the proceedings by the High Court, the Crown filed written submissions as to the effect on sentence of that bail.  The Crown contended that, ""whatever the outcome of the sentence appeal"", the non-parole period fixed by Latham J must be adjusted to reflect the time spent on bail (a total period of 399 days).   14The applicant then filed written submissions addressing two matters.  They were, first, a response to the Crown's contention as to the relevance of the period spent on bail and, secondly, the effect of fresh evidence sought to be relied upon by the applicant.
15The Crown responded to those submissions in writing.  Neither party sought a further oral hearing.
Determination
16For the following reasons, I agree with the conclusion reached by McClellan JA in the earlier judgment of this Court that the original grounds for the appeal against sentence should be rejected: at [137] to [174] of the earlier judgment.  I have also concluded that the applicant's additional submissions made following the remittal by the High Court should be rejected.  Accordingly, leaving aside the Crown's request to have the sentence passed by Latham J varied to reflect the period spent on bail, I would dispose of the present application by ordering that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
17As to the Crown's request that the sentence passed by Latham J be varied to reflect the period spent on bail, I have concluded that, although it may be anomalous, this Court has no power to make an order of the kind sought by the Crown and, further, that by operation of law the applicant's sentence runs from the date ordered by Latham J.  
18Since preparing this judgment, I have seen the additional remarks of McClellan JA at [3] to [4] above.  I agree with his Honour that, in accordance with the terms of the remittal of the proceedings by the High Court, the authority of this Court is confined to determining the offender's application for leave to appeal against his sentence.  
Reasons for rejecting appeal against sentence
19The facts are set out at length in the earlier judgment of this Court.  Briefly, the charges related to the applicant's compilation of a book in Arabic called (as translated) ""Provisions on the Rules of Jihad: short judicial rulings and organisational instructions for fighters and Mujahideen against infidels"".  The book was compiled from various articles downloaded from the Internet, which were selected by the applicant and edited with some additional commentary of his own.  The book included a dedication and an introduction by the applicant.  It opened by defining Jihad to mean ""fighting the infidels to make God's word supreme"".  It included a chapter called ""Reasons for Assassination"", which was described as having been copied from a message by an ""esteemed brother"" in which ""he motivates Mujahideen to revive the ritual of assassination"".  The chapter discusses the religious teachings as to the permissibility of killing a person who insults the prophet.  It also discusses the characteristics of ""modern warfare against the infidels"", important characteristics of ""the assassination team"", ways and means of assassinating and the identities of targets that should be assassinated (including the order in which they should be assassinated).
20The applicant submitted the book for publication on an Internet site which, according to an expert witness at the trial (Mr Kohlmann), enjoyed an unusual level of endorsement by al-Qaeda (AB143). 
21The Crown case at the trial was that the book advanced religious or ideological justifications for violent struggle and provided a practical guide to achieving martyrdom and destroying the opponents of Islam.  The jury evidently accepted that case.
22The trial judge found that the offence was not far removed from the worst category of an offence under s 101.5(1) and that the objective gravity of the offence called for a sentence towards the top of the range as indicated by the maximum penalty (ROS at [21]).  Turning to the applicant's subjective circumstances, her Honour rejected the proposition that the applicant's depression had contributed to the commission of the offence; rejected a submission that he should be regarded as a person of prior good character and found that his prospects of rehabilitation remained ""exceedingly poor"", indicating the need for a strong element of personal deterrence.  
Ground 1
23The first ground of appeal is:
Her Honour erred in concluding that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""not far removed from the worst category of an offence under s 101.5(1) of the Code"".
24McClellan JA addressed that ground at [137] to [151] of this Court's earlier judgment.  I agree with his Honour's reasons for rejecting that ground and would add the following additional remarks.
25Ground 1 relied, in part, on the fact that the jury was unable to reach a verdict as to count 2 on the indictment.  That was a count of incitement, which alleged that the applicant had attempted to urge the commission of terrorist acts by others.  It was based on the same evidence as count 1, namely, the compilation and publication of the book.
26The burden of the applicant's submission was that, in light of the jury's failure to agree as to count 2, he had to be sentenced on the basis that he did not intend, by making and publishing the book, to urge the commission of any terrorist act and that the objective gravity of the offence for which he was sentenced was accordingly lower than as assessed by the trial judge.  
27In her remarks on sentence, Latham J expressly noted (at ROS [13]) that there was no warrant for a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to incite the commission of a terrorist act.  The applicant's submissions rest on the untested premise that, absent such intention, an offence under s 101.5(1) is necessarily of considerably lower seriousness than the worst category of that offence.  That premise must be tested by considering the terrorism provisions of the Code as a coherent whole.  
28Division 101 of the Code creates a series of offences of cascading seriousness (according to the maximum penalties provided).  Sections 101.1 and 101.6 create the most serious offences, being the offence of engaging in a terrorist act (s 101.1) and the offence of doing any act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act (s 101.6).  Each of those offences carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.
29Sections 101.2 to 101.5 criminalise acts which may be seen as falling within the next ripple of seriousness, being acts ""connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act"".  A variety of specific offences is created by those provisions but there is a common thread, namely that the criminalised conduct is ""connected with"" aspects of terrorist acts.  The seriousness of the offences varies according not only to the state of mind with which the offence was committed (either knowledge of the connection or recklessness as to the existence of the connection, which is less serious) but also the nature of the conduct.  For example, the provision or receipt of training in connection with a terrorist act knowing of the connection carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, while the making of a document in connection with a terrorist act knowing of the connection carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.  Correspondingly, the provision or receipt of training in connection with a terrorist act reckless as to the existence of the connection carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, while the making of a document in connection with a terrorist act reckless as to the existence of the connection carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  
30Separately, s 11.4 of the Code creates the offence of incitement, which consists in urging the commission of an offence.  It is an element of the offence of incitement that the person intend that the offence incited be committed.  Nonetheless, it is clear from the relevant penalties that incitement is less serious than the direct commission of the corresponding offence.  The penalties for incitement under s 11.4 are as follows:
Penalty:
(a)   if the offence incited is punishable by life imprisonment--imprisonment for 10 years; or (b)   if the offence incited is punishable by imprisonment for 14 years or more, but is not punishable by life imprisonment--imprisonment for 7 years; or (c)  if the offence incited is punishable by imprisonment for 10 years or more, but is not punishable by imprisonment for 14 years or more--imprisonment for 5 years; or (d)   if the offence is otherwise punishable by imprisonment--imprisonment for 3 years or for the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence incited, whichever is the lesser; or (e)  if the offence incited is not punishable by imprisonment--the number of penalty units equal to the maximum number of penalty units applicable to the offence incited.  
31Thus the Code expressly provides that the offence of urging the commission of an act of terrorism intending that offence to be committed is less serious than the offence of making a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act knowing of that connection.  So much was presumably reflected in the order in which the two counts against the applicant were presented on the indictment.
32That analysis reinforces my view that the trial judge was correct not to regard the absence of intention to incite a terrorist act as a factor obviating a finding that the offence of which the applicant was found guilty was close to the worst case of that offence.  The seriousness of the offences created by ss 101.2 to 101.5 lies in their being acts ""connected with"" terrorist acts, as opposed to the urging of others to commit such acts, which Parliament has deemed to be less serious.  The important consideration for the trial judge so far as the offender's state of mind was concerned was his knowledge of the connection.
33The trial judge's characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence as ""not far removed from the worst category of an offence under s 101.5(1)"" was an evaluative judgment of the gravity of the offending against a hypothesised range of the kinds of documents connected with assistance in a terrorist act that might be made by a person knowing of that connection.  The document made by the applicant openly condoned the assassination of infidels; provided the religious or moral justification for such killings; provided some detail as to the ways and means of carrying out such killings and was posted on a website endorsed by al-Qaeda.  I am not satisfied that the trial judge's characterisation of the seriousness of the offending was not rationally open.
Ground 2
34Ground 2 is:
Her Honour erred in concluding that the appellant could not be regarded as a person of prior good character in light of various foreign convictions, even though these were obtained in violation of the principle of procedural fairness.
35McClellan JA addressed that ground at [152] to [161] of this Court's earlier judgment.  I agree with his Honour's reasons for rejecting that ground.
Ground 3
36Ground 3 is:
Her Honour erred in failing to give proper consideration to the question of deterrence. 
37McClellan JA addressed that ground at [162] to [167] of this Court's earlier judgment.  I agree with his Honour's reasons for rejecting that ground and would add the following additional remarks.
38The applicant relied upon the remarks of Calvert-Smith J in R v Adel Yahya (Central Criminal Court, 5 November 2007, unreported), approved by Lord Phillips CJ of the English Court of Appeal in Rahman v R [2008] EWCA Crim 1465 at [8], to support the contention that the stern sentence imposed by the sentencing judge in the present case may be ""counter-productive"" and provoke ""the commission of further offences"" (AS at [98]).  The applicant's written submissions stated:
If sentences are imposed which are more severe than the circumstances of the particular case warrant this will be likely to inflame rather than deter extremism.  
39There is an element of question-begging in that submission in that it assumes as a premise the conclusion contended for in this appeal, namely, that the sentence passed in the present case was ""more severe than the circumstances of the case warrant"".  
40The remarks of Calvert-Smith J in R v Adel Yahya related to a provision of the Terrorism Act 2000 (UK), which carries a maximum penalty of 7 years and under which an accused may be tried summarily.  Its utility is limited in the context of the present offence.
41In R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 691; (2006) 199 FLR 364 at [91] to [92], Whealy J highlighted the substantial role played by the principles of denunciation, deterrence and community protection in sentencing for offences under Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code:
The need for substantial sentences to reflect the principles of general deterrence are obvious in relation to crimes of this kind. Such crimes are hard to detect; they are likely to be committed by members of our own community and often by persons of prior good character and favourable background. One has only to consider the tragedy of the London bombings in 2005 to recognise this observation as a sad truism. Moreover, terrorism is an increasing evil in our world and a country like Australia, with its very openness and trusting nature, is likely to fall easy prey to the horrors of terrorist activities.
In those circumstances, the obligation of the Court is to denounce terrorism and voice its stern disapproval of activities such as those contemplated by the offender here. It may be argued that the imposition of stern penalties, in the context of firm denunciatory statements, will not in fact deter those whose religious and political ideologies are extreme and fanatical. The community is owed this protection even if the obstinacy and madness of extreme views may mean that the protection is a fragile or uncertain one. In my view, the Courts must speak firmly and with conviction in matters of this kind. This does not of course mean that general sentencing principles are undervalued or that matters favourable to an offender are to be overlooked. It does mean, however, that in offences of this kind, as I have said, the principles of denunciation and deterrence are to play a substantial role. There is also a need to recognise that the imposition of a substantial sentence may have a personal impact as a deterrent on this offender so that upon his release he will, it is cautiously hoped, be unlikely or less likely to re-offend. In addition to general deterrence, the need to deter this man from future offences is a potent factor in the sentencing process.
42That approach was upheld on appeal to this Court: Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470.  
43It would be inimical to that approach to accede to a submission that stern sentences may inflame extremism.  Further, it would be naïve to think that the imposition of a lesser custodial sentence by the sentencing judge or a reduction of that sentence by this Court would placate extremists.   
Ground 4
44Ground 4 is:
Her Honour erred in giving inadequate weight to the onerous conditions to which the appellant had been subject while on bail.
45McClellan JA addressed that ground at [168] to [173] of this Court's earlier judgment.  I agree with his Honour's reasons for rejecting that ground.
46A ground which complains of the weight attributed to a matter implicitly acknowledges that the sentencing judge had some regard to it.  The difficulty of establishing error in that circumstance was emphasised by Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, where his Honour said (at [11]):
Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstance in which matters of 'weight' will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.
47In her remarks on sentence in the present case, the judge said (ROS at [50]):
Throughout the period of time, the prisoner was subject to bail conditions which were deemed necessary by the Court, having regard to the nature of the charges the prisoner was facing. Whilst those bail conditions restricted the prisoner's movement to the extent that he was required to reside at a notified address, report daily to Campsie police station and travel only in the metropolitan area of Sydney, they do not qualify as quasi-custodial. 
48Although her Honour did not expressly list ""the whole raft of other conditions, which restricted the [applicant's freedom of expression and freedom of association during this time [on bail]"" (as complained at [101] of the Appellant's Submissions), it does not follow that her Honour did not take those other conditions into account.   I am not persuaded that her Honour overlooked that consideration.
Ground 5
49Ground 5 is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  50McClellan JA addressed that ground briefly at [174] of this Court's earlier judgment.  I agree with his Honour's conclusion that the sentence imposed was within the permissible range for this offence.
51The contention that the sentence was manifestly excessive was based on the cumulative force of the submissions made in support of the applicant's four other grounds, with particular emphasis on the challenge in ground 1 to her Honour's characterisation of the objective gravity of the offence.  Much of the force of ground 5 is removed by the rejection of ground 1.  
52Although I consider that the sentence imposed was stern, I have not been persuaded that it is outside the permissible range or that her Honour's exercise of discretion miscarried.     
Further evidence relating to the activities of the applicant whilst at conditional liberty on bail
53Additional evidence was sought to be adduced by the applicant as to his conduct whilst at liberty on bail.  Subject to what follows, that evidence was relied upon only in the event that this Court was persuaded as to the existence of error and so had to consider re-sentencing the applicant.  In the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the evidence for that purpose.
Relevance of period on bail to the disposal of this application
54Since being sentenced by the trial judge, the applicant has spent 399 days on conditional bail.  
55The sentencing judge made orders as follows:
Belal Saadalah Khazaal, you are convicted of the offence of making a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act. I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment, to date from 31 August 2008.  I fix a non parole period of 9 years.  You may be released to parole after 31 August 2017.
56The sentence accordingly commenced on 31 August 2008.  The decision of this Court quashing the conviction was given on 9 June 2011.  On 7 July 2011, the applicant was granted conditional bail.  At the time bail was granted, the conviction had been quashed.  Bail was granted pending a new trial or other disposition of the proceedings: Khazaal v R (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Adams J, 7 July 2011, unreported).  However, on 7 October 2011, the Crown was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court.  Accordingly, from that date, the applicant was on bail pending the determination of the Crown appeal against the order quashing the conviction.  
57The High Court delivered judgment on 10 August 2012.  The orders of the Court were:
1.  Appeal allowed.
2. Set aside the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal made on 9 June 2011 and in place thereof dismiss the appeal against conviction on count 1 of the indictment. 
3.  Remit the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal for consideration and determination of the appeal against sentence in respect of the conviction on count 1 of the indictment.  
58According to the Crown's written submissions filed 6 September 2012, the applicant's bail was revoked by McClellan JA the same day (10 August 2012).  Assuming that is correct, the applicant was in custody from 31 August 2008 to 7 July 2011 and then on conditional bail from 7 July 2011 to 10 August 2012.  He was evidently taken back into custody on 10 August 2012 and has remained in custody since that date.
59The Crown submits that ""whatever the outcome of the sentence appeal, the non-parole period of nine years fixed by Latham J on 30 September 2009 to expire on 31 August 2017 must be adjusted so that the date of expiration of the non-parole period is increased by the length of time the offender was on bail"".   
60The Crown acknowledged that there is no direct authority on the issue whether such an adjustment ought to be made.  It was submitted that the ""best guide"" is provided by the remarks of Callinan J in Marotta v R [1999] HCA 4; (1999) 160 ALR 525 where, in the context of an application for bail pending appeal, his Honour said (at [9]):
I am of the view that so long as it be clear that the full terms in actual time to be served in prison are served if the appeals are refused, the public interest in the fact of the convictions and their consequences will not be adversely affected, whereas, there is, in my opinion, no public benefit of interest in the incarceration of people who might turn out to have been wrongly convicted according to law [emphasis added].
61As submitted on behalf of the applicant, those remarks were made obiter dicta, without the benefit of argument on the point and in the different context of an application for bail.  Further, the remarks were made in the context of an offender appeal.
62The applicant opposed any postponement of the date on which he will be eligible for parole.  He relied upon the further evidence as to his circumstances since the sentence was imposed for that alternative purpose.  The evidence addressed the distress and anxiety caused by the Crown appeal and the inevitable uncertainty as to the fate of that appeal.  
63Whilst the applicant was initially on bail awaiting a new trial following his own successful appeal, from 7 October 2011 his bail continued pending the determination of the Crown's appeal to the High Court.  The applicant submitted that the distress and anxiety of that period should be taken into consideration either in the event of re-sentence (which does not arise) or in determining whether to make the mechanical adjustment to the applicant's release date sought by the Crown in order to give effect to the sentence imposed at first instance. 
64The applicant sought to tender two medical reports directed to that issue.  In view of the conclusions I have reached, it is not necessary to address that material in these reasons save to observe that, as may be expected, it reveals a degree of real distress caused or contributed to by the course of these proceedings. 65The submission that such distress and anxiety should now be taken into account by this Court was put in two ways.  First, the applicant relied upon decisions of this Court relating to the circumstance where an offender experiences actual anxiety and distress attributable to the possibility of a harsher sentence being imposed following a successful Crown sentence appeal.
66The applicant acknowledged that a Commonwealth offender is not able to rely upon the principle of double jeopardy, that is, the assumption (without proof) of anxiety and distress brought about by a Crown appeal: see Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1; (2012) 244 CLR 638.  However, he relied upon the decisions of this Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 (at [173] to [175]) and R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7 (at [52]) which hold that the actual anxiety and distress attributable to the possibility of a harsher sentence being imposed following a successful Crown sentence appeal remains a factor to which regard must be had on re-sentence.  
67The applicant further relied upon the following remarks of Simpson J in R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17; (2012) 215 A Crim R 476 (at [15]):
[I]t remains open to this Court to take into account the circumstances of the respondents since the sentences were imposed, and particularly those circumstances which directly flow from the compliance with the orders made.
68[As noted in the applicant's submissions, her Honour's remarks at [14] appear to misstate the basis of the decision in Bui but that does not matter for present purposes].
69The applicant submitted that the distress or anxiety experienced by him whilst at liberty on bail since sentence was passed is due to an increased sense of uncertainty brought about by the Crown's conviction appeal to the High Court.  However, the current appeal is not a Crown sentence appeal, nor has any error been identified in the sentence passed at first instance necessitating re-sentencing by this Court.  Accordingly, in my view, the applicant's reliance on the Court's decisions in De La Rosa and R v JW is misconceived.  
70The second way in which the applicant's submission was put sought to rely upon his distress and anxiety as ""fresh"" evidence.  The principles to be applied as to the characterisation and permissible use of such evidence were considered by Buddin J in Anderson v R [2010] NSWCCA 130; (2010) 202 A Crim R 68 (at [44] to [46]).  In that case, his Honour helpfully summarised the considerations relevant to the admissibility of fresh evidence in R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 (at 330) in the following terms:
(1) that the additional material sought to be put before this court is of such significance that the sentencing judge may have regarded it as having a real bearing upon his decision;
(2) that, although its existence may have been known to the applicant, its significance was not realised by him at the time; and
(3) that its existence was not made known to the applicant's legal advisers at the time of those sentencing proceedings.
71Fresh evidence has alternatively been characterised as evidence ""not available to the accused at the time of trial, actively or constructively"": R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at [63] per Kirby J, Mason P and Levine J agreeing. It is implicit in each of those definitions that the facts sought to be established by the tender of such evidence must pre-date the imposition of sentence although not relied upon, and not reasonably able to have been relied upon, at that time. The evidence here is not fresh evidence, so understood.  It relates to facts arising entirely after sentence and, as such, as with the evidence of the applicant's conduct whilst at liberty on bail, cannot be received where no error has been established. The same approach was taken in respect of post-sentence evidence of assistance provided to the authorities in JM v R  [2008] NSWCCA 254 (at [25]) and in respect of a medical condition that had developed post-sentence in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; (2011) 209 A Crim R 509 (at [111] to [112]).
72Further, such evidence cannot itself admit of error, as explained by Simpson J in Khoury v R at [110] as follows:
...evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account, no matter how compelling they may be. If the facts did not exist at the time of sentencing, it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account. 
73For those reasons, I have concluded that the so-called fresh evidence should not be admitted.  I have further concluded that there is no warrant for reducing the sentence on the grounds of the applicant's undoubted distress and anxiety occasioned by the course of these proceedings.
Reasons for concluding that there is no power to adjust the sentence as sought by the Crown
74It is convenient to repeat the terms of the sentence passed by Latham J:
Belal Saadalah Khazaal, you are convicted of the offence of making a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act. I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment, to date from 31 August 2008.  I fix a non parole period of 9 years.  You may be released to parole after 31 August 2017.
75In fixing the sentence to date from 31 August 2008, her Honour was making allowance for the period spent in custody before the conviction was entered, exercising the court's discretion under s 47(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  Section 47 relevantly provides:
(1)  A sentence of imprisonment commences: (a)  subject to section 71 and to any direction under subsection (2), on the day on which the sentence is imposed, or(b)  if the execution of the sentence is stayed under section 80, on the day on which the court decides whether or not to make a home detention order in relation to the sentence.
(2)  A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment: 
(a)  is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or(b)  commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.

76In submissions dated 6 September 2012, the Crown asserted that ""the non-parole period of nine years fixed by Latham J on 30 September 2009 to expire on 31 August 2017 must be adjusted so that the date of expiration of the non-parole period is increased by the length of time the offender was on bail"".  The submissions did not articulate the terms of the order sought or the source of any power to make such an order.
77In the course of preparing these reasons, I formed the view that the Court should have further assistance from the parties as to the source of any power to make an order of the kind sought.  The Crown and the applicant provided further written submissions on that issue.
78The Court drew the parties' attention to the fact that a similar issue was considered by the High Court in Whan v McConaghy [1984] HCA 22; (1984) 153 CLR 631 and by this Court in R v Hall [2004] NSWCCA 127.  In Hall, applying Whan, the Court proceeded on the basis that, unless this Court had a statutory power exercisable when dismissing an appeal to vary the commencement date of the sentence imposed at first instance, that sentence continued to run while the applicant was on bail: at [28].  Whilst that was a sentence governed by different legislation, the circumstances are similar in that the sentence imposed by Latham J commenced on a day fixed in accordance with similar legislation (here, s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).
79An important difference in the present case is that, at the time bail was granted by Adams J, the conviction had been quashed and a new trial ordered.  The order for imprisonment was not expressly stayed at any stage: cf United Mexican States v Cabal [2001] HCA 60; (2001) 209 CLR 165, especially at [2] to [6].  The Crown submitted that the quashing of the conviction may nonetheless be taken to have quashed the sentence imposed in consequence of it.  Whether or not that is technically correct, it may certainly be accepted that the quashing of the conviction deprived the sentence order of any operative force.
80It is important, however, to focus on the ultimate point reached by the orders made.  As submitted on behalf of the applicant, the effect of the orders of the High Court (in setting aside the order of this Court quashing the conviction) was to revive or reinstate the original order for imprisonment made by Latham J.  That order imposed a term of imprisonment of 12 years to date from 31 August 2008.
81The decision in Hall holds that the existence of any power in this Court to vary the commencement date of a sentence passed by another court must be found in a statute: at [28] per Handley JA; Dowd J agreeing at [50]; Greg James J agreeing at [51] and see his Honour's additional remarks at [53].  
82The Crown has pointed to no statutory power to make an order of the kind sought.  Section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies only where a court has imposed a penalty that is contrary to law or failed to impose a penalty required by law.  Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies only where the court is of the opinion that a more or less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.  The powers in special cases under s 7 of the Criminal Appeal Act do not have any application in the present case.  Sections 18 and 25A of the Criminal Appeal Act provide that time during which a person is at liberty on bail pending the determination of that person's appeal (to this Court or to the High Court) does not count as part of the appellant's sentence (s 28A confers power on the court to adjust a sentence in that event).  However, there is no equivalent provision addressing Crown appeals.  The fact that the case of an offender appeal is expressly addressed in the legislation only reinforces the absence of power in the case of bail pending a new trial where there is a Crown appeal against an order quashing a conviction.
83The Crown's supplementary submissions do not dispute any of those propositions and do not point to any other source of power to make an order of the kind sought.  The Crown simply asserts that imprisonment for the full non-parole period of nine years ""can only be achieved"" in the manner submitted in the Crown's first written submissions (filed 6 September 2013).  The logic of that assertion cannot be assailed, but it is ultimately aspirational.  The Crown's submissions provide no answer as to the critical question of power.  
84A court that derives its power exclusively from statute cannot supplant the statute with its own sense of what should be done in order to achieve individual justice in any particular case.   Where a court's powers are confined to those conferred by the parliament, the community must look to the parliament, and not the court, to address any anomalous want of power.  I am not persuaded that this Court has power to adjust the order of Latham J as requested by the Crown.  85For those reasons, the orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

2761718,Kamali v R; Mosawi v R; Shahsawari v R; Bejoushin v R [2013] NSWSC 799,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Seyed Alireza Kamali, Sayed Ibrahim Mosawi, Kamelledin Shahsawari and Amir Manafi Bejoushin have each applied to the Court for a certificate pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) (""the CCC Act"").

2The applicants, and others, were accused of offences of riot and affray arising out of a disturbance that occurred at Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""VIDC"") on 20 April 2011. These are offences against ss 93B and 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The trial for those offences has now concluded. Messrs Kamali and Mosawi were found not guilty by directed verdict at the conclusion of the Crown case on 21 March 2013. The jury found Messrs Shahsawari and Bejoushin not guilty on 17 April 2013.

3The applicants have consented to the application being heard on the papers. I have been provided with written submissions by Ms Yehia SC for Mr Kamali, Mr Brasch for Mr Mosawi, Mr Jankowski for Mr Bejoushin, and Mr Little for Mr Shahsawari. The Crown has also made submissions, and the applicants have provided further submissions in reply.

The legislation

4The provisions of the CCC Act relevant to my consideration of the application are as follows:


2 Certificate may be granted 
(1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may: 


(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken...
...
grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1)(a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.
...
 
3 Form of certificate 
(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate: 



(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and



(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances
   ...


3A Evidence of further relevant facts may be adduced 

(1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3 (1) (a) to ""all the relevant facts"" is a reference to: 


(a) the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and


(b) any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and


(c) any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that: 



(i) relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and



(ii) were not adduced in the proceedings.

(2) Where, on an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the defendant adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may: 


(a) order that leave be given to the prosecutor in those proceedings or, in the absence of the prosecutor, to any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, to comment on the evidence of those further relevant facts, and


(b) if the Court, Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any such comments, order that leave be given to the prosecutor or to the person representing the Minister to examine any witness giving evidence for the applicant or to adduce evidence tending to show why the certificate applied for should not be granted and adjourn the application so that that evidence may be adduced.

(3) If, in response to an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the prosecutor or, in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may: 


(a) order that leave be given to the defendant to comment on the evidence of those relevant facts, and


(b) if the Court or Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any of those comments, order that leave be given to the defendant to examine any witness giving evidence for the prosecutor or that authorised person.

5The effect of granting a certificate is to enable the applicant to apply to the Director-General of the Department of Attorney General and Justice for payment of costs incurred in the proceedings. It is then a matter for the Director-General to determine whether the making of a payment to the applicant is justified and, if so, to determine the amount of costs that should be paid (s 4).

Principles

6The principles I am to apply in my consideration of the applications were helpfully distilled by McColl JA (Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreeing) at [36] in Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121; (2007) 171 A Crim R 510. Since the principles extend over seventeen paragraphs, I will not reproduce them here, save for the following two:

(e) The task of the court dealing with an application under the CCC Act is to ask the hypothetical question, whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings: Allerton [(1991) 24 NSWLR 550] (at 559 - 560); the judicial officer considering an application must find what, within the Act, were ""all the relevant facts"" and assume the prosecution to have been ""in possession of evidence of"" all of them and must then determine whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of those facts before the proceedings were instituted, ""it would not have been reasonable to institute [them]; an applicant for a certificate must succeed on both the ""facts issue"" and the ""reasonableness issue"": Treasurer in & for the State of New South Wales v Wade & Dukes (Court of Appeal, 16 June 1994, unreported, BC9402561) per Mahoney JA (with whom Handley and Powell JJA agreed); Ramskogler [(1995) 82 A Crim R 128] (at 134 - 135) per Kirby P; 

(f) The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the CCC Act; all of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker: Allerton (at 559 - 560); Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [9]); the relevant facts include those relevant to the offences charged and the threshold question posed by s 3(1)(a); other facts will also be relevant and admissible going, amongst other things, to the question posed by s 3(1)(b) and to the ultimate question whether, assuming that the court is of the opinion required to be specified, it should exercise its discretion under s 2: Gwozdecky v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 65 A Crim R 160 (at 164 - 165) per Sheller J (with whom Mahoney JA and Hope AJA agreed);

7As may be seen, the definition of ""relevant facts"" in s 3A is limited: while categorising different types of relevant facts, it does not expand upon what makes a fact ""relevant"". In Chalal v DPP [2008] NSWCA 152; (2008) 185 A Crim R 580, Ipp JA (Giles JA agreeing) found at [29] that the necessary construction of ""relevant facts"" was ""facts relevant to the reasonableness of the institution of the criminal proceedings."" Three types of relevant facts may be considered:


(1)The first are those relevant facts ""established in the proceedings"": s 3A(1)(a). Basten JA, giving separate judgment in Chalal, took ""proceedings"" to have the same meaning as it has in s 2(1) (at [62]). That is, the criminal proceedings instituted by the Crown and concluded by the discharge or acquittal of the applicants. I am not bound by his Honour's reasoning, but the construction is logical and I can find no other authority on point. An implication is that this category includes material established at committal and on the voir dire.


(2)The second are relevant facts established by the defendant, in conjunction with the making of the CCC Act application, to the satisfaction of the Court: s 3A(1)(b).


(3)The third type of relevant facts are those established by the Crown which ""relate to evidence"" in the possession of the Crown at the time the decision to institute proceedings was made and which were not adduced in the proceedings: s 3A(1)(c). These facts may include, for example, credibility evidence that supports primary evidence to be adduced at trial and may influence a decision to institute proceedings, but is not itself admissible. (For the purposes of the application, the institution of proceedings means the date of arrest or charge: Mordaunt [36(c)].)

8In summary, I am to determine firstly what facts the hypothetical prosecutor is to be assumed to have been in possession of, and secondly whether, armed with those facts, it was not reasonable to have instituted proceedings. If the latter question is answered in the affirmative, it is within my discretion to grant a certificate under the CCC Act.

9Section 3(1)(b) is a further test requiring consideration of the acts and omissions of the defendants. But the Crown does not contend that any act or omission of the defendants in relation to the proceedings, such as refusing to answer questions put by police officers in an interview, was not reasonable in the circumstances.

The evidence

10The evidence in respect of each applicant varied, and I do not propose to extensively recount it in each instance. But the reader might benefit from a brief note of the main sources, especially as I may refer to a witness by name.

11A company called ""Serco"" was contracted by the Australian government to run the VIDC. The evidence at trial came largely from Serco employees. These included 



Ms Susan Bishop; 
Mr Nathan Kiner; 
Mr Simon Atachparian; 
Mr Michael O'Connor; and 
Mr Wayne Carmichael. 

12A Sri Lankan detainee who was in VIDC at the time, Mr Augustus Henry-Peters, also gave evidence.

13Each of these witnesses had made written statements describing what they saw on the evening in question. Some, in particular Ms Bishop, had made more than one statement. Ms Bishop and Messrs Kiner, Atachparian and O'Connor had made various notes and lists contemporaneously with, or soon after, the disturbance, and the Crown was also in possession of these.

14Witnesses were cross-examined by defence counsel at committal. Further preliminary cross-examination was conducted at a pre-trial hearing between 29 January and 5 February 2013, in accordance with the principle in R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337 at 339. This was permitted in respect of witnesses not available at committal or who had since provided further statements.

15Lastly, of course, the witnesses gave evidence at the trial in the presence of the jury.

Seyed Alireza Kamali

16Mr Kamali was charged with one offence of riot in contravention of s 93B Crimes Act, which is in the following terms:

(1) Where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety, each of the persons using unlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot and liable to imprisonment for 15 years. 

(2) It is immaterial whether or not the 12 or more persons use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously. 

(3) The common purpose may be inferred from conduct. 

(4) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene. 

(5) Riot may be committed in private as well as in public places.

17The offence of riot has two central elements. The first relates to context and requires that the accused was one of 12 or more persons using or threatening unlawful violence for the common purpose. The second relates to the conduct of the accused, and requires that he or she actually used, not merely threatened, unlawful violence. See R v Hawi & ors (No 18) [2011] NSWSC 1664. 

18The Crown put its case against Mr Kamali in the following way. At about 11pm on the evening of the disturbance, some detainees were seen to be involved in activities relating to a bonfire that was lit on the soccer pitch. Mr Kamali was said to have been one of those people. He was alleged to have moved wheelie bins to the fire, and to have placed items such as toilet tissues, bed sheets and pillows upon the blaze.

Applicant's written submissions

19Ms Yehia's submissions were directed to the Crown failure to satisfactorily establish that her client used unlawful violence. She submitted that the relevant facts for my consideration of her client's application are those described in my judgment of 21 March 2013, directing the jury to return a verdict of not guilty: R v Abdollahi (No 9) [2013] NSWSC 482. In particular, she refered to [7]-[20] of that decision. After describing the evidence adduced, my finding at [20] was:

That is the evidence upon which the Crown relies for the proposition that the accused Kamali used unlawful violence. In my view, as a matter of law, it is incapable of establishing that he did. The evidence of Mr Atachparian and [Mr] Henry-Peters is capable of establishing that Mr Kamali was present when others took items [onto] the soccer field where the items were set on fire. But it is incapable of establishing more than he was present and ""running around."" The evidence of Ms Bishop does not add anything. The third person she described is incapable of being regarded as the accused Kamali, as opposed to some other detainee.

20Ms Yehia maintained that there was no act or omission of Mr Kamali that contributed to the institution of proceedings. I accept that submission. She also sought to adduce a further relevant fact in accordance with s 3A(1)(b), being a no bill application made on behalf of Mr Kamali on 7 November 2012. The no bill application does not add to the facts available to the Crown. Rather, it comments upon them. Nor is the event of an accused making a no bill application a relevant fact. Thus, I do not accept that the application must be considered under s 3A(1)(b). The criticisms it made of the Crown case were, in any event, borne out in the trial.

Crown written submissions

21The Crown submitted that ""all the relevant facts"" must include evidence contained in statements and notes made by witnesses who gave evidence in the trial. It was the case that a number of witnesses did not ""come up to proof"" in that they were unable to recall various matters recorded in their statements.

22The Crown submitted that it was not unreasonable to have instituted proceedings where witnesses did not give evidence at trial in accordance with their statements. The events in question involved many acts committed by many persons over several hours almost two years before, and the ""Crown could not be expected to 'guess' that ... those witnesses would not come up to proof in relation to one or more of the persons they identified as being involved in the incident within the compound.""

23The Crown sought to rely upon the various witness statements and notes pursuant to s 3A(1)(c).

24The Crown also referred, at [6] of its submissions, to the broad definition of ""violence"" in s 93A Crimes Act. While this point is not developed, I take it to mean that the question of whether a person had committed an act of violence was so at large that it was proper to leave any suggestion of it to the jury.

25Lastly, the Crown pointed to the failure of defence to cross-examine one witness ([22]) or to directly challenge the evidence of two others ([28] and [32]). Specifically to Mr Kamali, it stated at [49] ""there was no suggestion from Kamali that Ms Bishop would not be able to give evidence identifying him as being so involved"". Whether the Crown argues that these failures to cross-examine are relevant facts, facts supporting relevant facts, or other, is not stated.

Applicant's written submissions in reply

26Ms Yehia made two points in response to the Crown submissions. The first point is captured at [9] of her submissions in reply:

The Crown...appears to be submitting that the matter should be decided only on the evidence available to it prior to the commencement of trial, or otherwise provided in statements during the trial, on the basis that it cannot be responsible for the failure of witnesses to give evidence according to their statements. If that were the proper test, it is submitted that no hypothetical exercise would be required...

27The applicant's second point takes issue with the Crown observations referred to at [25] above. Ms Yehia argues that the fact that defence did not cross-examine witnesses (or cross-examine on a particular point) is an irrelevant consideration for the purposes of the application.

Consideration

28Section 3A does not in explicit terms include within the definition of ""relevant facts"" the additional material the Crown sought to rely upon, being witness statements and notes, some made before proceedings were instituted and some after. No point about this was taken in submissions in reply for the applicant; indeed, reference was made to the following from the judgment of McColl JA in Mordaunt (at [36(f)]):

The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the CCC Act ...

29The issue between the parties was the significance of material in witness statements and notes; not whether such material may be considered at all. Accordingly I will approach the determination of the application by Mr Kamali (and the others) with regard to both the evidence in the trial and that which was otherwise available to the prosecution.

30This leaves for consideration the ""reasonableness issue"". The Crown submitted at [23]:

The Crown could not be expected to anticipate that Ms Bishop would not be able to recall the name of Kamali - during the pre-trial hearing Ms Bishop stated: 'I would have recognised him anyway'. 

31The Crown also argued, at [57]:

Notwithstanding the facts as they emerged at trial, it is submitted that it was reasonable for the Crown to institute the proceedings against Kamali.

32As Ms Yehia correctly argued at [9] of her submissions in reply, these arguments misstate the CCC Act inquiry. The hypothetical prosecution must know that their witnesses will not come up to proof in respect of an element of the offence. It is not a question of risk, or leaving a factual dispute to the jury. In this application, possession of probative material in statements or notes must be weighed against the hypothetical knowledge that the evidence they contain will never be given.

33I found in R v Abdollahi (No 9) that the evidence was incapable of establishing an element of the offence. The bare fact that I determined the evidence to be insufficient to ground a conviction does not entitle the present applicant to a favourable decision: R v Williams; ex parte Williams [1970] 1 NSWR 81 (at 83) per Sugarman P (with whom O'Brien J agreed; cf Manning JA (at 85)), Mordaunt at [36(k)-(m)]. But it was not the case that the evidence was meagre, or that it was unreliable: it was that it was not there.

34I have already referred to the separate judgement of Basten JA in Chalal. In that judgment, his Honour also made the observation that the failure to establish any factual basis for a particular element of the prosecution case will tend to support a costs application. This is opposed to the situation where the evidence for a particular element is merely unsatisfactory. Fullerton J endorsed this comment (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J) in Cittidini v R [2010] NSWCCA 291 at [8]. I agree with the proposition.

35As an addendum, I should resolve the question raised inferentially by the Crown, and refuted by Ms Yehia, that the failure of defence to cross-examine particular witnesses before trial was relevant to the (hypothetical) decision to institute proceedings. I do not think this is a relevant fact for the purposes of the exercise required by s 3(1)(a). In as far as it falls under s 3(1)(b), it was reasonable in the circumstances. I do not see how it is the responsibility of defence counsel to point out flaws in the Crown case at an interlocutory stage, except in so far as they could be expected to preserve the best interests of the accused, which is not itself a consideration in the present judgment.

Conclusion

36Having regard to the matters above, it is my opinion that, had the prosecution been in possession of all the relevant facts in respect of Mr Kamali, in particular the knowledge that the evidence at trial would be insufficient to establish an element of the charge, it would not have been reasonable to institute the subject proceedings. I find that to the extent that any act or omission of Mr Kamali contributed to the decision to begin or continue proceedings, it was an act or omission that was reasonable in the circumstances.

37In as far as I possess residual discretion under s 2, I consider it appropriate to grant a certificate in this case.

Sayed Ibrahim Mosawi

38Mr Mosawi was charged with one count of aiding and abetting a riot. In accordance with the provisions of s 345 Crimes Act, he was liable as a principle to the full penalty for the offence. He was found not guilty by a directed verdict at the close of the Crown case.

39The case against Mr Mosawi was outlined to the jury in the Crown's opening address:

So far as the particular acts relating to him are concerned, you will hear evidence that between about, or from about 7.30pm clients on the ground were attempting to gain access to the roof. At about this time Mr Mosawi was seen encouraging others to climb on to the roof. In broken English he was yelling for everyone to get on the roof saying, ""Go, go, go"". He was gesturing with his hands for others to get on to the roof. At that time, or around about that time, Mr Mosawi broke the tape, that is the cordon tape, being used to mark off the cordoned area. And at that time clients on the roof were throwing tiles in the direction of staff members. So that outlines the evidence I anticipate being called against Mr Mosawi.

40(The cordon tape had been laid out by Serco staff seeking to prevent detainees joining others who had started a protest on the roof of the adjoining building.) Mr Mosawi was also alleged to have applied force to Ms Bishop, who was standing behind the tape, in order to move her out of the way. Ms Bishop's police statement supported this version of events.

41Ms Bishop's evidence at trial corresponded with her written statement:

Q. Any observations made of any other clients at the time of the rush of clients? 
A. There was another client who pulled the barrier tape that we had to allow the other clients to get closer to the fence at the end of the Macquarie building. 

Q. When you say ""barrier tape"", what do you mean by that? 
A. It's just like a plastic tape, very similar to what the police would use, like ""do not cross"". 

...

Q. The clients that you saw, were they on the left side of the tape as you look at the sketch prior to the rush? 
A. Yes, they were behind the tape. 

Q. You said the tape was broken, is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you see that happen? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did you see? 
A. One of the clients ripped the tape. 

Q. Who was that? 
A. That was Mosawi, Mosawi. 

Q. And at the time that Mr Mosawi ripped the tape, did you hear him say anything? 
A. As he ripped the tape he pushed me to the side. There was a lot of noise and yelling going on at that time. I couldn't distinctly hear what he said. 

Q. When you said, ""Pushed me to the side"", you indicated with your left elbow a movement with the elbow backwards, is that right? 
A. As he broke the tape he pushed. 

Q. In the action of breaking the tape, his arms moved to the left and right and one of them hit you, is that what you're saying? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you hear him say anything at that time or not? 
A. I can't remember. 

Q. There was a lot of noise going on, is that right? 
A. There was a lot of noise. 

Q. When you say ""a lot of noise"", what are you hearing? 
A. Just a lot of voices yelling. 

...

Q. After Mr Mosawi broke the tape and hit you with his arm, did you make any other observations of him? 
A. No, I can't recall, no, he 

Q. Sorry? 
A. No.


 
42No other witness identified Mr Mosawi as participating in the disturbance. In R v Abdollahi (No 9) at [22]-[35] I found that it would be impossible for a jury to conclude that the man Ms Bishop identified as ""Mosawi"" was Sayed Ibrahim Mosawi. I was led to that conclusion by the paucity of the evidence, Ms Bishop's marked difficulty in pronouncing the names of detainees, and the presence of other detainees with similar-sounding names within the compound.

Applicant's written submissions

43In his written submissions, Mr Brasch drew attention to the above facts and others. He observed that a statement in the Crown brief by a witness who did not give evidence, Mr Jaskaran Singh, provided a reason for thinking that one Sayad Ashgar Musawi was identified as playing an active role in the protests. Mr Brasch also pointed out that Ms Bishop's responses to cross-examination in the pre-trial hearing regarding her familiarity with Mr Mosawi were equivocal at best. He also made a number of general points about the chaotic circumstances in which the identification was made.

44In addition to the matters above, which are concerned with identification, Mr Brasch submitted that it was inherently unlikely for Mr Mosawi to be participating in the protests at all. A statement was attached to the applicant's submissions that includes material establishing that Mr Mosawi was cooperative with Serco staff and provided them with information about daily events, tensions and threats within the VIDC. I accept that these are further relevant facts under the provisions of s 3A(1)(b) and the fact of Mr Mosawi's assistance is established to my satisfaction. The evidence of Mr Carmichael given at trial also supports these facts.

Crown submissions

45The Crown relies upon the same general argument as it applied to the application of Mr Kamali. That is, it is not unreasonable to institute proceedings where, in the event, a witness does not give the evidence he or she is expected to give.

46The Crown pointed out that it also had access to contemporaneous, albeit brief, notes made by Messrs Kiner, Atachparian and O'Connor that supported Ms Bishop's memory of events. Ms Bishop's own handwritten notes were consistent with her recollection.

47The Crown made reference to a number of failures by Mr Mosawi's counsel to cross-examine. It states at [51]:

In relation to Mosawi, the Crown notes that at no time prior to Ms Bishop giving her evidence, including at the Basha Inquiry, did Mosawi suggest to her that she would not be able to recall his involvement in the disturbance. As noted in the applicant's submissions (p 15), Ms Bishop knew Mosawi by sight, but not directly by name.

48As with its submissions in relation to Mr Kamali, the basis upon which I should consider this was left unarticulated.

49The Crown responded to the further relevant facts submitted by Mr Brasch by casting them in the following light, at [60]:

Viewed objectively, these facts show that Mosawi was aware of the likelihood of a disturbance prior to it happening. Mr Carmichael's opinion of Mosawi's statements, and his opinion as to the reasons for raising it with him, is irrelevant to such a consideration. Viewed objectively, the material supported the institution of proceedings against Mosawi in that it revealed that he had prior knowledge of the likelihood of a protest against continuing detention, especially when coupled with the statement of Ms Bishop and considered in light of the notes made by her and the other three officers.

Applicant's submissions in reply

50Mr Brasch argued that it was inconsistent for the Crown to be relying upon statements and notes made by witnesses in support of its resistance to the application when in may be inferred that the Crown accepted that such material was inadmissible at trial.

51In response to the argument that a failure of a witness to come up to proof does not make a prosecution unreasonable, Mr Brasch pointed out, first, that the CCC Act test does not involve a criticism of the Crown. It is, after all, an artificial exercise. Second, he argued that evidentiary problems that arise during the course of the trial and the evidence actually adduced at the trial are pertinent to the CCC Act assessment.

52Like Ms Yehia (see [27]), Mr Brasch took issue with the Crown's inference that failure to cross-examine particular witnesses should somehow sound against his application.

53Finally, the submissions in reply contest the Crown's use of the additional relevant facts relating to Mr Mosawi's assistance to Serco staff. Mr Brasch reasserts his reason for introducing the evidence: that Mr Mosawi's actions were not consistent with those of a person likely to support the disturbance.

Consideration

54I accept that the further additional facts relied upon by Mr Brasch indicate that the Crown case was more unlikely. I do not accept the use the Crown makes of those facts as providing material that would make a prosecution, as perhaps opposed to an investigation, more reasonable. It is reasonable to expect that the prosecution should make a proper evaluation of contradictory evidence, even where there is sufficient material to establish a prima facie case: Mordaunt at [36(i)]. Having said that, however, I do not believe that the additional material relied upon by the applicant is of any more than marginal significance.

55I reject any suggestion that the failure to cross-examine is a relevant consideration.

56Regardless of the additional material tending to support Mr Mosawi's involvement, the Crown's case at trial was reliant upon the brief evidence of a single witness where, as it turned out, the ability of that witness to identify the accused accurately was extremely suspect. Facts that emerged at trial, such as Ms Bishop's difficulty with the pronunciation of names, would have been relevant to the institution of proceedings. This is particularly so given that she did not describe Mr Mosawi's appearance and only referred to him by his family name in light of the fact that there were two other detainees with similar sounding and spelt family names. The circumstances in which Mr Mosawi was said to have committed the offence were so fleeting that the Crown would have been expected to be cautious about instituting proceedings where the identification was not sound. Here, it was anything but.

57I do not think that this was a case where the question of guilt was (or would have been) decided upon credibility or ""word against word"". The Crown case was inherently weak: see Mordaunt at [36(m)].

Conclusion 

58Having regard to the matters above, it is my opinion that, had the prosecution been in possession of all the relevant facts in respect of Mr Mosawi, in particular the inherent weaknesses in the evidence of Mr Bishop, it would not have been reasonable to institute the subject proceedings. I find that to the extent that any act or omission of Mr Mosawi contributed to the decision to begin or continue proceedings, it was an act or omission that was reasonable in the circumstances.

59In as far as I possess residual discretion under s 2, I consider it appropriate to grant a certificate in this case.

Kamelledin Shahsawari

60Mr Shahsawari was charged with one count of riot, and of affray in the alternative (s 93C Crimes Act). The jury found him not guilty of both charges on 17 April 2013.

61The Crown case against Mr Shahsawari was that at some time around 10:30pm on the evening of the disturbance, he and three other detainees let off fire extinguishers in a riotous fashion. Ms Bishop was the only witness able to support the case against Mr Shahawari.

62Mr Little made an application for a directed verdict of not guilty a week after the conclusion of the Crown case. Unlike the applications for Messrs Kamali and Mosawi, I did not conclude that there was insufficient evidence to base of verdict of guilty against Mr Shahsawari. In my judgment I stated my view that there was ""just enough"" to make out the elements of the charge: R v Abdollahi (No 10) [2013] NSWSC 483 at [3]-[4].

Applicant's written submissions

63Mr Little made the following submission at pp 10-11:


It is submitted that ""all the relevant facts"" in the proceedings against the accused were

Susan Bishop's witness statements (tendered on pre-trial applications) as qualified by her evidence the facts or material outlined in the sworn evidence of Susan Bishop


Susan Bishop's evidence both as to the alleged actions of the accused and her recognition evidence.


the material in the subpoenaed documents produced by QBE Insurance Ltd particularly that part of the psychiatrist's report dealing with memory difficulties including not being able to name the Prime Minister. These require tendering on the application, I request they be treated as tendered from the papers available in Court.


The accused's ERISP. I request the Crown either produce a copy to tender or concede that the accused exercised his right to silence.


The balance of the evidence relating to fire extinguishers. 


[emphasis in original]

64I take the QBE Insurance Ltd document and the ERISP to be relied upon under s 3A(1)(b).

65Mr Little submitted that Ms Bishop's recognition of Mr Shahsawari was unreliable. He submitted that it was lacking in detail as to his appearance and identifying features. No other witness identified Mr Shahsawari as being involved with the fire extinguishers, and Mr Kiner gave evidence that contradicted Ms Bishop. Mr Kiner identified another detainee, Al Halfi, where Ms Bishop had nominated Mr Shahsawari.

Crown written submissions

66The Crown put a different argument in relation to the applicants who were found not guilty by the deliberation of a jury, and not by directed verdict. In the case of Mr Shahsawari (and, as will be seen, Mr Bejoushin) it was not the situation that the relevant witnesses could not ""come up to proof"". The Crown argued, at [15]:

The submissions made on behalf of Shahsawari and Bejoushin fail to appreciate the significance of the decision of the Court to allow the jury to determine the question of their guilt. The Crown submits that a conclusion that the matter was for the jury to determine provides strong support for the view that the decisions to institute proceedings against Shahsawari were reasonable. Whether Shahsawari or Bejoushin were guilty, or not, was properly left for the jury to determine.

67That is to say, the Crown relies upon my decisions to allow Ms Bishop to give evidence despite objections as to its accuracy (R v Abdollahi (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 479) and to refuse a directed verdict in respect of Mr Shahsawari (R v Abdollahi (No 10)), as determinative of the question of reasonableness. The Crown recognised that the case against Mr Shahsawari was not strong, but refers to Mordaunt at [36(m)]:

...matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and alike are likely to fall on the other side for the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact-finder whether is be judge or jury.

68As with the other applications, the Crown pointed out that it also had access to contemporaneous notes made by Messrs Kiner, Atachparian and O'Connor that supported Ms Bishop's memory of events. Ms Bishop's own handwritten notes were consistent with her recollection.

Applicant's written submissions in reply

69Mr Little cavilled with the Crown's statement of the CCC Act test, at [4], as ""whether it would have been reasonable to charge"". He submitted that the correct test, ""institute proceedings"", sets a higher bar than ""charge"". He referred to Mordaunt at [36(h)], particularly the statement that the relevant test is not whether there is reasonable suspicion that might justify an arrest.

70The submissions in reply contain a novel argument in response to the Crown's reliance upon notes taken by Messrs Kiner, Atachparian and O'Connor. Mr Little argued, at p 2, in relation to the expression in s 3(1)(a) of being in ""possession of evidence of all the relevant facts"":

Evidence means evidence. There never was evidence (admissible) of the contents of the so called list [compiled by Messrs Kiner, Atachparian and O'Connor]. On the voir dire there was evidence of comments being contributed by others (which never made any statement of any witness).

The list did not contain admissible evidence nor was there ever any qualification by the Crown to indicate it was more than inadmissible.

In these circumstances it was never and could never be reasonable to treat it as ""evidence of all"" (or any)"" relevant facts"".

71It will be recalled that Mr Little, in his principle submissions, described as ""relevant facts"" at least two items that were never admitted as evidence. The concept of ""relevant facts"" as defined in s 3A is not qualified by any requirement that it is restricted to evidence admissible in the proceedings. And reliance is placed upon material in support of the application with no apparent concern for its admissibility and the fact that it was not evidence in the trial.

72Mr Little submitted that there can be no speculation as to why the jury acquitted. He submitted that they must have not accepted the evidence of Ms Bishop.

Consideration

73The points raised in the submissions in reply may be dealt with briefly.

74I accept that the test for whether a prosecution was unreasonable is not the same test that applies to arrest. But the submission goes nowhere. And the Crown is plainly correct in referring to the time of charge as the time when the decision to institute proceedings has been made: Mordaunt [36(c)].

75I do not accept the submission that relevant facts must be evidence adduced at trial. That is not the sense with which ""evidence"" is used in the CCC Act. If it was, ss 3A(1)(b) and (c) could not operate. The contents of the notes made by Messrs Kiner, Atachparian and O'Connor have been established in the proceedings to my satisfaction. So too have the fact that the applicant exercised his right to silence, and that there was reason to believe that Ms Bishop's memory had been adversely affected by the traumatic events of the disturbance at VIDC. That much was plain from her evidence alone; there is nothing to be gained by recourse to other material.

76I must determine whether it was reasonable for the prosecution, being in possession of all these facts, to have instituted proceedings.

77Only Ms Bishop was able to name Mr Shahsawari as being involved with the discharge of fire extinguishers. But while she had some difficulty with the pronunciation of the name ""Shahsawari"" (T 1096), there was no evidence establishing that she could be accidentally referring to another detainee with a similar name (cf Mosawi). She gave evidence that she knew him by name from her day-to-day duties at VIDC and from conversations with him (T 1096). She recalled him being ""a little tall"" and ""taller than the majority"", and having prominent cheekbones. I observed Mr Shahsawari in the dock for the length of the trial, and the latter was, in particular, an obvious feature that the jury would be able to evaluate for themselves. Mr Little submitted, at p 23 of his principle submissions, that ""the comment 'he's taller than the majority' is prima facie inconsistent with 'a little tall'"". I respectfully disagree.

78Another feature that distinguishes this evidence from that regarding Mr Mosawi is that it related to an activity observed from a safe distance that went on for more than a fleeting moment. The question of Ms Bishop's memory is not relevant to the evidence against Mr Shahsawari. The evidence she gave at trial was consistent with her contemporaneous notes and statements.

79Having regard only to Ms Bishop's evidence, I would not be inclined to view the decision to prosecute as unreasonable. Her evidence was of such a quality that a verdict of guilty could have been entered. There was a prima facie case against Mr Shahsawari that was sufficient to go to a jury. But that does not determine the CCC Act question. My decisions in R v Abdollahi (No 6) and R v Abdollahi (No 10) are not conclusive: R v McFarlane (Supreme Court of NSW, Blanch J, 12 August 1994, unreported), Fesja v R (1995) 82 A Crim R 253.

80The evidence of Mr Kiner is troublesome. As I have said before, the Crown is expected to make an evaluation of contradictory evidence. Ms Bishop and Mr Kiner each saw four men discharging fire extinguishers in the evening. Their evidence was the same in identifying three of the men. They differed as to whether the fourth person was Mr Shahsawari or the detainee Al Halfi. It was not conclusively established that they were referring to the same event, but it was an available inference.

81The contradictory evidence of Mr Kiner created a weakness in the Crown case. But it was not one that was outside of the ability of the jury to evaluate. It was not, adopting Mordaunt at [36(m)], a conflict of important expert evidence. It was ""word against word"" between two lay witnesses, neither of whom was so substantially lacking in credit as to render it unreasonable for the jury to be the ultimate judge.

Conclusion

82Having regard to the matters above, it is my opinion that, had the prosecution been in possession of all the relevant facts in respect of Mr Shahsawari it would not have been unreasonable to institute the subject proceedings. 

Amir Manafi Bejoushin

83Mr Bejoushin was charged with one count of riot. The jury found him not guilty on 17 April 2013.

84The Crown case against Mr Bejoushin was that at about 11pm on the evening of the disturbance, he and others were observed to be pulling wheelie bins onto the soccer field where a bonfire was being lit. It was not alleged that he had actually ignited the fire.

85Ms Bishop gave evidence of having seen Mr Bejoushin pull bins from the laundry building towards the fire on the soccer pitch. Mr Atachparian said that he had seen Mr Bejoushin pulling bins over from the Clarence Building, which is near the laundry. He also said that he had seen Mr Bejoushin run through the laundry trying to pick up items there.

Applicant's written submissions

86Mr Jankowski pointed to a number of weaknesses in the evidence of Mr Bishop and Mr Atachparian as it related to Mr Bejoushin. They are many, and need not be repeated in their entirety here. He observed that Mr O'Connor gave evidence that he knew Mr Bejoushin, and that he was not one of the persons he observed pulling bins.

87Mr Jankowski sought to adduce a further relevant fact in accordance with s 3A(1)(b), being a no bill application made on behalf of Mr Bejoushin in October 2012. I decline to consider this for the same reason I declined Ms Yehia's similar application at [20] above. I accept such material might be relevant in some cases to the exercise required by s 3(1)(b), but there is no serious contest on that question here.

88The conclusion to the applicant's submission, at [37], is that it was unreasonable to have instituted proceedings having regard to the following:



The internal inconsistencies in the evidence of both Ms Bishop and Mr Atchaparian [sic].


The internal inconsistencies between Ms Bishop, Mr Atchaparian [sic] and Mr O'Conner.


The inadequate and unreliable nature of the identification/recognition evidence of Mr Bejoushin by both Ms Bishop and Mr Atachaparian [sic].


The nature and quality of the character evidence of both Mr Patten and Ms Binns.


The absence of any evidence from numerous other SERCO Officers identifying Mr Bejoushin doing anything on the night, even though those witnesses gave evidence about observing the movement of wheelie bins.


The lack of any corroboration of Ms Bishop's account of wheelie bins being moved.


There was no act or omission of Mr Bejoushin that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings...

Crown written submissions

89The Crown's argument in relation to Mr Shahsawari, reproduced at [66]-[68] above, applies to Mr Bejoushin. (But it is mistaken in implying that Mr Bejoushin made an application for a directed verdict: he did not.)

90The Crown did not dispute the matters raised by Mr Jankowski in relation to the evidence of Ms Bishop and Mr Atachparian. It did, however, argue that Ms Bishop and Mr Atachparian were clear in their identification of Mr Bejoushin as being engaged in the movement of rubbish bins.

Applicant's submissions in reply

91Mr Jankowski highlighted an important weakness in Ms Bishop's evidence regarding Mr Bejoushin. She had not identified him as being involved in any statement until 7 February 2012, ten months since the events at VIDC. At trial she did not recall Mr Bejoushin's involvement until the second day of her evidence.

92In reply to the Crown reliance on [36(m)] of Mordaunt as a cure for the weakness of its case at trial against Mr Bejoushin, Mr Jankowski took issue, at [10]:

with the proposition that the evidence must substantially lack credibility before it can be said that the proceedings were not reasonably instituted. While the main issue at trial was the accuracy of the purported recognition/identification of Mr Bejoushin, where such evidence lacks cogency and both internal and external consistency, the reasonableness of instituting proceedings remains a live issue. This is particularly the case where the difficulties with the reliability and accuracy of both Ms Bishop and Mr Atachparian would have been known well in advance of them giving evidence at trial.

Consideration

93I accept that the case against Mr Bejoushin was not strong. But the reliability of Ms Bishop's and Mr Atachparian's recall was the subject of cross-examination, and could be evaluated by a jury.

94Mr O'Connor's evidence did not support that of Ms Bishop and Mr Atachparian, but it did not refer to so discrete an event with a limited number of participants as Mr Shahsawari and the fire extinguishers. It does create a conflict, but on a lesser scale.

95I agree with the submissions of the Crown that the evidence required a judgment concerning the accuracy of the identification by Ms Bishop and Mr Atachparian. It did not involve inherent weakness in the sense meant by the CCC Act or Mordaunt. In light of all the circumstances of the disturbance at the VIDC on the night in question, it was quite understandable that there would be variations in the recollections of witnesses. The Crown case concerning Mr Bejoushin relied upon two witnesses who each, and independently, described his involvement in the same type of activity. It was quintessentially a matter for the tribunal of fact to determine the significance of the differences in their accounts.

Conclusion

96Having regard to the matters above, it is my opinion that, had the prosecution been in possession of all the relevant facts in respect of Mr Bejoushin it would not have been unreasonable to institute the subject proceedings.

Orders

97I grant Seyed Alireza Kamali a certificate under s 2 of the CCC Act.

98I grant Sayed Ibrahim Mosawi a certificate under s 2 of the CCC Act.

99The applications of Kamelledin Shahsawari and Amir Manafi Bejoushin are refused.

2761733,R v Naden [2013] NSWSC 759,"remarks on sentence 

1HIS HONOUR: Malcolm John Naden (the offender) pleads guilty to 18 counts on the indictment upon which he was arraigned on 22 March 2013.

2Counts 2 and 3 are offences of murder. The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment has been prescribed. 

3Count 12 is an offence of shooting with intent to murder contrary to s 29 Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

4Count 1 is an offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment.

5Counts 4 to 11 and 13 to 18 are offences of break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, contrary to s 112(1)(a) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years. No standard non-parole period has been prescribed. 

6The maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for an offence are legislative guideposts that are to be born in mind when the court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The standard non-parole period does not have determinative significance in sentencing the offender: Muldrock at [31], nor is it a ""starting point"" for the sentence, nor does it directly apply as the offender has pleaded guilty.

7The findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270.

8During the proceedings on sentence, Mr M Tedeschi QC appeared for the Crown and Mr M Ierace SC with Mr R Wilson for the offender. 

9A statement of agreed facts has been tendered. As the agreed facts consist of 32 pages, I shall refer to them as succinctly as possible. Although I adopt this convenient approach, I have had regard to all of the agreed facts in sentencing the offender. 

Agreed Facts 

Count 2 - The murder of Lateesha Nolan 

10Lateesha Nolan, the deceased, is the grandchild of Florence and Jack Nolan and on occasions stayed at the Nolan house. 

11At about 9:30pm on 4 January 2005, the deceased drove her vehicle to the home of her grandparents. It was also the home of her cousin, the offender.

12Her grandmother had been babysitting two of the deceased's children. The deceased asked her grandmother to babysit her other two children for a short time, while she went out. Her grandmother agreed. The deceased left the house and returned to her vehicle. 

13The deceased saw the offender sitting on the front steps of the Nolan house and asked the offender what he was doing. He told her he was going to go fishing at Sandy Beach. She offered to give him a lift. The offender accepted the offer and got in the backseat of her vehicle. They went to Sandy Beach. When they arrived at that location the deceased mentioned the allegation that the offender indecently assaulted XY. The offender became enraged, prompting him to manually strangle the deceased from his position in the back seat. 

14At about 9:20pm to 10pm, several young persons saw a vehicle fitting the general description of the deceased's vehicle parked at Sandy Beach. Elizabeth Doyle saw movement inside the car. She reported that the driver's side window was down and the remaining windows looked foggy.

15The offender moved the deceased's body to the passenger seat of her vehicle and drove to Butlers Falls. The offender removed the deceased's body from the vehicle and moved it to an area near the Macquarie River. The offender dug a hole beside the river, and then dismembered the deceased's body. 

16The offender disposed of the surface covers in the car, such as the car seat covers, to minimise the chance that a forensic examination would identify him. He drove the car to the western end of Tamworth Street, alongside a footbridge spanning the Macquarie River and abandoned it. The car was discovered around 5:50am. 

17On 17 October 2011 several boys fishing along the Macquarie River located a pink wallet containing the Driver's Licence and Medicare card belonging to the deceased. This is approximately ten to twelve kilometres down stream from Butler's Falls.

18Admissions made by the offender in relation to Ms Nolan's murder are detailed in par 52 of the agreed facts. 

Findings

19Mr Crown relies in each offence of murder upon the same aggravating features to place the murders in the worst category. Mr Crown identified the aggravating features as being: 

(i) Multiple murders;

(ii) The offender's motives (or lack of a rational motive) for committing each murder;

(iii) Defiling of bodies after death;

(iv) Abuse of trust by the offender: s 21A(2)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; and 

(v) Substantial suffering and harm. 

20Mr Crown submitted that it is permissible to take into account the fact that there are multiple murders in determining whether an offence falls into the worst category and cited R v Baker (NSWCCA, 20 Sep 95, unreported) and R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469; (2000) 50 NSWLR 409. However, in Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 360, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom James and Hoeben JJ agreed) recognised that such an approach did not stand happily with R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 and Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. McClellan CJ at CL said at [25]: 

""To my mind there is some difficulty reconciling the result in Harris with the principle defined in Veen (No 2). If a prior offence, including a prior killing, is not capable of informing the objective criminality of the instant offence, even if it be another killing, the imposition of a life sentence for the latest killing, as was done on appeal in Harris requires that the latest offence qualifies as an offence of extreme culpability justifying a life sentence (s 61(1)). Be that as it may, as I have said, the approach to the issue of prior offending has been authoritatively determined in so far as this Court is concerned in McNaughton.""

21James J said at [50] that it is not permissible to use other offences as warranting the imposition of a life sentence for an offence which standing by itself would not warrant the imposition of a life sentence. 

22Accordingly, the murder of Ms Nolan cannot be used to increase the offender's sentence for Ms Scholes' murder to imprisonment for life and vice versa. Before a life sentence can be imposed, an offence standing by itself, must warrant the imposition of a life sentence.

23The murder of Ms Nolan was not planned or premeditated which is a mitigating factor: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offender had met Ms Nolan by chance that night at the front of their grandparent's house. Ms Nolan had dropped off two of her children and generously offered to give the offender a lift to Sandy Beach, to enable him to go fishing. The offender sat in the back seat as there were items in the front passenger seat. 

24When they reached Sandy Beach the offender manually strangled Ms Nolan from his position in the back seat as he became enraged when she raised the subject of XY's complaint of indecent assault. In his handwritten statement (ex B T3d p4), the offender recounts that he was annoyed by ""any mention of that family"" and ""the fact that people were talking about it."" The offender discloses the violent and prolonged struggle that followed after he gripped Ms Nolan's neck. It is evident that Ms Nolan fought hard to remove the offender's hands to save her life. He acknowledges that he could have stopped and extended mercy to Ms Nolan, but he was determined to kill her. 

25The offender's chilling account in his handwritten statement reveals that Ms Nolan suffered a prolonged period of pain and terror before she died. The offender's actions were extraordinarily cruel and brutal. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill Ms Nolan. 

26Ms Nolan was the mother of four children aged 5, 4, 3 and 1 at the time of the offence. The offender was aware that she had young children. Indeed, in his handwritten statement he ruminates about the child seats in Ms Nolan's vehicle. It is plainly the case that the offender knew that Ms Nolan's death would deprive these young children of their mother. This is a matter that increases the objective seriousness of the offence: R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448 at [67]. 

27Mr Ierace submitted that the dismemberment of Ms Nolan's body that followed the murder should not be taken into account as an aggravating factor as it was done to enable the body to be placed in the hole that the offender had dug and did not reveal a contempt for the deceased. I reject that submission. Although the offender may have dismembered the deceased's body so that he could hide it, what he did in severing the body and disposing of the body parts was appalling and showed no regard whatsoever for the deceased and her family, who have been denied the opportunity of laying their loved one to rest. The result of the offender's actions is that her remains have never been found. In my view, the dismemberment of Ms Nolan's body increases the objective seriousness of the murder: R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315; Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126. 

28Mr Crown invites me to find that the offender's familial relationship with Ms Nolan was a position of trust which the offender abused: s 21A(2)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In determining whether the offender stood in a position of trust, the relevant factor is that there was at the time of the offending a particular relationship between the offender and the victim that amounted to ""a position of trust"": Suleman v R [2009] NSWCCA 90 at [22]. The relationship between Ms Nolan and the offender was that they were cousins and it was because of that relationship, she could feel confident to drive the offender to Sandy Beach even though it was night-time. The offender abused his position of trust which is an aggravating factor. 

29Although the offender became a suspect in the disappearance of Lateesha Nolan when Ms Scholes' body was discovered, there was no forensic or eyewitness evidence to connect him with the murder. Indeed, police had been given an account by a witness of a person who had long blonde hair in the back seat of a vehicle at Sandy Beach that matched Ms Nolan's vehicle, which was far removed from the offender's description. The detailed admissions made by the offender in the records of interview and handwritten statements that are set out in the agreed facts were fundamental to solving the murder. Furthermore, the offender endeavoured to assist the police in locating the burial site, but it seems that the Macquarie River has flooded on two occasions and has risen about five metres since the murder. 

30The significance and usefulness of the assistance; its nature and extent and its reliability entitle the offender to a lesser sentence than would otherwise be imposed: s 23(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. One of the matters that the court is obliged to consider is ""the timeliness"" of the assistance: s 23(2)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Whilst the offender provided the assistance to police shortly after his capture, he had known for some 7 years how Ms Nolan died, but had made no disclosure of what he had done. The offender's lengthy delay in assisting police moderates the discount on sentence.

31Any reduction in penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: s 23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Although a separate quantified discount is not usually given on sentence for assistance: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189; (2007) 175 A Crim R 40, I propose to do so in this case for the sake of transparency. I assess the reduction in sentence for assistance to be 5 per cent. 

32The offender is an Aboriginal man who was born on 5 November 1973 and was 31 years old at the time of Ms Nolan's murder. His prior criminal history as an adult at that time, reveals two high range PCA offences and an offence of offensive language. However, he has pleaded guilty to the aggravated indecent assault on 12 May 2004. The offender's prior criminal history does not entitle him to leniency, but it is not a matter of aggravation. 

33As the offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence, his subjective circumstances are mainly drawn from the psychiatrists' reports. The offender was raised in Dubbo by his father and mother. He is the second oldest of four siblings. He described his father as being mentally abusive towards him as a child and reported that there was domestic violence in the home by his father towards his mother. He attended Dubbo Primary School and Dubbo South High School. He stated that ""he never got much out of it"" (ex B T6 p5).

34The offender reported that he initially worked as a rouseabout, shedhand and shearer after he left school. At the age of 18 years, he left the family home to live with his grandparents in Dubbo. Between the ages of 22 and 26 years old, he worked in the abattoirs. His last job was as a shearer when he was 28 years old. Save for some seasonal work, the offender was on the dole. He explained to Professor Greenberg that ""he couldn't be bothered about getting up each day and didn't see the point of it""(ex B T6 p5). 

35Various witness statements (ex 1 TB 1-5) were tendered on behalf of the offender that provide insight into his background. It is evident that after the offender stopped shearing, he began to confine himself to his room. His social isolation worsened following the complaint of indecent assault. 

36An issue that emerged during the proceedings was whether the offender has a major depressive disorder and whether the offender's mental disorder played a role in the commission of the offences. An offender's mental condition can have the effect of reducing an offender's moral culpability and matters such as specific and general deterrence, retribution and denunciation may have less weight. It may also mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on an offender. On the other hand, the offender may present more of a danger to the community: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177].

37There are four reports from Dr Bruce Westmore, a psychiatrist, who saw the offender at the request of the Legal Aid Commission (ex 1 TA). In a report dated 5 June 2012, Dr Westmore's diagnosis was that the offender was suffering from a ""Major Depressive Disorder - Chronic course"". Dr Westmore states at p 9: 

""It is my view that [the offender] was suffering a Major Depressive Disorder, certainly a very severe and significant Depressive Disorder leading up to the matters now before the court. He said he was depressed prior to the alleged incident involving the under aged child but, following that, his depression worsened. There was then the incident with Latisha [sic] which further aggravated his depression and then the incident involving Kristy."" 

38As to Axis II, Dr Westmore considered that the offender was likely to have some avoidant personality traits. He thought it was unlikely that the offender suffered an Antisocial Personality Disorder. 

39Dr Westmore was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was ""a direct and positive relationship between his Depressive Disorder and the incidents involving Latisha [sic], Kristy and the shooting of the police officer."" Dr Westmore considered that the sexual offence was ""less attributable to [the offender's] depressed mood and the break and enter offences appear to have occurred as a matter of his own personal survival"" (ex 1 TA 05/06/12 p9).

40In his further reports, Dr Westmore adhered to his diagnosis of a Major Depressive Disorder. In a report dated 19 April 2013, Dr Westmore observed at p 5 that the offender's case ""is extremely complex, not only in terms of the multiple, serious and diverse nature of his offending behaviour... but also in terms of his complex psychology and because of the nature and extent of his personality pathology"" (ex 1 TA 05/06/12 p9).

41During his evidence, Dr Westmore was asked to briefly explain the relationship between the depressive disorder, the two murders and the attempted murder. He said (TOS 02/05/13 T80 L49-50, T81 L1-16): 

A. It is in my mind more clear and obvious with the first homicide in that I think Mr Naden was already depressed having allegations raised against him in relation to an alleged sexual assault at that time. I think his behaviour was becoming increasingly abnormal in that he was becoming isolated, withdrawn, staying in his room, food was being delivered to his door. So there were quite significant behavioural changes. I think what we saw leading up to the first homicide was these allegations against him being raised by the first woman and Mr Naden becoming angry in response to that. 

There is, in my view, a close connection between anger and depression, particularly in men. In other words, men who are angry are often depressed. Not universally, but there is a connection in my mind. I think therefore that Mr Naden was on the edge of anger probably quite commonly after these allegations were raised, and that is likely to have arisen because of the depression arising from the allegations. And that there is therefore a connection between what was said by the deceased, Mr Naden's depression, his acute anger and his subsequent behaviour. 

42In cross-examination by Mr Crown, Dr Westmore agreed that the offender might have some psychopathic tendencies. Of particular concern was ""his stated lack of empathy and lack of obvious remorse for what occurred"" (TOS 02/05/13 T84 L5-6).

43Professor David Greenberg, a psychiatrist, interviewed the offender at the request of the Crown. In a report dated 4 February 2013, Professor Greenberg's provisional diagnosis included ""Axis I: 1. Depression: (query - Chronic Dysthymia Disorder)"" and ""Axis II: Personality Disorder with Cluster A and Cluster B features (Mixed features of Antisocial, Schizoid and Psychopathic traits)"" (ex B T6 04/02/13 p2). He expressed the opinion that the offender had a long-standing history of a depressive disorder. Professor Greenberg noted that the ""[p]ossibility of a Sexual Deviant Disorder"" could not be excluded (ex B T6 04/02/13 p7). Although he did not assess the offender on the Psychopathy Checklist Scale, Professor Greenberg considered that the offender had many features of this syndrome. 

44In a report dated 20 April 2013, Professor Greenberg stated at p 2 that the offender ""has no history of any major mental illness such as schizophrenia or mania."" Professor Greenberg was of the opinion that the offender ""likely has a chronic history of low grade depression (dysthymia)."" In a report dated 29 April 2013, Professor Greenberg opined at p 7 that the offender's depression did not play a significant role in the commission of the offences. In his opinion, the offender's ""depressive disorder is not the primary motivation for committing the murders."" 

45Professor Greenberg writes at p7: 

""He currently presents as a man with no evidence of meeting the DSM-IV-TR criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder. I am of the opinion that his current mood status presentation whilst attending court, is likely to have been very similar to his degree of depression whilst he had been living in the community at the time of the offences."" 

46Professor Greenberg explained that the offender's depression does not arise because he has delved into what he had done, but mainly because of how it affected him. He said that the offender ""sees the world as the problem, in other words society or people in society as the problem rather than himself"" (TOS 02/05/13 T58 L21-23). Professor Greenberg expressed his concern that there may be an underlying sexual motivation to the murders of Ms Nolan and Ms Scholes. He remained of the view that the offender had many features of a psychopath and remarked that further psychiatric assessment over time will likely clarify this diagnosis. 

47Mr Ierace cross-examined Professor Greenberg on the opinions of Dr O'Dea and Dr Roberts who examined the offender in prison. Professor Greenberg pointed out that neither psychiatrist had made a definite diagnosis of a major depressive disorder. 

48I note that on 25 September 2012 Dr Roberts provided a differential diagnosis of a major depressive disorder with psychosis and bipolar disorder. However, in a report dated 23 October 2012, Dr Robert's opined (at p2) that the offender's mood state and associated symptoms were ""reflective of the presence of a mood disorder probably on the bipolar spectrum"" (ex B T5).

49The principal difference between Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg is that Professor Greenberg does not consider the offender's depression to be a major disorder, whereas Dr Westmore does. Dr Westmore found a causal connection between the offender's depression and the commission of the murders and the shooting with intent to murder whereas Professor Greenberg considered that the offender's depression did not play a significant role in the offending. When Professor Greenberg was cross-examined on the offender's reference in the handwritten statement of 12 April 2012 that all he could say [about killing Ms Nolan] was that he was ""severely depressed"" (ex B T3e p5), Professor Greenberg pointed out that the documents must be read in their entirety. Professor Greenberg said (TOS 02/05/13 T69 L47-50, T70 L1):

""You are talking about depression being a motivating factor for the offence and on the one hand he is saying depression was a motivating factor, on the other hand he is saying ""I felt calm, I felt nothing, I had no feelings"". I mean there's two reasons or two feelings at the same point in time.""

50Mr Ierace submitted that less weight should be given to the opinions of Professor Greenberg as he did not have the opportunity of examining the offender before his mental state deteriorated significantly around May 2012. I am not persuaded that Professor Greenberg's assessment of the offender's depression is undermined by the fact that he interviewed him in 2013. Professor Greenberg noted that the offender had no active symptoms of mental illness and that his depressive symptoms were considered to be mild. This assessment is supported by Dr Reznik's opinion which is referred to at [55] below. 

51Mr Ierace referred to the repeated assertions by the offender that something happened in his mind when he murdered Ms Nolan, that he went numb, that there was in effect a dissociation between his mind, his feelings and emotions and the offender's belief that it is unlikely that they will ever reconnect.

52In his handwritten account of Ms Nolan's murder, the offender's statements include being ""very robotic"" in his actions (ex B T3d p10), feeling ""nothing at all for this"" (ex B T3d p19) and ""I felt nothing about what had taken place"" (ex B T3d p23). Any suggestion that the offender was not fully aware of what he had done is blown away by his graphic and olfactory description of the dismemberment of the deceased's body. In my view, the offender's reports of lack of feeling supports Professor Greenberg's opinion that he has psychopathic tendencies and a severe personality disorder. 

53Dr Westmore referred to the offender's description of the shooting of the police officer being ""in a similar way"" to how he described Ms Nolan's death (report dated 5 June 2012 p9). It seems that Dr Westmore was referring to the offender's ability ""to disassociate himself emotionally from his actions."" I do not accept that the offender was dissociated in any way when he shot at Senior Constable MacFayden. He shot to kill the police officer so as to avoid being captured. 

54The offender's social isolation before the murder reflects, in my opinion, his personality disorder. Professor Greenberg opined (ex B T6 29/04/13 p7):

""His isolation and schizoid lifestyle where he spent long periods in his bedroom are in keeping with his personality dysfunction.""

55Dr Reznik and Dr Farrar saw the offender a number of times in December 2012 and January 2013. The clinical notes dated 11 December 2012 disclose their assessment of the offender as being a ""highly psychopathic individual"" but there was ""[n]o evidence of psychotic illness or affective illness"" (ex B T5). They concluded the offender had an ""[a]ntisocial personality disorder with narcisstic traits."" On 18 December 2013, Dr Reznik noted that there is ""no evidence currently [of] depression or psychosis although [the offender] remains hypervigilant"" (ex B T5).

56I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender suffers from a Major Depressive Disorder. I prefer and accept Professor Greenberg's opinion that he has a long standing low-grade depression and a severe personality disorder. His low-grade depression played an insignificant part in Ms Nolan's murder. He was not overwhelmed by a Major Depressive Disorder. In these circumstances, I do not think that the offender's moral culpability is moderated nor should less weight be given to specific and general deterrence. His psychopathic tendencies and severe personality disorder increase the danger that the offender presents to the community. These characteristics do not make him ""an unpersuasive vehicle for the deterrence of others"": R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 72. 

57Mr Ierace did not submit that a custodial sentence may way more heavily on the offender because of a mental disorder. There is no evidence as to how the offender is to serve his sentence, but it is likely to be served in isolation. I take this into account, but note Dr Westmore's opinion that the prison environment with its security, isolation and predictability suits the offender's personality. 

58Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury loss or damage caused by them. By his plea of guilty and the admissions that he has made, the offender has accepted responsibility for the murder of Ms Nolan. However, the material on sentence taken as a whole does not establish that the offender is remorseful for taking Ms Nolan's life. There are times in the offender's answers to questions by Detective Hennessy and in his handwritten statements, that the offender appears to express some regret for the murder, but any such indication is overwhelmed by many other statements that demonstrate a lack of remorse for the killing. For the sake of brevity, I do not propose to detail them here, but mention that some of the statements are canvassed in Professor Greenberg's report dated 29 April 2013, at pages 4 to 6.

59In his report dated 19 April 2013, Dr Westmore agreed at p3 ""that there has been a clear lack of remorse and a lack of empathy expressed by and demonstrated by [the offender]."" During his oral testimony, Dr Westmore described the offender's lack of remorse and lack of a sense of guilt for his offending behaviour as being the major concern that he had in his last interview with the offender. 

60During his assessment on 11 December 2012, Dr Reznik noted that the offender had no empathy or remorse.

61Professor Greenberg in his report dated 29 April 2013 writes at p6:

""...[the offender] expressed contempt for the victims and their families, and showed a lack of empathy and a lack of remorse for his actions. He also attributed (projected) blame onto the victims...""

62In his oral evidence, Professor Greenberg said that he did not think that the offender had accepted moral responsibility for his actions. He noted a lack of depth of remorse and empathy. 

63None of the psychiatrists expressed an opinion that the offender's stated desire to get a life sentence was an expression of remorse or contrition. Dr Westmore referred to the offender's ""rational"" decision to plead guilty to all the charges as he does not wish to be released from prison. Dr Westmore observed that ""[l]ife outside of prison is not an option for him. As noted, he wants to be in custody. He is more comfortable in prison with its security, isolation and predictability"" (report 25 February 2013 p6). Professor Greenberg pointed to the inconsistencies in the offender's statements which the offender could not explain. Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion that ""[the offender] presents with a feature of individuals with psychopathy where the lying seems to have no motivation other than what is termed by some experts as ""duping delight"" in causing confusion to the listener or writer of this report"" (report 29 April 2013 p3). 

64One of the submissions made by Mr Ierace was that having regard to the offender's post-arrest behaviour, it would be unjust for him to miss out on the mitigatory effect of remorse. Mr Ierace asked what more could he have done to make amends? The short answer is the offender could have recognised the huge loss that he has caused, but he has not. His assistance to police has been acknowledged by a reduction in sentence: see [31] above. 

65I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is remorseful. His sentence is not to be increased for that, but no allowance in mitigation can be made for remorse. 

66Mr Crown invited me to find that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are minimal and there is a very high risk of future dangerousness by his committing serious offences including murder. Mr Ierace accepted that the offender asserted that he will kill again, but submitted that would, if Dr Westmore's diagnosis was accepted, have to be taken into account with his untreated mental illness. 

67The offender has made extraordinary threats against certain persons and made it clear that his killing days are not over and he will kill again. I do not think that these threats have been made by him predominantly or wholly for the purpose of securing a life sentence. Dr Westmore expressed the opinion that the offender must be considered to be a high risk, both to himself and to others. Professor Greenberg regarded the offender as falling in the highest risk category for future violence. He noted the offender's lack of insight, empathy and remorse and his unresponsiveness to treatment. 

68I consider that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are very poor. 

69A finding of future dangerousness does not need to be established beyond reasonable doubt: R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310; (2003) 58 NSWLR 589. It is sufficient if the Crown establishes that there is a risk of re-offending: R v Harrison (1997) 93 A Crim R 314. The evidence in this case compels a conclusion that there is a real risk that the offender will re-offend by killing others, particular those who are the subjects of his threats. I find that there is a high risk of future violent offending. 

70I accept Mr Ierace's submission that the offender's pleas of guilty would have been entered at an earlier stage than upon arraignment before me. He had indicated to police shortly after his capture that he intended pleading guilty to all the charges. The question of his fitness to be tried delayed the entry of the plea. A discount for the utilitarian value of a plea is determined largely by the timing of the plea: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1. But for his being on the run for almost seven years, I would have found that the utilitarian value of the plea entitled the offender to a sentencing discount of 20 per cent. I am unable to find that the plea was entered at the first available opportunity as he did his best to elude police and thereby avoid admitting his guilt for the murder. In my view, the offender's flight erodes the utilitarian value of the plea. I assess the utilitarian value of the plea in all the circumstances to be 15 per cent. 

71The spontaneity of the accused's attack on Ms Nolan brings the offence slightly below the worst category of murder. Furthermore, a factor militating against a life sentence is that without the detailed admissions that he made, the offender could not have been convicted of Ms Nolan's murder. A determinant sentence will be imposed for this offence.

Count 3 - The murder of Kristy Scholes 

Agreed Facts 

72Kristy Scholes, resided next door to the residence of the grandparents of Lateesha Nolan and the offender. At this time the offender was still living with his grandparents.

73In early June 2005, Ms Scholes told Alissa See that she was getting sexually explicit notes. Ms Scholes said that one of the notes asked her to guess who it was and she had done so. Ms Scholes received a reply that it was none of them. Ms Scholes then told Ms See that she suspected the offender was sending the notes. The offender had sent the notes.

74On 10 June 2005 Ms Scholes told her half sister, Samantha Toomey that she was getting letters that were sexual in nature from the offender. She also told Ms Toomey that she had written back asking him to stop writing to her but he continued to write the notes.

75Ms Scholes also told Roslyn Toomey, Lisa Ann Asper and Kelly Griffin about the notes she had received from the offender. 

76The residents of the Nolan house, except for the offender, were absent from the house from about 15 June 2005. They were in Sydney as Jack Nolan was having surgery.

77Since the Nolan house was available and Ms Scholes' residence was being painted it was decided that Ms Scholes and her two children would stay at the Nolan house to avoid the paint fumes.

78On 20 June 2005, Ms Scholes and her children spent some time with Ms See. Ms See states that Ms Scholes asked her to stay with her at the Nolan house. When Ms See asked why, Ms Scholes replied that the offender was there and she was afraid of him.

79At about 9pm on 21 June 2005, Ian Walker saw Ms Scholes and her children at the Nolan house. This was the last sighting of Ms Scholes alive, apart from by her children.

80On 21 June 2005 the offender confronted Ms Scholes in the bathroom of the Nolan house. The offender strangled her to death and then took her body into his bedroom. The offender then had sexual intercourse with Ms Scholes body. The offender dressed the body, covered it and fled from the house. Ms Scholes' two children were in another bedroom of the house.

81At about 10am on 22 June 2005, Ian Walker went to open Ms Scholes' house. While he was doing this he heard a tapping on the front window and saw Libby Scholes, the deceased's daughter. He told her to go back next door. The child left but returned a short time later. Ian Walker went to the Nolan house. He saw Libby Scholes climbing in the bedroom window. He also found Johnny Scholes, the deceased's son in the house. Ian Walker couldn't locate the deceased.

82Ian Walker, Larissa Rutley and Christopher Nolan looked after the children throughout the day. Numerous attempts were made to locate the deceased.

83Leanne Nolan, the deceased's sister in law, reported the deceased missing at 8.30pm on 22 June 2005.

84At about 1.30am on 23 June 2005, the deceased's body was located by police inside the bedroom occupied by the offender at the Nolan house. The deceased was lying on the floor on top of a couple of blankets, and was covered by a sleeping bag and a pillow. There were two pillows under her back. The deceased was dressed, wearing cream pants, a sleeveless turtleneck top and a black bra. A pair of tracksuit pants had been rolled and placed at the base of the door to the offender's bedroom.

85Crime scene officers attended and examined the house. They located a number of holes in some of the ceilings which allowed a person in the ceiling space to observe two of the bedrooms, the bathroom and the toilet. The crime scene officer noted there was no dust in the vicinity of these holes. 

86An autopsy was performed on Ms Scholes' body. Dr Duflou, the forensic pathologist, identified the cause of death as manual strangulation. The following results were obtained from swabs taken during the autopsy:

a. The offender cannot be excluded as a contributor to the sample obtained from under Kristy Scholes' fingernail. 

b. DNA from the vaginal swab taken from Ms Scholes' body has been identified as being consistent with the offender's DNA.

c. The offender cannot be excluded as a contributor to the sample obtained from the right side of Ms Scholes' neck.

d. The minor component of a swab taken from the right side of Ms Scholes' neck has been identified as the offender's DNA.

e. The offender's semen was located on Ms Scholes' underpants. 

87Admissions made by the offender in relation to Ms Schole's murder are detailed in paragraphs 53 and 54 of the agreed facts. During the conversation with police on 27 April 2012, Detective Hennessy expressed disbelief that the offender had sexual intercourse with Ms Scholes' body based on his understanding at that time of the results of the forensic examination, but the offender remained adamant that he had done so. However, Detective Hennessy informed the offender during the interview of 8 May 2012 that forensic tests established the presence of DNA on vaginal swabs from Ms Scholes' body that ""matched"" his.

Findings

88The offender heard Ms Scholes using the bathroom and could hear that her children were awake in the house. He waited for her to finish washing her hands, then walked up behind Ms Scholes. The offender intended to kill her. The offender by placing both hands around her throat strangled Kristy Scholes to death. The facts do not reveal how long it took the offender to bring her life to an end or if she struggled, but the offender in the ERISP of 26 July 2012, told Detective Senior Constable Hennessy that ""[i]t wasn't much of a struggle"" (ex B T3g Q & A 436). The offender had taken Ms Scholes completely by surprise and overpowered her. 

89Mr Ierace submitted that the murder of Ms Scholes appears to be a crime committed without any motive or catalytic event. Mr Ierace drew my attention to the offender's explanation to Dr Westmore that ""[a]fter Latisha [sic] [he] was on auto pilot... very numb, just very robotic... just going through the motions"" (report of Dr Westmore 05/06/12 p3). The offender told Dr Westmore that Ms Scholes ""was a neighbour and he had not had problems with her before either"" (report of Dr Westmore 05/06/12 p3). Mr Ierace referred to the offender's statement that his sexual involvement with the body of the deceased was an afterthought. 

90I do not accept the offender's attribution of his motivation for the murder to his robotic-like existence at that time. The offender was not being honest when he told the psychiatrist that he had not had problems with Ms Scholes before. He had been sending sexually explicit notes to Ms Scholes who had written back to him asking him to stop. 

91I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was motivated by his sexual desire for the deceased, who had not displayed any interest in him. There was a degree of premeditation in the murder. When he had sexual intercourse with the deceased's body, he was so aroused that he ejaculated inside her. The immediacy of the sexual intercourse and the offender's arousal do not speak of an afterthought. The offender gave various explanations to Professor Greenberg for the act of necrophilia. I reject the offender's account that he thought he'd have ""one (sexual coitus) for the road"" or that it was an afterthought (ex B T6 29/04/13 p5). 

92Whilst the offender waited for Ms Scholes to finish in the bathroom, he had the opportunity to consider the enormity of his actions before he killed her. He took advantage of there being no other adults in the house. 

93The necrophilic violation of Ms Scholes body immediately after her death enhances the objective seriousness of the offence. 

94Ms Scholes was the mother of two children aged 4 and 2 at the time of offence. The offender well knew that by killing Ms Scholes, these young children would be deprived of their mother. This is a matter that increases the objective seriousness of the offence: R v Lewis. 

95Mr Crown submitted that other factors that aggravated the offence were that the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age and the offence was committed in the house of the victim: s 21A(2)(ea), s 21A(2)(eb) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These aggravating factors commenced on 1 January 2008 and do not apply to a crime committed before that time. In any event, as the offender was lawfully in the home, s 21(2)(eb) does not apply: DS v R [2012] NSWCCA 159 at [145].

96Ms Scholes and her children had been residing in the house for some nights before she was killed. The offender was the only adult in the home. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the relationship between the offender and Ms Scholes amounted to a position of trust which the offender abused. This is another factor which aggravates the offence: s 21A(2)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

97For the reasons expressed at [36] - [56] above I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender suffered from a Major Depressive Disorder at the time Ms Scholes was murdered. His low-grade depression played an insignificant part in her murder. 

98The second murder plainly demonstrates the danger that the offender's psychopathic tendencies and severe personality disorder present to the community. 

99I have referred at [32] above to the offender's prior criminal history. However, he has not only pleaded guilty to the aggravated indecent assault but to the murder of Ms Nolan some 6 months before Ms Scholes' murder. The offender's criminal history does not increase the objective seriousness of the murder of Ms Scholes, nor is it an objective circumstance for the purpose of the application of the proportionality principle and it does not determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence: R v McNaughton. In view of the fact that this is a second murder, the weight I give to personal deterrence and protection of society is substantially increased: Veen v The Queen (No 2). 

100The offender has accepted responsibility for the murder of Ms Scholes by his plea of guilty and his admissions. The indication of regret in the four page document dated 17 April 2012 is subordinated by many other statements that demonstrate a lack of remorse for Ms Scholes murder. Once again for brevity's sake, I do not propose to detail these statements, but mention that I found the offender's attempt to blame Ms Scholes for her own murder to be particularly insensitive. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is remorseful. 

101The offender's disclosure of his necrophilic conduct to Detective Hennessy did not provide significant assistance to the police as the results of the autopsy indicated that the offender had sexually interfered with Ms Scholes. 

102The commission of the second murder reinforces the assessment that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are very poor and that there is a high risk of future violent offending. 

103I am conscious that a sentence otherwise appropriate to the seriousness of an offence cannot be extended merely to protect society. On the other hand, the court must have regard to the protection of society as a factor in determining a proportionate sentence. In Veen v The Queen (No 2), the majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said at 474:

""...It must be acknowledged, however, that the practical observance of a distinction between extending a sentence merely to protect society and properly looking to society's protection in determining the sentence calls for a judgment of experience and discernment."" 

104The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Robinson [2002] NSWCCA 359 observed at [41]: 

""...That judgment is necessarily founded on a finding as to the offender's future conduct"". 

105The offender's plea of guilty would have entitled him in the normal course of events to a utilitarian discount. However, in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ observed at [157] that:

""There are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate...""

106In my opinion, the grave circumstances of Ms Scholes' murder and the high danger that the offender represents to society do not justify any utilitarian discount being applied to the sentence. 

107The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) Crimes Act. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life). 

108Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows: 

""A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"". 

109The maximum penalty of life imprisonment is intended for cases falling within the worst category of murder: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452. The level of culpability of the offender in the commission of the offence and whether the case is one calling for a life sentence in the terms of s 61(1), is first to be considered, and if so, whether in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 21(1), the subjective features relating to the offender justify a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a specified term: R v Harris, R v Phuong Canh Ngo (No 3) [2001] NSWSC 1021; (2001) 125 A Crim R 495. The primary focus of s 61(1) is an assessment of how extreme the offender's culpability is: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at [52]. The combined effect of the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection, and deterrence is critical to a conclusion that a life sentence is required. The absence of any one or more of the four indicia may make it more difficult for the conclusion that a life sentence is required, but will not be determinative: Knight v R at [23]. 

110All four of the indicia in s 61(1) are present. There is nothing in the subjective circumstances of the offender that justifies a sentence less than life imprisonment. This was a cold-blooded merciless killing that was sexually motivated. I am satisfied that the level of the offender's culpability in murdering Ms Scholes is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be only met by a sentence of life imprisonment. 

Count 12 - The shooting with intent to murder 

Agreed Facts

111On 18 November 2011, police left a sleeping bag containing a tracking device at ""Alkira"", a property situated at Nowendoc. When the offender broke into that property on 24 November 2011, he stole the sleeping bag (see count 11). The police used this device to track the offender. 

112At 6:45am on 7 December 2011 police approached a campsite in Nowendoc. Senior Constable MacFadyen saw the sleeping bag and told Senior Constable Mahoney to take cover. They did not identify themselves as police at the time.

113As Senior Constable MacFadyen moved to cover Sergeant McDowell, the offender discharged one round from a .22 calibre rifle at Senior Constable MacFadyen with the intention of killing him. The round struck the police officer and travelled through his right shoulder. Senior Constable Mahoney and Sergeant McDowell then both called ""police, don't shoot.""

114The tactical police took evasive action and remained alert until further police arrived. In that time the offender fled the area. 

115The admissions made by the offender in relation to this offence are detailed at par 109 of the agreed facts. These admissions include that he was aware that a reward had been offered for his re-capture and he was concerned about ""cowboys"" trying to track him down (Agreed Facts, par 109b). They were dressed in camouflage and he was unaware that police did sometimes dress in camouflage. He thought ""it would just be army blokes or something"" (Agreed Facts, par 109d). He didn't recall whether they had identified themselves as police before he fired and in firing at Senior Constable MacFayden, he thought they could have been civilians after the reward. During the interview on 3 April 2012, the offender admitted that he intended to kill the police officer when he shot him. He explained he went for a body shot aiming for the ""chest and heart"" (Agreed Facts, par 109f).

Findings

116Although the offender did not specifically know that he was shooting at a police officer, he assumed correctly that the people who were approaching him intended to apprehend him. He shot to kill in order to avoid capture. I do not think it matters that the offender did not know that the person he shot was a police officer. As members of the police force are required to put themselves in danger for the benefit of the community, ""the courts have always accepted that the fact that the victim was a police officer is a substantially aggravating factor"": R v Penisini [2004] NSWCCA 339 at [20]. 

117Although the offender said in the 26 July 2012 interview that he aimed for the chest and heart of Senior Constable MacFadyen, the agreed facts reveal that the police officers were close to one another when the offender discharged his rifle. The offender recounted that ""[he] moved [the rifle] from the first, the bloke that [he] did shoot to the one behind him, that was kneeling behind him, so you know, I was debating which one to shoot, you know, I didn't know how many there were"" (ex B T3g Q & A 693). By shooting at Senior Constable MacFayden, the offender put the other police officers at a grave risk of death. This is a factor that enhances the objective seriousness of the offence.

118Another matter advanced by Mr Crown was that the offence was one offence in a series of criminal acts which was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, this aggravating factor does not apply. In R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; (2005) 65 NSWLR 740, Howie J explained at [29]:

""...the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(m) is concerned with the situation where a single offence contains a number of allegations of criminal acts that are part and parcel of a single course of criminal conduct."" 

119In my opinion, this is objectively a very serious offence of shooting with intent to murder. 

120By the time this offence was committed, the offender had murdered two people and indecently assaulted a 12 year-old child. I give weight to personal deterrence and protection of society. I also give weight to general deterrence as shooting to avoid lawful capture must be firmly discouraged. 

121It is an agreed fact that when arrested, the offender accepted responsibility for having shot Senior Constable MacFayden, enquired after his welfare and expressed regret for the shooting. However, Professor Greenberg found that, as in the offences of murder, the offender admitted to the offence of shooting a police officer ""in a matter of fact manner and without any empathy, guilt or remorse towards his victims or their loved ones and a sense of indifference to the gravity of his admissions."" Professor Greenberg opined that ""there is callousness in his self report of his alleged offences"" (report 4 February 2013 p11). Notwithstanding Professor Greenberg's opinion, I accept in this case that the offender has expressed some remorse for shooting Senior Constable MacFayden. 

122The offender's plea of guilty was entered at an early opportunity and the utilitarian value of the plea is not eroded by flight to the extent that the utilitarian value of the plea to the murder of Ms Nolan has been. In all the circumstances, his plea of guilty entitles him to a utilitarian discount of 20 per cent. 

Count 1 - Aggravated indecent assault

Agreed Facts

123XY, the victim, has known the offender for about 6 years. 

124On Wednesday 12 May 2004, the mother of the victim called her grandmother and asked if the offender could come over as she was frightened of some local boys.

125The offender arrived at the house at about 10:10pm. The adults watched a movie and then the mother prepared the offender a bed in the lounge room. The mother then went to her bedroom to sleep.

126In the night the victim woke to find that the offender had his hand down her pyjamas pants, inside her underpants and was touching her vagina with his hand. The offender then touched the victim on both breasts on the outside of her clothing. The victim moved away from the offender. The offender told the victim he would put her younger sister in the bed with her. The offender then left the room. The victim was 12 years of age. 

127The next morning the victim waited until the offender left and went into her Aunt's room. She climbed into bed with her Aunt. Her Aunt noticed the victim was shivering and asked her what was wrong. The victim told her that that the offender had touched her vagina on the outside of her clothes. Her Aunt then asked if he touched her anywhere else and the victim said that the offender tried to touch her on the back but she jumped up.

128The Aunt told the victim's mother who reported the incident to the Department of Community Services. The victim was interviewed by police on 14 May 2004. 

Findings

129The offender had stayed the night in the victim's home at the request of her mother because she was afraid of some local youths. In these circumstances, the relationship between the offender and the victim, amounted to a position of trust which the offender abused by indecently assaulting her. This is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I take into account as a mitigating factor that the offence was opportunistic, rather than pre-planned: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

130At the time of the commission of this offence, the offender's record as an adult was confined to the convictions that have been identified at [32] above. Although high range PCA offences cannot be described as minor, there were no matters of violence or of a sexual nature on his record. The offender's prior criminal history does not disentitle him to considerations of leniency. 

131But for the fact that the offender absconded after a warrant was issued for his arrest, his plea of guilty would have attracted a utilitarian discount of 20 per cent. In all the circumstances, I assess the utilitarian value of the plea to be 15 per cent. 

132The offender has neither expressed nor demonstrated remorse for having indecently assaulted XY who was 12 years old at the time. This is a serious offence. 

The offences of break enter and commit serious indictable offences contrary to s 112(1)(a) Crimes Act 

Agreed Facts

133Count 4: In November/December 2005, the offender resided in the roof cavity of the guesthouse inside the grounds of the Western Plains Zoo. He stole food from the guesthouse to sustain himself. 

134Count 5: On 7 February 2007, the offender broke into and stole food and other items including a solar powered radio, two cushions, a plastic water jug, various cooking utensils, various towels, table cloths and cans of food from the property ""Old Castle"" in Stewarts Brook. 

135Count 6: On 14 October 2008, the offender broke into and stole food supplies from the Misty Mountain Health retreat in Bellbrook. 

136Count 7: Between 10 and 20 June 2011, the offender broke into and stole food, a pair of grey track pants, a pair of binoculars, a rope and garden brush hook from a Birdwood property. 

137Counts 8 and 11: Between 18 and 23 September 2011, the offender broke into and stole food and butane gas cartridges from ""Alkira"" situated at Nowendoc. He broke into ""Alkira"" for a second time between 18 November 2011 and 24 November 2011 stealing food stuffs, a raincoat, a rifle scope and a sleeping bag. Police had left the sleeping bag containing a tracking device at ""Alkira"". 

138Counts 9 and 10: Between 22 September and 27 September 2011, the offender broke into and stole clothing, an oven dish, food items, two pairs of binoculars, and a suitcase from the property ""Boraning"" near Nowendoc. He broke into ""Boraning"" a second time between 11 and 16 November 2011, stealing food, socks, and a DVD player. 

139Count 13: Between 7 December 2011 and 15 December 2011 the offender broke into Bloxoms Hut and stole food and clothing items, a poncho, a pair of binoculars and beer. 

140Count 14: Between 24 November 2011 and 22 December 2011 the offender broke into the homestead on ""Part Myra"" and stole food items, beer, soft drink, milk, a gas lighter and metal cup. 

141Count 15: On 20 December 2011, the offender broke into ""the Willows"" and took from inside the house a large quantity of goods placing them on the verandah. During the course of the evening the offender consumed a large quantity of beer and used the laptop computer in the living room to browse the internet. When police arrived, the offender fled the home and escaped into surrounding bushland. 

142Count 16: Between 3 and 29 December 2011, the offender broke into ""Snow's Hut"" and stole many items that included a hammock, camp stretcher, gumboots, knife scissors and fire starters. Ms Snow located a number of items (tent, swag, raincoat and pants) that appeared to have been slashed and damaged. Furthermore, there were remnants of clothing that appeared to have been burned. 

143Counts 17 and 18: Between 10 and 24 February 2012, the offender broke into ""The Kerripit"" and stole a .22 calibre self loading Browning brand rifle and a quantity of ammunition from the firearms safe, two knives, food, a fishing rod and binoculars. The offender broke into the homestead again on 22 March 2012, collecting a loaded .22 calibre rifle and other items including a pair of binoculars, a knife, tools and food items. 

144Police had observed the offender entering the homestead and after he attempted to flee, he was captured a short distance from the homestead. 

Findings 

145The offender broke into and stole from these premises so that he could avoid capture by police. He was on the run for almost seven years and the stolen food items, clothing and firearms allowed him to survive in wilderness areas. As to property that he damaged in ""Snow's Hut"", he made a ""slight parallel"" to depriving his ""enemy"" of things he couldn't have, but explained that he wasn't sure why he damaged the property (Agreed Facts, par 144). 

146I do not agree with Mr Ierace's submission that this is another aspect of the offender's mental condition. Dr Westmore was of the opinion that the offender's break and entering offences had little to do with the offender's depressed mood. I am satisfied that he damaged the property in ""Snow's Hut"" to deprive others of items that he could not take with him. This is a factor that increases the objective seriousness of count 16: R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327.

147A factor that increases the objective seriousness of counts 10, 11 and 18 is that these offences were the second time that the offender had entered into ""Boraning"", ""Alkira"" and ""The Kerripit"" and stole from those premises: R v Ponfield. 

148The offender's stealing to avoid capture does not mitigate the seriousness of the offences, but enhances their seriousness: R v King [2003] NSWCCA 352. I take into account the items that were stolen when each offence was committed.

149I assess the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty to be 20 per cent. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is remorseful for any of these offences. 

150Victim impact statements of Joan Nolan and Michael Peet, the parents of Lateesha Nolan and of the deceased's children have been read to the court. Victim impact statements of David Scholes, the father of Kristy Scholes, Alison Morris, Kristy Scholes' aunt and of the deceased's children have been read to the court. The court also heard the victim impact statement of the grandmother of XY and received into evidence, the victim impact statement of Pamela Morris, the aunt of Kristy Scholes. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the families of Lateesha Nolan and Kristy Scholes and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

151As a matter of the law, the contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentences for murder: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 

152In structuring the sentences to be imposed, I have fixed an appropriate sentence for each offence and then have considered questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. The imposition of a life sentence for count 3 does not make these considerations irrelevant for the remaining counts. 

153The undiscounted starting point of the sentence for the murder of Ms Nolan is 35 years and 20 years for the offence of shooting with intent to murder. Special circumstances have been found in some of the individual sentences in order to apply the totality principle. 

154The agreed date for the commencement of the sentences is 22 March 2012.

		17 June 2013",2013-06-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761743,Zarakas v R [2013] NSWCCA 144,"Judgment

1LATHAM J: I agree with Button J.

2BUTTON J: On 26 November 2010, his Honour Judge Delaney sentenced the applicant in the District Court at Wollongong for a single offence of unlawfully selling three or more firearms to unauthorised purchasers over a period of 12 months. Pursuant to s 51B(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, the maximum penalty of the offence was imprisonment for 20 years. There was also an applicable standard non-parole period of 10 years.

3His Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. Clearly, special circumstances had been found; if that had not been the case, the non-parole period would have been 6 years 9 months. 

4On the same day, his Honour had sentenced a co-offender, Mr Kafizas, for two offences. The first offence was identical to the offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty. The second was a serious drug offence that had nothing to do with the applicant. I shall provide more detail about the sentencing of Mr Kafizas later in my judgment.

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal, including leave to appeal out of time. The Crown does not oppose the latter leave being granted.

Objective features

6Over a period of two months, the applicant, Mr Kafizas, and a third man, Mr Dionys, were involved in the illegal supply of a large number of firearms and a large amount of ammunition in the Wollongong area. The offences were committed for profit.

7With regard to the offence on the indictment to which he pleaded guilty, the applicant supplied firearms on 13 separate occasions. Contained on a Form 1 pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 were 39 other offences of unlawfully possessing firearms, selling ammunition, and not keeping firearms safely.

8It is noteworthy that two of the firearms particularised on the indictment were light machine guns. Some of the firearms were pistols fitted with silencers. 

9An undercover operative was used to detect the offences. As a result, none of the items reached the community. Over $71,000 was handed over in return for the various items. All of the firearms were in good working order.

10With regard to the roles played by the three offenders, his Honour found that Mr Dionys was at the top of the criminal structure. Mr Kafizas was at the bottom, and fulfilled the role of negotiator with the undercover operative. His Honour found that the applicant was ""the middle man and he had a greater role to play than that of Mr Kafizas"".

11The profound objective gravity of seeking to disseminate into the community semi or fully automatic firearms for profit requires no elaboration by me: for a recent example of the approach of this Court, see Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36.

Subjective features

12The applicant pleaded guilty at an early stage and received a discount of 25 per cent as a result. Neither party impugns that discount.

13Born in 1966, the applicant was aged 44 years when he stood for sentence in 2010. His criminal record was not unblemished, and showed a readiness to disregard the law repeatedly with regard to driving whilst disqualified. It also featured a conviction in 2003 for possessing or using a prohibited weapon without a permit, for which the applicant was fined $250.

14The applicant attended school until the age of 15 years, after which he became involved in a number of ventures such as the buying and selling of automobiles and the restaurant trade. He had been in a de facto relationship for five years as at the date of sentence. Prior to his incarceration, he had been a great help to his elderly and infirm mother.

15The most noteworthy subjective feature was that, in 2002, the applicant was the victim of an armed robbery during which he had been threatened with a firearm. That traumatic incident, combined with the after-effects of the death of his father many years previously, led to him being diagnosed in 2005 with post traumatic stress disorder. The evidence demonstrated that he was continuing to suffer from psychological problems as at the date of sentence. Despite the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder, it was recorded that the applicant had not received effective psychological treatment. 

Sentences of Mr Kafizas and Mr Dionys

16As I have indicated, Mr Kafizas was dealt with for the same offence as the applicant, and they were co-offenders with regard to the bulk of the ""sub-offences"" that underpinned it. However, the offence on the indictment to which Mr Kafizas pleaded guilty encapsulated 12 sales of firearms.

17A Form 1 contained 28 further offences to be taken into account in the sentencing of Mr Kafizas.

18As I have noted above, Mr Kafizas was found by his Honour to occupy a lower place in the hierarchy of the criminal enterprise than the applicant.

19Subjectively, Mr Kafizas also pleaded guilty at an early stage, and also received a discount of 25 per cent as a result. Mr Kafizas had no criminal convictions whatsoever. He was aged 59 years in November 2010. Like the applicant, he also suffered from various psychological difficulties. His Honour found that custody would be a difficult experience for a man of his age.

20For his firearms offence, Mr Kafizas received a head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.

21In light of the fact that no ground of appeal is founded upon the quantum of the sentences imposed upon Mr Dionys, or any of the evidence underpinning them, I will not proceed to detail them.

Grounds of appeal

22Two grounds were notified and maintained at the hearing. I shall deal with them in turn.

Ground one

""The sentencing judge erred in his approach to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending and application of the standard non-parole period.""

23It will be recalled that the sentence was imposed well before the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 was handed down.

24The ground was founded on the following aspects of the remarks on sentence. His Honour commenced by detailing the subjective features of the applicant, including his criminal record. Thereafter, his Honour provided a summary of the objective features. His Honour then returned to subjective matters, and recounted them in a way generally favourable to the applicant.

25His Honour then said: 

""The offender has submitted through his counsel, Mr McGill who has appeared for him on all occasions, that the offence for which he has been charged is one which is of below mid range of objective seriousness. Of course the authorities require that the Court give consideration to whether or not, where there is a standard non-parole period, where the offence falls in the level of objective seriousness.""

26Thereafter his Honour returned to the objective features, and that discussion included the finding to which I have referred that the applicant occupied a higher position in the hierarchy than Mr Kafizas.

27His Honour then said:

""Accordingly having referred to those circumstances of the offending I am of the opinion that the objective seriousness of this offence, as pleaded guilty to by the offender and having regard to the matters on the form 1 schedule, are above the mid range of objective seriousness. In saying that I find the offence to be slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness.""

28Thereafter, his Honour turned to the timing of the plea, and the discount that resulted from it. His Honour then turned to various subjective features, including a finding that the applicant was remorseful; that the applicant was unlikely to offend again; and that the applicant would benefit from psychological help, both in custody and upon release.

29Thereafter his Honour said:

""I am of the view that if this was a sentence after trial, rather than a sentence that was being dealt with after a plea of guilty, that the sentence would be a sentence of twelve years imprisonment. I reduce that by a discount of twenty-five per cent for the plea of guilty which means a starting sentence of nine years. I am of the opinion that there is evidence from the fact that this will be his first time in custody, and also from the psychological point of view that I have referred to, that this is a case where there should be a finding of special circumstances and an alteration to the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period imposed.""

30As I indicated, the finding of special circumstances resulted in a reduction in the non-parole period from 6 years 9 months to 5 years 6 months.

Submissions

31Counsel for the applicant submitted that the approach of his Honour as revealed in the remarks on sentence offended against what was said in Muldrock v The Queen. He submitted that an impermissible two-stage approach to sentencing, as opposed to an instinctive synthesis, had been demonstrated.

32He also said that this Court had found error in the remarks on sentence of his Honour with regard to Mr Dionys in Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272, and that the same kind of error was established here.

33The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated. He pointed to decisions of this Court that post date Muldrock v The Queen, and are to the effect that it remains appropriate for sentencing judges to assess the objective seriousness of an offence. He submitted that there was nothing in the remarks on sentence that established that there had been an overly prescriptive, two-step approach adopted by his Honour.

Determination

34I am not satisfied that the error complained of has been demonstrated.

35As my overview of the remarks on sentence shows, his Honour first referred to subjective matters. His Honour then referred to the objective seriousness of the offence, and made the specific finding that I have recounted above. His Honour then returned to a review of various subjective matters, about which generally favourable findings were made. It was after that review that his Honour indicated what the starting point would have been with regard to the head sentence if there had been a trial.

36I do not consider that it was an error for his Honour to make an evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offence. There are a number of decisions of this Court that post date the decision in Muldrock v The Queen to the effect that that is not an inappropriate exercise for a sentencing judge to make an evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offence: see, for example, R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38, Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183, and Atchison v R [2012] NSWCCA 82.

37It is not necessary for me to explore the specificity with which a sentencing judge is now called upon, after Muldrock v The Queen, to make findings with regard to the objective seriousness of an offence. But merely because a sentencing judge has assessed the objective seriousness of an offence with more specificity than may now be necessary does not of itself demonstrate error.

38Here, it is clear from the context that I have recounted that, when his Honour indicated what the starting point (absent a plea of guilty) would have been, that starting point reflected all of the objective and subjective features to which his Honour had referred. In truth, there is no sign of an impermissible two-stage process whereby a non-parole period was considered as a starting point that reflected objective features only and rigid reference to the standard non-parole period, and thereafter reduced to reflect subjective features.

39In short, in the remarks on sentence his Honour discussed the significant subjective and objective features; made an evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offence; indicated the discount that would be given for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty; indicated the starting point of the head sentence that would have been imposed, reflective of all objective and subjective features except the discount for the plea of guilty; explained the bases upon which special circumstances had been found; and thereafter imposed a head sentence that reflected the discount and a non-parole period that reflected special circumstances. Nothing in that process demonstrates error.

40Finally, it is true that an examination of the judgments in Dionys v R shows that a ground founded on Muldrock v The Queen succeeded. It was based on the assertion that, in those completely separate remarks on sentence, his Honour had adopted a two-stage process:

""[50] His Honour sentenced the applicant before the recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, (2011) 85 ALJR 1170 in which the High Court held that R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 had been wrongly decided. When attempting to apply the law as it had been stated in Way , his Honour said that the standard non-parole period remained as a guide even though the applicant had pleaded guilty and made a finding as to the objective seriousness of the offences by reference to the ""mid range of seriousness for offences of this kind"". 


[51] Given the applicant's success in relation to Ground of Appeal 1(a) and the need to re-sentence, the present application is not a suitable vehicle for a close examination of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock. 


[52] What is clear from Muldrock is that a sentencing court is not to engage in a two-step process. His Honour clearly did that on this occasion. His Honour looked at the objective seriousness of the offences and made an assessment of that basis alone and then took into account the applicant's subjective features. In Muldrock the court reiterated the point made by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 537 that all the relevant factors must be identified, both subjective and objective, and then the sentence is set. 


[53] It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out and the applicant has to be re-sentenced in respect of counts 1 and 2.""

41A number of things may be said about that decision. First, the appeal was founded upon wholly separate remarks on sentence. Secondly, the appeal was heard on 3 November 2011 and the decision handed down on 14 December 2011; that is, a little over two months after Muldrock v The Queen was handed down. At that time, the development of the jurisprudence of this Court with respect to the application of the principles in Muldrock v The Queen had only just begun. Thirdly, the analysis in that judgment predates the three examples of authorities to which I have referred to the effect that it remains appropriate for a sentencing judge to make an assessment of objective seriousness in his or her remarks on sentence. Fourthly, the analysis of that ground took place in a context of another ground having been the subject of a concession by the Crown that it should succeed, and accordingly was not determinative. Fifthly and finally, Hoeben J (as his Honour then was), with whom McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) and Adams J agreed on this aspect (Adams J delivering a separate judgment with respect to another ground) made it quite clear that that appeal was not the appropriate vehicle for a close examination of the principles in Muldrock v The Queen.

42In all of those circumstances, I respectfully consider that the decision of this Court in Dionys v R is not determinative of this appeal. 

43As an ancillary matter, and as against the possibility that I am wrong in all of the above analysis of the ground, I indicate that, in light of the grave criminality of the applicant, I have no difficulty in determining that, even if error were to be established contrary to my approach, no lesser sentence is warranted in law.

44It is for those reasons that I would not uphold ground one.

Ground two

""The Applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender Mr Andrew Kafizas.""

45It was submitted that a comparison of a number of aspects of the sentence imposed on Mr Kafizas and the sentence imposed upon the applicant would lead the applicant to experience a justifiable sense of grievance, and therefore that erroneous disparity is established. 

46In support of the ground, counsel for the applicant made clear that he placed no reliance upon the sentence imposed upon Mr Dionys. He also made it clear in oral submissions that he placed no reliance on the sentence imposed upon Mr Kafizas for the serious drug offence and which, as I have noted, had nothing to do with the applicant. His focus was upon the sentence imposed upon Mr Kafizas and the applicant for the firearms offence, in which they were each directly involved.

47It will be recalled that the starting point with regard to the head sentence of the applicant was imprisonment for 12 years. The starting point with regard to the head sentence of Mr Kafizas was imprisonment for 10 years.

48The head sentence actually imposed upon the applicant was imprisonment for 9 years. The head sentence actually imposed upon Mr Kafizas was imprisonment for 7 years 6 months.

49The non-parole period imposed upon the applicant was 5 years 6 months. The non-parole period imposed upon Mr Kafizas was 4 years 6 months.

50I respectfully consider that this ground can be dealt with shortly, and without reciting the submissions of the parties in detail. Nor is it necessary for me to review the well-known authorities. It suffices to say that there were five important points of distinction between the applicant and Mr Kafizas.

51The first was that the offence in the indictment against the applicant was founded on the sale of 13 firearms. The offence in the indictment against Mr Kafizas was founded on 12 such sales.

52The second was that the Form 1 to be taken into account with regard to the applicant contained 39 offences. The Form 1 to be taken into account with regard to Mr Kafizas contained 28 offences.

53The third was that his Honour found that the applicant occupied a higher position in the criminal hierarchy than Mr Kafizas.

54The fourth was that the applicant had a criminal record, and that record featured an entry for an offence to do with a prohibited weapon. Mr Kafizas had no criminal convictions whatsoever.

55The fifth and final point of distinction was that Mr Kafizas was an older man, for whom, as I have indicated, his Honour found an extended period in custody would be a greater burden.

56Founded upon those five points of distinction, I consider that it was well open to the discretion of his Honour to differentiate to the extent that his Honour did between the two offenders, with regard to the starting points, the head sentences actually imposed, and the non-parole periods. I consider that the five points of distinction amply justify the different results at which his Honour arrived. As a result, I do not consider that the applicant can maintain a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares any aspect of the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon Mr Kafizas.

57It follows that I would not uphold ground two.

Orders

58I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal out of time granted.

(2)Leave to appeal granted.

(3)Appeal dismissed.


59GROVE AJ: I agree with Button J.

2761752,Sleeman v Tuloch Pty Ltd t/as Palms on Oxford (No 3) [2013] NSWDC 92,"Judgment

Introduction

1The publication the subject of these defamation proceedings consists of three sentences spoken shortly before midnight on 23 December 2011 by a person identified in the statement of claim as the ""defendants' security guard/doorman"" (""the security guard""), outside the Palms on Oxford nightclub in Darlinghurst. The plaintiff, who had been waiting in a queue to get into this nightclub, alleges that the security guard said to him: 

""You are way too drunk. Go and sober up somewhere else. You can't come in"".

The relevant legislation is the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (""the Act"").The imputations are:

(a)The plaintiff was excessively drunk in a public place;

(b)The plaintiff was so drunk that he needed to sober up somewhere else;

(c)The plaintiff was so drunk as to warrant him not being admitted to the nightclub.

2The statement of claim also sets out that an additional imputation was conveyed to the three persons alleged to have heard the matter complained of. It is pleaded that each knew the plaintiff ""strongly opposed drinking alcohol"", giving rise to the imputation that the plaintiff was a hypocrite, in that he pretends to oppose drinking of alcohol when he himself consumes alcohol to such an excess that he becomes drunk.
3The defendants against whom these proceedings have been brought are as follows:

(a)The first defendant is a corporation conducting the business of the Palms on Oxford, a licensed premises nightclub;

(b)The second defendant is the sole director and secretary of the first defendant; and

(c)The third defendant is the licensee of Palms on Oxford. 

4The defendants are not sued as the publishers of the matter complained of in the generally accepted way (Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331), but on the basis of vicarious liability for the alleged publication by the security guard. In the defence they have jointly filed, each defendant:

(a)Does not admit publication of the matter complained of;

(b)Challenges capacity and denies that the imputations are defamatory;

(c)Claims that if the matter complained of was published, the defendants are not vicariously liable;

(d)Relies upon the defences of qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30, honest opinion, triviality and offer to make amends; and

(e)Relies on the circumstances of the publication in mitigation of damages.

5The Reply filed on 15 March 2013 pleads malice in reply to both of the qualified privilege defences. There is no defeasance of the defence of honest opinion.

6The plaintiff also commenced proceedings in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal in relation to these events. That claim was brought on the basis of exclusion from the nightclub by reason of age discrimination. No claim was made that these proceedings had any relevance in relation to damages issues, despite some overlap in heads of damages, because the Tribunal proceedings are not proceedings for defamation, and because the Tribunal judgment has not been handed down.

Pre-trial applications and rulings

7The procedural history of the claim is of relevance to the way the case was conducted at trial. The defendants challenged the vicarious liability pleadings in a hearing in the Defamation List on 30 November 2012, and the plaintiff was ordered to provide further particulars of the basis of the vicarious liability for each defendant. No judgment is available, but the orders made indicate that the plaintiff was not directed to plead liability for publication in accordance with Webb v Bloch principles. The plaintiff filed an amended statement of claim on 20 December 2012 providing these particulars and joining (without leave) two additional defendants, namely the security guard (Clint James Unwin) and his employer (ADCAS Pty Ltd). 

8These proceedings were then set down for hearing. The first problem was that Mr Unwin and ADCAS Pty Ltd were not told of the hearing date, or served, until after the statement of claim became stale. Proceedings against them were then discontinued as part of a series of case management rulings prior to the trial: Sleeman v Tuloch Pty Ltd t/as Palms on Oxford [2013] NSWDC 43. The second problem was that the claim against the defendants continued to be pleaded on vicarious liability principles applicable to other tortious claims rather than on the principles generally applicable in defamation law (Webb v Bloch, supra).

The issue of publication

9Where the matter complained of is a slander, the court must first determine whether the matter of complained of was published as claimed. In The Producers' and Citizens' Co-operative Assurance Company of Australia Limited v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (1931) SASR 244 at 251, Murray CJ explained this procedure as follows: 

""The actual words spoken by the defendant must, therefore, be given by the witnesses, so far as they can recollect them, and then the inquiry will be, first, whether their recollection and accuracy can be trusted, and secondly, whether the words deposed to and accepted as having been correctly reported bear the same, or practically the same defamatory meaning as the words set out in the statement of claim.""

10I shall first consider issues relevant to publication, namely:

(a)Whether the matter complained of was published;

(b)Whether those imputations which are conveyed are defamatory; and,

(c)Whether any of the defendants are vicariously liable.

Evidence of publication

11The plaintiff is a sports journalist. He was born in 1951 and is currently 62 years old. On the night in question he arranged to meet three friends at the Oxford Hotel, a hotel in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst. They planned to have drinks at the Oxford Hotel and then to spend the evening at a nightclub, the Palms on Oxford. It was a pleasant Friday evening, the day before Christmas Eve, and the gay revellers thronged the streets.

12Mr Everingham, who met the plaintiff at this hotel at 10 pm, was the first to arrive. He had been a friend of the plaintiff for over thirty years and they regularly met for a night out, often in Oxford Street. They remained in the Oxford Hotel, where they were joined at about 11 pm by Mr Kemp and Mr Clifford, Mr Everingham's partner. The plaintiff said that during this time he either did not have anything to drink, or had one drink. Mr Kemp and Mr Clifford both consumed one or two drinks after their arrival. The plaintiff said, and these witnesses confirmed, that the plaintiff's opposition to consumption of alcohol to excess was known by them to be a view of longstanding.

13The plaintiff and his friends intended to go to the nearby ""Palms on Oxford"" nightclub at about 11.30 pm. The plaintiff had been to these premises once before. He was aware there was a security guard at the entrance, and that there was ""always a queue"" waiting to get in:

""Q. You'd been there the year before, hadn't you?
A. Yeah, once the year before, and I was in a queue and only gained entrance because one of the people I was with knew the security guard.

Q. Well you gained entrance didn't you, because you were waiting in the queue?
A. Waiting in the queue, yeah.

Q. And you jumped the queue, because someone knew one of the security guards?
A. Well, there was considerable doubt as to - I don't believe we would have got in at all. There was a - we were standing out there waiting for some time, and we got in - the only reason we got in was because one of the people we were with is an ex-policeman who knew the security guard.

Q. You didn't believe you'd get in because it was so busy?
A. At that stage I didn't know whether it was busy or not?

Q. Well there was a queue, wasn't there?
A. There was a queue. There's always a queue.

Q. There was other people waiting to get in?
A. Yes.

Q. They didn't get in and you got in?
A. I don't know whether they got in or not?

Q. And you only got in because you knew someone?
A. That's why I got in, yes - why we got in.

Q. And you're used to having that sort of preferential treatment are you, when you go out?
A. The preferential treatment wasn't for me, it was for the ex policeman I was with."" (T 97-98)

14All four walked 20 metres up the road to the Palms on Oxford nightclub. There was only one entrance, and there was a security guard standing at the door, as well as a queue waiting to get in.

15Mr Unwin, who gave evidence for the defendants, said that he was that security guard. According to Mr Unwin's evidence, and the security log he said he completed later that night, the plaintiff and his friends attempted to walk into the nightclub without queuing. He claims he told them to join the queue. The plaintiff and his three friends deny this. 

16The plaintiff and his three friends waited in the queue for about ten minutes. According to the plaintiff, he was still five or six persons back from the head of the queue by this time. According to the plaintiff's three friends, Mr Kemp and Mr Clifford had now advanced to the front of the queue, and Mr Everingham and the plaintiff were directly behind them. Although the plaintiff said that Mr Kemp and Mr Clifford had moved to one side so that one of them could have a cigarette, he later agreed that Mr Kemp and Mr Clifford had already been told by the security guard that they could go into the nightclub, and were in the process of doing so (T 102) when the words the subject of this litigation were spoken.

17The plaintiff described what happened as follows:

""Q. Now could you tell her Honour what happened in late 2011? Well, on the date - on December 23 2011, what happened?
A. On that day, I worked from home throughout the day. I was working on a book project, and I arranged to meet some friends in the city. I met - I drove in from my home around 9.30 at night, I guess, having been at my home throughout the day. I met one of my friends, Mr Everingham, at the Oxford Hotel around 10, 10.15 maybe. We were there for an hour to an hour and a half. We were joined at around 11 by Mr Everingham's partner, and a younger friend of Mr Everingham, whose name is Will Kemp. During that time, I had no alcohol. I drink very rarely. We decided around 11.30 to leave that venue and go to Palms nightclub, which is on the same side of the street, slightly downhill, only about 20 metres at most. There was a short queue there at the time, and we joined that queue--

Q. I'll stop you there. How many in the queue, would you say?
A. With us in the queue, there was probably a dozen, I guess. 12 to 15.

Q. Keep going.
A. It was reasonably early in the night by nightclub standards, 11.30 at night and I suppose I was fourth or fifth in the queue. The doorman was about from me to you away, 4 to 5 metres I guess, slightly uphill because it's a slope, and he pointed above the heads of the few people in front of me and pointed directly at me and quite loudly, above the traffic noise and the hubbub of the area, because it was very crowded, you can imagine, the Friday before Christmas. He said very loudly and very pointedly, you're way too drunk, you can't come in here, go away and sober up somewhere else. I was--

Q. Could I stop you there, please, sorry. While you were in the queue, and the fourth or fifth back from the queue as you say, where were your friends who you mentioned, Warwick Everingham, Adam Clifford?
A. Mr Everingham was directly behind me. The other two I'm uncertain of - I'm pretty sure they were either slightly to the right or in front of me. I know that Mr Everingham was directly behind me. To pinpoint exactly where the other two were, I'm not certain. They may have been having - one of them may have been having a cigarette, they may have been slightly to the side or in front of me.

Q. Now, just to clarify, the answer you've just given, or the description you've just given as to where people were located, where your friends were located - is that at the time that the words were spoken?
A. That's at the time the words were spoken, yes.

Q. Carry on, you were--
A. Well I was - my reaction was, I was shocked and bewildered. I was standing in the queue, not animated in any way, not talking to anyone, facing the front. I was well dressed in a collared shirt and reasonably stylish jeans and shoes. I was giving no impression that anybody - any reasonable person, anybody at all could draw that I was affected in any way by alcohol.

...

Q. Did the security guard approach you and perhaps see if there was alcohol on your breath, to your understanding?
A. Didn't move from his spot by the door.

Q. He remained the distance you've said, 4 or 5 metres away?
A. Didn't move from his spot, yes.

Q. And you certainly weren't drunk, if I haven't asked you? I'll ask you again.
A. I was not drunk, I had no alcohol at all.

Q. At the time the words were spoken, or immediately after, what was your reaction?
A. I was stunned and bewildered for a few seconds, because it was - completely at a loss to explain why I was being attacked so loudly, and because I was allegedly drunk and so drunk that I couldn't get in to mix with other people, and so drunk that I had to be banished elsewhere. It was bewildering. I very quickly came to the realisation that I was being excluded because I was too old, I just simply didn't fit into the queue or the sort of people that the doorman wanted in the club, and calling me drunk and so drunk that I couldn't go in and I had to go somewhere else was simply his way of excluding me.

Q. The words spoken by the security guard, was your impression that they were said to your group, or what was your impression?
A. It was said to me, pointedly, directly, aggressively and loudly.

Q. When you say pointedly, did he point at you?
A. He pointed at me directly, and the words were said loudly and aggressively.

Q. And he pointed to you as he was saying the words, did he?
A. Pointed to me as he was saying the words.

Q. You said your reaction to the words - was this something that happens to you, or used to happen to you when you - I withdraw that. You said something along the lines of being stunned and bewildered. Is this something that usually happened to you on a night out on Oxford Street?
A. No, it's not happened to me before."" (T 6-9)

18The other witnesses gave a slightly different version, namely that Mr Everingham called Mr Kemp and Mr Clifford back to stop them from continuing to enter the nightclub, and told them the plaintiff had been refused entry on the basis that he was too drunk (T 302, 311). Mr Everingham said at T 430:

""Q. Now, what happened next, when you were in the queue?
A. For some reason the - well, when we were just standing in the queue, chatting quietly, and for some reason the security guard decided - made a decision that we weren't getting in, and said that we weren't getting in because we were drunk. I don't think he used those words. He just said that, ""You've had enough, you're not having any more here,"" words to that effect, which I was really dumbfounded by, because I wasn't - I hadn't had too much to drink. It was obvious to me I hadn't had too much to drink, and I think it was obvious to the security guard we hadn't had too much to drink either. There was obviously some other reason for him saying that. There had been a decision made that we weren't going to get in; simple as that.

Q. All right, and did he greet you, the security guard?
A. I don't remember him saying anything much other than that""

19The plaintiff said that there were many other people in the vicinity within earshot:

""Q. You said that there were about a dozen people in the queue?
A. Around a dozen people in the queue.

Q. Were there passers by?
A. There were - it was a very busy area, the busiest night of the year, I suspect, the Friday night before Sunday Christmas in one of the largest entertainment areas of the city, so - I think within the immediate area there was - in addition to the dozen in the queue, another 20 or so in the immediate area. It could well have been within earshot and probably were. In, in the vicinity - that is within, within the radius of this room - it could well have been 50 to 100 people.

Q. Just to be clear, 12 in the people in the queue or thereabouts?
A. Yep.

Q. Twenty people or so in the immediate area, you say--
A. Yes.

Q. --would you call them the passers by or?
A. Yeah, yes.

Q. And then within what distance? I'm sorry if you've already said, within what distance were the 20?
A. Within the distance of this room, so I suppose in a--

Q. I'm sorry, I just - I think your evidence was ""20 or so in the immediate area""?
A. Yes.

Q. And then you said, ""In the vicinity there might've been 50""?
A. Fifty, correct.

Q. Just back to the 20--
A. Yes.

Q. --who you said were in the immediate area, would you say they were the passers by or?
A. They were passers by people within - people in the queue and passers by.

Q. You make a distinction, so the 20 is made of the 12 in the queue and then 8 or so passers by?
A. No, no, 12 in the queue and another 20 within in earshot in the, in the immediate vicinity.

Q. Overall, the size of this courtroom?
A. It could've been 50 to 100 people."" (T 10-11)

20The plaintiff's evidence differed from the evidence of Mr Clifford, Mr Everingham and Mr Kemp in a number of respects. This is to be expected where the events in question occur quickly, and witnesses see events from a different vantage point. However, the differences between the plaintiff's evidence and the evidence of these witnesses showed a pattern of exaggeration by the plaintiff on issues such as the loudness and aggressiveness of the security guard's voice, where they were in the queue, the ability of those present to hear him, and what was said. His evidence that the security guard was aggressive not only conflicted with the evidence of the other witnesses, but with statements he had previously made in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (Exhibits B, D and F).

21The plaintiff's evidence was that he was standing alone, 4 - 5 metres from the doorman, in the third, fourth, fifth or sixth position in the queue (T 7 - 8, 11, 102 - 3). He said the security guard looked at him from a distance of about 4 metres or even further. In addition, he said that Mr Clifford and Mr Kemp were another 5 metres away and had separated from him (T 103 - 105). Since Mr Kemp and Mr Clifford had, the plaintiff agreed, been told they could go inside (T 102), this suggests that they would have been on the other side of the security guard.

22However, the plaintiff's description of where he was - isolated, further down in the queue and vulnerable - is contradicted not only by the evidence of the security guard but also by the three witnesses the plaintiff called. Mr Clifford said ""I was standing at the front of the queue and Mr Sleeman and Mr Everingham were right behind me"" (T 489). Mr Everingham said he was standing in the line with Mr Sleeman and was two metres at most from the nightclub door (Exhibit 13, p 41; T 459). Mr Kemp said he had walked past the door and started to go in, accompanied by Mr Clifford. Similarly, although the plaintiff said that he had become separated from his three companions (T 103 - 105) and that they were five metres or so away, Mr Clifford's evidence was that he and Mr Kemp were standing in front of the plaintiff and Mr Everingham for approximately 10 minutes while they waited in the queue (T 489). This was confirmed by Mr Everingham who said they were ""in the queue, which is closed [sic], which is by the door"" (T 432) for three to four minutes (T 458). Mr Kemp said that they were in the queue for 10 minutes, and that the plaintiff and Mr Everingham were ""standing behind us"" (T 311).

23While he was in the queue the plaintiff said he did not talk to anybody (T 99 - 102). It was in these circumstances that the security guard spoke to him aggressively and loudly without prior warning (T 9, 103, 146, 148). Again, this differed from the evidence of his three friends, who described the group as having conversations. Mr Clifford said he was talking to Mr Kemp, while the plaintiff and Mr Everingham were talking to each other (T 489). Mr Everingham said he and the plaintiff were ""chatting quietly"" (T 430; 459). Mr Kemp observed the plaintiff and Mr Everingham chatting together (T 320). In addition, none of these witnesses mentioned shouting or loudness by the security guard. Mr Everingham (T 43) and Mr Kemp (T 303) described what the security guard said without any mention of his shouting, being aggressive or even speaking loudly.

24Mr Kemp said he had his back turned to the plaintiff when he heard someone say, ""You're way too drunk. You're not coming in"" (T 303). He turned around and saw the security guard still ""talking"" to the plaintiff but did not say what further words were said. Mr Clifford, standing with Mr Kemp with his back to the guard, did not even hear this:

""Q. And then what happened then?
A. I got to the front of the queue. Me and Will were at the front, and we were told we were allowed to go in.

Q. Sorry, I missed that last
A. Me and Will, we were standing together.

Q. Yes.
A. And we were told we were allowed to go in, by the bouncer.

Q. Do you recall the words spoken by the bouncer to you, or not?
A. ""You can go in.""

Q. Did he greet you?
A. I think he nodded his head and said, ""Hi."" I can vaguely remember that.

Q. Did he say anything else? Was there any other
A. Not that I can recall.

Q. So you and Will pass through the door of the
A. Yeah.

Q. And what happened next?
A. We were walking - about to walk down the stairs, and I heard Warwick say - call my name.

Q. Yes.
A. And I turned around and he said, ""We can't go in.""

Q. Did he say anything else?
A. Sorry. I can't specifically remember, at that exact moment.

Q. Okay, sorry to interrupt you. So he said, ""We can't go in.""
A. Yeah.

Q. And then what happened next, or what was said next?
A. Then he said after that, ""They said Richard's drunk.""

Q. Okay. Did he say anything else?
A. Sorry. Not that I can remember, not in that

Q. Okay, and so Mr Everingham, ""They say - or they said Richard's drunk""?
A. Yeah.

Q. Then what happened next?
A. We basically turned around and walked back out."" (T 466-467)

25According to Mr Kemp, Mr Everingham called him and Mr Clifford back ""We can't go in. Richard's been told he's too drunk"" (T 304). Mr Kemp's claim that he turned around after hearing the security guard saying that the plaintiff was too drunk, and saw him still speaking these words to the plaintiff, cannot be correct, as he turned around after hearing these words. Since he was with Mr Clifford, and in the process of entering the club, the likelihood is that he, like Mr Clifford, did not know about what had happened until Mr Everingham told them. That would mean that neither of them, and not only Mr Clifford, heard or saw what happened.

26The plaintiff said that after he was told he could not enter, he said to the security guard, ""quietly and deliberately"", that ""discrimination was disgraceful and any discrimination in a gay club was particularly disgraceful"" (Exhibit 13, pp 17 and 35; see also T 9). None of the other witnesses heard this conversation or mentioned it.

27The question of what the plaintiff said to the security guard is of significance. The nightclub's incident log (Exhibit 5) contains a note of the guard's version of what was said by both of them. That version does not refer to an age discrimination complaint, but to a threat to publicise the event in the media.

28If there was any conversation between them, it was not noticed by the other witnesses (Mr Everingham, standing next to the plaintiff, said there were ""no arguments"" and they just left: T 435).

29It is common ground that the security guard said nothing about the plaintiff's age. According to Mr Everingham, Mr Clifford suggested age discrimination as the explanation for his exclusion. Mr Everingham thought ""another agenda"" was being served, although he did not know what this agenda was:

""Q. So you've said that the plaintiff was dumbfounded?
A. Yes. 

Q. Because he was clearly not drunk, and that there was another agenda at play, you said?
A. Yes. 

HER HONOUR

Q. How did you know that?
A. Okay. Look, I just didn't think that the doorman was saying with any real conviction that we were really drunk. I don't believe that that doorman thought that we were drunk either. I believe that there was another agenda being served. I didn't know what it was. Right?

EVANS

Q. Yes.
A. I think it was Adam that said, ""You're too old,"" and that started to make sense. That seemed an obvious suggestion. I come from a community that's - it's a gay community. We've been discriminated against all our lives. I've grown up with it, right. And here I am in a situation, a gay place run by gay people, who are deciding to discriminate against me because I'm too old, too fat, too ugly, whatever it happens to be. All right?

Q. Okay.
A. And that made me angry. I'm not angry about being called a drunk. I couldn't care less that someone calls me a drunk. But I really am angry about just being discriminated against by my own people, and that seems to have been lost in this whole - this whole scenario. No one seems to have said that at all.

Q. All right. So you said the doorman didn't - you don't believe the doorman--
A. I don't believe the doorman believed what he was saying, because it was so obviously untrue, we were not drunk and no one in their right minds could say that we were drunk. And if he's a security guard he should be able to see if someone's actually drunk if that's part of his job to do that. No one could have said that we were drunk. It was just impossible after one beer."" (T 433-434)

30It is unclear at what precise stage Mr Clifford suggested this. Mr Everingham said that when the security guard refused the plaintiff permission to enter the premises, they were all ""dumbfounded"". It was shortly after the incident occurred that Mr Clifford volunteered the suggestion that the plaintiff's age could have been the reason. Since Mr Clifford had not had the opportunity to see or hear the exchange, this was supposition.

31The plaintiff said that someone in the immediately vicinity called him a ""dinosaur"" (T 155, 157). He was not sure where the ""dinosaur"" comment came from (T 9, 11, 70) but he thought it came either from someone in the queue or a passer-by (T 10-11).

32Mr Kemp did not mention hearing the word ""dinosaur"". Mr Everingham said:

""Q. What I want to suggest to you was he was on one side of the security guard because he'd been let past--
A. Could've been, yeah, could've been.

Q. --and you were on the other side of the security guard on Oxford Street--
A. Yeah, that's sounds about right.

Q. --and you said to him, ""Adam, come back, we're not being let in--
A. I, I just said that we're not, they're not letting us in.

Q. --they think we're too drunk.""
A. Yeah.

Q. You didn't laugh, did you, at Mr Sleeman at that point?
A. Not at that point. Later, yeah.

Q. Well, did you think it was funny at some point?
A. Yeah, later on, yeah.

Q. Well, tell me about that, what did you think was funny about it?
A. Well, he's just, you know, the, you know, the idea of him being a dinosaur is funny, just a good natured dragging that you get, that you do with friends.

Q. But you didn't laugh at him until you got to the Taxi Club?
A. Maybe on my way up there.

Q. You thought it was funny, didn't you, because it was a silly situation?
A. Well, it wasn't a silly situation but just good natured dragging, ""You're a dinosaur, you're too old ..(not transcribable).. you're too old, you can't go anywhere with you, you're too old."""" (T 460-461)

33Mr Clifford said:

""Q. All right. Well, on that night, apart from your knowledge of him generally over that 22 years, why do you say that night he didn't look drunk?
A. He looked perfectly normal. He was well dressed. He was in a pressed shirt, collared shirt, pants. He wasn't slurring. He wasn't anything other than he always looks or behaves.

Q. So then you were at the Palms and then at some point this happened, and then what happened after what you've already told us?
A. Well, there was a bit of a crowd and some comments were said in the crowd.

Q. Right, and what were they?
A. I didn't see who said it, but someone said something like to the effect of, ""Ah, you old dinosaur,"" or something like that.

Q. When you say a bit of a crowd, how many people did
A. Probably 15 to 20 people, maybe. That was in the line behind us, but there were a few people on the street as well. It was a busy night.

Q. So you're saying there were 15 to 20 on the queue?
A. Yeah.

Q. And then a few people around.
A. Yeah."" (T 468-469)

34The plaintiff said that people were chuckling and laughing at him (T 11-12). It was put to the plaintiff that this was a recent invention, as this claim had not been raised in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal proceedings (T 164). 

35While there are inconsistencies and omissions between the accounts of what was said, the evidence of these witnesses is that the plaintiff was refused admittance to the Palms on Oxford because he was drunk. The evidence of the security guard who says he was on duty, and who made an entry into a security log about these events, differs in important respects.

Evidence of Mr Unwin

36Mr Clint James Unwin gave evidence that he was working from 9:00pm to 3:00am that evening. He was a public servant who had worked in the evenings as a security guard for ADCAS Pty Ltd at the Palms on Oxford premises for approximately 12 years. On the night in question he was working with another security guard named Harry, a man of similar build and age, but of Indian origin. As Mr Unwin was the more experienced of the two, he remained on the door when he worked with Harry, who would go downstairs every 15 minutes to do a ""sweep"" of the premises (T 190).

37Mr Unwin's description of what occurred is as follows:

""Q. what happened to lead you to write this incident report?
A. Okay, I was standing at the front door of Palms and I was the only person there, Harry was downstairs. By my recollection three males walked to the door. They approached from a southeasterly direction, from Bondi direction, the top of Oxford Street, and they went to go in. I stated to the males, ""There's a line, can you please line up?"" The males didn't want to line up and I stated, ""Sir, everyone, we need to line up,"" so the males finally went to the line, the line was only short, by my memory. 

When the males got to the front of the line I, I just each male, as I always do, ""Gentlemen, where have you been today? How are we?"" And I saw one male, I describe as being approximately 50 to 60 years of age, tall, which I now know to be Mr Sleeman, had reddish complexion, dark red complexion, so it's my, my experience and, and skill to be able to see that this person may have consumed some drinks. I do not know how many, and that's why I asked, ""Excuse me, sir, how much have you had to drink tonight?""

He stated he had none. His two friends, I said, ""How much have we had to drink?"" His two friends then said, ""We've been to dinner and we've consumed a couple with dinner,"" so now I had conflicting stories with his friends, so I said to each male, I said, ""Excuse me, gents, which one is it? None, or one, or two? Can you help me out?"" At that time Mr Sleeman immediately became irate and refused to be what I believe, to be questioned by me. I stated to the males, ""I'm just doing my job. How many have we had to drink?"" He became abusive and refused to answer my questions and said that I he should not be subject to the questions of me.

He then walked away in disgust, about 2 to 3 metres, and I continued to speak to his two friends. They were quite calm and in a patient demeanour, and I explained to them, ""I'm just trying to do my job and ascertain how much we've had to drink."" I struck a conversation with them for several minutes and explained to them that: 

""Your friend has appeared to not want to come in, as he's objected to being questioned about his alcohol intake, but you two are welcome to go into the club.""

At that time they state we continued a conversation about letting Mr Sleeman in, and I said, ""He's, he's doesn't want to enter."" He's 2 or 3 metres from the doorway now, he's several metres away near the footpath. The gutter. At this time I allowed them entry and ultimately in the end Mr Sleeman was over near the gutter and that's when he stated, ""Do you know who I am? You'll regret refusing me entry."" And at this time I heard his remarks. I did not know who he was, I was just doing my job, and in the end he, he that's when I said to his friends:

""Look, your, your, your friend is becoming a bit, you know, aggressive and, and abusive. I don't think it would be a good idea for him to come in but you two are still welcome to enter.""

In the end they left with Mr Sleeman. That's when Mr Sleeman said, ""I'm going to name and shame you to the media. You'll regret refusing me entry."" So after they left, several minutes later, I went down and made contemporaneous notes of his entry, taking into effect that I deemed his threats to be serious.

Q. Now, did you ever shout at any of these men at any time?
A. At no time was there a reason to shout to anyone. 

Q. Did you ever say to any of them words to the effect of, ""You are way too drunk to come in. Go and sober up somewhere else""?
A. No, that's not true.

Q. Do you recall ever shouting at patrons outside the club?
A. No, that's not true. I, I didn't have a chance to ascertain Mr Sleeman's sobriety because he walked away and refused to enter. I was in the process of trying to and he objected to being questioned by me and that's when he moved away, and I continued the conversation with his two friends, and they were in close proximity to me, so there was no need to raise my voice at all. 

Q. Now, you say it's Mr Sleeman, how do you know it's Mr Sleeman? When did you see him?
A. Apart from seeing Mr Sleeman on the night, several weeks later, I'm not sure exactly when, Rod Innis explained to me that a complaint had been made to the media about him being refused entry for age discrimination and being too drunk. That's when I realised the entry and I pointed the entry out to Rod, saying, ""This is who I think the entry is.""

Q. So you made a connection, did you, in your mind
A. Yes.

Q. between the allegation of well, the media interest
A. Yes.

Q. and what had happened
A. Yes, due to his

Q. and recorded in this entry?
A. Sorry, yes.

Q. When did you first know that it was a person called Mr Sleeman?
A. I went to the, the ADT a while ago, February, and I saw Mr Sleeman in court.

Q. Are you sure that he's the person that relates to this entry?
A. Yes, I am. I am.

Q. Or the incident log?
A. Yes, I am.

Q. Are you sure that he's the person that you just spoke about to her Honour that said certain things on 23 December 2011?
A. Yes, I am."" (T 191-193)

38Mr Unwin's evidence was that he remembered the plaintiff, whom he first noticed when he and his companions had attempted to enter the nightclub without queuing up. He made the point, a number of times during his evidence, that there were three men (he had no recollection of there being four men) who were big and strong, a matter of some concern to him since he weighed 75kgs and was of more slender build. From observation in the courtroom, this is an accurate description of the build of Mr Clifford, Mr Everingham and the plaintiff. Mr Everingham is a former champion athlete, and he and Mr Clifford, who are partners, are very actively involved in sports. The plaintiff is a sports journalist; his history is one of active participation in sport related activities. Mr Kemp, who is just into his twenties, looked his age or younger, and also looked to be fit and strong.

39Mr Unwin denies speaking the words complained of (T 192) or being aggressive (T 195) or shouting (T 192). In particular, he said he did not refuse the plaintiff permission to enter because of his age:

""Q. So did you exclude him because he was mature age?
A. No."" (T 193)

40He went on to say in cross-examination that he had never refused any person because of their age as this would have been contrary to the purpose of the nightclub, which played ""retro"" music from the 1970s and 1980s, and had regular attendees of a mature age, including patrons in their fifties, sixties and even seventies (T 188).

41Mr Unwin said that following these events he filled out the incident log (Exhibit 5). Mr Unwin said he filled out incident number 480265 (and also the second entry, 480266, in relation to another incident) on the night in question shortly after these events occurred. This entry reads:

""Refuse male. Refused to line-up. Lined up & then want [went] in. Male abused security & said he would publicly defame our names in newspaper.""

42The third defendant, Mr Innes, is the licensee of the nightclub. He described having a conversation with Mr Unwin that same night, in which Mr Unwin told him that he had had to refuse entry to someone. He thought he had this conversation early in the morning of 24 December:

""Q. I can put to you this though, I think. Do you agree that it would be most unlikely that you, the licensee of the premises, and the security guard, who was on duty at the time of this incident, would not have - I withdraw that. When was it again that you spoke to Clint Unwin on the night?
A. On the 23rd, 24th?

Q. 23rd.
A. Or 23rd/24th. Somewhere - it was 1, quarter past, half past 1 or somewhere around there.

Q. At the time you spoke to him he had already filled in the incident log?
A. Yes.

Q. Are you aware of what time he put in on the incident log?
A. To be honest, no. I can't remember.

Q. Well, have a go, putting it all together.
A. It would have been, it would have been about half an hour, 40 minutes beforehand, so 12.15, 12.30.

Q. Just one sec. Sorry, your Honour, I just wanted to clarify an answer. All right. So sitting there in the witness box, you were at first unsure of the time he might have put it in the incident book, but you gave an answer 12.15 or 12.30.

HER HONOUR: No. What he said was he couldn't remember and you asked him to have a guess.

EVANS: Right.

...

Q. Now, did you have cause to - I withdraw that. Did you do one of your visits to the door - I withdraw that. When did you first see the incident log, if at all?
A. When Clint come down and told me about it, about the incident.

Q. Now, he would have needed to be away from the door at that point?
A. Correct.

Q. What was the arrangement made for someone to be on the door while he was downstairs?
A. The other security - Harry was on the door.

Q. Is it your recollection that Clint Unwin spoke to you downstairs at the time, around the time that he entered the incident log?
A. Yes.

Q. And is the reason you say that be he was generally needed on the front - someone was needed on the front door and he needed to get back to the front door when he could?
A. I don't understand what you mean.

Q. Well, is it the case that Clint Unwin was the - you say he was regularly on Friday nights, don't you?
A. Yes.

Q. Now, could he, while on duty and whilst not undertaking a sweep of downstairs or other duties - first of all, how long would a sweep of downstairs take, do you say?
A. Anything from two minutes to 10, 15.

Q. Are you aware that he was doing a sweep around about the time he filled in the incident log or not, of whether he was?
A. That's what he was doing. He said to me, ""I've just gone through the venue and I just wanted to fill in this incident book.""

Q. He said, ""I'm just going through the venue.""
A. No, he's just been through.

Q. Just been through, sorry.
A. Because he had been through the venue to come out to the office.

Q. ""Just been through the venue. Going to fill in this incident log"", something like that. Okay.

Q. Did he tell you when he - go ahead. Have some water.
A. No, you're right.

Q. Sorry. Okay. So ""just been through the venue"", you understood to mean he had done a sweep of the venue?
A. Yes.

Q. A security sweep of the venue?
A. Yes.

Q. And what does that involve?
A. Just checking to see intoxication, smoking, open-toe shoes, anyone fighting and that the ladies are using the ladies' and the men are using the men's.

Q. A very elegant way of putting it, if I may say, Mr Innes. Now - unless I misunderstood, of course. Now, see the

CHRYSANTHOU: Even I understood that.

EVANS: Thank God for that. Right. Good.

Q. Did you have an idea? You've said generally it might take two to 10 minutes to do a sweep?
A. Generally.

Q. Do you have any reason to know how long that particular sweep had taken?
A. No, not at all.

Q. Well, as the regular security guard on the door, whether he was doing a sweep or something else for the venue or for his employer within the venue, it would have been important for him to get back on the door quickly, as quickly as he could, wouldn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. If I put to you that during the period we're talking about, this period from probably half an hour to 40 minutes before 1.15, if I put to you that Clint Unwin didn't make a security sweep during that period, what would you say to that?
A. That particular security sweep? I know he did.

Q. You know he did?
A. Yes.

Q. And how are you sure it was a security sweep?
A. Because I was in the office and we have cameras right above where I was standing.

Q. And what do the cameras show you with regards to--
A. The whole venue.

Q. But what did the cameras show him doing?
A. Walking through.

Q. But a security log is a important document, isn't it?
A. Security log? Incident report?

Q. Incident log.
A. Yes."" (T 363-366) 

43Mr Innes went on to say:

""Q. You said he went downstairs. Originally your evidence was that he went downstairs to do a sweep and - I'll just see if I can get the words of the conversation from my note. Well, he referred to doing a sweep, didn't he, and that he was filling in the incident log, didn't he?
A. Yes.

Q. ""Just been through the venue. I'm going to fill in this incident log.""
A. That's when he told me what the, what it was about.

Q. Good. Now, your original was that he said he was about to, and now you say that he already had.
A. The incident log has got two parts to it.

Q. Yes.
A. The first part, which is a, a, a short summary of what happened, and the second part is the, well, it's the log part of it. That's what he was coming in to fill out, the log part. He'd already filled out the incident. That's why, and then that's when I said to him, ""There's no point. There's nothing to, nothing to put, nothing to put in there.""

Q. He'd already put the short summary--
A. Yeah, the--

Q. --of what had happened and he was putting in the log part?
A. He was about to put the log in.

Q. What do you mean by the log part?
A. That's if - each one is numbered and then there's a, at the end of the book there's another page that corresponds with that number which you can put a full report into it.

Q. So did he ever - right, I'll withdraw that. So he was telling you, ""I've done the short bit.""
A. Mm-hmm.

Q. ""I'm about to fill in the long bit of the log book.""?
A. Mm.

Q. And have you ever seen the long description of the--
A. No, because I told him not to both.

Q. You told him not to bother?
A. Yeah.

Q. Aren't you required to fill in that part of the log book?
A. No, because there was nothing really to report on there. It was that somebody was going to name and shame. I said, ""Oh, don't worry about it. Just, you know, it'll, it'll - that's when he had, had - that's when we had a laugh about it. I said, ""Oh, don't worry about it. It's someone just being smart.""

Q. Now, what you've referred to as the longer description of the incident at the back of the book--
A. Yeah.

Q. --could that be what I've been referred to as the venue incident log?
A. That's all in one - it's all the security log. It's all the same book.

Q. Okay.
A. Yeah.

Q. But is there some kind - there's an obligation, you accept, to fill in the short description part with the sequential numbering?
A. The only, the only time you need to fill in the long is if there is a major incident. Someone's had a fight. They've cut themselves. They've thrown a glass at someone, if you need a more detailed description of a person or something like that.

Q. You didn't require him to fill in the long description at the back of the log book at that time. Did you ever require him to do so?
A. No.

Q. So as far as you know, Clint Unwin didn't create another document between the short entry here in the log book and then the longer log book entry at the back of the book?
A. No. No.

Q. You've never seen an account of this incident?
A. Only what's, only what's in the, the short version there.

Q. All right. Now, when he was telling you what it was about, he would have told you, wouldn't he, whether Mr Sleeman, who's the plaintiff in these proceedings - as I'm sure you know by now--
A. Yes.

Q. --whether he came in to the venue or not, whether he actually stepped in the doors of the venue?
A. No, his words were, ""Oh, you might get a complaint about me later because I refused, refused this guy because he was drunk and he threatened to name and shame us,"" and that's when I just went, ""Yeah, right,"" and that's my exact, that's - and then that was it; that was the end of it. And he, that's all he wrote down on there.

Q. When as the next time - I apologise if you've said this before. When was the next time or the first time you saw the entry in the incident log?
A. Well, that was then.

Q. So you did have a look at it?
A. Well, he just put it up in front of me; that was about it."" (T 377-379)

44Mr Unwin was not cross-examined about this conversation, about which he did not give evidence. His evidence was that he thought no more of these events until Mr Innes spoke to him later in January. 

45The plaintiff was asked about the accuracy of Incident Log 480265:

Q. And does it have an incident number?
A. Yes. 480265. It says location door, reported by Armen [Transcription error: Unwin]. 

Q. Could you read out the number again?
A. 480265.

Q. And if I told you that purported to be an incident log of the incident, what's your reaction to that?A. There's no resemblance to what happened at all. Completely unrelated to the incident involving me.

Q. Why do you say that?
A. Well, it says refused to line up. Well I never refused to line up, I just stood in the queue as per normal and wasn't animated in any way, so I stood as anyone would stand in a queue. So it says refused to line up, and it says lined up and then went in. Well, I never got near the entry to the club, because the doorman told me I couldn't go in. So it says then went in, and when - and then went in, well, I never went into the club. It says male abused security. At not point did I abuse security or say a word to security other than on the way out when I spoke quietly to him about the discrimination that had just occurred. Then it says - and said he would publicly defame our names in newspaper, and I never at any stage said that. And no mention of the fact that I'd been accused of being intoxicated. So there's a box here for intoxication, that's not ticked. There's a box here for refuse entry, that's not ticked. It just - it's - there's no resemblance whatever, it simply is unrelated to the incident involving me."" (T 48-49)

46The reference to ""Armen"" is the signature of Mr Unwin. The reference to the box for ""refuse entry"" and the box for ""intoxication"" not being ticked are, I consider, significant. They support the evidence of Mr Innes about the conversation he had with Mr Unwin, and Mr Unwin's evidence that he was still in the process of determining what to do when he spoke to the plaintiff.

47Ms Evans submitted that I would reject this document as being a forgery or, alternatively, as being so obviously wrong that it was a hopelessly inaccurate record. She particularly relied upon the reference to the fact that the document said ""then went in"". The plaintiff did not in fact go in, although Mr Clifford and Mr Kemp had been told they could go in.

48This was a document filled out in haste by a security guard who said he was at the time in a state of some anxiety. It was a very busy night, being the last night of trading before Christmas Eve. It was filled out in circumstances similar to hospital and emergency records, where the maker of the record has other concerns; in the present case, these were safety issues because of the possibility of inebriated or violent persons seeking entry to licensed premises, in circumstances where Mr Unwin was the security guard expected to keep them out. 

49Trial judges have repeatedly been warned against over-literal interpretations of the informalities in documents filled out in haste by persons processing information in busy situations, such as ambulance officers or hospital emergency admissions staff (Davis v Council of the City of Wagga Wagga [2004] NSWCA 34 at [35]; Kappadoukas v Fransepp Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 366 at [55] - [57] and Gulic v O'Neill [2011] NSWCA 361 at [24]). 

50I am satisfied that this record, despite the alteration of the time and informal language, was filled out on the night in question by Mr Unwin, who signed his name at the end, and that the reference to the response of the person refused entry about media publicity is strongly indicative that this person was the plaintiff. Given his subsequent conduct in contacting the Star Observer newspaper about this incident, I am of the view that the plaintiff did in fact say words to this effect to the security guard. I am also satisfied that, as a contemporaneous document, this document is the best record of what in fact occurred. I also consider the evidence of Mr Innes about his conversation with Mr Unwin on the night in question to be a reliable account of the circumstances in which Mr Unwin drew these events to his attention.

51The plaintiff challenges whether the security guard was Mr Unwin at all. He gave evidence that the security guard who stopped him entering was very different in appearance.

Description of the security guard's appearance

52The plaintiff challenges that Mr Unwin was the security guard in question. He stated that the security guard was of Islander or Middle Eastern appearance, about 1.8 metres tall, and heavy-set. He thought he saw someone who looked like this sitting in the public area during the Administrative Decisions Tribunal hearing, but this person turned out to be a Mr Negaren (T 181), a director of the security company which employs Mr Unwin, who had attended the Administrative Decisions Tribunal in that capacity. There is no suggestion that Mr Negaren worked as a security guard or was present on the night in question. 

53Mr Everingham's description of the guard was closer to the appearance of Mr Unwin. He described the security guard as Mediterranean (Exhibit 13, p 44) but, when shown a photograph of Mr Unwin, he said that he ""could be"" the security guard they saw on the night (T 444). He thought the security guard was wearing a white shirt and black pants. 

54Mr Kemp said the security guard was ""a big Islander guy"" (T 302) and was neither Middle Eastern nor Mediterranean (T 303, 313, 319). He thought the security guard was wearing a black button-up shirt, black pants and boots, and an ID. He said the guard did not look anything like the photograph of Mr Unwin (T 319).

55Mr Kemp's evidence of the events on the night in question is, I find, less reliable than the evidence of Mr Clifford and Mr Everingham. I am satisfied that Mr Kemp was with Mr Clifford, heading into the club entrance, and that neither of them saw or heard the security guard speak to the plaintiff, or knew what had happened, until Mr Everingham called them back.

56Mr Clifford said that the security guard was of Middle Eastern appearance or ""kind of Islander-ish"" (T 468). These are two very distinct racial types. In addition, Mr Clifford could not give any other details of significance concerning this security guard's appearance or apparel. Mr Clifford, when shown the photograph of Mr Unwin and another security guard (Exhibit 3), said the guard in question had the build of the person standing on the right of Mr Unwin (T 483 line 23), whom Ms Chrysanthou identified as a Mr Arnold in her submissions. There is no suggestion that he was working with Mr Unwin that night. Contrary to the evidence of Mr Kemp, the gentleman identified in Exhibit 3 as looking like the security guard on the night in question could not be described as a big muscular Islander.

57There was no challenge to Mr Innes' evidence that no guard of Islander appearance (whether 1.8 metre tall or otherwise) worked at the Palms on Oxford in December 2011 (T 348).

58The security guard who was working with Mr Unwin on 23 December 2011 was a Mr Harpreet (Harry) Gill, who was considerably shorter than Mr Unwin, of Indian/Pakistani appearance, and not overweight (T 340, 189). Mr Gill did not report any incident to Mr Innes that night (T 341) and no notes of any incident appeared in the incident log under his hand (Exhibit 5), both of which confirm that Mr Unwin carried out the writing up of incidents. Mr Gill has not worked at the Palms on Oxford since approximately February or March 2012, when he was reallocated on the security guard roster (T 190, 340).

The plaintiff's complaint to the Star Observer

59Mr Innes received a telephone call on Monday 9 January 2012 from the Melbourne editor of the Star Observer, Ms Noonan. According to Mr Innes' affidavit of 27 September 2012 (paragraph 5), Ms Noonan referred to an incident in which a male had been refused entry to the club ""on Christmas Eve"" (Exhibit 8) and claimed that age discrimination had been levelled at him by the security guard. Mr Innes asked Ms Noonan to send an email in relation to the issue, and said that he would respond after he had made further enquiries. He received an email inquiring about the events and responded that the club ""does not and has not discriminated against persons for any reasons let alone someone's age"" (Exhibit 9). He also stated that the club was closed on the date given, namely Christmas Eve (24 December). Following Ms Noonan's 10 January correction of the incident date to 23 December (Exhibit 8), he had a conversation with Mr Unwin, as indicated in Mr Innes's email in reply (Exhibit 8), and the incident book entry was located. This chain of emails confirms the existence of the incident book and the second conversation Mr Innes had with Mr Unwin. 

Conclusions concerning the identity of the security guard

60For the plaintiff and his witnesses to be correct, there would have to be a cover-up by the defendants in order to falsely represent that Mr Unwin was the security guard/doorman at the relevant time (I note the plaintiff has particularised this claim in the Reply), create a false entry in the incident log (and a reconstructed log book), hide the identity of the real security guard, and give untruthful evidence both in these proceedings and the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. 

61Mr Unwin and Mr Negaren are not defendants in these proceedings. Nor were they defendants in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal proceedings. They have nothing to gain by participating in perjury and falsification of documents in relation to a complaint of the kind brought by the plaintiff against one of their clients. Nor is it clear why the licensee, Mr Innes, or the first and second defendants, who gave evidence they had mature-age clientele who enjoyed hearing 1970s and 1980s music, would be likely to have a policy of excluding persons in their 60s. From my observation of the plaintiff and his witnesses in the witness box, their well-dressed appearance and physical fitness meant they presented as being considerably younger than their stated ages. They did not appear to be elderly, or physical decrepit, in any way.

62The circumstances in which the plaintiff did in fact contact the Star Observer are consistent with the threat noted in the log book, repeated by Mr Unwin to Mr Innes, that the plaintiff would ""defame"" the nightclub for excluding him.

63Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that I should not accept the evidence of Mr Inwood, Mr Unwin or Mr Innes on any of the matters about which they had given evidence, on the basis that they should not be believed. However, none of these witnesses was caught out on a lie, or behaved in such a way that I should draw so serious a conclusion that their evidence and their documentation are all concocted.

64There are inconsistencies and errors in the evidence of Mr Unwin in relation to the conversation he claimed he had with the plaintiff and his friends in which he said they told him they had been playing golf and had had a few drinks with dinner. I am satisfied that this evidence is wrong and should be disregarded. I am not, however, satisfied that it is dishonest. Witnesses can, and do, make errors of recollection. 

65I am, however, satisfied that the notation Mr Unwin made in the incident log on the night in question is accurate. Even if I were to reject all of his other evidence, the notation in the incident log is contemporaneous evidence of what occurred, as are the conversations and emails about which Mr Innes gave evidence. Mr Innes is an impressive witness who gave clear and consistent evidence on all issues.

66I am satisfied that Mr Unwin was the security guard on the door in question, and that he had a conversation with the plaintiff, in the course of which he refused the plaintiff entry to the club. I am satisfied that, after some brief inquiry about drinking, he refused the plaintiff entry to the club. Precisely what was said by either the plaintiff or Mr Unwin is unclear, but I am satisfied there was some conversation, however limited, and that this included statements the plaintiff made after he was excluded.

67The next issue for determination is whether this very unclear picture of events sufficiently resembles the matter complained of for the purpose of establishing whether or not the words pleaded by the plaintiff, or words not significantly different, were spoken.

Conclusions concerning publication

68It is sufficient to prove the words were in substance what was said, and that any variance or error is immaterial unless there is a substantial difference (Lamb v West (1884) 15 LR (NSW) 120; Sinclair v Bjelke-Petersen [1984] 1 Qd R 484). ""Every case must depend upon its own circumstances, and no rule can be laid down as to what constitutes a substantial difference"": Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England [1924] 1 KB 461 at 470 per Bankes LJ. It is generally sufficient if the words ""accurately express the substance of what was said"": Jennings v Buchanan [2005] 2 NZLR 577 at [5] per Lord Bingham of Cornhill.

69McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318 - 319, in relation to claims that misleading or deceptive statements were made, noted the fallibility of memory, as opposed to a reliable contemporaneous record of what was actually said, as well as the ""relatively subtle nuances"" of actual words. Watson v Foxman, supra, was considered and explained by McColl JA in Habib v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 34 at [339], and I respectfully adopt the same precise and careful method of analysis McColl JA applied in Habib v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, supra. 

70The need for ""attention to detail"" in such cases is important: Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets (No 6) (2007) 63 ACSR 1 at [353]. In Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets (No 6), supra, McDougall J considered that it was necessary for the court to feel an ""actual persuasion"" (at [355]) that the words were spoken. 

71The principles set out by McDougall J in Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets (No 6), supra, at [353] - [355], by Young CJ in Eq in For the Good Times Pty Ltd v Coltern Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 807 at [185] and by McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman, supra, at 318-319 relate to statements made in the course of business transactions. However, I consider such principles should apply with equal, though not greater, force to slander. It would be inappropriate for there to be a higher standard of precision required for statements in business than for statements about personal reputation. The tension between freedom of speech and protection of reputation suggests that the publication of a slander should require the same level of particularity as a misleading or deceptive statement in business.

72Mr Clifford clearly did not hear what was said, and had his back to the security guard at the crucial time. Yet, according to Mr Everingham, Mr Clifford is the person who volunteered the explanation that the plaintiff had been excluded because of his age. This is an indication of the degree of reconstruction of events which occurred as the group endeavoured to absorb the upset they felt at the plaintiff being excluded from the nightclub for what they saw as no apparent reason, in circumstances where he clearly was not drunk. 

73I have rejected the evidence of Mr Kemp and found that he, like Mr Clifford, did not hear the matter complained of as they had both already headed into the nightclub entrance and had their backs turned. Mr Everingham, who did hear what was said, stated the security guard referred to drunkenness, but thought the security guard was referring to both of them.

74I am satisfied that the plaintiff was excluded from the nightclub following a brief verbal exchange with the security guard about alcohol consumption. However, that is insufficient evidence that a conversation along the lines pleaded by the plaintiff actually took place. As set out above, the evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses falls short of establishing that the matter complained of, or words not substantially different, were published. I must also have regard to the more likely version of events recorded by Mr Unwin in the incident log, and repeated to Mr Innes, and the implausibility of the claims that Mr Unwin was not the security guard who spoke the words on the night in question. I give no weight to Mr Unwin's description of the conversation in his affidavit, which contains wrong references to a conversation about golf and appears to be a reconstruction (in much the same way as the evidence of Mr Kemp), but this does not assist the plaintiff. Taking all of the evidence into account, the plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proof to establish that the matter complained of was published.

75I note that republication has not been pleaded, and that the evidence of Mr Fox (T 36) that friends reported to him they had witnessed the plaintiff being thrown out of the club because he was ""blind drunk"" was evidence of hurt to feelings only. The same applies to the grapevine publication heard by Mr McDermott. 

76In the event that I have erred in holding that the plaintiff failed to establish that the words were published, I set out my findings in relation to defamatory meaning, vicarious liability, the defences and quantum, on the basis that the plaintiff has been able to establish that the words were published. I have, however, dealt with some of the issues, an in particular capacity and quantum, in less detail than would be the case if findings in favour of the plaintiff on publication had been made. The principal difficulties for the plaintiff, if he had succeeded in relation to publication, are the vicarious liability issues in relation to the very unusual way that the plaintiff has approached the issue of vicarious liability for publication and, in relation to the defences of qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30, the problem of establishing vicarious liability for malice for each of the defendants.

Capacity and defamatory meaning

77The defendants complain that, contrary to r 14.30 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2004 (NSW) (UCPR), the imputations do not differ in substance (written submissions at [96]) and that no extrinsic facts were pleaded to identify the plaintiff (at [84]); hence the case ""fails on the pleading"". The form and capacity of the imputations formed part of the rulings made by Elkaim SC DCJ on 30 November 2011; imputations 2(a) and 5(a) were redrafted in accordance with those rulings. I do not propose to traverse these findings. 

78For a publication to be actionable, it must be ""of and concerning the plaintiff"", which means the plaintiff must be identified. I reject the submission of the defendants (written submissions, paragraphs 80 - 90) that the plaintiff was not able to be identified. He was identified by his companions. The extent of publication, and whether others knew who he was, are issues relevant to damages only.

79When determining whether imputations are conveyed, the test is that of the ordinary reasonable listener: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158. Each imputation must be considered in the context of the entire publication: Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos (2002) 54 NSWLR 165. 

80The defendants concede, in written submissions, that each of the imputations is carried by the words spoken (written submissions, paragraph 96).

81The imputation of hypocrisy (imputation 5(a)) presents difficulties, as the extrinsic facts need to reflect accurately all the material which gives rise to the imputation, not merely one fact plucked out of a series of events. An imputation of hypocrisy would clearly arise if, for example, the plaintiff was a Moslem, or a recovering alcoholic, to whom alcohol was forbidden. In the present case, the three persons identified as the recipients of the matter complained of who had this specific knowledge also knew that the plaintiff, from their own observations of him over the previous half to one and a half hours, was not drunk. 

82The question is not whether Mr Kemp in fact believed the plaintiff was drunk, but whether, on an objective test (Morgan v Odham's Press Ltd [1971] 1 WLR 1239 at 1261 per Lord Guest), the ordinary reasonable listener would consider such an imputation to be conveyed by the extrinsic facts.

83 The extrinsic facts are deficient, in that they do not take into account the other material necessary for the ordinary reasonable reader to find that this imputation would be conveyed. The defendants submit that this would include evidence of what the plaintiff was doing on the night, namely not drinking, which was a matter conceded by the plaintiff to have been known by each of the persons named as being in possession of the extrinsic facts (T 14). I am satisfied that the imputation of hypocrisy should fail for this reason, in that the ordinary reasonable listener would have needed to have this information and would, in the circumstances, not consider such an imputation to have been conveyed.

84The defendants challenge whether imputations of drunkenness would be capable of being defamatory. These submissions are misconceived. The imputations are not simply of drunkenness, but public drunkenness, and to the extent that the plaintiff should be refused entry to licensed premises. Each of imputations (a) - (c) is defamatory. So, too, would an imputation of hypocrisy be defamatory.

Vicarious liability

85The defendants have, unusually, not been sued as publishers of the matter complained of: Webb v Bloch, supra. Instead, the particulars of publication provided in the statement of claim pleaded only that the words were spoken by the security guard/doorman of the nightclub, and that the defendants were vicariously liable for the statements of this security guard/doorman, who was at all times alleged to be subject to their orders and under their control.

86The defendants brought an application challenging the capacity of imputations 4(a) and 5(a) and the adequacy of the vicarious liability pleading before the Defamation List Judge, Elkaim SC DCJ. On 30 November 2012 his Honour heard the application and made the following orders:

(1)Leave to the plaintiff to replead Particulars 4(a) and 5(a) of the Statement of claim and to replead paragraph (b) in relation to aggravated damages.

(2)The plaintiff is to file an Amended Statement of Claim giving the particulars of the basis upon which the first and second defendants are vicariously liable for the actions of the security guard.

(3)The plaintiff is to give particulars of the basis upon which the licensee is vicariously liable for the actions of the security guard unless that allegation is derived only from the third defendant's position as licensee.

(4)The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs in respect of preparation for the hearing today. In respect of the hearing today the plaintiff is to pay half the defendants' costs.

(5)The plaintiff is to file and serve the Amended Statement of Claim within 14 days.

(6)The defendants are to file and serve a Defence to the Amended Statement of Claim by 22 January 2013.7. Listed for further directions in the Defamation List on 1 February 2013.

87Although the parties thought that reasons for making of these orders were given on the day, attempts to obtain any judgment handed down have been unsuccessful. Whether or not there is a judgment, it is clear from the orders made, and the particulars provided, that the argument before his Honour proceeded upon the basis that liability of the defendants for publication should be dealt with as if this were a claim for vicarious liability in tort, rather than in accordance with the principles in Webb v Bloch which apply in relation to liability for defamation by persons other than the original publisher. This has added a great deal of unnecessary complexity to this claim.

88Consequent to these orders, in the Amended Statement of Claim filed on 20 December 2012, the plaintiff provided the following particulars:

""Particulars of Vicarious Liability

At all material times the First Defendant conducted the business the Palms and is and was the second defendant's alter ego. The Second Defendant was at all material times and from 2005 the sole director and secretary of the First Defendant. The Second Defendant has attended the Palms regularly and often during trading hours to ensure that the Nightclub staff adhere to all appropriate liquor licensing laws and regulations as well as venue policy documents. The Second Defendant has been and is very well aware of the type of patrons that attend the Palms and has made it his business to take an active part in the management of the Nightclub.

At all material times the Third Defendant was the Licensee of the Palms. It was his duty as Licensee to oversee the general operation and running of the licensed premises. He was responsible for all patrons who entered the licensed premises. He was required by the appropriate liquor licensing laws and regulations to not serve alcohol to intoxicated patrons. In order to comply with those laws the Third Defendant deployed the Fourth Defendant for the purposes of securing the Nightclub including ensuring that intoxicated persons did not enter the licensed premises. The Second and Third Defendants gave the Fourth Defendant all necessary instructions and supervision required to enable him to complete his deployment.

The Fifth Defendant was at all material times a corporation that engaged in the hiring out of security personnel for licensed premises. The Fifth Defendant contracted the fourth defendant to provide security services to the Palms.

The defendants, and each of them, are joined pursuant to s 5 of the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1946 (NSW).""

89The references to the fourth and fifth defendants should be ignored. The actions against Mr Unwin and his employer were discontinued.

90The defendants submitted that the plaintiff should be held to his pleading of vicarious liability, on the basis that this is the case they had come to meet. There are already significant difficulties for the plaintiff in relation to the need to establish malice in relation to each of the defendants (Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law and Practice (LexisNexis) at [18,045]). 

91If the plaintiff had, during the trial, sought leave (preferably before the trial) to rely upon Webb v Bloch principles instead of bringing this convoluted claim, this would have been a difficult request to refuse. However counsel for the plaintiff's response to these issues has been to underline the plaintiff's intention to rely upon vicarious liability as pleaded, rather than upon the principles enunciated in Webb v Bloch, supra, and to ask this court to apply principles of ""temporary"" employment as explained in English authorities such, as Hawley v Luminar Leisure Pty Ltd [2006] IRLR 817, Biffa Waste Services Ltd v Maschinenfabrik Ernest Hese GMBH & Ors [2008] EWCA Civ 1257 and Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd [2006] ICR 327. None of these cases has been considered, let alone followed, in Australia (which is ""out of step with overseas developments such as those in the European Union"", according to Macken's Law of Employment, 7th ed., 2011, at p. 92).

92Unlike the much simpler Webb v Bloch test for liability in defamation, vicarious liability in tort operates as a doctrine of strict liability imposed on a defendant irrespective of personal faultlessness, or in addition to personal liability, arising where one person is held liable for the wrongful act or omission of another by virtue of the special relationship between the parties: Darling Island Stevedoring & Lighterage Co Ltd v Long (1957) 97 CLR 36 at 57 per Fullagar J.

93Issues of vicarious liability most commonly arise where a tort is committed by an employee in the course of employment. The law distinguishes between employees and independent contractors, in that an employer is not vicariously liable for acts done in the course of employment where the worker is an independent contractor: Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 21 at 32. While the question of whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor is a question of law depending on the circumstances of the case, including control (see Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd, supra, at 43-45), no submission could be, or was, put that the security guard who published the matter complained of was the employee of any of the defendants. 

94This is very different to the principles generally applied where a person other than the original publisher is asserted to be liable for the defamatory publication. The often-cited principles explained by Isaacs J in Webb v Bloch, supra, at 364 are:

""In Parkes v. Prescott Giffard Q.C. quotes from the second edition of Starkie: ""All who are in any degree accessory to the publication of a libel, and by any means whatever conduce to the publication, are to be considered as principals in the act of publication: thus if one suggest illegal matter in order that another may write or print it, and that a third may publish it, all are equally amenable for the act of publication when it has been so effected."" In R. v. Paine it is held: ""If one repeat and another write a libel, and a third approve what is wrote, they are all makers of it; for all persons who concur, and show their assent or approbation to do an unlawful act, are guilty: so that murdering a man's reputation by a scandalous libel may be compared to murdering his person; for if several are assisting and encouraging a man in the act, though the stroke was given by one, yet all are guilty of homicide."" A little later, in R. v. Drake, that law was reaffirmed. In The Queen v. Cooper Lord Denman C.J. said: ""If a man request another generally to write a libel, he must be answerable for any libel written in pursuance of his request: he contributes to a misdemeanour and is therefore responsible as a principal."" In that case the defendant was indicted for ""publishing and causing to be published"" the libel in question. The judgments show that all the defendant did was to authorize the publication of the libel, in law that he published it."" (citations omitted)

95On these principles, all persons who participate in the publication may be jointly and severally liable for the whole damage suffered by the plaintiff; liability extends to any person who participated in, secured or authorised the publication. The concept of publication is a broad one. In R v Gutch (1829) Mood & M 432 Lord Tenterden CJ explained at 437-438:

""... A person who derives profit from, and who furnishes means for carrying on the concern, and entrusts the conduct of the publication to one whom he selects, and in whom he confides, may be said to cause to be published what actually appears, and ought to be answerable, although you cannot shew that he was individually concerned in the particular publication.""

96An example may be seen in Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Producers & Citizens Co-operative Assurance Co of Australia Ltd (1931) 46 CLR 41. Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd employed an agent to canvass for business on its behalf. While canvassing for business, the agent slandered the plaintiff. The company denied liability, relying upon a term of the agreement that the agent would not cast any aspersions upon any person or institution which could bring that person or institution into disrepute or discredit. The High Court rejected the defence stating that:

""we apprehend that one is liable for another's tortious act ""if he expressly directs him to do it or if he employs that other person as his agent and the act complained of is within the scope of the agent's authority."" It is not necessary that the particular act should have been authorised; it is enough that the agent should have been put in a position to do the class of acts complained of - Barwick v English Joint Stock Bank, LR 2 Ex 259; Lloyd v Grace, Smith and Co., (1912) AC at p 733. And if an unlawful act done by an agent be within the scope of his authority, it is immaterial that the principal directed the agent not to do it.""

97However, the plaintiff in these proceedings has expressly excluded any reliance upon liability for publication on Webb v Bloch principles. Instead, the plaintiff argues that Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd [1947] AC 1 and Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd, supra, are no longer the law. It is submitted that the control test has been adapted by the English courts in Hawley v Luminar Leisure Pty Ltd, supra, Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd, supra, and Biffa Waste Services Ltd v Maschinenfabrik Ernest Hese GMBH & Ors, supra. These authorities deal with problems of divided control, where the host business (in this case, the licensed premises) will be vicariously liable for the torts of the agency providing the security services. In particular, Ms Evans drew my attention to the discussion, in Viasystems, of Brennan J's analysis of dual control in vicarious liability in Oceanic Crest Shipping Co v Pilbara Harbour Services Pty Ltd (1986) 150 CLR 626 at [32]. 

98Ms Evans also referred me to Macken's Law of Employment (7th ed., 2011), pages 86 - 92, and to the discussion of the principles in Deutz Pty Ltd v Skilled Engineering [2001] VSC 194, where Ashley J set out a series of principles relating to the circumstances in which liability will be shifted from the general employer (in the present case, the security company) to the temporary employer (in the present case, the company running the licensed premises). This authority is of little assistance, since Ashley J states (at [109] - [112]) that only in exceptional circumstances will this occur.

99This is not the law in Australia in relation to intentional torts. The legal principles for vicarious liability in relation to an employer where there is an intentional tort on licensed premises have been explained in Zorom Enterprises v Zabow & Ors [2007] 71 NSWLR 354. The plaintiff's action against the licensee and occupier of the hotel failed, as in so many other cases involving security staff, on the issue of control: see also Portelli v Tabriska Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 17 at [69]. A hotelier or licensee may owe a duty of care to take steps to protect or prevent injury or a wrong to a parton as a matter of general principle, but it will depend on the particular circumstances of the case whether that duty can be found to exist, and whether it had been breached. In the present case, while the defendants owed a duty to take reasonable care to prevent injury to the plaintiff from for example, the drunken or violent conduct of other patrons, by reason of the statutory power designed to prevent entry and remove persons from the licensed premises using reasonable force (Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarek (2009) 239 CLR 420 at [26]), did they owe him a duty to do so in such a way as to prevent him from being defamed by the security staff at the same time? Ms Evans' suggestions that the security guard should have been more diplomatic and said ""I think you may be drunk"", or spoken to him in a quiet voice so that others could not know that he was being ejected from the nightclub, do not fall within the duty to exercise reasonable care in the performance of statutory responsibilities. 

100Where a security firm is contracted to provide security services to give effect to obligations of the licensee and nightclub manager, and the guard employed by that company neglects his duties, it is the responsibility of the guard's employer, not the defendants, for the reasons explained in Perkins v Redmond Co Pty Ltd (2007) 5 DCLR (NSW) 21 at [143], unless there is a complete delegation. Where, however, the security company is retained to perform specific services, its duty is not enlarged beyond the prudent performance of those services: Quintano v B W Rose Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 446.

Evidence concerning control of the security staff

101The evidence of the nature of the relationship between the defendants and the security company is largely unchallenged. Mr Unwin gave evidence that he was not employed by any of the first to third defendants. He and the other security guard who was stationed at the Palms on Oxford nightclub were employees of ADCAS Pty Ltd (T 186 and 335). ADCAS Pty Ltd contracted with the first defendant to provide security services to the Palms on Oxford nightclub. 

102All matters relating to the selection, training and employment of the security guards were matters for ADCAS Pty Ltd. This included:

(a)The first defendant contracted with ADCAS Pty Ltd for the provision of security guards, but did not interview them, provide them with training, or decide which security guard should be rostered at any given time. In fact, the first defendant expected the security guard to be fully qualified and trained by ADCAS Pty Ltd (T 336-337).

(b)ADCAS Pty Ltd made all arrangements in relation to providing security guards to be rostered at any given time in response to receiving a request for one (T 186).

(c)The first defendant was not given advance notice of which security guard would be rostered at any given time (T 336) and security guards would be transferred to another site without any prior warning or consultation with the first defendant, as happened with ""Harry"".

(d)Neither the first nor second defendants interacted with the security guard in relation to their duties. Mr Unwin gave evidence that his boss, Mr Negaren, who was the manager at ADCAS Pty Ltd, was the person he went to if there were any issues in relation to his employment (T 186-187).

(e)The third defendant's role was to remind the doorman of their obligation under the Palms on Oxford policy but otherwise played no role in their supervision (T 186).

103The unchallenged evidence points to the security guards being professional independent contractors engaged by a different company that was unrelated to any of the existing defendants. As previously noted, Mr Unwin and the company which employed him are not parties to these proceedings.

104Counsel for the plaintiff placed great weight on the fact that the security guard was required to exclude persons wearing open-toed shoes. However, this requirement would not give control of the security guard's activities to the defendants; it was simply nightclub policy. Counsel for the plaintiff also referred to the participation of the night club in compulsory precinct meetings for licensed premises in Oxford Street. However, attendance at those meetings, and participation in those activities was part of the nightclub's statutory obligations in relation to supervision of its activities, and gave it no extra control over its security staff.

105Counsel for the plaintiff did not cross-examine Mr Unwin about any special reasons for his having been a security guard at the same venue for so many years. What little evidence I have on this issue appears to be that the choice of where to work is a matter for ADCAS Pty Ltd and its employees. The evidence of Mr Innes and Mr Inwood was that they had no say in this matter. 

106None of the factors indicating employment as listed by the AIRC Full Bench in Staff Aid Services v Bianchi (2004) 133 IR 29 at [27] can be made out on the facts in this case. The ""quite exceptional circumstances"" required, even under the English decisions (Hawley v Luminar Leisure Pty Ltd, supra, at [14]), cannot be made out. In Hawley v Luminar Leisure Pty Ltd, supra, the licensed premises played an active role in the security guard's training and supervision, and had the right of dismissal in certain circumstances. That is not the case here. On the facts as pleaded, the principles enunciated in Hawley v Luminar Leisure Pty Ltd, supra, cannot be made out.

A servant of two masters?

107The security guard, whoever he may have been, was the employee of ADCAS Pty Ltd. I should briefly note some additional issues about the plaintiff's submission that the security guard could be regarded as the employee of the nightclub at the same time.

108Contrary to what was submitted, Hawley v Luminar Leisure Pty Ltd, supra, does not assist the plaintiff, as the court held that the nightclub, not the security company, had assumed the employer position, not that both the nightclub and the security company were liable (at [82]). Unlike other jurisdictions such as Canada (Teskey v Toronto Transit Commission (2003) OJ No. 4545), in Australia, the concept of an employee being the servant of two masters has never been recognised: Costello v Allstaff Industrial personnel (SA) and Bridgestone TG Australia [2004] AIRComm 13 at [25]; the highest it has come is not to be struck out as unarguable: Fair Work Ombudsman v Eastern Colour Pty Ltd [2011] FCA 803 per Collier J at [72], [78]. The concept of joint employment has similarly been rejected in the United Kingdom: Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd, supra.

109I invited both parties to consider Orcher v Bowcliff Pty Ltd (No 4) [2011] NSWSC 862, where Harrison J granted leave to add the licensee of a hotel as a defendant, noting statements in Fleming's The Law of Torts, 10th ed (2011) at 449 that ""[r]ecent jurisprudence indicates a shift in the view that liability can only be allocated to one employer"". In Orcher v Bowcliff Pty Ltd, supra, the plaintiff was assaulted by a drunk hotel employee in an ""entirely foreseeable"" accident; the case turns on its facts and it is of no assistance on this issue. Harrison J granted leave to join the licensee on a General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125 basis. However, the issue did not arise at trial: Orcher v Bowcliff Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1088. This is as far as any consideration of these principles has gone in New South Wales.

110The question is not whether Mr Unwin is a modern-day Truffaldino, but whether the modern Australian test of employment - a multi-factor test, where control is only one of a number of relevant indicia - can be satisfied on the facts of the case in order to identify who that employer may be: Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd, supra, at [43] - [45]; Staff Aid Services v Bianchi, supra, at [27]. That test cannot be satisfied on the facts in this case.

111In the event that I have erred in this finding, I set out my findings in relation to the defences pleaded. I have included the additional imputation of hypocrisy in these findings.

The defences

112The defences are common law and s 30 statutory qualified privilege, honest opinion, triviality (s 33) and offer of amends (s 18).

Common law qualified privilege

113The court must determine the following issues in relation to the defence of common law qualified privilege:

(a)Whether the publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege;

(b)Whether the defamatory matter was relevant to that occasion; and,

(c)Whether by reason of the presence of malice the privileged occasion is lost.

An occasion of qualified privilege?

114Where a person has an interest or a duty, whether legal, social or moral, to make a statement on an occasion and the recipients have a corresponding interest or duty to receive it, such a publication will be made on a protected occasion: Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 334 per Lord Atkinson; Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 366 at [9]-[10]. The principles governing qualified privilege are broad; as Gummow J explained in Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd, supra, at [139], citing Dixon J in Guise v Kouvelis (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 419, when explaining that it was a question of fact and degree in each case, noted:

""[T]he very width of the principles governing qualified privilege for defamation makes it more necessary, in deciding how they apply, to make a close scrutiny of the circumstances of the case, of the situation of the parties, of the relations of all concerned and of the events leading up to and surrounding the publication.""

115This ""close scrutiny"" requires a careful consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the publication. By reason of my findings of fact, I have made findings in relation to each of a series of fact situations, including the fact situation put forward by the plaintiff and the fact situation put forward by the defendants.

116The principles upon which a defendant must establish that the publisher and the recipient had a common interest arising out of the same set of circumstances were explained by the High Court in Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon (2011) 243 CLR 298 at 305-307. These are summarised by counsel for the defendants as follows:

(a)The defence of qualified privilege is based on notions of public policy;

(b)It is incumbent on the defendant to establish that he/she had a duty to convey the information; and,

(c)Whether a duty exists depends on the relative positions of the publisher and recipient, the nature and importance of the matters conveyed, and the relationship of the defamatory statements to these matters.

117The principles have recently been considered by the High Court in Papaconstantinos v Holmes a Court (2012) 293 ALR 215 (in relation to statements which are volunteered) and by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna [2013] NSWCA 30 at [75]-[97] per Beazley JA.

118In particular, strict reciprocity is not essential and incidental publication may be protected: Gatley on Libel and Slander, 11th ed., [14.66] and [14.73]; Haddon v Forsyth [2011] NSWSC 123 at [314]. The general test is whether the publication goes beyond the exigencies of the occasion.

119The facts of the present case are a clear example of an occasion when the duty owed is not simply moral or social, but legal. These are licensed premises (Exhibit 6), and the licensee is required to comply with provisions of the Liquor Act 2007 (NSW). This includes the requirement, under s 73, of prevention of excessive consumption of alcohol in licensed premises, not to supply alcohol to intoxicated persons, and refuse entry to an intoxicated person. In addition, there are obligations to refuse entry to any person who is quarrelsome or disorderly, and not simply intoxicated (s 77 Liquor Act). This requires the services of a licensed security guard with appropriate training to form an impression based on the appearance of the patron as he/she presents himself or herself for entry into the club (T 188, 338).

120Essentially the licensed security guard was hired for the purpose not simply of allowing people to enter the premises, but to ensure that the entry of those persons into the premises was in compliance with these statutory requirements. The potential for injury, accident, medical emergency or other potential problems arising from an intoxicated, quarrelsome or disorderly person coming onto licensed premises requires proactive regulation of the entry into licensed premises, and an essential part of that regulation requires the refusal of entry to persons known or suspected to be such persons. In other words, licensed security guards are not hired to let people in, but, where appropriate, to keep people out. Although he is called a ""doorman"" in the statement of claim, his job is not simply to open the door.

121The plaintiff submitted that the occasion could not be privileged (or alternatively that the privilege was lost), because there was ""excessive publication"" (Gatley on Libel and Slander, 11th ed., [14.66]). Publication must be proportionate to the occasion, but the fact that there is some incidental publication (for example, to other persons in the queue, or in the immediate vicinity of the plaintiff in the street) should be permitted as otherwise society and its business could not be conducted.

122As it happens, I am satisfied that the other persons in the queue, entering the nightclub or in the street nearby all had an interest in receiving information that a person within reasonably close physical proximity was being excluded from a night club. The security guard had a duty to these persons to warn of his actions in case there were any consequences.

123Excessive publication offers only limited protection; for example in Bezant v Rausing [2007] EWHC 1118, a claim was brought where the claimant's daughter opened the letter. Gatley on Libel and Slander notes at [14.66] that ""the minimal nature of the publication and the unlikelihood of damage meant that the claim was an abuse of process"" and the claim was summarily dismissed on this basis. Gatley on Libel and Slander goes on to note that many of the older authorities on excessive publication would be summarily dismissed in this fashion. However, these principles have been rejected in New South Wales (Ehiozee v EDO Nigerian Association of NSW Ltd [2013] NSWSC 239; Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 at [41] per Basten JA; Barach v University of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 431), which may explain the large number of defamation claims in Australia for publication to one or to a handful of persons.

Relevance to the occasion

124A defendant must establish that the communication was relevant to the occasion of qualified privilege: Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135 at 151 per Diplock LJ. The defence will fail if the defamatory matter exceeded what was reasonably incidental to the legitimate purpose of the occasion: Papaconstantinos v Holmes a Court, supra, at [75]; Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd, supra, at [27]. There must be sufficient connection to the privileged occasion to attract the defence. Anything not relevant to the discharge of the duty will not be protected: Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna, supra, at [98].

125The matter complained of, and the imputations asserted to arise therefrom, were relevant to the occasion, namely the reason why the plaintiff was refused entry to the Palms on Oxford nightclub.

126The basis upon which relevance is challenged is that the matter complained of is alleged to have been published by the security guard in a loud voice, enabling as many as 70 or more persons to hear what was said, and in an aggressive tone.

127Imputations of public drunkenness and unfitness to be admitted to licensed premises are matters which are relevant to other persons seeking entry to the nightclub or passers-by within the immediate vicinity. The fact that these words were spoken in a loud and aggressive manner do not detract from this relevance. Such a tone of voice and manner may, in the circumstances, have been appropriate. This could well have been the case if the plaintiff had been drunk as alleged.

128I note my findings in relation to publication that I am satisfied that the security guard was Mr Unwin and that he did not speak in a loud or aggressive tone of voice. However, whoever the security guard was on the night in question, the fact-finding result would be the same. On the case as pleaded by the plaintiff, a security guard who spoke the words in the matter complained of in the manner asserted by the plaintiff would still be complying with the Liquor Act, in that there could be circumstances in which it may be appropriate to speak to an intoxicated, quarrelsome or disorderly person in this fashion.

129I am satisfied that the communication was relevant to the occasion of qualified privilege. The issue of malice, which may defeat this defence if the plaintiff can establish it, is set out in more detail below.

Statutory qualified privilege

130The statutory defence of qualified privilege (s 30) requires there to be an interest or an apparent interest in receiving the information. In the present case, not only did the plaintiff have such an interest, as well as his friends, but so did those persons who were in the immediate vicinity.

131I shall deal with each of the matters in the s 30 checklist as follows:

(a)Sections 30(3)(a) and (b) - given the concerns about public drunkenness and the need for other persons in the immediate vicinity to know that a person was being excluded from licensed premises for such a reason, I consider the matter to be one of public interest and one performed by the security guard in the course of his activities under the Liquor Act.

(b)Section 30(3)(c): The seriousness of any defamatory imputations - these imputations are low in seriousness compared with other defamatory imputations.

(c)Section 30(3)(d): The extent to which the matter published distinguishes between suspicion, allegations and proven facts - I must take into account the difficulties under which Mr Unwin was operating, namely that he had a matter of seconds or at most minutes in which to determine whether to admit the plaintiff. The defendants should succeed on this particular.

(d)Sections 30(3)(e) and (f) - there could be few better examples of a publication needing to be made expeditiously, and in the business environment in which the defendants operate, than a statement by a security guard in relation to the drunkenness of a person attempting to enter licensed premises. The defendants make out these particulars.

(e)Section 30(3)(g), the source of the information - this was based upon Mr Unwin's own observation. He had been trained in order to observe the signs of alcohol consumption and he was relying upon that training. I consider the defendants here established this item in the checklist.

(f)Sections 30(3)(h) and (i) - the failure of the plaintiff to verify the information or to consult the plaintiff is the key issue in relation to this defence. However, in LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah [2011] NSWCA 370, Bergin CJ in Eq considered that the making of an enquiry afterwards was sufficient. In situations of emergency, such as an enquiry by a police officer or a security guard, this must be correct.

(g)Section 30(3)(j), any other circumstances the court considers relevant - I consider that the context of the situation is of great significance. This was a security guard who was performing a job which required him in effect to make decisions which required him to act quickly and without the luxury of proper enquiry.

132For the reasons set out above, I accept the submission of the defendants that they are able to make out each item in the s 30 checklist.

133The security guard had to form an impression of the plaintiff based on his appearance and his behaviour, doing the best he could, if he took the view that entry must be refused (T 337-338). Mr Unwin, for example, clearly formed a view about the plaintiff on the night in question based on their exchange of conversation. It is irrelevant that he was mistaken. Mr Kemp apparently also formed the view that the plaintiff was drunk, even though he had been with the plaintiff since 11:00pm (T 13 line 50; T 316 line 18).

134It was reasonable not only to inform the plaintiff and his friends but it was reasonable that persons in the immediate vicinity, including those in the queue and on the street or roadway within a reasonable radius, should be warned that this event had occurred. Although Mr Kemp's evidence was that he saw security guards refusing entry to persons at least once a night when he was in Oxford Street (a place he frequented five nights a week) that does not undercut the seriousness of the potential damage their behaviour could do to passers-by, particularly if the persons excluded from entry were angry and/or sought to confront the security guard or other persons in the immediate vicinity.

135I also note that the security guards contracted by ADCAS Pty Ltd were qualified and experienced security guards (Exhibit 4; T 337). Mr Unwin was a trained security guard with many years of experience.

136As with common law qualified privilege, malice plays a role in this defence, although the degree to which it is of significance is uncertain. This is discussed in more detail below.

Honest opinion - section 31

137Section 31 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) essentially reproduces the common law defence of fair comment (Fraser v Holmes [2009] NSWCA 36 at [74]). The comment provisions in the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) suffered from the problem that the defence had to be pleaded to the imputations, rather than to the matter complained of. 

138A s 31 defence requires consideration of the imputation in the context of the matter complained of to determine whether the allegations made of and concerning the plaintiff are statements of fact or opinion. The difference between fact and opinion has been explained by Giles JA in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v O'Shane [2004] NSWCA 164 at [25]; it must be seen as a ""deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, remark or observation"" (Lloyd-Jones v Allen [2012] NSWCA 230 at [43] per Nicholas AJA). It would be an oversimplification to regard the statement as being merely opinion: Trad v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 61; Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna, supra, at [361].

139However, s 31 has been even more unsuccessful than its predecessor under the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). It has yet to succeed in any action where it is pleaded. In Lloyd-Jones v Allen, supra, at [43] Nicholas AJA approved its dismissal by the trial judge in the briefest of terms. The difficulty is that even imputations that a plaintiff is a bully or a coward (Bennette v Cohen [2009] NSWCA 60) have been interpreted as comment.

140In Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna, supra, however, an imputation of hypocrisy in the cross-claim was determined to be comment (at [351] - [371]). That is the true innuendo imputation pleaded in these proceedings.

141Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna, supra, does not refer to Bennette v Cohen, supra. It is not easy to reconcile decisions of the Court of Appeal that imputations of being a coward or a bully are fact, while an imputation of being a hypocrite is a statement amounting to comment.

142Conformably with Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna, supra, I am satisfied that the imputation of being a hypocrite, if such an imputation were capable of being conveyed (contrary to my findings) would be capable of amounting to comment.

143However, imputations (a) - (c), when viewed in the context of the matter complained of, which relate to the plaintiff being excessively drunk, are incapable of amounting to an opinion. Statements to the effect that a person is drunk, or excessively drunk, are statements of fact. 

144I should briefly note whether, in relation to the true innuendo pleaded, the material is proper material for comment (Sims v Wran [1984] 1 NSWLR 317 at 322). ""Proper material"" is defined under s 31 as being substantially true, or published on an occasion of qualified privilege. 

145The role of the security guard at the nightclub front door was to exclude persons whose inebriation level could pose a danger to themselves, or to others, or to the venue. It required making a snap decision on very little information; just the appearance of a patron, or a few words in response to a question, might be sufficient basis for forming such an opinion. The risk of error was high, but so was the risk of failing to exclude a patron whose inebriation level resulted in personal injury, damage or worse. I am satisfied that any imputation of hypocrisy was based on material which was proper material for comment.

146The remaining element of the defence, that the opinion must related to a matter of public interest, is clearly established, for the reasons explained by McColl JA in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Hitchcock (2007) 70 NSWLR 484 at [123] - [180]. Governmental, media, medical and community groups' discussions about issues of public drunkenness have been, as the plaintiff noted in his evidence, matters of public interest for some years.

147I would be satisfied that the defence of comment succeeds for the imputation asserted to arise by way of innuendo, but I reject the defence in relation to imputations (a) - (c).

148In relation to malice, I repeat the observations I have made concerning my findings as to the qualified privilege defences as set out below.

Malice

149The particulars of malice provided in the Reply are as follows:

(a) It was obvious to the doorman/security officer of ""Palms on Oxford"" that the Plaintiff was sober.

(b) Failure of the doorman/security officer to make proper or any enquiries and to ascertain by inspection at close quarters the sobriety or otherwise of the Plaintiff.

(c) Cover up by the Defendants in falsely representing that the Fourth Defendant was the doorman/security officer at the relevant time.

(d) Failure of the Defendants to disclose the name and address of the relevant doorman/security officer because of fear he would admit he was wrong in refusing admittance to the Plaintiff.

(e) Discrimination against the Plaintiff by the Defendants on the grounds of his physical appearance.

(f) Wrongfully false allegations made against the Plaintiff in the Defence that the Plaintiff was red faced, loud, agitated and quarrelsome and thereby not eligible to be admitted to the ""Palms on Oxford"".

(g) Insulting offer of amends.

(h) Wrongful attempts of the Defendants to escape liability because of a false claim they were not vicariously liable for the conduct of the doorman/ security guard.

(i) False statement in the Defence that it is not defamatory to allege that a teetotaller is drunk.""

150These particulars fall into the following categories:

(a)Particular (a) has been abandoned;

(b)Particular (b) relates to the failure of Mr Unwin to make ""proper or any enquiry"" before publishing the matter complained of;

(c)Particulars (c), (d) and (h) relate to what is called the ""cover-up"" namely the claim that the defendants have, by false representations and ""wrongful"" behaviour, sought to lie or otherwise withhold information from the court in these proceedings;

(d)Particular (e) is an allegation of discrimination against the plaintiff by each of the defendants on the grounds of his physical appearance; and,

(e)Particulars (f), (g), (h) and (i) relate to the conduct of this litigation.

151Malice in relation to qualified privilege functions as follows, in relation to each of the defences:

(a)If proved (and the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff: Dillon v Cush; Dillon v Boland [2010] NSWCA 165), the common law qualified privilege defence is defeated; 

(b)Malice will also be defeated if the plaintiff can prove that the publication of the matter complained of was actuated by malice: s 30(4); and,

(c)If proved, malice will also defeat a defence of honest opinion.

152The relevant principles in relation to malice are discussed and explained by the High Court in Roberts v Bass (2002) 212 CLR 1 and in Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon, supra at [29] and [109]. Statements made by mistake, out of ignorance, due to carelessness or stupidity or even in circumstances amounting to recklessness will not destroy an occasion of qualified privilege: Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna, supra, at [288] - [289].

153The plaintiff's version of events was that he was singled out without warning by the security guard who simply spoke the words in the matter complained of ""out of the blue"". I have rejected that evidence, but even if the evidence given by the plaintiff was believed in its entirety, this would make no difference in my findings in relation to malice, for the reasons set out in more detail below.

Particular (b)

154Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the failure of Mr Unwin to smell the plaintiff's breath, or attempt to do so, amounted to a failure to make ""proper or any enquiry"". In addition, it was submitted that he should have spoken to the plaintiff in a more conciliatory nature, such as by saying ""I think you may be drunk"", which may have elicited a more informative response.

155Mr Unwin gave evidence about the need to make decisions in a very short timeframe in circumstances where he had very little information to go on. He was trained to ascertain whether a person was drinking or not, and he was not cross-examined about any breaches of the protocols or skills he learned from the courses he had undertaken (apart from the suggestion that he should have smelled the plaintiff's breath, the provenance of which was never explained). Mr Unwin described some of the risks that a security guard would face when confronted by three men, one of whom he propose to exclude from entry into a nightclub. I am satisfied that he made proper enquiries.

The cover-up - Particulars (c), (d) and (h)

156As indicated elsewhere in this judgment, I find the submission that the defendants have instituted a plan to exclude older members of the community from their nightclub, forged a security log entry and employment records, and procured false testimony from Mr Unwin to the effect that he was the security guard on the night, when it was someone else (by inference, a person not in the conspiracy) to be implausible.

Particular (e)

157The Reply does not state in express terms that the plaintiff was excluded because of his age. Particular (e) refers to the plaintiff's ""physical appearance"" but what aspect of his ""physical appearance"" that may be was never made clear. There was reference to the plaintiff as being conservatively dressed, but that the plaintiff told the court he was wearing jeans. As indicated elsewhere, the plaintiff presented as a fit and healthy man who looked younger than his stated age.

158Whatever else the security guard said, he did not say that the plaintiff was too old. The claim that the plaintiff was excluded for age reasons was the explanation proposed to the group by Mr Clifford, according to Mr Everingham (T 433):

""A. I think it was Adam that said, ""You're too old,"" and that started to make sense. That seemed an obvious suggestion. I come from a community that's - it's a gay community. We've been discriminated against all our lives.""

159Mr Clifford simply leapt to a conclusion that the plaintiff was too old. He did not see or hear the events which led to the plaintiff being excluded. He was told about them by Mr Everingham, but all he knew was that the plaintiff was being excluded because the security guard said the plaintiff was drunk. Nothing was said about the plaintiff's appearance at any time.

160There is no evidence of there being any intention of the security guard, let alone the defendants, to exclude persons on the basis of their appearance. Although Ms Evans led evidence of Mr Kemp never having to wait in line to attend Oxford Street venues because he was young and handsome, that does not mean the reverse is the case. This particular is not made out.

Conduct of the litigation - Particulars (f), (g), (h) and (i)

161While conduct on the part of a defendant subsequent to the publication may provide evidence of an improper motive, it is an inference the courts are reluctant to draw: Tobin & Sexton at [18,040].

162As is set out in more detail elsewhere in this judgment, the defendants have been successful in the defence of offer of amends and in their arguments concerning vicarious liability. Particulars (g) and (h) are not made out. I have accepted in general the evidence of Mr Unwin in relation to the circumstances in which he refused the plaintiff admittance to the Palms on Oxford, but even if I had not, he was entitled to give evidence to this effect. The circumstances in which the mere giving of evidence which is not accepted by the court would amount to evidence of malice would have to be exceptional. Counsel for the plaintiff could not direct me to any authority where such a finding had been made.

163However, there is a more fundamental reason why a plea of malice must fail, and that is that the malice must be the malice of the defendants, in circumstances where a defendant is shown to be a servant or agent: Tobin & Sexton at [18,045]. In addition, although the law on this issue is unsettled, in my view, it is the better view that each of the defendants must individually be shown to be malicious. This brings me to a consideration of the problem of vicarious liability for malice in relation to a statement by a person other than the defendant.

Vicarious responsibility for the malice of a servant or agent

164Mr Unwin is not a servant of any of the defendants. In addition, the first defendant is a corporation. In Waterhouse v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 58 at 72 per Hunt J and in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327 at [113]-[127] per Callinan J, the limited circumstances in which a corporate publisher may be liable for the knowledge of its employees are set out and explained. 

165Where the publication has been made by a person who is not an employee, but who is argued to be an agent, real difficulty arises. Ms Chrysanthou relied upon Hay v Australasian Institute of Marine Engineers (1906) 3 CLR 1002 at 1011-1016. The plaintiff in those proceedings had brought a claim against an organisation in relation to defamatory material handed around at a conference by the organisation secretary who, it was alleged, was motivated by a desire to injure the plaintiff, which would defeat a defence of qualified privilege. Griffith CJ, with whom Barton J agreed, said that:

""The rule as to imputing the knowledge of a servant to the master is a rule of common sense. If I employ a man to receive information for me, and information is given to him, the knowledge of my servant may properly be imputed to me. And if I employ a man to act at his discretion as my servant, and he acts within the scope of his authority, I am properly held responsible for what he does, and if he does a wrongful act I am responsible for the consequences. But if I tell him to do a lawful act, and he afterwards on his own account does the act with a wicked motive, that does not make it unlawful in me. A lawful act does not become unlawful because it is done with an unlawful motive. You cannot impute the knowledge of a servant to his master in a matter in which the knowledge has not been communicated to the servant for the purpose of being transmitted to the master. The words of Vaughan-Williams, LJ, in Re Hampshire Land Co, (1896) 2 Ch , at p 749, seem to me applicable in principle to the present case, in regard to the suggestion that officers ought to be taken to have communicated knowledge received by them to their employers. After referring to two cases that had been cited, he said -

The test applied by the court was this - First, was it within the scope of the duty of the officer to give notice to the other Company of the information he had got; and, secondly, was it within the scope of his duty, as the officer of the Company sought to be affected by notice, to receive such notice?

I think that exactly the same principle applies to the suggestion that the knowledge of Corby, the secretary, was the knowledge of the trade union of which he had become the servant, and that on that account the contention entirely fails. The other two persons by whom the statement was published were in the same position as Corby, and the same arguments apply to them.""

166O'Connor J concurred:

""... it is said that the occasion has been misused because Corby had knowledge that the resolutions contained an untrue statement about the plaintiff. I do not think it necessary to refer to the cases cited by Mr Ferguson or to follow in detail the able argument, in which he endeavoured to show that Corby's knowledge, whatever it was, in regard to the affairs of the Institute, particularly in regard to the documents in his possession after the registration, was to be imputed to the corporation. I assume for the purpose of this judgment that the corporation had a knowledge of everything in the documents which Corby had officially in his possession, and that they had knowledge of everything which he knew as official manager of the corporation. Even under those circumstances there was no evidence whatever that the corporation in publishing this report in any way misused the occasion.""

Malice and joint tortfeasors

167While the malice of a servant or agent may be vicariously attributed to an employer or principal, what is the situation where a defamatory publication is made by more than one person, such as members of a committee or joint or concurrent tortfeasors where some, but not all, may be argued to be malicious? Tobin & Sexton at [18,065] note this as being ""still not authoritatively resolved in Australia so far as this issue is concerned"". Essentially the question is whether the plaintiff must establish that each of the three defendants is malicious, or whether the malice of one will be sufficient to establish the malice of all. This is further complicated by the fact that this was not a situation (such as Egger v Viscount Chelmsford [1965] 1 QB 248), where the persons in question were members of the same committee. Each of the three defendants performed a different function in relation to the conduct of the Palms on Oxford nightclub.

168The conclusion that the malice of one defendant may be imputed to one or more co-defendants was first expressed in Smith v Streatfeild [1913] 3 KB 764, where the malice of the author of a pamphlet was imputed to the printers, even though the printers were otherwise completely innocent for any malicious intent. In Brown on Defamation, 2nd ed. (Carswell), Professor Brown notes at [16.5] that this decision ""foretold disastrous consequences"" for publishers, and was subject to severe criticism by writers (such as Fleming's The Law of Torts, 8th ed, 1992 at p 580), Law Reform Commissions (such as the Faulks Committee (Recommendation 276)) and eventually overruled in Egger v Viscount Chelmsford, supra, in relation to qualified privilege. Egger v Viscount Chelmsford, supra, was referred to in Cornwall v Rowan (2004) 90 SASR 269 at 373 (at [450]) and in Bass v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (2003) 60 NSWLR 251 at [77], where the court said that:

""there is no doctrine of transferred malice in the law of defamation apart from the ordinary principles of vicarious liability: Dougherty v Chandler (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 370; Egger v Viscount Chelmsford [1965] 1 QB 248 CA.""

169In New Zealand, McLeod v Jones [1977] 1 NZLR 441 at 444, White J arrived at a similar conclusion.

170However, in Roberts v Bass, supra, Callinan J appeared to embrace the view expressed in Smith v Streatfeild, supra, at [117] and [126]. Kirby J nevertheless expressly approved the view in Egger v Viscount Chelmsford, supra, stating that ""each person's malice must be judged individually"" (at [182]). Their Honour's views remain in conflict.

171The difficulty is that in Webb v Bloch, supra, the decision of Smith v Streatfeild, supra, was accepted by the High Court as correct (at 363) although, as Tobin & Sexton note (at [18,060]), this acceptance was not necessary to the ratio of that case.

172Smith v Streatfeild, supra, was distinguished by Slade J in Longdon-Griffiths v Smith [1951] 1 KB 295, a decision described as a ""tottering authority"" by Jordon CJ in Dougherty v Chandler (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 370 at 375-376 as follows:

""Where several defendants are charged with joint defamation, and express malice is established against one only, it has been said that the express malice of the one is fatal to the success of a plea of privileged occasion of fair comment by all or any ... This may be true enough where the others are, on general principles, vicariously liable for the acts of the one ... But, except in this class of case, I think, with all respect, that, as a matter of principle, where, to defeat a plea of several defendants sued jointly, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove express malice, he must fail as against any defendant to whom he is unable to sheet home express malice.""

173These authorities were all recently considered in LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah, supra, where Bergin CJ in Eq at [66] stated:

""[66] The Respondents' submissions included the contention that where there is a joint publication or publication by joint tortfeasors then the malice of one or some infects the others so that all are liable. In this regard the Respondents relied on Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331 and submitted that if the employees of the Shop were malicious, the police officers who took part in the publication are deemed to have been infected by their malice and would lose the defence of qualified privilege [OB 61-64]. The Appellant and the Police questioned the correctness of this proposition and in doing so relied upon Egger v Viscount Chelmsford [1965] 1 QB 248 which overruled the case of Smith v Streatfeild [1913] 3 KB 764 upon which the High Court had relied in Webb v Bloch. In Egger v Viscount Chelmsford the Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR, Harman and Davies LJJ) limited the principle to circumstances in which an agency was proved. This limitation had also been noted by Jordan CJ, with whom Maxwell and Owen JJ agreed, in Dougherty v Chandler & Ors (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 370 at 375-376. Having regard to the conclusions I have reached below it is unnecessary to decide this issue.""

174Although Bergin CJ in Eq considered it was ""unnecessary to decide this issue"", her Honour did in fact set aside the qualified privilege findings on the basis that a party not sued for defamation (LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd (""LVMH"")) had not been motivated by malice. The plaintiffs' action for defamation against the police arose from statements police made, outside the LVMH store, where police had made the plaintiffs sit on the footpath while they spoke to store staff. (In fact there had been no hold-up and the plaintiffs, an intellectually disabled man and his carer, successfully brought proceedings against both the police and LVMH for false imprisonment). Her Honour set aside trial findings that LVMH store staff pressed the ""hold up"" emergency button after the plaintiffs left the store, and considered this evidence conclusive in setting aside the qualified privilege findings in the defamation action the plaintiffs had brought against the police. Her Honour's findings that LVMH was not malicious suggest that her Honour favoured the Smith v Streatfeild approach. 

175However, LVMH (called ""the Appellant"" throughout the judgment) should not have been a party to the appeal at all; LVMH was only the cross-defendant to the police cross-appeal (LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah, supra, at [22]). LVMH's malice (or absence thereof), if relevant to the court's findings on the qualified privilege defence, required the court to rule specifically on whether malice by a third party or co-defendant could be relevant in determining the malice of the police. LVMH should not have called itself ""the Appellant"", or made submissions on appeal, including submissions on malice, when it was not in fact the appellant. The findings by Bergin CJ in Eq concerning the absence of malice by LVMH should not be read as endorsing the Smith v Streatfeild approach. The neutral view her Honour took is clearly as set out in LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah, supra, at [66].

176Whether or not the malice of one may infect all defendants, there still must be analysis of malice on a defendant-by-defendant basis, if only to determine which defendant was malicious. The plaintiff in these proceedings has not even attempted this.

177Not only have the defendants been treated as if they are one person, but no attempt has been made to identify the basis upon which one or more of them may be vicariously liable for the malice of the security guard in excluding the plaintiff from the nightclub. Beyond proffering the motive of age discrimination (and the basis upon which the defendants put a plan into operation to bring this about was never the subject of evidence or submissions), the basis upon which the malicious motive of one or all of the defendants, individually or in concert, was never explained.

178The plaintiff has failed to discharge the onus in relation to malice on these bases.

Malice and s 30

179I briefly note the submission of the defendants in relation to the role of malice in s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). A finding of the presence of malice may play a part in defeating a s 30 defence. In LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah, supra, at [137]-[142] Bergin CJ in Eq took this principle further, and considered that absence of malice was sufficient to defeat a s 30 defence, either by itself or in combination with one or more findings in favour of the defendants in relation to the checklist.

180I therefore also note that malice has not been established by the plaintiff, a relevant factor for the purposes of s 30 (s 30(4)).

Triviality - s 33

181Section 33 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides:

""33 Defence of triviality 

It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the circumstances of publication were such that the plaintiff was unlikely to sustain any harm.""

182The formula ""unlikely to sustain any harm"" differs from the formulation ""not likely to suffer harm"" contained in s 13 Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) which was the provision in force when Jones v Sutton (2004) 61 NSWLR 614 was handed down. The defence of unlikelihood of harm is not found in any other common law jurisdictions. Rich J, in Lang v Willis (1934) 52 CLR 637 at 650, held that this defence was available for slander since its introduction in 1847 ""to meet the hard conditions of pioneer days"". It was considered appropriate for publications made in the heat of a family squabble, or a quarrel in a shearing shed, or in a taproom or bar. More recently, in Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1984) Aust Torts Reports 80-691, Moffitt P noted that publication of a defamatory statement to friends in a bar may fall within s 13.

183Counsel for the defendants submits that the difference between s 33 and s 13 of the repealed legislation picks up the language of Mahoney JA in King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie (1991) 24 NSWLR 305. This decision was distinguished in Jones v Sutton, supra, where the court noted that what Mahoney JA had meant to say was that the plaintiff was ""likely"" not to be harmed at all. However, following the change of language in the section to restrict the wording, it may be that this is no longer the case. In Papaconstantinos v Holmes a Court, supra, at [105] McCallum J adopted this interpretation of s 33. While there is no judgment at appellate level supporting this interpretation, McCallum J's judgment was considered on appeal in relation to the qualified privilege defence, and no point was taken about the correctness of her Honour's approach to the s 33 defence.

184Ms Evans also adopted the criticism of Jones v Sutton, supra, in Szanto v Melville [2011] VSC 574 at [157]-[164], namely that upset and hurt to feelings should be included. This is a controversial submission as it is inconsistent with the ratio of Jones v Sutton, supra, as Kaye J noted in Szanto v Melville, supra, at [163]-[164].

185Although the defendants submit that I should apply the more generous test set out in Jones v Sutton, supra, I am of the view that I should, conformably with the approach taken by McCallum J in Papaconstantinos v Holmes a Court, supra, have regard to the change of wording in s 33 and adopt the same approach in the interpretation of this provision as that taken by McCallum J.

186This publication has many of the features of actions in relation to which this defence is brought. There is publication of an imputation towards the bottom of the range in terms of seriousness, and it was made in private circumstances and to persons with knowledge of the plaintiff's reputation (Jones v Sutton, supra, at 618). In relation to any incidental publication, there is no evidence that any of those persons knew who the plaintiff was. In addition, there is evidence that drunkenness is common in Oxford Street, that refusal of people for drunkenness was a common occurrence in Oxford Street nightclubs at that time of night, and that the allegation could have been made to Mr Everingham as well as the plaintiff (T 324-326). 

187An allegation of being drunk in Oxford Street could well fall within the range of publications protected by s 33. However, the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff go beyond that. They connote not merely drunkenness, but drunkenness to the extent that he had been, and should be, denied access to licensed premises, and in circumstances which would make him in the eyes of those knowing the extrinsic facts a hypocrite. The question is whether these factors are outweighed by the other factors in the s 30 checklist.

188Although this is a borderline case, the circumstances are that the publication was made to one or more of the plaintiff's three ""very dear"" friends, all of whom were ""dumbfounded"" by the allegation, and who were in his company for long enough, both before and after this incident, to form their own views. Indeed, their views were that the plaintiff must have been excluded for another reason, namely his age.

189Taking all of the above into account, the defence under s 33 is made out.

Offer to make amends - s 18

190Where a defendant has made an offer to make amends and it has not been accepted by a plaintiff, the defendant may be entitled to a defence under s 18. 

191Although the procedure of offer of amends has been successfully used in the United Kingdom (see, for example, Nail v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 1748), it is a defence rarely relied upon in Australia, with the result that there has been only passing judicial consideration in cases tending to turn on their own facts (as occurred in Bushara v Nobabananas Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 225 at [93] - [107]). The defence has yet to be relied upon successfully in Australia.

192The defendants made an offer promptly, having been served with the statement of claim shortly after it was filed on 30 August 2012. There was no reply by the plaintiff to that offer, although such a procedure is available. The plaintiff never responded, and never sought an apology from the defendants (T 272). Ms Evans submitted that the issue of a statement of claim amounts to a request for an apology, but such a submission cannot survive a defence which includes an offer of amends making a provision of this kind. Moreover, the defendants' offer remained open from the time it was made up until the trial of these proceedings.

193The next issue is whether the offer is reasonable. The defendants submit that it is reasonable because:

(a)It was made promptly after receipt of the statement of claim;

(b)It included an offer to publish an apology;

(c)The defendants pointed out that they were not vicariously liable for publication by a security guard, and this and other defects in the pleading were the subject of a successful application in the Defamation List;

(d)The security guard was doing his job, and the defendants had a duty to ensure that he did his job pursuant to the Liquor Act 2007 (NSW);

(e)There were strong defences of triviality and qualified privilege.

194An offer of amends is not like an offer of compromise. The purpose of the introduction of this provision was ""to avoid expensive litigation"" (Second Reading Speech, Mr Bob Debus MLA, 13 September 2005, p. 17637). Mr Debus went on to state, in the context of s 20, that ""sorry is a singularly powerful word"", capable of healing the hurt caused by ""an ill-conceived or careless publication"". 

195When determining what is reasonable, the fact that an offer is made speedily, and includes an offer to publish an apology, is significant. It is all the more significant where no apology has been sought but where the plaintiff's evidence has been, in the proceedings before me, all that he wanted was an apology.

196Ms Evans submitted that the offer of apology was not reasonable, pointing me to the matters raised in the proceedings for relief in the Administration Decisions Tribunal. She submitted that the defendants should have offered not only to apologise, but also to guarantee that their age discrimination should not recur, and to acknowledge their wrongdoing.

197I do not accept this submission. The offer of amends procedure relates to defamation proceedings only. It should not be extended to litigation in other courts or tribunals. The plaintiff was entitled to his remedy in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, having already commenced proceedings there, and could have sought relief of this kind from that Tribunal. As Mr Debus pointed out in the Second Reading Speech, the offer of amends procedure should not preclude the making of other settlement offers (Hansard, p. 17637).

198While I do not consider the defendants' view of their success in this litigation ((c) - (e) above) to be relevant, their prompt and genuine offer of amends was, in the context of the facts of this case, reasonable, particularly since it remained open up until the trial. Accordingly, this defence would succeed.

199I also note that an offer of amends is not a matter that can be taken into account as a matter going to damages, and cannot be relied upon in relation to any claim for aggravated compensatory damages. In addition, the circumstances in which an offer of amends would, if pleaded, be capable of amounting to malice would have to be exceptional, and I reject this particular of malice.

200I shall include some brief observations on the subject of quantum.

Quantum

201While damage is presumed (Bristow v Adams, supra, at [20] - [31]), this is a limited publication to between one and three recipients (depending upon how many of the plaintiff's friends heard what was said) in circumstances where, as Mr Everingham stated, the allegation that the plaintiff was drunk was dumbfounding.

202The defendants submit that this was a case that should never have been brought, as the costs far outweigh any benefit to the plaintiff. This is a familiar complaint in defamation litigation (Bristow v Adams [2011] NSWDC 11) but it is one with which appellate courts have little sympathy: Bristow v Adams at [41] per Basten JA. The summary procedure for dismissal of actions on the basis of disproportionate costs (Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission [2000] EMLR 296) has been decisively rejected by the New South Wales Court of Appeal.

203Publications to one or more persons are a feature of Australian defamation actions. No judicial comment was made, in Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon, supra, or Jones v Sutton, supra, to the effect that publication of a few words, to one to three persons whose response was sceptical or disbelieving, was an action that should not have been brought. Accusations of public drunkenness to the extent that the plaintiff should be refused admission to licensed premises, although not as serious as allegations of adultery, or of improper conduct by an alderman, are not accusations warranting nominal damages.

204The damages awarded in both Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon, supra, and Jones v Sutton, supra, were $5,000. Both those decisions were handed down prior to the imposition of a cap on damages in defamation, which was introduced to discourage inappropriately high verdicts. In Jones v Sutton, supra, there was evidence of the ""grapevine effect"", as there has been here; moreover there were three publications, and not merely one.

205In Haddon v Forsyth, supra, at [369], a claim for damages brought under the current legislation, Simpson J stated she would have awarded $5,000 for a publication to 5 - 10 people accusing the plaintiff of sexual harassment. Claims for damages in defamation are now conducted on principles appropriate for a cap on damages. In Jeffrey v Giles [2013] VSC 268, where extensive evidence of grapevine effect and damage in a local community arising from website publications was led, damages of $8,000 and $12,000 were awarded to each of the plaintiffs. 

206I take into account the principles explained by the High Court in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, supra, at 347 per Hayne J, and the provisions of s 34 regarding an appropriate relationship between the harm sustained and the amount awarded. Whether there was publication to one or three persons, or to a queue of more than a dozen, or to the many passers-by, I am satisfied that an appropriate sum to award would be $3,000. This amount would also take into account the ""grapevine effect"" of publications coming to the attention of the plaintiff's professional associates such as Mr McDermott. Many of these publications were, I find, made by the plaintiff himself, such as his conversation with Mr Tim Webster, and thus not compensable.

207Aggravated compensatory damages should not be awarded. The particulars relied upon are knowledge of falsity and the allegation that the security guard knew the plaintiff was sober. Neither of these particulars would justify an award of aggravated compensatory damages: Haertsch v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 182 at [49] - [62]. Nor would the conduct of the trial by the defendants (about which submissions were made, but which was not particularised; see Gatley on Libel and Slander at [34.58]) warrant the award of such damages; see Jeffrey v Giles, supra, at [57].

Concluding remarks

208I have found that the matter complained of was not published, but that if it were, none of the defendants is vicariously liable for the statements of the security guard, whether he was Mr Unwin or some other security guard employed by ADCAS Pty Ltd. I have also made alternative findings that if the matter complained of were published, the three imputations conveyed by the natural and ordinary meaning are defamatory, but published on occasions protected by qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30 of the Act, and that the plaintiff has failed to prove any of the defendants were malicious. I have also held that the defences of triviality and offer of amends have been made out but that the defence of honest opinion would fail in relation to the imputations arising by way the natural and ordinary meaning. In the event that damages were to be awarded, I would have awarded $3,000. I would not have awarded aggravated compensatory damages.

		19 June 2013",2013-06-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761755,R v Tony LIRISTIS [2013] NSWDC 223,"JUDGMENT

1In this case I have to decide whether to fine a man who admits to driving his car whilst disqualified from holding a driver licence, or to let him off without a conviction at all. The case comes to me as an appeal from a magistrate who convicted and fined the man. The man's name is Tony Liristis, and I will explain the background to the case and how I come to be presented with this decision to make.

2Tony Liristis was disqualified from driving by a magistrate. The date is unimportant. He appealed from that order disqualifying him to the District Court. He lost that appeal when Judge Syme upheld the disqualification. What happened then is this. Mr Liristis lodged documents to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from Judge Syme's order which had the effect of disqualifying him from driving. Mr Liristis says that he asked officers in the Court of Criminal Appeal section of the Supreme Court of New South Wales whether the driver disqualification order was still current. He asked this question. He had a good basis for this question because when a person appeals from a Local Court magistrate to the District Court, there can be a stay of the Local Court magistrate's order. A stay is another way of saying that the order is suspended until the appeal is determined. Mr Liristis says that he was informed by an officer that the order would be stayed so that his licence would remain current until the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was resolved. 

3He continued driving. He was stopped by the police on 23 July 2011. The police pointed out to him that the advice he received was wrong and that their records showed that he was disqualified from driving. Accordingly, he was charged with the offence of driving whilst disqualified, which is an offence against s 25A(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998. Mr Liristis went to the Local Court before Magistrate Rabbidge and defended the case. He lost and was convicted of that offence by Magistrate Rabbidge, who put Mr Liristis on a good behaviour bond. 

4As it happened, 23 July 2011 was a Saturday. On the following Wednesday, 27 July 2011, Mr Liristis was driving again. He said he was on his way to court. Police saw him and for some reason pulled him up. It seems it might have been for a random breath test. The dealings between the police and Mr Liristis when he pulled up are all recorded on a video which the police activated from their car. Mr Liristis, it is clear, first gave a false name and address, claiming to be somebody else. The police kept checking the name and came up with a negative. The police officer obviously became suspicious and issued a warning to Mr Liristis that he could be charged for providing a false name and address. Mr Liristis then confessed, and provided the police with his correct name and address. It obviously followed that the police realised that he was disqualified from driving. 

5Mr Liristis explained again to the police that he had appealed from the disqualification to the Court of Criminal Appeal and had been told that the disqualification was suspended until the appeal was resolved. The police told him that their records were different and that he was disqualified, so he was charged again with driving whilst disqualified. 

6Again he came before the Local Court. This time he came before Magistrate Barkell. Mr Liristis defended his case. Her Honour found that he was guilty and convicted him of the offence. Her Honour then fined Mr Liristis $2000 with court costs.

7Mr Liristis appealed from both magistrates' decisions to the District Court. When a person appeals to the District Court, the District Court judge reads the same material that was before the magistrate, together with any additional evidence which is tendered either by leave or in any event before the judge. The judge takes into account the magistrate's decision and then makes up his or her own mind about the outcome of the case. 

8Mr Liristis appealed against both of his convictions. He argued through his barrister, Mr P R Glissan, that he was not guilty of either of the offences. He relied upon the defence which is commonly referred to as the Proudman v Dayman defence and is based upon the judgment of Sir Owen Dixon in Proudman v Dayman (1941) 67 CLR 536. In two separate judgments, I dismissed his appeals, saying that in each case the mistake that he was under was a mistake of law, not a mistake of fact. His argument through Mr Glissan had been that he was under a misapprehension of fact, but I did not agree. Accordingly, I dismissed both of his appeals.

9Mr Liristis also appealed against both of the sentences. I heard his appeal against the sentence imposed by Magistrate Rabbidge of the good behaviour bond earlier this week. I allowed the appeal and set aside Magistrate Rabbidge's good behaviour bond, and instead made an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that the charge should be dismissed. 

10Then I heard the appeal from the second sentence, that was the $2000 fine imposed by Magistrate Barkell. This is the judgment concerning that appeal. I have been ably assisted by both Mr D Robinson, who appears for the respondent to the appeal, who is the Director of Public Prosecutions, and by Mr Glissan in their leading of evidence and cross-examination and submissions. Mr Glissan called his client to give evidence and he was cross-examined extensively and appropriately, and I might add fairly by Mr Robinson. 

11Mr Glissan's case is that his client should get the benefit of another order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act because of his misunderstanding about the state of the law brought about by information he had been given by officers in the Supreme Court. Mr Robinson opposed that and said that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed and the fine permitted to stand.

12I should add some more information which comes from evidence tendered by Mr Glissan in the appeal. It will be recalled that the first time the police pulled him up was Saturday 23 July 2011. Mr Glissan tendered in evidence a copy of a document which became exhibit S5 and is called a transmission verification report, and concerns a fax which I accept Mr Liristis sent to the Court of Criminal Appeal registry on 26 July 2011. That would have been a Tuesday and the day before his second encounter with the police, and three days after his first encounter. He addressed it to an officer called Violetta. The relevant parts of his fax say that he ""called you twice yesterday and left two messages to call me back and I have not heard back from you."" He then went on to say in the fax that he ""was pulled over by police a few days ago and they advised me that my licence was suspended, and this cannot be correct as you advised me when I lodge my appeal there is an automatic stay."" He then provided his mobile phone number and asked her as a matter of urgency to ""advise me what is going on?""

13I accept that Mr Liristis sent that fax to the Court of Criminal Appeal registry. I also accept, which he said in evidence and is confirmed by the terms of the fax, that he attempted to phone on the Monday. There is evidence also in the form of exhibit S4 which indicates that a fax was sent to a fax number at 9230 8271 from Mr Liristis. Because the Evidence Act does not apply to sentence proceedings, I checked the Law Society diary: many of the phone numbers in the Supreme Court commence with the numbers 9230.

14I also accept that he sent the fax and left the messages, because in the video which was taken of his second encounter with the police he can be heard referring to the Court of Criminal Appeal and to his appeal. I do not think that he has made up this information, although it was not suggested that he did. It was explored but it was not suggested that he made it up. 

15Returning now to the arguments. Mr Robinson says that a dismissal under s 10 is not an appropriate course because Mr Liristis had neither an honest nor reasonable belief that he had a current licence from which he had not been disqualified from holding. Mr Robinson argued that it was not honest because he had lied to the police about his name and address, and had provided different reasons for lying to the police. The only reason for the lie, Mr Robinson argued, was that Mr Liristis knew that he was not entitled to drive because he had been told four days earlier, or at least he should have known four days earlier, that according to the police and driving authority records he had been disqualified. In fact his licence had been taken away from him. 

16Mr Robinson argued that his belief was not reasonable because all he did was make some phone calls and send a fax to the Court of Criminal Appeal to enquire about the status of his licence. As Mr Robinson said, one cannot just make a couple of phone calls and send a fax and expect to be able to drive on that basis. He should have ascertained the exact status of his licence. He chose to drive despite getting no responses to his phone messages or to his fax. Mr Robinson pointed out that the consequence of a conviction would be an automatic 2 year disqualification because this would be a second and subsequent offence after Judge Syme's order, and it is a serious offence.

17Mr Glissan, on the other hand, argued that his client should benefit from an order under s 10. He took me to the High Court's decision in Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; (2004) 218 CLR 493. That case had been referred to in the arguments on the conviction appeals, but Mr Glissan drew my attention to observations made by some of the justices about the circumstances of that case. It was a case where a man had said that he made enquiries of government officials and had not been provided with answers which assisted him before committing a regulatory offence. The case concerned whether or not a defence similar to the Proudman v Dayman defence was available. Their Honours decided that it was not available. Gleeson CJ and Kirby J pointed out in their joint judgment at 500([2]) that the ignorance of the legal consequences that flow from the existence of facts that constitute an offence ""is ordinarily not a matter of exculpation, although it may be a matter of mitigation, and in some circumstances it may enliven a discretion not to prosecute.""

18Mr Glissan also took me to the joint judgment of Callinan and Heydon JJ. Their Honours said in a passage at 519([61]) that Mr Glissan referred me to that the ""appeal provides an example of the way in which provisions for mandatory penalties can operate harshly and unfairly, and, as has occurred here, generate time consuming and expensive appellate litigation."" Mr Glissan argued that the consequence in this case of a 2 year mandatory disqualification would be a harsh and unfair penalty in the circumstances where his client had been misled by a public official. He also referred to what Callinan and Heydon JJ had said at 521([70]) about the prosecution in that case leading to ""the imposition of harsh mandatory penalties,"" and their Honours went on to say in the same sentence that the prosecution ""has the appearance of an act of mindless oppression.""

19Mr Glissan also referred me to 527 where their Honours said in [84] that it was ""impossible not to sympathise with the respondent. On any fair and objective view he was not culpable in any way.""

20Mr Glissan referred me to the evidence that his client had attempted to contact the Court of Criminal Appeal, including the evidence of the fax which was sent. He acknowledged that his client had told a lie to the police but had explained that lie in a way which tallied with the facts. He emphasised that his client had explained at the scene that there had been an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and argued that the penalty, the mandatory 2 year penalty, would be harsh and unfair in the circumstances of this case. 

21I should add that Mr Liristis's evidence was that in the month following his sending of the fax, he received a telephone call from another officer in the Court of Criminal Appeal telling him that the earlier advice had been wrong and that the order effectively disqualifying him from driving was not in fact suspended until the outcome of his appeal. 

22I think that this is a case for the application of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is true, as Mr Robinson points out, that Mr Liristis lied to the police at the scene. However, once it was drawn to his attention that he could get into serious trouble, he owned up and confessed to his real identity. The lie in my opinion was understandable. It was probably the result of panic, of being pulled up yet again. Mr Liristis explained that in fact he was on the way to court and did not want to be late for court. He gave that explanation at the scene as well. No doubt part of the panic was because there was some doubt in his mind about the conflicting information which he had been receiving. The police some days earlier had removed his licence and told him that he was disqualified. On the other hand, he had received advice from an officer in the appellate division of the Supreme Court, or in an appellate court of this State, namely, the Court of Criminal Appeal, to the effect that his licence was not suspended. In those circumstances, it may be understandable that he was panicky and wanted to avoid being confronted with another charge. 

23It is true that he, as Mr Robinson points out, took the risk of driving without getting a clear answer back but, on the other hand, he was dealing with a public sector office which no doubt is very busy. Calls are not always returned promptly because of more important commitments which those officers have, nor faxes responded to, but what is clear to me is that Mr Liristis himself had tried to clarify the situation by not only making a phone call or two but by sending a fax to find out whether the advice he received was wrong or not. Mr Glissan pointed out that an order under s 10 may be available because of Mr Liristis's need for a licence. His client gave evidence of a need to drive his ill father for treatment and to assist in the driving of his children. However, I would not regard that as an appropriate basis for making an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Everyone who drives has a need of some sort or other for a licence. 

24I would not regard an appropriate basis the character antecedents of Mr Liristis. He has criminal convictions, including traffic offences, on his record. I would not regard the offence as trivial. He was driving whilst being disqualified. However, the provision which Mr Glissan primarily relied upon, and which I do regard as applicable and one which I will rely upon, are what are described as extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed. Although, as Mr Robinson pointed out, he was clearly on notice that some official records regarded him as disqualified, he had made proven attempts to clarify this in the few days between the two offences. He produced documentary evidence to that effect. He pointed out at the scene to the police about these steps which he had made.

25However, the point is that, in my view, he had been given misleading information by an officer in the Court of Criminal Appeal and was acting on that information, which was at law, in driving. One could understand that he may have regarded advice from a senior appellate court officer as carrying a good deal of weight compared to public service records. I regard the circumstances of this offence as extenuating sufficiently to give Mr Liristis the benefit of an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

26The formal order which I make in disposing of this appeal is this. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. Instead of that sentence, under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, without proceeding to conviction, I find Mr Liristis guilty of the offence and I make an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed.

HIS HONOUR: Are there any other orders that I need to make, Mr Robinson, Mr Glissan?
ROBINSON: No, your Honour.
GLISSAN: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you both again for your assistance, Mr Glissan and Mr Robinson.
APPELLANT: Thank you very much, your Honour.

		18 November 2013",2013-06-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761759,R v O'Toole [2013] NSWDC 181,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Corruption in sport is an ongoing problem and noted recent examples have included cricket, rugby league and horse racing in its various forms.
2I have before me an offender, Paul Anthony O'Toole, who, through his corrupt conduct, has tarnished the reputation of a particular form of horse racing, harness racing in New South Wales.  He was a steward who took bribes.  He did this on 30 occasions and on a further four occasions agreed to receive a bribe that was not actually paid.  His offending extended over a period of 18 months and, whilst it was for the fairly modest sum of about $6,500 in total, it was intended by Mr O'Toole that his regular bribes would supplement his income and he would have financially benefited as a result.
3Mr O'Toole got involved with a scheme with a number of trainers and another steward whereby the stewards would agree not to test certain horses, knowing that those horses had been administered performance enhancing substances.  The idea was that the trainers could administer such substances to their horses.  That would increase the likelihood that the horses would win a race.  That would increase the trainer's income through simply receiving prize money or through making it more likely that the trainer would win a bet. To cover up that misconduct, the stewards, including Mr O'Toole, would be bribed to ensure that the relevant horses were not subject to post race testing.
4The first offence occurred on 21 January 2010.  I will describe what happened on that occasion because it is very similar to what happened on the other occasions that the offender committed similar offences.  He was working as a steward at a race meeting at Penrith.  Michael Russo, a trainer who I sentenced recently, asked Mr O'Toole that his horse, Alpine Al, not be tested.  The horse won its race.  Mr Russo paid some money to Mr O'Toole in order to ensure that Alpine Al was not tested.  The actual sum that Mr O'Toole received is not known, but he gave between $200 and $400 to another corrupt steward, Matthew Bentley.  This, as I say, was on 21 January 2010.  
5Throughout 2010 and through half of 2011, similar activities occurred.  Mr O'Toole, whether he was a steward or a starter at a race meeting, was involved in a scheme whereby trainers would pay money to ensure that particular horses were not drug tested so that the fact that the horses had been doped could be covered up.  
6He now stands to be sentenced for nine offences of being an agent and corruptly receiving a benefit, offences which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years.  He asks that when I sentence him for the first of those matters, the one I have just described, I take into account a further 25 matters on a Form 1, 21 similar offences and four of corruptly agreeing to receive a benefit, although the benefit was not paid in those cases because the horse did not actually win, thus no money was paid.
7The criminality of these offences is obvious and the harm that his conduct has caused is also obvious.  These offences represented a grave breach of trust, a matter which of course is common to all bribery offences, such as these.  The Court of Criminal Appeal in dealing with an example of corruption in the greyhound racing industry has reminded us as to just how serious corruption of people involved in the racing industry, including of stewards, really is.
8The offender pleaded guilty to his offences at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I will ultimately impose upon him is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
9The offender is a man of prior good character.  He has no other criminal offences on his history and references tendered to the Court speak highly of his general integrity.  Of course it was his prior good character which put him in a position which enabled him to commit these offences and any suggestion, as is made in many of the references, that his conduct was out of character has to be considered in light of the fact that his out of character behaviour went on for 18 months and involved 34 separate acts of bribery.
10The offender was born in 1963.  He is almost 50 years of age and he lives with his wife and their three children.  There was nothing really remarkable about his upbringing apart from one particular aspect of it that I want to speak briefly about.  I want to speak briefly about it not because I do not consider it important, but because of the intensely personal nature of it.  His experiences at school as the victim of criminal behaviour have had a lasting and significant impact upon him.  He is deserving of significant sympathy because of that.  As judges understand when they sentence for crimes similar to those of which Mr O'Toole was a victim, the impact of such crimes is ongoing and at times devastating.  The material tendered today is an eloquent demonstration of the seriousness with which judges treat conduct of that kind, but of course being the victim of a crime of that kind does not give anyone a licence to themselves commit crimes.  I have taken into account, Mr O'Toole's terrible experiences at school but of course that cannot lead to a situation where I impose a sentence upon him which fails to reflect the objective gravity of his most serious criminal behaviour.
11These offences were committed by Mr O'Toole at a time when he was under additional financial and emotional stress for reasons which have also been outlined in the evidence.  He and his family have suffered greatly since his misconduct has become known.  Not surprisingly, there has been a great deal of publicity given to Mr O'Toole's misconduct and this has caused distress both for him and his family.  The pressure that his family is under as they wait for today's sentencing proceedings has led to obvious and completely understandable consequences for the rest of his family.  They too have suffered because of Mr O'Toole's criminal behaviour.  That hardship however is not exceptional, nor is the hardship that the family will experience in the event that Mr O'Toole is sent to gaol exceptional either, but it remains the case that Mr O'Toole will do his sentence harder than it would otherwise have been, blaming himself and knowing that his actions have caused suffering to his family.
12Mr Barber, on behalf of Mr O'Toole, also relies on the circumstance that Mr O'Toole has had to give up his job as a steward, in fact give up any involvement in the harness racing industry.  That of course is not unusual.  Many people who commit offences, especially offences of dishonesty, find it difficult to get work and have to change careers.
13A submission was made in written submissions by Mr Barber that concurrent sentences are appropriate.  Although I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence, it will be obvious from the indicative sentences I announce, that I do not accept Mr Barber's submission about the concurrency of sentences.  These were 34 separate acts of criminality, resulting in nine specific offences which must be the subject of a sentence.  No one should consider that having committed one offence, further offences, all 33 of them can be committed for free.  Each offence involved further harm to the racing industry and each offence is deserving of further punishment.  On the other hand of course, the principle of totality applies.  I have decided in imposing an aggregate sentence, to reflect both of those principles, even though they at times point in completely opposite directions.
14I accept that Mr O'Toole is remorseful.  Of course a large part of that is appropriately directed to the effect that his crimes have had on his family, but I accept that remorse goes beyond that and that he is sorry for what he has done.
15I should mention other offenders who have been sentenced for their involvement in this scheme.  Two of them, trainers, were dealt with in the Local Court.  Of course the principle of parity requires that no offender should have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares his sentence with that imposed on his cooffenders but in applying that principle to those matters dealt with in the Local Court, a problem arises.  Very limited information is available about one offender and the other had a significant discount allowed for him because of assistance he gave to the authorities.
16The principle of parity also applies to the sentence that I imposed upon Michael Russo.  He was sentenced for similar offences, although because he was a trainer and not a steward, the fact that he himself did not breach any trust, means that objectively for that reason alone, his conduct was less culpable than that of Mr O'Toole.  In addition, he was dealt with for fewer offences overall, but I have taken the sentence I imposed upon Mr Russo and those differences into account in determining the sentence that I will impose upon Mr O'Toole.
17Notwithstanding the circumstances in which Mr O'Toole committed these offences, which I have mentioned, and notwithstanding the mental health issues which have arisen because of Mr O'Toole's experience at school, general deterrence remains of prime importance in this sentencing exercise.  Clearly, sums of money, perhaps significant, can be made through corrupt activity where betting is involved.  Now is not the place for me to express my views as to the link between corrupt conduct and the betting industry but the link between those two activities is clear.  If there is to be a betting industry, it is important that it is fair and what Mr O'Toole did was harm those people who placed bets on horses believing that things were fair when, as investigations revealed, they were not.  It is hard of course to point to an individual victim of these crimes but there were no doubt many who all lost, I hope, small sums of money because of what Mr O'Toole did.
18Mr O'Toole is not to get any longer sentence in an effort to make an example of him, but general deterrence does remain a very important aspect of the sentence I am about announce on Mr O'Toole.  Those, whether they are involved in harness racing, other forms of horse racing, other forms of racing, or other forms of sporting activity, who might be tempted to receive or offer bribes should bear in mind the likely result if they are caught.
19It was accepted implicitly in the submissions of Mr Barber that a sentence of imprisonment was required, although he suggested that a suspended sentence or an ICO would be appropriate.  I accept Mr Barber's concession that imprisonment is required.  The next question becomes how long, and only if the length of sentence is such that alternatives to fulltime imprisonment are possible does the next question arise.  I have determined a length of sentence such that no alternative to fulltime imprisonment is possible.
20The aggregate sentence I impose upon Mr O'Toole is to consist of an 18 months non-parole period and a head sentence of three years.  I would have imposed a sentence of two years on the first matter taking into account the Form 1 matters and 18 months on the remaining eight matters.  The earliest date on which Mr O'Toole is to be released to parole is 20 December 2014 and I order his release to parole on that day.

		25 September 2013",2013-06-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761761,R v Stanley Thomas BOWDEN [2013] NSWDC 170,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing a young man who committed a shocking home invasion as well as an aggravated break, enter and steal and a car theft. There are three crimes that I have been asked to sentence him for. He has pleaded guilty to them all.

2The first in time was an especially aggravated break, enter and steal. That is the crime I referred to as the shocking home invasion. It was specially aggravated because it was in company, and because it involved a reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm. That is an offence against s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 25 years imprisonment to that crime, and a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment.

3The next crime I am sentencing him for is the theft of a car. That is an offence against s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 5 years imprisonment to that crime.

4The last crime is an aggravated break, enter and steal. The aggravation was knowing there were persons inside the house. That is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that crime, and again a standard non-parole period has been fixed for that crime, which is 5 years imprisonment. 

5The young man's name is Stanley Bowden, and I formally convict him of all of those offences. 

6I should add that when I am sentencing him for the aggravated break, enter and steal, he has asked me to take into account 6 offences under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I will take the offences into account. I will list those offences in due course, and I will sign the certificate to that effect. That certificate is a copy of the certificate and is part of exhibit A.

7A judge needs to say something about the crimes that the judge is sentencing an offender for, and I will give a brief description of each of the crimes. I will start with the car theft and the aggravated break, enter and steal, even though those were later in time than the home invasion.

8Brett Strickland's Holden Apollo was parked outside his house in South Windsor on 13 April 2011. At some time that evening, after 4.30pm in the afternoon, it was stolen. The car was driven to a petrol station in Berkshire Park where $73 worth of petrol was taken but not paid for. It was eventually recovered some weeks later at Mosman. 

9Mosman was also the scene of the aggravated break, enter and steal. The house was in Holt Street. There was a garage. The owners went to bed on the night of 14 April 2011 and secured their house. Between 10.00pm that night and 3.00am the next morning Stanley Bowden opened a window at the side of the house and got in. He got the owner's wallet, and the house and car keys from the kitchen bench. Then he stole the car in the garage. However he left his fingerprints on a window. The car was found a week or so later burnt out in Windsor Downs. 

10On 30 April 2011 a car was stolen from another house in Mosman. Stanley Bowden's fingerprints were found on that car as well. Yet another car was stolen from Mosman in Glover Street and Mr Bowden was seen in that car. Again petrol was taken and not paid for. 

11All of that criminal activity gave rise to the aggravated break, enter and steal, which was the house in Holt Street, Mosman. It was aggravated because Mr Bowden knew that there were people inside at the time. 

12The original theft of Mr Strickland's car gave rise to the offence of take and drive conveyance, which I have to sentence Mr Bowden for, along with the aggravated break, enter and steal.

13There are 6 offences, as I said, that I have to take into account when I am sentencing him for the aggravated break, enter and steal. Two of those arise from stealing the petrol, which is an offence against s 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and is called obtain property by deception. One of them is a take and drive conveyance, an offence against s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and the remaining three are all offences of being carried in a stolen car, which is an offence against the same section, but cl (b). In due course I will take those offences into account when I am sentencing Mr Bowden for the aggravated break, enter and steal. 

14I now need to describe the home invasion. That occurred on 3 January 2011. The circumstances were truly shocking, and I should give a little more detail than I usually would about the crime.

15On 3 January 2011, after 9.00pm, Mylos Pavelec, a 65 year old man, was at home lying on his couch in Canoelands. His wife, Mirsolava, who was 61, got back from working in their son's pizza shop. They settled in for the evening. They were sitting down having dinner when two men broke into their house. The two men literally broke through the glass front door. Mr Bowden was the first of the two men to come in the door. Both of the men had a knife in each of their hands. Mr Bowden shouted ""This is a home invasion, give us the money"". 

16No doubt unexpectedly to Mr Bowden and his co-offender, who is not identified, Mr Pavelec responded by saying ""Out from my house you bastards"". He picked up the beer bottle that he was drinking from and threw it at Mr Bowden. Mr Bowden and his co-offender dodged the beer bottle but Mr Pavelec threw a torch at them. The other man walked towards both victims. Mr Pavelec picked up a cushion and used it to push the co-offender into the corridor next to the toilet. He then ran into the kitchen, picked up some mugs and other items and threw them at the men. He picked up a bread knife. He yelled out to his wife, ""gun"". He wanted to get her to go into the bedroom and collect the .22 calibre rifle, which they kept above their wardrobe. She went in.

17Mr Bowden followed Mr Pavelec into the kitchen. Then Mr Bowden dropped one of his two knives and grabbed the blade of the knife that Mr Pavelec was holding in order to get it out of his hands. Mr Pavelec responded by pulling the knife back, which injured Mr Bowden's hands, and then he lunged forward. He stabbed Mr Bowden between the legs and caused a penetrating injury around the scrotum at the base of Mr Bowden's penis. Understandably Mr Bowden backed away from the kitchen, but he followed Mrs Pavelec into the bedroom. She had got the rifle from the wardrobe and was sitting on it on the bed. He pushed her off the bed and grabbed the rifle. 

18Meanwhile the co-offender threw some kitchen chairs at Mr Pavelec and Mr Pavelec started throwing knives back. Then the co-offender advanced towards Mr Pavelec, who picked up the kettle. Mr Bowden shouted ""Steven, come in"" and the co-offender left the kitchen and went into the bedroom. But then he went back to the kitchen armed with a baseball bat. This is when things got particularly serious.

19The co-offender hit Mr Pavelec three times with the bat. The first was aimed at his head. He blocked the strike by holding his forearm. The second hit the victim on his left wrist, and the third struck his left fingers.

20Mrs Pavelec left the bedroom and went back into the living room. She was put on her knees by Mr Bowden, who put a knife to her throat. He said to her ""Lady, I don't want to hurt you."" Then he shouted to her husband ""Drop that knife down or I am going to kill this fucking old cunt"". Mr Pavelec dropped the knife. At that point the co-offender hit him again with the baseball bat to his head. Mr Pavelec fell to the ground unconscious and Mrs Pavelec saw blood coming from her husband's head.

21Mr Bowden and his co-offender went through the house and stole a couple of laptop computers and a mobile phone. They stole Mrs Pavelec's handbag, which had $1000 cash in it. They stole two watches and the rifle. Mr Pavelec got up and wanted to untie his dogs from outside but he found he could not do that because of the injury to his hand. He went back inside and fell to the ground. By that time the men had left. Mr Pavelec could not speak properly. Twenty minutes or so later he could speak again. He asked for water but could not drink it; it kept running out of his mouth. 

22Mr Pavelec had a CT of his brain and facial bones. There was an extradural haematoma seen in his left temporal lobe. It was about seven millimetres in depth. There was another one as well, which was five millimetres. There was a third haemorrhage. The report said there was ""extensive left sided skull fracture (temporal Bone) with associated 3 focal areas of extradural haemorrhage"". It was noted there was another fracture. He also had a fractured ulna. 

23Mr Bowden himself went to Westmead Hospital the next day and was admitted with a scrotal injury and a haematoma at the base of his penis. He was discharged the following day. Mr Bowden's DNA profile was found on one of the knives. He was arrested on 29 May 2011 and Mr Bowden has been in custody since. His sentence will date from then.

24I now turn to make some remarks about Mr Bowden himself. He is 24. He has an extensive criminal record. He has offences recorded from appearances in the Children's Court. They involve break, enter and steal offences, possession of housebreaking implements as well as drug offences, assault and property damage. As an adult he has been convicted of offences to do with car theft, deception and break, enter and steal, which have been punished by full time custody. He has breached good behaviour bonds and has been sent into custody as a result of those breaches. 

25Mr Pavelec and Mrs Pavelec provided victim impact statements. I propose to read those out and put them on the record. Mr Pavelec's victim impact statement reads as follows -

""My name is Milos Pavelec. I am a victim of a home invasion that happened on the 3/1/2011 at the above address. As a result I have suffered a multitude of injuries. My skull received three fractures. One was across my skull from one side to the other and was about 150 mm long. My right eye socket was broken and another was over my left ear and was about 70 mm long. After I was hit by the baseball bat, I lost consciousness for about 30 seconds. After that I could not speak for about 40 minutes. My left arm was broken and in plaster for 13 weeks. After all this time, I still have problems with my right hand as a direct result of my head injuries. I have hardly any feeling in three of my fingers and repeatedly drop things. I also suffer from frequent headaches. My skin suffers from a painful rash, which only now is starting to heal after taking many different medications. My doctor does not want to prescribe me any sleeping pills, even though I have trouble sleeping. I suffer from mood swings. I am constantly angry and upset. I am not the person I used to be before the home invasion. The violent crime that took place in my home has severely diminished the quality of my life.""

26Mrs Pavelec's victim impact statement reads as follows -

""When the home invasion occurred at my home by the two armed robbers. I received small cuts to my hands and a cut to my throat, which was about 20 mm in length. I suffered bruising to my back and neck. Compared to my husband, these were minor injuries. Little did I know that after two and a half years, I am still not able to sleep at night. When I come home from work at night, I wait outside in the car until my husband comes outside and gets me. I constantly suffer from nightmares. I have tried antidepressant pills and sleeping pills though neither has much effect. I go to bed at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. This in turn means that I always feel tired. Since the home invasion happened, I have not felt safe in my home. I will never feel safe at home again. Not even if I move.""

27Those two victim impact statements provide a graphic and articulate illustration of the impact, indeed long lasting impact, which the shocking crime committed by Mr Bowden can have on its victims. I should add, without detracting from the impact of those statements, that regarding any matters related to descriptions of medical conditions, I rely not on the victim impact statements but on the medical material that I have already referred to and the agreed statement of facts. Nevertheless, I repeat, the victim impact statements illustrate the effect a crime such as this has on its victims. 

28I return now to the pre sentence report which I referred to earlier. The author points out that Mr Bowden had breached various bonds before. It points to the following about his childhood - 

""Mr Bowden reported a stable and positive childhood until the death of his father in 1998 following an accident, witnessed by the offender, where his father was badly burned in the family home. Mr Bowden stated and enquiries confirmed that from the age of ten following his father's death, he was a very difficult child to manage at home.""

29It noted he had been using prohibited drugs for a long time, these included cannabis, amphetamine, ecstasy, crystal methamphetamines and heroin. He first started drinking alcohol when he was 10. The author summarised her conclusions as follows:

""Mr Bowden is a 23 year old indigenous man who appears to have the benefit of a supportive family. He has previously been supervised by this Service on a Community Service Order, a Section 12 bond and a Parole Order that were all subsequently revoked due to non attendance, further offending and continued drug use. While he has demonstrated an understanding of the seriousness of the crimes and his awareness of the impact on the victims, he needs to address his drug issues to ensure he has an opportunity to gain fulltime employment and maintain a pro-social lifestyle free from criminal behaviour.""

30Mr T Edwards, who appeared for Mr Bowden, also tendered a report by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Jeremy F O'Dea. Dr O'Dea collected the same history of the traumatic events in Mr Bowden's childhood and his early use of alcohol and drugs. It noted he had commenced the methadone programme in custody and wanted to see if he could get into the drug unit at Parklea. Dr O'Dea noted that ""Mr Bowden appeared thoughtful, positive and optimistic regarding the future."" Dr O'Dea said he ""did not diagnose Mr Bowden as suffering from a major psychiatric illness."" He said his primary problems ""appear to be with a longstanding history of Substance Abuse Disorder, in particular alcohol, cannabis, amphetamine and opioid use disorders, and offending behaviours, and offending behaviour from an early age, in the context of a vulnerable personality."" He pointed out the offending could be ""best understood in the context of his significant substance abuse disorder."" He thought ""intensive and extensive alcohol and other drug counselling and rehabilitation, including in the community in the long term, with abstinence from alcohol and other drug use the aim and requirement in order to manage and minimise his risk of engaging in further offending behaviour in the community in the long term."" He thought some psychological or psychiatric assistance would help as well. He concluded by saying -

""[A]lthough the trauma surrounding his father's death is likely to assist in understanding, at least in part, Mr Bowden's subsequent substance abuse and offending behaviours, I could not draw a direct causal connection between this trauma and the commission of the index offence.""

31Mr Edwards also tendered a document indicating Mr Bowden had enrolled at Parklea Correctional Centre in a TAFE course in engineering to do with heavy fabrication and has completed a number of aspects of that course. In addition, he has a certificate of completion of an alcohol and drugs programme which he completed in custody. 

32Mr Edwards called his client to give evidence. He confirmed he comes from a supportive family; indeed his mother and his twin brother were present when he was giving evidence and are present today in court. He confirmed the history of his father being burnt when Mr Bowden was six years old. He was admitted to a nursing home and a life support system for him was turned off some years later. He then started to mix in the wrong crowd, to take drugs and abuse alcohol. He indicated his younger brother has been in trouble and is serving custody because of offences that the younger brother has committed. Mr Bowden feels responsible for that because he has obviously provided a role model. He confirmed he had been undertaking the courses in prison as well as partaking in the methadone programme. 

33He has made enquiries about his longer term future. He wishes to qualify with some skills and move to Queensland where he has, he hopes, an opportunity to secure some accommodation and some employment. He made specific reference to the two victim impact statements and acknowledged the harm which he had brought about by the home invasion offence. He expressed his remorse for the crime he had committed and says he thinks about it every day. 

34I was assisted by both Mr T Edwards and Mr D I Curran in their submissions. Mr Curran appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

35The home invasion I have described as a shocking crime. It was indeed a shocking crime as is obvious from the description which I gave of how it came about and what happened to the victims. Mr Edwards however undertook a careful analysis of his client's role in that home invasion. He argued that the analysis supported the proposition that his client's conduct placed him towards the lower end of the range of seriousness for this kind of offence. That is the kind of assessment that I need to make, namely, how serious is the offence which Mr Bowden has committed compared with other examples of this crime? 

36Mr Edwards' analysis is correct. He pointed out his client did not use the baseball bat at all. He acknowledged he had entered the house contemplating grievous bodily harm because they were armed with knives. He pointed out his client had dropped one of his two knives and attempted to remove Mr Pavelec's knife from his hand. He mentioned his client had indicated to Mrs Pavelec that he did not want to hurt her. There are many cases which are far more serious examples than this. That is not to say the description of the crime as shocking is not appropriate, but I do accept his submission that his client's conduct in the crime, compared to the conduct of offenders who have committed other such crimes, falls within the lower end of the range of seriousness for such offences as this. 

37Mr Curran acknowledged that the co-offender did most of the damage and caused most of the injuries but he also pointed out correctly that Mr Bowden was the first to enter the house. Mr Edwards acknowledged realistically that there was an additional aggravation in that in going into the house, Mr Bowden, along with his co-offender, was armed with a knife. That was not one of the specific matters pleaded by the Crown so it could be relied upon as an additional aggravating factor. 

38Personally, about his client, Mr Edwards pointed out the circumstances of his childhood and the impact of the traumatic events surrounding his father's death. He pointed out the fact his client started using and abusing drugs and alcohol at such an early age meant that was probably related to circumstances beyond his control. It is clear the offences which Mr Bowden has committed in the past, and indeed these offences, are related to his substance abuse. Mr Edwards referred me to the remarks of Simpson J in the Court of Criminal Appeal guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R 149. I also take into account he has expressed genuine remorse. 

39Mr Edwards argued that his client's prospects of rehabilitation are good, despite his client's record. He pointed out that his client was engaged in employment in the prison and had taken on an education course, as well as a drug and alcohol programme and had a strong desire to rehabilitate himself. He also had a level of planning regarding the future. He undertook these courses whilst he was on remand, which is not an easy achievement. I see a good deal of force in those submissions. However, I would be more inclined to describe his prospects of rehabilitation as guarded. I hope they are good, and I was impressed by his evidence, but one has to be realistic because he has had problems in the past. But I do agree with Mr Edwards that his client has shown a lot of initiative whilst he has been on remand and appears to have plans in place for when he is eventually released. 

40Although Mr Bowden pleaded guilty to the especially aggravated break, enter and steal, the plea was very late. Mr Edwards realistically acknowledged a discount should range between 10 and 12½ per cent. Mr Curran thought it would be worth 10 per cent. I propose to discount the sentence by 10 per cent in due course. Mr Edwards argued there are special circumstances for altering the usual ratio between a full sentence and the non-parole period. Normally, a non-parole period is three-quarters of the full sentence but the non-parole period can be reduced and the parole period extended in special circumstances. 

41Mr Edwards pointed out this will be his client's longest period in custody so far. He will need a good deal of treatment, support and supervision when he is released and he referred me to Dr O'Dea's report. Mr Curran agreed there were special circumstances for making that adjustment to the non-parole period. Mr Edwards took me to a number of Court of Criminal Appeal decisions concerning especially aggravated break, enter and steal. They are R v Richard Fojt [2011] NSWCCA 20, Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259, R v Van Rysewyk [2008] NSWCCA 130 and R v Rossi-Murray [2009] NSWCCA 177. I was also provided with the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. Mr Edwards argued that the break, enter and steal at Mosman was at the bottom end of the range. I agree. He realistically acknowledged, however, that it should attract custody and needs to be accumulated to some extent on the sentence for the especially aggravated break, enter and steal. 

42Mr Curran pointed out that the home invasion offence tends to overshadow the others. The others are serious but the home invasion was extremely serious. He is right in that submission. As Mr Curran fairly pointed out, there was nothing remotely like this on Mr Bowden's record but that nevertheless it had to be a significantly lengthy sentence. 

43I am sentencing Mr Bowden for three offences. I will aggregate the sentences into one sentence but I need to indicate what the individual sentences would have been. 

44For the especially aggravated break, enter and steal I would regard an appropriate sentence, bearing in mind the matters which I have referred to, as 7 years imprisonment. I would discount that by 10 per cent, say 9 months, and reduce that sentence to 6 years and 3 months. The discount is because of the plea of guilty. 

45The aggravated break, enter and steal at Mosman: for that offence I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 5 years imprisonment. Mr Bowden pleaded guilty to that at the earliest available opportunity and I would discount that sentence by 25 per cent, so the sentence that I would fix for that crime is 3 years and 9 months. 

46Finally, for the car theft I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 2 years imprisonment. I would discount that by 25 per cent because of his plea of guilty and I would fix a sentence of 18 months imprisonment. 

47I would accumulate the larger sentences, obviously the 6 years and 3 months, for the especially aggravated break, enter and steal. I would accumulate the other two sentences to the extent that an overall sentence I would fix would be 8 years imprisonment. 

48For a sentence of 8 years imprisonment the normal non-parole period envisaged by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would be 6 years imprisonment. However, because of the special circumstances referred to by Mr Edwards, and acknowledged by Mr Curran, I would reduce the non-parole period to one of 5 years imprisonment. Hence I would fix an aggregate sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment.

49Mr Bowden, I fix a non-parole period of 5 years in this aggregate sentence to commence 29 May 2011. That expires on 28 May 2016. The balance of the sentence is 3 years, commencing on 29 May 2016 and expiring on 28 May 2019. The overall sentence is 8 years, starting when you were arrested on 29 May 2011, and the overall sentence finishes on 28 May 2019. The first date on which you are eligible for parole is after 5 years, 28 May 2016.

HIS HONOUR: There are a couple of things, the compulsory drug treatment - what's the section - do I recommend him for that?
CHAN: It will be section 5A of the Drug Court Act, which defines what eligible convicted offender is.
HIS HONOUR: Just give me that section again, Ms Chan?
CHAN: Section 5A.
HIS HONOUR: I need your help, both of you here, or particularly you Mr Payton. What do I do? Do I refer him--
CHAN: Well it appears by the time the Drug Court would assess him he may well be eligible for 3 years left of his non-parole period.
HIS HONOUR: He's eligible I think.
CHAN: I believe that he may be eligible, yes.
HIS HONOUR: No, I think he is. Mr Payton, what do you--
PAYTON: Yes, your Honour, I think it relates to the unexpired portion.
HIS HONOUR: It does, the unexpired portion is less than three years.
PAYTON: So I would ask your Honour to make that referral.

50Under s 18B of the Drug Court Act 1998 in my opinion there are grounds on which the Drug Court might find Mr Bowden to be an eligible convicted offender and I refer Mr Bowden to the Drug Court to determine whether he should be the subject of a compulsory drug treatment order. 

HIS HONOUR: I think that's all I need to do, is that right?
CHAN: I believe so, your Honour.
PAYTON: Your Honour, in relation to the material that might be sent to the Drug Court is it the case that the entirety of the court file--
HIS HONOUR: I don't know the answer to that. My guess is yes, but I don't know.
PAYTON: In order to remove any doubt, in relation to the psychiatric report prepared by Dr O'Dea, Mr Bowden provides his consent for that report to be provided to the Drug Court for that process of assessment.
HIS HONOUR: Thanks. The other thing I want his consent for - it's up to him whether he agrees or not and this might be encompassed by what you say - his classification. The prison authorities, who classify prisoners after they're sentenced, and he's now been sentenced, say that they are assisted by psychiatric or psychological material, and I ask Mr Edwards to get - or perhaps you--
PAYTON: Yes, that consent is also provided.
HIS HONOUR: Good. My associate will arrange to send a copy of Dr O'Dea's report to the classification section of Corrective Services.
PAYTON: Thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: I note your consent. I think the Drug Court would have all of the exhibits which are before me. All right. Now I will explain the sentence in a moment because I have to. I have given an aggregate sentence, I have fixed a sentence, I have specified what the individual sentences would be, I have referred him to the Drug--
PAYTON: Sorry, has your Honour indicated that your Honour took into account the Form 1 offences when--
HIS HONOUR: I did when I signed it, yes.
PAYTON: Yes, thank you.
HIS HONOUR: I did take that into account.

51In response to Mr Payton's query, I signed the Form 1 and indicated that when I was fixing the sentence for the aggravated break, enter and steal, or what the sentence would be when fixing it as 5 years, I took into account the matters on the Form 1.

HIS HONOUR: All right, is there anything else? Any other matters? I don't think so. Mr Payton?
PAYTON: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Bowden, I have given you one sentence for all three, you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: The three I've got to tell you what they would have been. You would have got 6 years and 3 months for the home invasion, you would have got 3 years and 9 months for the break and enter at Mosman and you would have got 18 months for the car theft, and I would have accumulated those a bit and given you an overall sentence of 8 years.
OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: So I have set just one sentence for all three crimes of 8 years and your non-parole period is 5, which by my calculations means you got that unexpired period which you can - it makes you an eligible convicted offender, well in my opinion it does, and I have made an order referring you to the Drug Court for that program.
OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: And the date on which you will be eligible for parole is 28 May 2016, do you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Anything else?
CHAN: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Keep up the good work, good luck.
OFFENDER: Thank you.

		10 September 2013",2013-06-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761766,R v Serour [2013] NSWDC 175,"Judgment
1Pierre Mina Serour stands for sentence as a consequence of having pleaded guilty to a charge that on 23 December 2011 at Kingsford in this State, being armed with an offensive weapon, he did enter the dwelling house of Jordan Sancin situated at 125 Houston Road with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, and while inside the said dwelling house did wound Jordan Sancin.  That is an offence contrary to s 111(3) of the Crimes Act 1900.  It is a very serious offence, as is reflected by the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament, imprisonment for twenty years.  The facts of the specially aggravated entering of a dwelling house are disturbing.  
2Jordan Sancin, who was aged forty-three, lived in a house in Houston Road, Kingsford.  He was a live-in carer for another man who lived at those premises who can be described merely as Richard.  Richard was elderly and had a number of health problems.  Despite his age and frailty, Richard was a man who on occasions had engaged in the possession and supply of prohibited drugs.  
3On the evening of 23 December 2011, Mr Sancin was at home alone as Richard had gone out to play cards with friends.  At about 10.30 Mr Sancin was getting ready for bed when he heard a knock at the front door.  He elected not to answer the door because he was not expecting any visitors.  
4A few minutes later he heard a noise outside the house.  He walked down the hallway and looked into the bathroom.  He noticed that the window was fully open, which he thought was odd because it was normally only ever left partially open.  As he was about to walk into a bathroom to inspect the situation, he was struck on his head and chest several times with a metal baseball bat wielded by the current offender.  The offender then ran to the front door and admitted another man, whose identity remains unknown, into the house.  That man was a co-offender.  
5Mr Sancin was told to sit down in a chair in the dining room.  The offender asked him where were the drugs and where was the money, or words to that effect.  Mr Sancin said that he did not know, that he merely lived in the house.  The offender then went through several rooms searching obviously for drugs and/or money.  Whilst that was happening, the co-offender was standing over Mr Sancin again making demands for valuables and pointing out to Mr Sancin that the co-offender and the offender did not want to leave the house ""empty-handed"".  The offender then returned to where Mr Sancin was sitting and threatened further harm if he did not help the offender and his co-offender find what they wanted to find.  Again Mr Sancin pleaded with the offender that he did not know where any drugs or money were kept.  
6The offender and the co-offender then continued to search through the house for about twenty minutes.  The offender then returned to Mr Sancin and hit him with the baseball bat in the eye area a couple of times.  He was then hit again with a bat on the back of his head and on his knees.  Mr Sancin then asked to be allowed to call an ambulance, promising not to call the police.  The offender and the other male then left the house.  
7Mr Sancin called for the ambulance, which arrived shortly thereafter as did the police.  While he was waiting for the ambulance to arrive Mr Sancin looked about the house and noticed that his two mobile phones were missing as well as his wristwatch.  The offender asks me to take into account on a Form 1 the larceny of those objects.  
8Mr Sancin was taken to St Vincent's Hospital.  He was attended to in casualty by Dr Kirsty Short at five minutes to midnight.  Dr Short found a 2-centimetre laceration 3 centimetres above the victim's left eyebrow.  She also found a 1-centimetre laceration immediately above the left eyebrow.  There was a boggy swelling to the left occipito-parietal region with two overlying lacerations each 4 centimetres long, that is, a laceration on the top of the scalp on the left-hand side.  There was a black eye of the left eye.  There were abrasions to the victim's left loin and buttock.  He also had contusions of both forearms and his left knee and there was swelling and tenderness of his right wrist.  A CT scan of the brain and the cervical spine were carried out but they revealed no abnormality.  There was no suggestion that there were any broken bones.  One of the lacerations was glued and the remaining lacerations needed stitching.  The victim was discharged from the hospital on the following day, Christmas Eve.  
9There is in evidence a victim impact statement from Mr Sancin.  He recounts much of what any informed observer would realise about somebody who has been assaulted in the way that Mr Sancin was.  He has suffered from anxiety, stress and depression.  He has been made angry.  He now mistrusts people.  He exhibits hypervigilance when hearing noises from people around him or from people entering any building in which he is.  The final statement in the victim impact statement is this:  ""I spent so much time doing volunteer work for the Salvation Army and helping needy people and this is what I get.  Not fair"".  The inference to be drawn is that Mr Sancin was acting as Richard's carer because of his voluntary work for the Salvation Army.  No doubt the job as a carer gave Mr Sancin perhaps free accommodation but still his work appeared to have been voluntary.  
10The circumstances of aggravation and circumstances of special aggravation for this offence are set out in s 105A of the Crimes Act.  There are three circumstances of special aggravation.  They can shortly be described as intentional wounding or intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm, recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, and being armed with a dangerous weapon.  Merely being armed with a dangerous weapon is not, in my view, as serious as intentional wounding.  
11The circumstances of aggravation are six in number.  That pleaded is being armed with an offensive weapon, namely the baseball bat.  However, there are here other circumstances of aggravation.  For example, the offender was in company.  The offender also deprived the victim of his liberty, he was kept locked in the house for at least twenty minutes when the house was being searched by the offender and his co-offender.  The sixth circumstance of aggravation is that the alleged offender knows that there is a person or that there are persons in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed.  Under subs (2A), if there was a person in the place in relation to which the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time the offence was committed, the accused is presumed to have known that fact unless he satisfies the Court to the contrary.  The offender has not sought to establish that he did not believe that there was anybody at home.  Indeed the fact that he entered the house with a metal baseball bat is only consistent with the fact that he anticipated that he might encounter somebody in the house.  
12The additional circumstances of aggravation can be taken into account as aggravating factors at common law, making the especially aggravated offence even worse.  
13Furthermore, there are other aggravating factors within s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  Here the wounding involved the actual use of a weapon.  Wounding can be inflicted without the use of a weapon.  A split lip can amount to a wound and such a wounding can be caused by a punch.  
14There is also the aggravating factor that this crime was carried out in the home of the victim.  Every member of our community expects to be safe and sound in his or her own home.  For a crime of violence to be inflicted upon someone in his or her own home is clearly an aggravating factor.  It is a moot point here whether harm suffered by the victim was substantial.  Physically, one would not expect there to be any long-term sequelae from lacerations; however, psychic trauma suffered by the victim can persist indefinitely.  The evidence does not permit me to find that the harm was substantial but it is something that in any event I must consider.
15The final aggravating factor is that this offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty.  He was on a bond at the time to be of good behaviour, a bond for two years imposed by the Local Court at Kogarah on 4 April 2011.  Both under the statute and at common law the commission of an offence when a person was at conditional liberty is an aggravating factor.
16There are a number of disturbing features about what can be essentially described as an armed home invasion.  The first is that the victim was not given any opportunity of surrendering by the offender.  The offender merely attacked him with a baseball bat without any warning.  The offender and his co-offender then persisted in their search of the premises for at least 20 minutes in which the victim obviously would have been in fear.  The prolongation of the invasion is significant.  The offender then again attacked the victim with the baseball bat to try to obtain further information.
17All of these facts are extremely disturbing.  In R v Kenny Li (unreported, NSWCCA, 9 July 1997) Abadeen J pointed out that offenders convicted of home invasion offences can expect to receive severe and condign punishment from the Courts in order to protect the public and in particular to protect citizens of this state who are lawfully in their own home.
18Anyone with any experience of the criminal law would know that it was highly likely that the reason for this home invasion was to obtain drugs or money with which to buy drugs to support a drug habit.  This is exactly what occurred in the current case.  The offender had an expensive drug habit.  At the time that he committed these offences he was affected by marijuana, a prescribed drug Xanax, which he abused, and cocaine.  The offender told Ms Caroline Hare, a psychologist, that on the day of this offence the drugs had made him ""ruthless.""  His drug ingestion also caused him not to care about the consequences of what he was doing.  However, that can be no excuse in law for what the offender did.
19Of the personal circumstances of the offender much can be said.  It countermands to some extent the seriousness of the offence committed by this offender.  Despite having what looks like a French name, the offender's parents are both Coptic Orthodox Egyptians who raised the offender in Sydney.  He is one of three siblings.  He has an older sister who is shortly to marry and a younger brother who is five years his junior.  The offender's father was a violent man.  The offender witnessed domestic violence being perpetrated by his father on his mother on a regular basis and was himself the victim of domestic violence perpetrated by his father when he attempted to ""stand up"" to his father.
20The offender told Ms Hare that he recalled a particular incident when he saw his sister and mother hiding under a bed whilst his father kicked the bedroom door down and entered the room looking as if he would kill his mother and sister.  On one occasion the offender's father had used a statue to strike him, causing the offender a serious wound.  On that occasion the police needed to be called.  The offender's parents separated when he was nine and it appears that there has been no contact between the offender and his father since.
21The offender then took on the role of the man of the house.  He adopted the values that his father had and, no doubt, had inherited from his Egyptian background.  That is, that a woman's place is in the home, that the man must protect and rule, and the man must be strong and show no emotion.  This appears to have led the offender both into drug use and into mental health problems.  The psychologist, Ms Hare, provided this ""formulation"":
""Mr Serour impressed as a young man who had experienced repeated violence within the home during his early childhood.  He was exposed to poor parental modelling.  He failed to develop secure attachments with primary care givers due to the abuse he experienced.  He appeared to feel pressure to be the 'man of the house' following his parent's eventual separation and engaged in this role by modelling the types of attitudes and behaviours he had observed in his father, which included apparent misogynist beliefs.  Lack of exposure to appropriate modelling by his caregivers left Mr Serour unable to manage his emotions and lacking skills to develop mutually supportive interpersonal relationships.  He subsequently experienced significant interpersonal difficulties resulting in volatile relationships and ultimately leaving him socially isolated.
Mr Serour appears to have engaged with substance misuse in response to a number of stressors, including:  being unable to pursue his soccer career overseas and therefore 'giving up'; being unable to meet the expectation of others; an associated sense of failure/low self worth; peer influence; and self medication to regulate his emotions.  Subsequently, he became increasingly embroiled in antisocial subculture as a result of being unsuccessful in studies, not gaining a place at university or maintaining stable employment, ongoing misuse of substances, lack of finances, and feeling accepted by his antisocial peers rather than feeling judged and found wanting.  Polysubstance abuse has been a consistent problem for Mr Serour since the age of 14 and appears to have impacted upon his life across a range of areas, including his mental and physical health.  Identifying whether psychological issues preceded, or resulted, from his substance misuse is challenging.  However, the types of behaviours described above, his presentation in interview, and the results of the psychometric testing are suggestive of personality difficulties.  
Mr Serour appeared to commit the index offences in the above context.  The offences were more immediately triggered by his need for finances to buy drugs, his general impulsivity and lack of consequential thinking, and his antisocial attitudes linked to his negative peer associations, which allowed him to override any inhibition to committing the offences.""
I accept that formulation as being accurate.  Earlier in her report, Ms Hare had listed the offender as having a number of dysfunctional personality traits, including problems regulating his emotions and associated aggression/hostility, impulsivity and risk taking behaviours and unstable personal relationships.  The offender cannot be held accountable for his dysfunctional upbringing, the actions of his father.  To the extent that his personality traits reflect his dysfunctional upbringing, the offender cannot be held morally culpable.
22The offender commenced drinking alcohol at the age of 14.  He tended to binge drink at weekends and on occasions would even go to school drunk.  However, he was dissuaded from binge drinking alcohol at the age of 16 when he saw friends of his having their stomachs pumped.  Instead he turned, excessively, to smoking cannabis, which he had also started to smoke at the age of 14.  He has been smoking daily since the age of 18 at least up until he was taken into custody when arrested on 8 June 2012.  He was smoking up to an ounce of cannabis per day.
23Between the ages of 16 and 19, the offender used methamphetamine approximately every second day.  However, at the age of 19 he replaced methamphetamine with cocaine.  He commenced snorting cocaine at the age of 17 and, by the age of 19, smoking it.  However, he did not give up taking ice completely and would take it once a week from the age of 21.  He started misusing Xanax at the age of 14.  The offender has, since being taken into custody, given up all illicit drug taking.
24A 14 year old boy - and I use the word ""boy"" advisedly although most 14 year olds would present such usage - cannot foresee the likely effect of starting drug use and becoming addicted to drugs.  It would appear that the offender was addicted to drugs before he finished school.  By starting to take drugs at age 14, the offender made a poor choice but a choice that many young people unfortunately make.  It is different if, for example, a person takes up drug use after reaching maturity.  Again, that attenuates the offender's culpability for his drug taking somewhat.
25I accept that the offender is contrite.  He wrote a letter to me, which became exhibit 9.  He gave sworn evidence and I was impressed by his evidence.  In his letter he said this:
""Daily, I put myself in the shoes of Mr Jordan Sancin, and I had become completely horrified every time.  I can only imagine the terror he went through that evening.  I am very sorry for my actions, and I always want to try and find a way to help Mr Sancin and also let him know how remorseful I really am.""
He displays true victim empathy, which is what the Court always seeks in looking for remorse and contrition.  The Court is hardly impressed by self pity or pity, for example, for family members who feel let down by an offender's behaviour.  The Court always looks for empathy with the victims of the crime so that the offender understands the nature of what he has done.
26The offender has realistic plans and insight.  In the same letter he said this: ""After being in custody and choosing to stay away from these people [anti social peers], and remaining drug free, I have realised that, the drugs and the crowd of people I was mixed in with, had a major influence on all the wrong decisions and poor choices I had made in my life.""
Later in his letter he went on to tell me that since becoming drug-free in custody was the first time in his life that he acknowledged that he needed serious help.  Such help can be provided by counselling and drug and alcohol rehabilitation whilst in custody. 27The offender originally pleaded not guilty to perhaps a more serious charge.  He was committed for trial in this Court by the Local Court on 16 June 2012.  He was arraigned on 16 November 2012 and a trial date was fixed for Monday 15 April 2013.  On the following day, the offender pleaded guilty to the offence for which he now stands for sentence.  The plea must be seen as a late plea of guilty and only attracts a discount of 10%.  
28The prospects for rehabilitation are good, provided that the offender maintains his resolve to stay away from drugs and alcohol and to stay away from a poor peer group.  He told me of his efforts to do so in the witness box.  However, when he is released from custody there will be greater temptations than he might now have in custody.  There would be a prolonged need for supervision by the Community Offender Service to ensure that the offender maintains his resolve to stay away from drugs and a poor peer group.  In other words, there are grounds for finding special circumstances.
29I must balance the seriousness of the offence against the offender's personal circumstances.  This is the most difficult part of sentencing.  Statistics available from the Judicial Commission provide little assistance.  They record only 29 cases in which the sentence has been passed under s 111(3).  One offender obtained a suspended sentence.  One offender was sentenced to periodic detention.  27 offenders were sentenced to imprisonment.  There were only 16 non-consecutive sentences.  The median head sentence is three and a half years and, much to my surprise, the median non-parole period is only one and a half years.  At the top of the 80% range, the head sentence is six years and the non-parole period is three years.
30I have determined that the appropriate starting point for this sentencing exercise is a head sentence of five years imprisonment.  I discount that by 10%, which reduces the head sentence to four years and six months.  That should theoretically give me a non-parole period of three years and four months but it in my view, the more appropriate non-parole period, bearing in mind my finding of special circumstances, is three years imprisonment.
No one wants any further reasons do they?  In passing that, I have not formally passed sentence but I take into account him making those findings of matter and that is on the Form 1.  No one wants any further reasons do they?EVENDER:  No your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  Now three years takes him to 5 June 2015.  What is one and a half years after that - 5 December 2016, is it - 5/12/16?  So those dates are right - 6/6/12 to 5/6/15 and then to 5/12/16.
31Pierre Mina Serour, on the charge that on 23 December 2011 at Kingsford in this State, whilst being armed with an offensive weapon, you did enter the dwelling house of Jordan Sancin, situated at 125 Houston Road, with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, and while you were inside the said dwelling house you did wound Jordan Sancin, you are convicted.  I sentence you to imprisonment.  I set a non-parole period of three years commencing on 6 June 2012 and expiring on 5 June 2015.  I impose a further period of imprisonment of one and a half years, to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 5 December 2016.  The total sentence is therefore four and a half years, comprising the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence.  I have found special circumstances.  You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.  I have taken into account the matter on the Form 1 in passing that sentence.  It is a term of your release to parole that you obey all reasonable directions of Community Offender Service regarding drug and alcohol rehabilitation, counselling and testing.
32Any other orders sought?EVENDEN:  No your Honour.  Sorry, could I just have a moment with?HIS HONOUR:  Certainly yes.EVENDEN:  Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  Good luck, Mr Serour.

		19 September 2013",2013-06-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761768,Mallegowda v Sood [2013] NSWDC 98,"Judgment

1On 12 June 2013 I heard an argument about the form and capacity of the imputations in the two publications the subject of these proceedings. In the course of that argument I made additional orders concerning documents produced under subpoenae in the Newcastle Registry of the District Court, including the bringing of any application for early access to those documents by the defendants, who issued the subpoenae in question. The orders I made on 12 June 2013 were as follows: 

(1)Defendants' application to strike out proposed imputations 1(a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k) and 2(a), (c) and (d) dismissed.

(2)Proposed imputation (j)(i) not conveyed.

(3)Defendants' application to strike out proposed particular (b) of the particulars of aggravated damages dismissed.

(4)The plaintiff has leave to file a Third Further Amended Statement of Claim to include the above imputations, any replaced imputation (j)(i), the proposed additional particulars of aggravated damages, and to delete the extraneous material at the head and foot of the matter complained of, within 7 days.

(5)Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 21 June 2013 at 9.30am.

(6)On 21 June 2013 the defendants are to indicate any further objection to the Third Further Amended Statement of Claim and, in the absence of further objections, the parties are to agree on a timetable for the filing of a defence and any cross-claim and a range of mutually convenient dates for a court mediation.

(7)Any notice of motion in relation to the subpoenae issued in these proceedings is to be returnable for 21 June 2013, but in the event that no such notice of motion is filed the court will return all documents produced on subpoena to their owners.

(8)Defendants pay plaintiff's costs of the application today.

2This judgment deals with two matters. The first is an application to strike out the statement of claim or alternatively to strike out portions of the pleadings, including the imputations, pursuant to rr 13.6 and 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2004 (NSW) (""UCPR""). These are my reasons for the orders that I made on 12 June 2013. I delayed providing reasons for decision until the expiry of the time for the defendants to comply with order 7, namely today.

3The issue raised by order 7 in the orders I made on 12 June 2013 is a case management issue, namely what is to happen to documents produced under subpoena by the Hunter New England Area Health Service and John Hunter Hospital produced pursuant to subpoenae issued by the defendants on 1 March 2013 and the subject of an outstanding Notice of Motion to set aside the subpoenae filed on 18 March 2013. 

4I shall deal first with the application to challenge the form and capacity of the imputations and particular (b) of the aggravated compensatory damages claim.

The imputations pleaded to arise in the matters complained of

5There are two publications, which are emails sent to members of an Indian community organisation in the Newcastle area. The imputations pleaded to arise from the 21 September 2012 publication (the first matter complained of) are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff is a false accuser (the entire matter but particularly paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 22, 24 and 25);

(b)The plaintiff is dishonest (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);

(c)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of corrupt or fraudulent conduct in that they misused IAN resources and funds to benefit their own needs (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);

(d)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of misusing his position as IAN treasurer in that Amit Sood collected funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function based upon a false promise to promote their business (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1,2, 3,4, 5, 6,18, 19,20,21,22,24,25);

(e)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of misusing his position as IAN treasurer in that Amit Sood collected funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function for which Amit Sood did not account to the IAN or the sponsors (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);

(f)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of forcing out two members of the IAN committee in an attempt to keep their corrupt conduct hidden (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(g)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of misusing public funds (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(h)The plaintiff sends vicious emails in order to sow the seeds of suspicion in the community against Amit Sood and Amit Karla (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(i)The plaintiff is deceiving the members of IAN by trying to cover up his involvement with a group of people who send vicious emails in order to sow the seeds of suspicion in the community against Amit Sood and Amit Karla (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(j)[see (i) or (ii)]

(i)The plaintiff falsely claims to be a true believer in Lord Ganesha when his actions are so malicious (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24);

(ii)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of not being a true believer in Lord Ganesha because his actions were so malicious (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24);

(k)[see (i) or (ii)]

(i)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of maliciously trying to divide the Indian Community in the name of Lord Ganesh Festival (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24);

(ii)The plaintiff is maliciously trying to divide the Indian Community in the name of Lord Ganesh Festival (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25).

6The imputations pleaded to arise from the 24 September 2012 publication (the second matter complained of) are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff has caused Amit Sood trauma by maliciously responding to his hard work with a vicious brickbat (the entire matter but specifically lines 1-4);

(b)The plaintiff is a villain (the entire matter but specifically lines 19 - 22);

(c)The plaintiff sent a slanderous email about Amit Sood (the entire matter but specifically lines 23-24);

(d)The plaintiff has been deceiving the members of IAN by hiding his involvement with a group of people who sent a slanderous email about Amit Sood (the entire matter but specifically lines 23-26).

The particulars of aggravated damages

7The particulars of aggravated damages, particular (b) of which was also challenged, are:

(a)the falsity of the imputations;

(b)the conduct of the defendants in falsely attributing to the plaintiff the publication of a libellous email in order to stop members of the Indian Community from attending the plaintiffs Ganesha Festival and instead to attend their rival Ganesha Festival.

8The structure of the matters complained of is unusual. The plaintiff's claim is that the defendants created a false email purporting to have been sent by the plaintiff attacking the defendants. The matters complained of purport to be the defendants' responses to this email. 

9An additional complication is that the matters complained of, which consist of disputes concerning religious and cultural matters known to the recipients, members of an Indian community group, are not commonly known, which means that a degree of explanation for the benefit of the court is required. Earlier drafts of the statement of claim attempted to include such material. Perhaps as a result, the pleadings have something of a confused history. 

10The original statement of claim filed on 12 November 2012 was prepared by the plaintiff, who at the time was a litigant in person. That document, and the amended statement of claim, were struck out as non-compliant without any analysis of their contents. On 29 January 2013 orders were made by consent for the plaintiff's legal representatives to file a further amended statement of claim. When the matter was first listed in the Defamation List on 22 March 2013, a further draft pleading was provided and filed on 26 April 2013. The defendants complained that this document was filed without leave and without prior service of a draft and the matter was listed for argument.

11On Friday 3 May 2013, the defendants successfully obtained orders striking out the statement of claim in its entirety, without any consideration of imputations or other pleading issues, on the basis that it was hopeless on its face. On Friday 3 May 2013, Bozic SC DCJ made the following orders and notations:

(1)The second further amended statement of claim is struck out.

(2)The plaintiff is to serve on the solicitors for the defendants a draft further amended statement of claim by 24 May 2013.

(3)The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of complaining about the pleadings, and the costs of the motions filed and the appearances in the defamation list to date.

(4)I note that the outstanding issues regarding the plaintiff's notice to produce and access to the documents produced on subpoena are to be stood over to be dealt with after the close of pleadings.

(5)The matter is stood over for directions in the defamation list at 9.30am on Friday 7 June 2013.

12In accordance with these orders a draft further amended statement of claim was served by the due date.

13The defendants raised extensive objections to this pleading in their letter of 5 June 2013, to the current pleading. This included a claim that the particulars of aggravated damages were liable to be struck out for failure to comply with the judgment of Bozic SC DCJ, conduct which was described by the solicitors for the defendants as ""remarkable"". In addition, spelling errors, use of paragraph numbers for the passages giving rise to the imputations, complaints of ""weasel words"" and impermissible terms such as ""falsely claims"" were raised as matters warranting the striking out of the pleadings as well as an order for costs payable forthwith. 

14These claims have now been abandoned. The sole remaining issues are:

(a)Objections to the form and capacity of the imputations; 

(b)Removal of extraneous email address material from the top of the first matter complained of; and,

(c)Objections to failure to comply with rr 15.8, 15.9 and 15.32(a) UCPR in relation to particular (b) of the claim for aggravated damages.

Form and capacity of the imputations

15The objections to the imputations pleaded as arising from the first matter complained of are:

(a)Imputations 2(c) - 2(g), 2(j)(i) and 2(j)(ii) and 2(k)(i) do not differ in substance from 2(a). All of those except 2(a) are ""redundant"". 

(b)Imputations 2(h) and 2(i) do not differ in substance. Alternatively, 2(i) contains two imputations, firstly of the plaintiff deceiving the members of IAN by trying to cover up his involvement with a group of people, and secondly of the plaintiff being involved with a group of people who send vicious emails in order to sow the seeds of suspicion in the community against Amit Sood and Amit Karla.

(c)Imputation 2(j)(ii) is incapable of arising. 

(d)Imputations 2(j)(i) and 2(j)(ii) are objected to on the basis that the act or condition ascribed to the plaintiff is ""unclear"". Each is asserted to contain two imputations; in the case of 2(j)(i), an imputation of behaving maliciously does not differ in substance from imputation 2(h).

(e)Imputation 2(k)(i) is not capable of arising.

(f)Imputation 2(k)(ii) does not differ in substance from imputation 2(h).

16The objections to the imputations pleaded as arising from the second matter complained of are:

(a)Imputations 4(a) and 4(c) are objected to as not differing in substance.

(b)Imputation 4(d) is objected to as incapable of arising in the absence of any allegation that the plaintiff has been deceiving the members of IAN.

Imputations 2(c) - 2(g), 2(j)(i) and 2(j)(ii) and 2(k)(i)

17In his oral submissions to me, Mr Connell for the defendants submitted that imputation 2(a) should be the sole imputation pleaded on the basis that it ""covers the field"". Other imputations should not be permitted. It was further submitted that imputations of an act (""the plaintiff stole money"") and a condition (""the plaintiff is a thief"") do not differ in substance.

18Whether the plaintiff's imputations ""cover the field"" is a term generally used to determine whether there are imputations left unpleaded by the plaintiff which the defendant may then plead as contextual imputations: Kelly v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 9; McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 224 at 68. The fact that a plaintiff pleads a broad imputation (often called a ""Maisel"" imputation: Maisel v Financial Times Ltd [1915] 112 LT 953) does not prevent the pleading of a specific allegation, and in particular does not prevent the plaintiff from pleading imputations of an act (""the plaintiff stole money"") and at the same time as an imputation of a condition (""the plaintiff is a thief"").

19The entitlement of a party to plead imputations comprising both an act and a condition is of longstanding. In Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 20 February 1980) Hunt J stated:

""Imputation (b) is conceded by the plaintiff to be no more than a particular instance of the general allegation made by Imputation (a). In the light of this concession, the defendant argues that the two imputations are not different in substance, as required by r11(3). As any imputation pleaded must be taken to include all other imputations which do not differ in substance (Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1977) 2 NSWLR 749, at 771), it is wrong in principle, it is said, to plead both the general and the particular applications of the same allegation.

In my view, such a principle is stated too broadly. It may be tested by considering what must be proved by way of justification to each such imputation. One of the most oft-quoted cases is that of Bishop v Latimer (1861) 4 LT (NS) 775. The heading to the defendant's report was in the terms: ""How Lawyer Bishop treats his clients"". Proof that the plaintiff had treated one client badly in one particular case was held to be an insufficient justification of the heading, which implied that he so treated his clients generally (at 775).

Another way by which the principle contended for by the defendant may be tested is by considering whatmay be proved by way of justification to each such imputation. Where the imputation consists of a general allegation, it is open to the defendant to establish the truth of that allegation by proof of matters entirely unrelated to the specific instance identified in the matter complained of. The leading case is of Maisel v Financial Times Ltd (1915) 112 LT 953. The matter complained of reported the arrest of the plaintiff, the director of a company, on a charge of fraud. In his Statement of Claim, the plaintiff relied upon an imputation that he was an unfit person to be the director of any company. The defendant was held by the House of Lords to be entitled to justify that imputation by relying upon a number of other dishonest acts, quite independent of that for which he was said in the matter complained of to have been arrested. For an even more startling example, see McGrath v Black (1926) 135 LT 594.

The question is whether the general allegation is different in substance from the particular. In most cases, in my opinion, it would be. In many cases, the allegation in the matter complained of that the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct on a particular occasion will not support an imputation alleged in general terms.""

20Mr Connell submitted that Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd, supra, does not permit such a procedure, and drew my attention to Hunt J's discussion of Bishop v Latimer (1861) 4 LT (NS) 775.

21The clear and concise language of Hunt J in Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd, supra, has long been accepted as permitting pleadings of this kind: Tucker v Echo Publications Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 239 at [8] - [10]; see also Lucas v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 950; Griffith v Australian Broadcasting Corp [2002] NSWSC 86; Saint v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 312; Loo v Rural Press Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 107. In Bishop v Latimer the objection was that one act was not sufficient for there to be a condition pleaded as well as the imputation of the one act (in Bishop v Latimer, the manner in which a solicitor treated one of his clients). There are multiple allegations made against the plaintiff in these proceedings, so this exception to the rule does not arise.

22This being the sole basis upon which these imputations are objected to, I find that each of these imputations is capable of arising. This is a publication which has not held back from making allegations about the plaintiff, and there is ample material in the matter complained of to give rise to each of these specific acts as well as the conditions pleaded.

Imputations 2(h) and 2(i)

23The objection to imputations 2(h) and 2(i) is firstly that they do not differ in substance and secondly that imputation 2(i) which relies upon imputation 2(h) being established, thereby includes material amounting to a second imputation. 

24Using the test of what must be proved for each imputation (referred to by Hunt J in Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd, supra), imputation 2(h) requires proof of sending vicious emails concerning the persons named, while imputation 2(i) would require proof of a cover-up of the activities of the plaintiff. I am satisfied that these imputations differ in substance. 

25I do not consider the repetition of the words ""vicious emails"" in imputation 2(i) to require a separate pleading of an imputation. If imputation 2(h) (which refers to the vicious emails) fails, then imputation 2(i) would fail as a matter of course. 

Imputations 2(j)(i) and 2(j)(ii)

26The only imputation which requires revision is imputation 2(j)(ii) which counsel for the plaintiff withdrew, on the basis that he wished to replead it with more clarity. It is therefore not necessary for me to deal with the objection to imputation 2(j)(ii).

The second matter complained of - Imputations 4(a) and 4(c) 

27Imputation 4(a) pleads the general response of the plaintiff; imputation 4(c) pleads that the plaintiff sent a slanderous email. I note that the phrase ""vicious brickbat"" is to be pleaded in the plural. Viewed in context of the matter complained of, these imputations clearly capture different actions by the plaintiff and therefore differ in substance. Imputation 4(c) is restricted to the sending of the slanderous email, while imputation 4(a) refers to the many wrongs the plaintiff has allegedly done. 

Imputation 4(d)

28This email, although pleaded as the second matter complained of, is the email which the defendants, in the first matter complained of, purported to be answering. It is initially confusing to read because it is apparently intended to make the readers believe the plaintiff is its author.

29I had trouble understanding the objections of the defendants to imputation 4(d), which clearly arises from the matter complained of, as this email effectively states that the plaintiff has been deceiving the members of IAM. 

30Mr Rasmussen questioned whether extrinsic facts may need to be pleaded (written submissions, paragraph 9), but the imputation is capable of arising in the natural and ordinary meaning of the second matter complained of, when read on its own. 

31Mr Connell did not suggest that there should be extrinsic facts to identify readers of the second matter complained of who had understood the plaintiff was identified. In practical terms, since the contents of this publication are repeated in the first matter complained of, and then followed by the defendants' ""answers"", and the emails are sent to the same persons, this may be one of those rare cases where no particulars of identification are necessary. 

32The remaining issue is the question of particular (b) in the claim for aggravated damages.

Objections to particular (b) in the claim for aggravated damages

33The defendants' objections to particular (b) on the basis that it fails to comply with rr 15.8, 15.9 and 15.32(a) UCPR are as follows:

(a)UCPR r 15.9 specifically requires the particulars to be subscribed to the pleading or otherwise furnished in a filed document.

(b)The particulars which are required to be given should not be merely a statement of a conclusion; see Harrigan v Jones [2000] NSWSC 814 at [13] and authorities referred to therein.

(c)The facts, matters and circumstances which the plaintiff proposes, by evidence to prove must be given. Only then, having done so, the plaintiff may state the conclusion which he assert the evidence will support or the submission which will be made upon these matters being proved by evidence; Harrigan v Jones at [14]. 

(d)It is not appropriate for the plaintiff to give inadequate particulars in the expectation that the deficiency can be cured by correspondence; Harrigan v Jones at [21].

(e)That is all the more the case here where there has been so much delay occasioned in pleading the statement of claim.

(f)Particular (b) rises no higher than particular 7 in Harrigan v Jones, which was struck out; see [68] - [70].

(g)Particular (b) is additionally objectionable because it can be read as alleging a conspiracy between the defendants, again without any particulars of the facts, matters and circumstances relied upon.

34Sending an email in another person's name is comparable to sending an anonymous email (and I note that the first email was in fact sent without a name, something that is made much of in the second email). In Megna v Marshall [2010] NSWSC 686 at 680 Simpson J noted the entitlement of a party to rely upon such conduct to seek aggravated damages. I note the plaintiff has now provided a fuller pleading of the basis upon which the claim is made.

35As to the complaint that there has been ""so much delay"" occasioned by pleading the statement of claim, these delays have been contributed to by the defendants. The defendants have brought unnecessary heat into these proceedings by seeking orders for the previous statement of claim to be struck out without any consideration of its merits, and by seeking orders in this application for costs to be payable forthwith.

Removal of extraneous material

36The defendants also submitted, in relation to the first matter complained of, ""[t]he extraneous material"" at the top of page 1 (email addresses from the persons who forwarded this email to the plaintiff) should be removed. The plaintiff has agreed to do so. It is not necessary for the purposes of the statement of claim, but the document tendered at the trial will contain this information, so I am inclined to consider the defendants' objections to be of relatively minor importance.

Early issue of subpoenae and notices to produce

37The subpoenae and notice to produce referred to in order 4 made by Bozic SC DCJ should not have been issued without leave. Parties generally may not seek documents (whether by discovery or otherwise) in a ""fishing expedition"" prior to filing a pleading or answering particulars of the pleadings (W. A. Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1980) ATPR 40-163; Associated Dominion Assurance Society Pty Ltd v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1955) 72 WN. (NSW) 250). This is particularly the case in defamation, where subpoenae to third parties may not be issued at an early stage without the leave of the court (Scott v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 169 at [8] - [10]); such leave is granted only after careful review of the nature of the documents sought from the non-party: Buswell v Carles [2012] WASC 509.

38The subpoenae the subject of the Notice of Motion filed on 18 March 2013 seek documents of wide generality and some sensitivity. The solicitor who has sworn the affidavit in support states, and I agree, that hospital records for the plaintiff for the period ""1 January 2007 and 18 February 2013"" can have no relevance to these proceedings. This would not be apparent to the busy hospitals which answer subpoenae of this kind as part of their administrative activities, generally for the purpose of personal injury proceedings. However this is not a personal injury matter, and counsel for the defendants conceded that such documents would have little or nothing to do with the issues in these proceedings, no matter when they were issued. 

39Mr Connell concedes that the medical material must be returned, but has told me this morning that another 18 subpoenae have been issued in the Newcastle Registry (and possibly the Sydney Registry as well), principally for Telstra and other email and telephone-related entities, and that these documents had been inspected by his clients. He did not have copies of these subpoenae available. He thought some had been issued by the plaintiff as well as the defendants.

40The plaintiff, no doubt in response to the many subpoenae issued by the defendant, issued the defendants with a Notice to Produce (which is impermissible: NSW Commissioner of Police v Tuxford [2002] NSWCA 139), and filed a Notice of Motion on 30 April 2013 seeking the leave of the court to issue subpoenae. He was, however, a litigant in person at the time, acting in response to a procedure he observed being used by his opponents. Furthermore, he correctly sought leave to issue subpoenae, unlike the solicitors for the defendants.

41Mr Connell submitted that these subpoenae were ""issued by the court"", not by the parties. I do not accept this submission. The parties, not the court, determine what subpoenae should be issued. The court stamp provides the court's imprimatur, but that makes it all the more important that such a procedure should not be misused.

42Mr Connell submitted that he did not understand my order to apply to all documents, and thought that it only applied to the documents the subject of the Notice of Motion filed by the plaintiff's former solicitors. He had thought my concern was that the Newcastle registry was being cluttered with subpoenae for proceedings listed for case management in Sydney. That is not the case; my concern is that these subpoenae have been used as a substitute for discovery (as many of the telephone and computer records, and all of the health records, are those of the plaintiff) as well as being issued prematurely.

43Mr Connell asked for an extension of time in which to bring an application for leave to retain these documents, on the basis that his clients would be put to the trouble of having to issue further subpoenae for the hearing.

44The court's process must be protected, and applications for early production of documents under subpoena should be made in the recognised way. It was for this reason that I made the orders in order 7 requiring the defendants to embark upon the procedure set out in Buswell v Carles, supra, on the understanding that if no Notice of Motion were filed, the court would return the documents produced. No Notice of Motion has been filed returnable today, and the defendants were already on notice as to the objections by the plaintiff to the issuing of these subpoenae. The documents should not remain in the registry any longer; all documents produced will accordingly be returned. 

45While judges should only raise matters not the subject of any application by the parties, protection of the court's process, of which the use of subpoenae is such a vital part, warrants such intervention in clear cases such as the present.

46The issue of any costs thrown away may be dealt with in accordance with the earlier orders of Bozic SC DCJ.

47I have made provision, in the timetable, for any cross-claim the defendants intend to bring. Mr Connell indicated that he was waiting on an expert report concerning the authorship of the second matter complained of, but that the likelihood was that its provenance being disputed was not high. Nevertheless, I have given his clients this opportunity to bring any cross-claim if they wish to assert that the author of the second matter complained of is indeed the plaintiff.

		26 June 2013",2013-06-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761776,Andrews v Ardler & Brown [2013] NSWDC 94,"Judgment

Introduction

1The appellant (the prosecutor in the Local Court) appeals under section 23(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the CARA) against an order of the Local Court that it pay the costs of the respondents (the defendants in the Local Court). On the day fixed in the Local Court for hearing of a prosecution under the Fisheries Management Act 1994 (the FMA), the appellant withdrew the charges The Local Court awarded costs in the sum of $200,000. 

2On the appeal, the respondents contended that the Local Court should have awarded costs on other bases.

Issues

(1)Whether the Local Court erred in law in failing to allow costs to the respondents under s 214(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the CPA).

(2)Whether the Local Court erred in law in allowing costs to the respondents under s 214(1)(c) of the CPA.

(3) Whether the Local Court erred in law in allowing costs under s 214(1)(d) of the CPA.

(4)Whether the Local Court erred in the manner in which it assessed the quantum of costs.

 
In connection with these issues, the following matters were raised:

(1)Whether the costs order can be supported on the alternative ground that the Local Court should have made a preliminary finding that the appellant bore the onus of proving that the NTA did not operate to suspend the operation of the FMA. (Respondents' contention.)

(2)Section 214(1)(a). Whether the Local Court erred in finding that the appellant's investigation was not conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner. (Respondents' contention.)

(3)Section 214(1)(c). Whether the Local Court failed to take into account relevant matters, i.e. that a prima facie case was conceded and there was an evidentiary onus on the respondents to adduce some evidence of their ""defences"" and that the respondents ' ""defences"" were substantially based on subjective matters that were peculiarly within their knowledge. (Appellant's argument)

(4)Section 214(1)(c). Whether the Local Court took into account an irrelevant matter, i.e. avenues of investigation that were said to have been available to the appellant, but which were not articulated by the Local Court. The appellant submitted that no evidence had been led and no submissions made in relation to relevant avenues of investigation that the appellant had failed to explore.

(5)Section 214(1)(d). Whether the Local Court took into account matters that were irrelevant when considering whether there were ""exceptional circumstances"", including the respondents' financial status and the procedural history of the matter.

(6)Section 214(1)(d). Whether the Local Court based its decision on erroneous findings of fact, including the asserted fact that the proceedings were withdrawn at the ""eleventh hour"".

(7)Whether the Local Court erred in the manner in which it assessed the quantum of costs.

Background

3The appellant knew that fishing was an integral and important part of the culture of many Aboriginal communities and was aware of archaeological evidence of Aboriginal shellfish gathering (including the gathering of abalone fish) at Wreck Bay (part of Jervis Bay), on the South Coast of NSW: Exhibit A, tabs 8, 9 and 10. The appellant was well aware of the tension between Aboriginal cultural claims of fishing entitlement, the demands of commercial fishers and the need to ensure a sustainable fish population: Exhibit A, tab 10.

Commencement of Local Court Proceedings

4On 1 July 2008 at Wreck Bay, fisheries officers found the respondents in possession of 110 abalone fish. Fifty-one abalone fish were below the legal size limit. The catch limit is two abalone fish per person. The area in which the respondents had been fishing was subject to a fishing closure. The fisheries officers realised that the respondents were Aboriginal people. When apprehended, the respondents stated that they had collected the fish for a celebration that was to occur the following week, which was NAIDOC week. Later, having received advice from the Aboriginal Legal Service, the respondents chose to exercise their right to silence: Exhibit A, tabs 1 and 2.

5On 22 June 2010, the respondents were charged under sections 14, 16 and 18 of the FMA with, respectively, possession of fish taken from closed waters, possession of under-size fish, and possession of an excessive quantity of fish.

6From the outset, the respondents indicated that they might raise a native title entitlement to fish. Because the respondents had difficulty securing legal representation, the matter was adjourned several times. By September 2011, the respondents had secured legal representation. The hearing was fixed for December 2011.

7On 24 October 2011, the appellant's solicitor wrote to the respondents' solicitor in an endeavour to clarify the real issues in dispute. Inter alia, the appellant solicitors referred to s 211 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NTA) and sought particulars of the matters upon which the respondents intended to rely in support of their claimed entitlement to fish under native title law: Exhibit A, tab 4. The respondents' solicitor replied that the respondents would rely upon s 211 of the NTA and, alternatively, upon a ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact and/or upon a ""claim of right"". The solicitor stated that he was endeavouring to engage an anthropologist to undertake research and fieldwork and was continuing to interview Aboriginal people in relation to the native title issue. He stated that the respondents identified with the Yuin people, and that the Yuin people asserted a native title right to fish for abalone fish. He identified the genealogical lines of the respondents. Otherwise, he provided generic answers to questions about the basis upon which the respondents claimed native title entitlement: Exhibit A, tab 5.

8The parties filed a notice under s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 in which all elements of the alleged offences against the FMA (excluding any element relating to native title native entitlement) were admitted: Exhibit A, tab 3.

9At the commencement of the hearing, the Local Court decided six preliminary matters. Relevantly, the Court decided that:

(1)The respondents had the onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that s 211 of the NTA applied to their fishing activities.

(2)As a matter of principle, the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact was available. 

(3)The respondents bore the onus of establishing the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact on the balance of probabilities.

The first preliminary issue: section 211 of the NTA

10The appellant accepted that, as a general proposition, s 211 of the NTA was capable of applying to a charge under the FMA so as to exonerate a defendant. 

Section 211 of the NTA provides:
(1) Subsection (2) applies if:
(a) the exercise or enjoyment of native title rights and interests in relation to land or waters consists of or includes carrying on a particular class of activity (defined in subsection (3)); and
(b) a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory prohibits or restricts persons from carrying on the class of activity other than in accordance with a licence, permit or other instrument granted or issued to them under the law; and ...
(2) If this subsection applies, the law does not prohibit or restrict the native title holders from carrying on the class of activity, or from gaining access to the land or waters for the purpose of carrying on the class of activity, where they do so:
(a) for the purpose of satisfying their personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs; and
(b) in exercise or enjoyment of their native title rights and interests.

Native title rights are acknowledged in s 287 of the FMA, which provides:
287. This Act does not affect the operation of the Native Title Act 1993 of the Commonwealth or the Native Title (New South Wales) Act 1994 in respect of the recognition of native title rights and interests within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act or in any other respect.

11Relevantly, on the hearing of preliminary matters, the issue between the appellant and the respondents was: Which party bore the evidentiary onus of establishing that s 211 applied or did not apply, and to what evidentiary standard? 

12This issue was considered in Appeals of Rigby and Ors (District Court, Blanch CJ, unreported 17 December 2007). In that case, the Chief Judge acknowledged that he was bound by the decision in Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572, in which the Court ""appeared to"" hold that a defendant who asserts native title rights must establish the existence of such rights on the balance of probabilities. His Honour noted the decision of Dershaw v Sutton (1996) 17 WAR 419, in which the Court reached a different conclusion, deciding that a defendant merely bore an evidentiary burden to adduce some evidence of a ""defence"" of native title fishing rights. 

13At the hearing of the preliminary issues, the respondents contended that the decision in Mason was not authoritative because it concerned an occurrence prior to the introduction of s 211 of the NTA, and s 211 evinced a clear intention on the part of the Commonwealth to neutralise State laws that purported to criminalise the exercise of native title fishing rights. 

14The Local Court concluded that it should follow the approach indicated in Rigby and should apply Mason.

15Initially, the respondents considered a Supreme Court challenge to this determination. However, they decided that they would not do so. They reserved their right to re-agitate the issue at the conclusion of the Local Court hearing. 

16Because the appellant withdrew the prosecutions, this fascinating and important issue was pursued no further.

The second preliminary issue: honest and reasonable mistake of fact

17As noted above, the Local Court decided that, as a matter of principle, when an issue of native title entitlement was raised the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact was available. Further, the Local Court determined that the respondents bore the onus of establishing the ""defence"" on the balance of probabilities.

18The Local Court proceedings were adjourned to enable the appellant to test the Court's preliminary rulings in the Supreme Court.

Supreme Court Appeal

19The proceedings were heard before Justice Button. His Honour delivered judgment on 25 July 2012: Andrews v Ardler [2012] NSWSC 845. 

20His Honour held that, as a matter of principle, the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact involving native title entitlement under Commonwealth law was available to proceedings alleging a contravention of State fisheries law: at [37] - [44]. His Honour affirmed the well-established proposition that, when the ""defence"" is raised, the defendant must point to some evidence of the ""defence"", but bears no onus of establishing the ""defence"" on the balance of probabilities. Once the defendant satisfies the evidentiary onus, the onus shifts to the prosecution to disprove the ""defence"" beyond reasonable doubt: at [38] - [40]. Justice Button repeatedly emphasised the need to distinguish a mistake of law (for example, a mistaken belief that one possessed native title rights) from a mistake of fact (for example, a mistake as to a fact giving rise to native title rights): for example at [41]. 

21As His Honour was satisfied that, in the proceedings before the Local Court, the parties could revisit the issues of the evidentiary and legal onuses applying to the ""defence"", he declined to grant declaratory relief in relation to that matter: at [46] - [67]. At [63] His Honour stated:

Fifthly, it is quite possible that many of these questions will turn out not to arise on the evidence. As I have said, apart from the document prepared pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act, no evidence has been tendered or called. It may be that, ultimately, no evidence will be led with regard to the ""defence"". If it is led, it may be excluded; if it is not excluded, it may be that the evidence will be quite circumscribed. I am not inclined to make a declaration that may well turn out to be quite unnecessary on the evidence in the case.


Withdrawal of the Local Court proceedings

22The Local Court hearing was fixed to resume on 19 November 2012. On 29 October 2012, the respondents served the appellant with a 103-page report from Dr Kwok, an anthropologist who is an expert in native title. In that report, Dr Kwok set out the results of her extensive literary and field research, and referred to the respondents' personal beliefs and customs and the relationship between those beliefs and customs and the conduct the subject of the charges.

23On Friday 16 November 2012, the appellant advised the respondents that it would withdraw the proceedings. The respondents sought costs under s 214 of the CPA. 

24The Local Court set a timetable for the service of written submissions on costs and allocated a date for oral addresses. The Court directed that, in the event that the parties wished to supplement their written submissions with oral submissions, they were to notify the Court. The parties advised the Court that, if the Court wished them to do so, they were willing to supplement their written submissions. The Court was content to consider the matter on the basis of the written submissions alone.

Sections 213 and 214 of the CPA

25Section 213 of the CPA provides:
(1) A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.
(2) The amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable.
(3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because: 
(a) the prosecutor fails to appear or both the prosecutor and the accused person fail to appear, or 
(b) the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid. 

Section 214 of the CPA relevantly provides:
214 (1) Professional costs are not be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following:
(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,
(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,
(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,
(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.
...

26On 19 March 2013, the Local Court published its decision on costs. The Court was not satisfied that it should award costs pursuant to s 214(1)(a) of the CPA (unreasonable or improper investigation) but was satisfied that it should award costs pursuant to s 214(1)(c) (unreasonable failure of the prosecutor to investigate) and s 214(1)(d) of the CPA (other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor). 

27Inter alia, the Local Court found:

Section 214(1)(a)
...
21. Notwithstanding the delay in charging the Defendants I am not satisfied that the investigation into the alleged offences was, at the time, conducted in an unreasonable or improper (manner) in all the circumstances. The Fisheries Officers recorded their observations and made contemporaneous notes. The abalone were photographed, measured and transported. The Defendants in this matter told Officers they were collecting for NAIDOC week but gave no further information. They were asked, and declined, to engage in an interview.

Section 214 (1)(c)
...
24. The issue of a ""defence"" reliant generally upon issues of the Defendants Aboriginality and collection of abalone for cultural purposes was a relevant matter raised from the time Fisheries Officers apprehended the Defendants. Whether that turned on the legal issues of ""honest and reasonable mistake of fact"", or on the assertion of the existence of legal native title rights, was a relevant matter that the Prosecution should have investigated promptly. On the material before me there is no evidence of the investigation of those matters from 2008 to 2010. It is trite for the Prosecution to assert ""where there was no evidence from the defendants, there was nothing that could be investigated"". An interview with the Defendants was not the only investigatory tool available to the Prosecution.
25. I accept the Defendants submission that it is unlikely the Defendants, even if they participated in an interview with Fisheries Officers, would have been able to articulate legal issues going to native title and customary practices, other than to the extent that they had already stated they were collecting for NA ID0C week. The Defendants were told they may be the subject of a criminal charge. They exercised their right, after being properly advised of it, not to participate in an interview.
26. These are criminal prosecutions with serious consequences for the Defendants if convicted. Penalties include imprisonment. I am satisfied that, had the Prosecution investigated those matters in any way, it would have resulted in a consideration of whether the prosecution should not be brought. This consideration would have had a significant impact on the costs of the proceedings. Ultimately the proceedings were carried on for over two years, with the Prosecution not apparently undertaking any detailed consideration of those relevant matters until the Defence had served an expert report from Dr Kwok, four years after the alleged offences.
27. I am satisfied that the Defendants have made out in entitlement costs pursuant to section 214(1)(c) of the CPA. For completeness I will also consider the claim under section 214 (1)(d) of the CPA.

Section 214(1)(d)
...
30. The Defendants were put to a very heavy burden in defending these charges. The conduct of the prosecutions of these matters appeared as though they were a ""test case""... The defendants were put to the time and expense of obtaining the expert report of Dr Kwok... At the first scheduled hearing the Prosecution sought to raise several preliminary issues of which the Defence were not on notice and those matters were then taken on appeal to the Supreme Court...
31. These prosecutions were summary and brought in the Local Court where there should be an expectation of both just and expeditious resolution. The delay in prosecuting these matters, the failure to properly investigate, the heavy burdens placed on the Defendants in the conduct of their defence and the withdrawal of the proceedings at the ""eleventh hour"" are exceptional circumstances. Taken together, it is just and reasonable that the Defendants also be awarded costs on this basis.

Nature of appeal under s 23(2) of the CARA

28Section 23 of the CARA is entitled ""Appeals as of Right"". Section 23(2) provides:
23(2) The prosecutor may appeal to the District Court against:
...
(b) any order for costs made by the light local court against the prosecutor in respect of summary proceedings taken by the prosecutor.

29The CARA does not specify the nature of an appeal under s 23(2). 

30In its written submissions, the appellant maintained that an appeal under s 23(2)(b) was an appeal de novo. However, at the hearing, the appellant abandoned that contention and conceded that the appeal was confined to an appeal in relation to an error of law or fact. Consequently, it was not necessary that the Court decide whether an appeal under s 23(2)(b) is so confined. Nevertheless, I make the following observations.

31The CARA provides for a variety of types of appeal to the District and Supreme Courts. None of the appeals for which the CARA expressly provides is a hearing de novo. Some provisions of the CARA refer to appeals stricto sensu (see, for example, sections 52 and 53). Under the CARA, the nature of an appeal may be determined by the nature of the party (whether prosecutor or defendant), the nature of the matter in contention or whether it is an appeal to the District Court or the Supreme Court.

32Generally, a defendant may appeal to the District Court against conviction or sentence but a prosecutor may appeal against sentence only. 

33An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the evidence given in the Local Court, although the District Court may allow fresh evidence if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so: s 18.

34Sections 17 and 26 provide that, where a prosecutor or a defendant appeals to the District Court against a ""sentence"", the appeal is to be by way of ""rehearing"". Fresh evidence may be given. Where a prosecutor appeals against ""sentence"", the prosecutor requires leave to adduce fresh evidence and leave will be granted only in exceptional circumstances: s 26. Notably, while ""sentence"" is defined to include a costs order against a defendant, the definition does not extend to include a costs order against a prosecutor: s 3. 

35In Fox Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 124, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ explained:
Appeal is not, as such, a common law procedure. It is a creature of statute. In Builders Licensing Board v Sperway Constructions (Syd) Pty Ltd, Mason J distinguished between (i) an appeal stricto sensu, where the issue is whether the judgment below was right on the material before the trial court; (ii) an appeal by rehearing on the evidence before the trial court; (iii) an appeal by way of rehearing on that evidence supplemented by such further evidence as the appellate court admits under a statutory power to do so; and (iv) an appeal by way of hearing de novo. There are different meanings to be attached to the word ""rehearing"". The distinction between an appeal by way of rehearing and hearing de novo was further considered in Allesch v Maunz. Which of the meanings is that borne by the term ""appeal"", or whether there is some other meaning is, in the absence of an express statement in the particular provision, a matter of statutory construction in each case.

See also Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40; (2000) 203 CLR 172, Coal and Allied Operations v AIRC [2000] HCA 47; 203 CLR 194.

36As a matter of statutory construction, an appeal under s 23(2) must be interpreted as being confined to an appeal in relation to an error of fact or law. It cannot have been intended to be an appeal de novo. First, it is most improbable that the legislature would have intended that an appeal on costs (which is typically a consequential issue) would be wider than an appeal in relation to the substantive issues of conviction or sentence to which the costs relate. Second, an appeal by a prosecutor in relation to an adverse costs order is an appeal in relation to a matter of less consequence than, for example, an appeal against conviction or a sentence of imprisonment, where the liberty of the subject is at stake. It is most unlikely that the legislature intended to confer a wide appeal in relation to costs while restricting the scope of appeals in relation to more significant matters. Third, a defendant has only a limited appeal in relation to a costs order. It is most unlikely that the legislature intended that a prosecutor would have a wider entitlement to appeal. Fourth, a decision in relation to costs is a discretionary decision. Ordinarily, such a decision would attract only a limited right of appeal.

Can the costs order be supported on the alternative ground that the Local Court erred in relation to a preliminary finding? 

37The respondents contended that the Local Court should have made a preliminary finding that the appellant bore the onus of proving that the NTA did not operate to suspend the operation of the FMA. Alternatively, it was submitted that the Local Court should have made a preliminary finding that, having received some evidence that the NTA may apply, the prosecutor bore the onus of proving that it did not operate to suspend the operation of the FMA. 

38As noted in [14] above, at the conclusion of the hearing on preliminary issues, the Local Court decided these matters in favour of the appellant, finding that it was bound by the decisions in Rigby and Mason. The respondents abandoned the opportunity to test the Local Court's rulings in the Supreme Court. 

39This appeal is confined to the Local Court's decision on costs, and the respondents cannot use the costs appeal as a vehicle to challenge the Local Court's preliminary ruling on a substantive matter.

Section 214(1)(a)

40Under s 213 of the CPA, the Local Court may award just and reasonable costs to a defendant when the prosecutor withdraws proceedings. Section 214 provides that costs are not to be awarded to a defendant unless he or she satisfies the court in relation to at least one of the grounds in s 214. The award of costs is discretionary but, if a defendant establishes one of the grounds in s 214, it is usual for costs to be awarded.

41The respondents contended that the Local Court should have awarded costs on the basis of the ground in s 214(1)(a) (the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner). 

42Unlike the ground in s 214(1)(c), this ground can be satisfied without proof that the prosecutor's actions or omissions deprived the court of evidence that may have made a difference to the way in which the proceedings ran (for example, because the evidence pointed to a lack of guilt): De Varda v Constable Stengord (NSW Police) [2011] NSWSC 868 applying Cliffleigh Haulage Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [2007] NSWCCA 13 at [27] - [32], in which the Court considered an almost identical provision. In Cliffleigh, Hodgson JA gave the example of a case in which the prosecutor knew that there were five eye - witnesses to an event but interviewed and called only one of them, and the prosecution failed as a case in which the provision may apply even if the costs applicant did not prove what the other four witnesses would have said.

43In this case, the Local Court found that, as there was nothing remarkable about the way in which the fisheries officers conducted their initial investigation, the ground in s 214(1)(a) was not established. 

44The approach taken by the Local Court raises two issues:

(1) Whether s 214 (1)(a) is concerned only with the initial investigation or whether it is concerned with the whole of the period up to when charges are laid.

(2)Whether s 214 (1)(a) is concerned only with unreasonable or improper actions in the course of an investigation, or whether it is also concerned with omissions.

45In relation to (1), the Local Court appears to have assumed that s 214(1)(a) is concerned only with the initial investigation. I see no reason to confine the provision in that way. Section 214(1)(c) deals with the unreasonable failure to investigate any relevant matter suggesting that ""the proceeding should not have been brought"". By analogy, I would interpret s 214 (1)(a) as addressing the whole of the period up to when charges are laid. In this case, the investigation period extended over a two-year period, from the incident in July 2008 until June 2010, when charges were laid. However, this matter was not argued on the appeal.

46As to the second issue, uninformed by authority I would have thought that s 214(1)(a) is concerned with unreasonable or improper actions in the course of an investigation, rather than with omissions such as the failure to undertake a comprehensive investigation, and that omissions fell within s 214(1)(c) of the CPA. The Local Court appears to have taken this view. However, in De Varda at [32] Davies J. decided that a failure to interview a relevant witness could establish both that an investigation was conducted in an unreasonable manner within s 214(1)(a) and that the investigation was unreasonable in terms of s 214(1)(c).

47Consequently, the Local Court erred in that, when considering whether the ground in s 214(1)(a) was established, it failed to consider any relevant omissions on the part of the appellant. 

Section 214(1)(c)

48Section 214(1)(c) provides that costs may be awarded where a prosecutor has unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) a matter that suggests that the accused might not be guilty or that, or any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought. 

49An applicant for costs who seeks to rely upon the s 214(1)(c) ground must both identify the ""matter"" of which the prosecution was or ought to have been aware and show that the matter suggested that the applicant might not be guilty (i.e. there was evidence pointing to lack of guilt) or that the proceeding should not have been brought: Cliffleigh at [20].

50I note some other considerations that may pertain to an application based on s 214(1)(c). First, relevant ""matters"" are not confined to matters that establish a prima facie case; the ground may apply where a prosecutor fails to investigate a matter that suggests that an accused person might not be guilty because he or she has a defence, or the prosecution case is flawed. A relevant ""matter"" must be a matter of fact or evidence. It can be a matter that creates or supports a defence, but it cannot be the defence itself. Second, not every failure to investigate a ""matter"" invokes s 214(1)(c); it is only ""unreasonable"" failures that do so. Third, it may be that s 214(1)(c) is concerned only with failures at the investigation stage (prior to the institution of proceedings) rather than with failures in relation to the conduct of proceedings, and that matters that occur after the commencement of proceedings are more properly considered under s 214 (1)(b) or (d). ""Defences"" are usually identified only after the institution of proceedings. Indeed, in this case, it was only after the commencement of proceedings that the respondents secured legal representation and confirmed that they would be relying on ""defences"" that raised native title entitlement. There is a further reason why it may be important to clarify whether s 214(1)(c) is concerned with failures that occur after the institution of proceedings. At [26], the Local Court referred with disapproval to the fact that ""the proceedings were carried on for over two years, with (the appellant) not apparently undertaking any detailed consideration of those relevant matters until (the respondents) had served an expert report from Dr Kwok, four years after the alleged offences"". This consideration appears to have been important to the Local Court's finding that the s 214(1)(c) ground was established. Prior to the institution of proceedings, the respondents had raised the possibility that, if charges were pressed, they would rely upon a native title entitlement. However, their position was uncertain. The respondents did not secure legal representation until some months after they received court attendance notices. It was only then that the respondents' intention to rely upon the two ""defences"" was confirmed. I note that the issue of the period addressed by s 214(1)(c) was not ventilated in the Local Court and was not raised in the appellant's grounds of appeal to this Court.

51The first question that the Local Court was bound to ask was: What ""matter/s"" did the respondents identify as matters of which the prosecution was or ought to have been aware? In this regard, the Local Court found that ""the (respondents') Aboriginality and collection of abalone for cultural purposes was a relevant matter"": at [24]. I accept that these matters are matters of fact or evidence that, in an appropriate context, may be capable of pointing to a lack of guilt or indicating that the proceedings should not be brought. However, I note that, in this case, the reference to ""the collection of abalone for cultural purposes"" seems to be a conclusion drawn from a bare reference to collecting for a NAIDOC week celebration, rather than a matter that was admitted or determined following the hearing of evidence. 

52The second question that the Local Court was bound to ask was: Do these ""matter/s"" suggest that the respondents might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not be brought? I accept that the respondents' Aboriginality and the collection of abalone for cultural purposes are matters that are at least capable of ""suggesting"" that the respondents might not be guilty by reason of a ""defence"" linked to native title entitlement. However, Aboriginality and the collection of abalone for cultural purposes are facts that, in combination, go only part of the way towards such ""defences"". 

53The third question that the Local Court had to consider was: Was the failure to investigate the relevant matters ""unreasonable"" in all the circumstances? In order to determine whether it was unreasonable that a particular investigation was not undertaken, an important first step is to identify the investigation that should have been undertaken.

54In this case, the Local Court did not articulate the nature of the investigation that it considered should have been undertaken, making it impossible to determine whether the Court's finding of ""unreasonableness"" was supportable. The respondents had argued that a proper investigation would have included an examination of the appellant's own resources (such as those reproduced in Exhibit A at tabs 8, 9 and 10), an examination of the Native Titles Register kept under s 192 of the NTA to determine whether a relevant claim had been made, making enquiries of peak Aboriginal bodies such as the relevant Land Council, making enquiries of the Australian Museum and interviewing elders and residents in the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community. In their written submissions on appeal, the respondents submitted that the appellant could have engaged its own expert anthropologist to gain an understanding of the nature and extent of traditional customs and rights. The respondents did not go so far as to assert that the appellant should have done so.

55It is true that the appellant could have undertaken those examinations and enquiries. But, even if the enquiries had established that the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community had a long-standing culture of collecting abalone and claimed a native title entitlement to do so, that would have fallen well short of establishing that the respondents themselves might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not be brought for reasons associated with a native title entitlement to fish.

56The consideration of whether the respondents had a ""defence"" under s 211 of the NTA raises complex issues of fact and law, including the nature and content of customs presently observed, whether the customary system has had a substantially uninterrupted continuous existence since sovereignty, the customary connection of the respondents with the relevant waters and the identity of the persons who hold the group rights comprising the native title: ss 223(1) and 225 of the NTA, and The Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58. While publicly available records may elucidate some matters relevant to the existence of asserted native title rights, the evidence of Aboriginal claimants is central to establishing native title entitlement: see, for example, Northern Territory v Maurice (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 492 per Deane J. and Sampi v State of Western Australia [2005] FCA 777 at [48] (describing other evidence as ""second order evidence""). In the absence of evidence from the respondents themselves concerning their own subjective beliefs and experiences, even an extensive investigation into Aboriginal cultural practices in relation to the collection of abalone finish at Wreck Bay would be most unlikely to reveal whether the respondents had a ""defence"" under s 211 of the NTA. In DPP (Cth) v Neamati [2007] NSWSC 746, the Court suggested that it could not be ""unreasonable"" for a prosecutor to fail to investigate a defendant's state of knowledge of a particular fact (albeit, in that case, the defendant's state of knowledge was the only contentious issue).

57Similarly, any ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact depends upon the evidence of the alleged offender concerning their subjective belief. Only an alleged offender can identify the fact or facts about which they say that they were honestly mistaken and which, if true, would have provided them with a ""defence"".

58Was the appellant's failure to undertake examinations and enquiries of the type proposed by the respondents ""unreasonable""? What constitutes an ""unreasonable"" failure to investigate within the meaning of s 214(1)(c) will depend upon the circumstances of a particular case, which may include the nature and seriousness of the charges and the nature of the ""matter"" of which the prosecutor is or should be aware. There may be an issue of proportionality; whether, given the nature of the charges and the costs of investigation, the failure to pursue a line of enquiry is unreasonable. There may be an issue as to whether it could be ""unreasonable"" to fail to pursue a line of enquiry when, at best, the results of that enquiry would be inconclusive because the enquiry could not encompass critical subjective material.

59A determination of the question of ""unreasonableness"" should not be clouded by the politics associated with the tension between Aboriginal cultural claims of fishing entitlement, the demands of commercial fishers, the need to ensure a sustainable fish population and the fact that the appellant is responsible for managing and regulating fisheries matters.

60In relation to the ground in s 214(1)(c), the Local Court erred in that it did not articulate the enquiries that it considered should have been undertaken as part of the investigation and it did not explain why the failure to undertake those enquiries was unreasonable, given the circumstances of the case, including issues of proportionality and the appellant's inability to enquire into subjective material. The appellant characterised these errors as taking into account an irrelevant matter or as making a finding that lacked an evidentiary basis.

Section 214(1)(d)

61In order to establish the ground in s 214(1)(d), a defendant must establish both ""other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor"" and that it is ""just and reasonable"" to award professional costs. 

62The use of the expression ""other exceptional circumstances"" suggests that the circumstances must be other than the circumstances referred to in grounds (a), (b) and (c). The resolution of proceedings in favour of a defendant or does not constitute ""exceptional circumstances"": Fosse v DPP [1999] NSWSC 367. The mere proffering of no evidence does not constitute ""exceptional circumstances"", nor does reliance on exculpatory statements of the defendant. Neither is remarkable in itself or in combination: Dong v Hughes [2005] NSWSC 84. 

63In this case, the Local Court nominated four matters which, when taken together, constituted ""exceptional circumstances"": the two year delay in the instituting proceedings, the failure to properly investigate, the heavy burden of conducting a defence to ""test case"" proceedings involving a large volume of evidence and numerous court attendances, and the withdrawal of proceedings ""at the eleventh hour"".

64As to the alleged failure to investigate, two observations can be made. First, the Local Court did not articulate the nature of the enquiries that, in its opinion, should have been made. Second, an unreasonable failure to investigate is a ground under s 214(1)(c), and s 214(1)(d) refers to ""other exceptional circumstances"".

65Individually, the remaining three matters are incapable of constituting ""exceptional circumstances"". A prosecutor is entitled to commence proceedings at any time within the prescribed limitation period, and from the outset the respondents were on notice of possible proceedings. The fact that proceedings are a ""test case"" is not necessarily an exceptional matter. In this case, the respondents themselves were interested in making it a test case. The withdrawal of proceedings ""at the eleventh hour"" was explained by the fact that the critical report of Dr Kwok was served ""at the eleventh hour"". It is my view that, when taken as a whole, in the context of this case these matters were not capable of constituting ""exceptional circumstances"" and the Local Court erred in determining that they did constitute such circumstances.

Assessment of quantum of costs

66The parties agreed that the Local Court made a mathematical error of $12,600 in favour of the respondents.

67The appellant argued that the award of $200,000 was excessive and the Local Court should have awarded only 60 - 80% of the amount claimed, rather than about 85%. The respondents contended that the Local Court should have awarded the full amount that was claimed (about $235,000) less the agreed error of $12,600.

68There is no rule that a court must award a particular percentage of the costs claimed under s 213 of the CPA. In order to succeed on an appeal against a costs order, the appellant must show that the award was not just and reasonable. Apart from the agreed mathematical error of $12,600, neither party has identified an error of law or fact in the way in which the Local Court approached its task of assessing just and reasonable costs.

Outcome

69Section 27(2) of the CAR Act provides:
27(2) The District Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in section 23(2):
(a) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just, or
(b) by dismissing the appeal.

70The parties agreed that, in the event that the Court decided to allow the appeal and set aside the costs order of the Local Court, the matter should be re-listed for submissions about the appropriate outcome.

2761777,AB v Constable Joshua Hedges & Anor [2013] NSWSC 814,"Judgment

1At the time of the events which give rise to these proceedings the plaintiff was a juvenile, and for that reason he is referred to as ""AB"" (which are not his initials). The proceedings arise out of the prosecution of the plaintiff in the Children's Court for certain offences, the informant being the first defendant, Constable Hedges. The second defendant is the magistrate who dealt with the matter in that court, who has entered a submitting appearance. It is convenient to deal with the background to the matter before turning to the relief sought. 

2On 10 April 2009, Constable Hedges arrested the plaintiff and charged him with five traffic offences and a charge of resisting him, an officer, while in the execution of his duty, an offence under s 58 of the Crimes Act 1900. The evidence upon which these charges were based is not material for present purposes. The plaintiff pleaded not guilty, and he was legally represented in the Children's Court. The hearing proceeded for two separate days in 2010, and were adjourned to enable submissions as to whether there was a prima facie case. Those submissions were made but, shortly before the hearing was due to resume, all charges against the plaintiff were withdrawn. They were accordingly dismissed. 

3The plaintiff made an application for costs pursuant to s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which confers a discretion on a magistrate to award costs where a matter is dismissed or withdrawn. The application was governed by s 214 of the Act, limiting the award of professional costs to an accused against a prosecutor acting in a public capacity. The subsection provides:

""S 214(1) Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following.

(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,

(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,

(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,

(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.""

4In deciding the application the magistrate focused on the issue raised by subs (1)(b), ""that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause ... ."" In the light of a concession made by Constable Hedges during evidence, his Honour found that his arrest of the plaintiff was unlawful and that a prima facie case of the charge of resisting an officer could not have been made out. As to the traffic matters, however, he found that a prima facie case might have been made out. Accordingly, he refused the application for costs, taking the view that the charges collectively constituted the ""proceedings"" for the purposes of s 214. 

5The plaintiff sought judicial review of his Honour's decision in this court, and the matter was dealt with by McCallum J: V (a child) v Constable Joshua Hedges [2011] NSWSC 232. He succeeded in part only. Her Honour held that the magistrate was in error in regarding the six charges as collectively constituting the proceedings for the purpose of s 214, as ""each separate offence for which a person is prosecuted ought properly to be regarded as giving rise to separate criminal proceedings"": [29]. She found that it was open to his Honour to have declined to order costs in respect of the traffic offences on the basis that it had not been shown that proceedings for them had been initiated without reasonable cause. However, he should have considered separately the exercise of his discretion to order costs in respect of the charge of resisting an officer: [30]. 

6Accordingly, her Honour quashed the magistrate's order dismissing the plaintiff's application for costs insofar as it related to the proceedings for the offence of resisting an officer, and remitted those proceedings to the Children's Court for determination of the plaintiff's application for costs according to law. 

7The matter came back before the magistrate on 29 April 2011 for directions. The application for costs was listed for 28 July, and the magistrate suggested that the parties attempt to settle the matter. On that same day, 29 April, the plaintiff's solicitor, Mr Oliveri, wrote to Sergeant Jamie Palmer, the prosecutor who had appeared on that day, setting out an estimate of costs totalling $107,828.90, but offering to settle the matter for $90,730.00. Sergeant Palmer referred the matter to Sergeant Will Somers, the prosecutor who had appeared at the hearing of the charges. On 19 May Sergeant Somers responded by email conveying that he had instructions from the Commander of the relevant Local Area Command to accept that amount. 

8Further correspondence ensued confirming the agreement and making arrangements to notify the court of it. By 17 June consent orders for the payment to the plaintiff of costs in the amount of $90,730.00, by cheque payable to Mr Oliveri's firm, had been agreed upon. 

9However, by email of 20 June Sergeant Somers informed Mr Oliveri that he had been instructed that the prosecution ""withdraws the agreement to consent orders being filed."" The matter was said to be under review by the Commander of the Police Prosecutions Command, and a decision ""whether to proceed to hearing or consent to the costs"" would be made by the end of that week. Mr Oliveri responded on the same day, asserting that there was a ""binding settlement agreement"", that it was not open to the prosecution to unilaterally set it aside, and that he was instructed to enforce it. 

10By email of 22 June Acting Senior Sergeant Tyler-Stott, Area Prosecutions Co-ordinator at Parramatta Children's Court, informed Mr Oliveri that ""the prosecution's position is that the quantum of costs are to be left to the determination of the court"", and asked him to advise how he wished ""to advance"" his application. Mr Oliveri responded, again on the same day, saying that, in the absence of ""consent to the orders as previously agreed"", he would be seeking orders under s 73 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 confirming the terms of the settlement. By a further email to Sergeant Tyler-Stott of 24 June Mr Oliveri stated that he considered the matter to have been settled, that a binding agreement was in place, and that orders pursuant to the settlement would be sought on 28 July, when the matter was listed before the court. 

11By a letter to Mr Oliveri of 8 July 2011, Ms Alison Byrne of the Office of the General Counsel of the NSW Police Force expressed the view that the Children's Court did not have jurisdiction to hear an application under the Civil Procedure Act, and asserted that on 28 July the court would be asked to determine ""the issue remitted by"" McCallum J. 

12On 19 July 2011, Mr Oliveri filed an affidavit in the Children's Court setting out his dealings with the prosecution, including the proposed consent orders and the prosecution's subsequent repudiation of the agreement. He asserted that the plaintiff ""does not consent to the attempted unilateral withdrawal of the settlement agreement reached herein"", and sought the entry of an order for costs in the agreed amount. On the same day, in the absence of the parties, the magistrate made an order in chambers for costs in the amount of $90,730.00, noting it as an order for costs made under s 214(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act ""by consent."" His Honour also vacated the hearing date of 28 July. 

13On 28 October 2011, Constable Hedges filed in the Children's Court an application to set aside the costs order, and seeking an order that the matter be re-listed so that the question of costs remitted by the Supreme Court could be determined according to law. It is unnecessary to recount the procedural steps which then ensued. Suffice to say that on 6 March 2012 his Honour set aside the costs order, giving reasons on that day.

14Put shortly, his Honour found that he should not have made the order in chambers of 19 July, adding that he would not have done so if he were aware that there was an issue as to consent to the order. The parties had a right to be heard on the matter and, in the circumstances, they had been denied natural justice. That being so, the order was a nullity and a submission for the plaintiff that, the order having been made, he was functus officio was rejected. 

15Further, his Honour rejected a submission for the plaintiff that the consent of a prosecutor to a costs order would be determinative of the issue of costs under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. He noted that s 213(1) provides that a court ""may"" make an order for costs, the amount being that which the magistrate ""considers to be just and reasonable"": subs (2). He also noted the opening words of s 214(1) that professional costs ""are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person"" unless the court is satisfied of one or more of the matters set out in the subsection. He saw the consent of the prosecutor as a matter relevant to the exercise of the discretion under ss 213 and 214, but as no more than that. If consent were determinative, he held, the court ""would effectively have no discretion in the matter"" and ""would merely be a rubber stamp for what the parties had agreed to."" 

16As to the question whether there was a binding agreement between the parties in the present case, his Honour found that he had no jurisdiction to determine issues ""relating to contract law that had been raised by both parties"". Those issues, he said, were for resolution by this court, not the Children's Court.

17Having set aside his costs order of 19 July 2011, his Honour set the costs application down for hearing on 3 May 2012. However, the proceedings in this court intervened. By a summons filed on 8 March 2012, the plaintiff seeks an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the magistrate's order of 6 March 2012 and, as against Constable Hedges, damages for breach of contract. The issues raised by these claims for relief overlap, but it is appropriate to deal with them separately.

Judicial review

18Put shortly, the grounds for judicial review are the following:


There was no denial of natural justice when the magistrate made his order of 19 July 2011. It was a valid order and, having made it, he was functus officio.


Alternatively, the question whether the consent order should have been set aside was properly the subject of separate proceedings: Spies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1991) 24 NSWLR 691, per Handley JA at 696 - 7. 


Further in the alternative, on the question whether the order should be set aside, his Honour should himself have determined whether the order was made without the lawful consent of the parties.


Yet further in the alternative, his Honour erred in holding that a court could not enter a consent order for costs under ss 213 and 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and that the court was bound to determine for itself whether such an order should be made. 

19In determining that the costs order of 19 July was a nullity because of a denial of natural justice, his Honour had regard to Cameron v Cole (1943) 68 CLR 571 and Taylor v Taylor (1978 - 79) 143 CLR 1. In Cameron v Cole, Rich J said at 589:

""It is a fundamental principle of natural justice, applicable to all courts whether superior or inferior, that a person against whom a claim or charge is made must be given a reasonable opportunity of appearing and presenting his case. If this principle be not observed, the person affected is entitled, ex debito justitiae, to have any determination which affects him set aside; and a court which finds that it has been led to purport to determine a matter in which there has been a failure to observe the principle has inherent jurisdiction to set its determination aside ... . In such a case there has been no valid trial at all. The setting aside of the invalid determination lays the ghost of the simulacrum of a trial, and leaves the field open for a real trial ... ."" (References to authority omitted)

In Taylor v Taylor, Gibbs J (as he then was) affirmed that principle, referring to the judgment of Rich J, at pp 7 - 8.

20Mr Coles QC, who appeared in this court with Ms Conway for the plaintiff, submitted that that line of authority has no application to the present case. Cameron v Cole was a bankruptcy matter in which a sequestration order had been made against a debtor in his absence, where he, through inadvertence, did not have notice of the date of the hearing. Taylor v Taylor was similar. It involved divorce proceedings in which orders had been made against the husband when, through no fault of his, he was neither present nor represented at the hearing. Mr Coles argued that the principles expressed in those cases have no bearing upon a final order of a court expressed to be made by the consent of the parties. Where there is such consent, he said, no question of procedural fairness (denial of natural justice) could arise.

21Of course, there have been cases where a party has sought to challenge an agreement giving rise to consent orders. Mr Coles referred to a leading High Court decision on that matter in Harvey v Philips (1956) 95 CLR 235. In that case the plaintiff sought unsuccessfully to challenge the settlement of proceedings despite the fact that counsel, on her instructions, had signed terms of settlement. In a joint judgment the High Court said at 243 - 4:

""The question whether the compromise is to be set aside depends upon the existence of a ground which would suffice to render a simple contract void or voidable or to entitle the party to equitable relief against it, grounds for example such as illegality, misrepresentation, non-disclosure of a material fact where disclosure is required, duress, mistake, undue influence, abuse of confidence or the like. The rule appears rather from positive statements of the grounds that suffice (cf Halsbury's Laws of England, vol 26, 2nd ed, pp 84, 85); but there is a dictum of Lindley LJ which is distinct enough: '... nor have I the slightest doubt that a consent order can be impeached, not only on the ground of fraud but upon any grounds which invalidate the agreement it expresses in a more formal way than usual ... . To my mind the only question is whether the agreement on which the consent order was based can be invalidated or not. Of course if that agreement cannot be invalidated the consent order is good': Huddersfield Banking Co Ltd v Henry Lister & Son Ltd [(1895) 2 Ch 273 at 280].""

22In Spies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (supra) the appellant had sought to set aside a judgment by consent on the basis that his consent had been procured by fraud. At 696 - 7 Handley JA, with whom Mahony and Clarke JJA agreed, cited that passage from Harvey v Philips. His Honour added (at 697) that ""it is also established that the jurisdiction to set aside a consent order on such a ground should be invoked by a new action brought for that purpose and not by a motion in the original proceedings,"" citing authority for that proposition. 

23In written submissions Mr Coles cited subsequent cases in which these principles have been considered and applied, but the principles are clear and those cases need not be referred to. Mr Coles argued that if Constable Hedges sought to set aside the consent order for costs on any of the bases referred to in Harvey v Philips, he should have instituted separate proceedings for that purpose or, at least, have filed a cross-claim in the present proceedings. He noted that there is no evidence before me of the circumstances in which the prosecution consented to an order for costs and then sought to withdraw that consent. (Nor, it appears, was there any such evidence before the magistrate.) It is not in dispute that, in the course of negotiations with Mr Oliveri, Sergeant Somers was the representative of Constable Hedges, the informant.

24That said, counsel for Constable Hedges in this court, Mr Hutchings, referred to two matters arising from the evidence suggesting that his Honour's order might have been the product of mistake. Firstly, in his judgment of 6 March 2010, his Honour noted that he made the order as a result of documents forwarded to him in chambers by registry staff on 19 July 2011. He added, ""I made the order because at the time I believed both parties had agreed to the order for costs and had also agreed to the amount that was to be ordered."" What the documents were which were sent to him in chambers is not clear but, one would have thought, they included Mr Oliveri's affidavit of that day. As I have said, that affidavit disclosed the fact that the prosecution had repudiated the agreement. His Honour's judgment of 6 March suggests that he was not aware of that fact or, at least, had overlooked it.

25Secondly, it is clear from the transcript of 29 April 2011, when the matter came back before his Honour for directions following the decision of McCallum J, that he believed that it had been remitted only on the issue of the amount of costs to be awarded, not whether there should be an order at all. It also appears from the transcript that Mr Oliveri shared that view. Moreover, when Sergeant Palmer referred the matter to Sergeant Somers she informed him that that was his Honour's view. However, it is clear from her judgment that McCallum J remitted the whole issue of the costs relating to the resist an officer charge, not just the question of quantum. Before her Honour it was conceded on behalf of Constable Hedges that that particular matter should be remitted, but there was not a concession that the plaintiff was entitled to an order for costs.

26Mr Coles responded that none of this makes any difference. Agreement had been reached between the parties for an order for costs and a consent order had been formulated. The prosecution subsequently repudiated that agreement, but that repudiation was not accepted and the agreement remained on foot. That being so, he said, the consent order was properly made. He noted that in Harvey v Philips the plaintiff, who gave instructions to settle the matter only after being subjected to considerable pressure, sought unsuccessfully to disown the compromise before judgment had been given in accordance with the terms of settlement. Nevertheless, judgment was given even though the court was aware at that time that she had withdrawn her consent to it. The High Court noted (at 244) the ""finding of the Supreme Court"" that the evidence sufficed ""to establish that she definitely did give her authority, however reluctant it may have been."" The court added that it was impossible ""to regard the authority she thus gave as insufficient to support the compromise.""

27However, the present matter is not as simple as that. I agree with the magistrate that an application for costs involving s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act cannot be resolved simply by a consent order. Mr Hutchings argued for the same view in this court. It may be that an application under s 213 could be resolved in that way in a private prosecution. Section 214 does not apply to the award of costs against a prosecutor ""acting in a private capacity"": subs (2). However, an application for costs against a prosecutor acting in a public capacity raises important questions of policy recognised by s 214(1). 

28The opening words of the subsection are emphatic. Professional costs ""are not to be awarded"" to an accused in a public prosecution unless the court is satisfied of one or more of the preconditions set out in pars (a) to (d). In oral argument, Mr Coles submitted that ""the best possible form of satisfaction must be the consent of the prosecutor to that order."" He likened that consent to an admission by a party conclusive of the issues in a proceeding. This I cannot accept. No doubt, a public prosecutor might responsibly concede that one of the matters set out in subs (1) is, or could readily be, established. This may well be such a case. Nevertheless, it would remain for the court to decide for itself whether that is so. 

29I do not find it necessary to assess the significance of the mistakes on his Honour's part raised by Mr Hutchings. I am satisfied that there was a denial of procedural fairness justifying the setting aside of the consent order. How the matter came to be referred to his Honour in chambers remains unclear. As noted at [10] above, Mr Oliveri's email to Sergeant Tyler-Stott of 24 June 2011 asserted that the agreement for costs was binding and that orders accordingly would be sought on 28 July, the date on which the matter had been listed for hearing. Presumably, he filed his affidavit of 19 July in preparation for that hearing, not with a view to a consent order being made in the absence of the parties in the meantime. In his judgment of 6 March 2012, his Honour frankly acknowledged that he had ""erred in making the order in chambers,"" properly describing that error as a ""significant one.""

30If the parties had appeared on the planned hearing date, they would have had the opportunity to be heard on the issue of the agreement and the prosecutor's decision to resile from it. More importantly, the prosecutor would have had the opportunity to be heard on whether, in the light of the terms of s 214, a consent order was appropriate. The parties having been denied that opportunity, the making of the consent order was a nullity for the reasons expressed by Rich J in Cameron v Cole. In the passage cited from that case Rich J referred to the ""inherent jurisdiction"" of any court, superior or inferior, to set aside a decision arrived at after a denial of natural justice. In relation to the Children's Court that jurisdiction might now be described as an implied power: Grassby v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 1, per Dawson J at 16 - 17, but the outcome is the same.

31Accordingly, no error has been demonstrated in his Honour's decision to set aside the consent order. The application for judicial review must be dismissed.

Contract claim

32The claim in contract seeks the following:


the principal sum of $90,730 or, alternatively, the difference between that amount and any amount validly awarded as costs by the Children's Court;
 

damages for the defendant's repudiatory conduct, being the plaintiff's professional costs of appearances in the Children's Court after the consent order of 19 July 2011. 

33My decision on the application for judicial review does not necessarily mean that this claim cannot be pursued. However, it would seem sensible not to do so until the application for costs in the Children's Court has been determined. In any event, a question arises whether this is a claim which should have been commenced by statement of claim: UCPR r 6.3. Having been commenced by summons, it may be appropriate to order that the proceedings continue on pleadings: r 6.6. Apart from other issues which might arise, it may be necessary to consider the bearing upon the claim of my finding as to the effect of s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

34I shall hear the parties on appropriate directions for the conduct of the matter, and on costs.

2761791,Aubourg v R [2013] NSWCCA 154,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: The applicant, Jessica Lynette Aubourg, sought leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on her by Judge Sides QC in the District Court on 12 September 2012. The matter proceeded in the District Court on a guilty plea, with an agreed statement of facts. The applicant also gave oral evidence. In this Court it was common ground that the sentencing judge made a factual error in giving reasons for the sentence imposed. The two issues before this Court were (a) whether the error materially affected the sentence imposed and (b), if so, whether a less severe sentence was warranted in law.

2At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court granted leave to appeal, but dismissed the appeal. Reasons were reserved.

3In order to understand the nature and significance of the error, it is necessary to provide some factual background to the circumstances of the offending and also the procedural background to the matter in the District Court.

Background
4The offending took place on the evening of 2 May 2011. In August 2010 the applicant had made a complaint to Police that she had been raped by a young man, Mosa (Julius) Mbele. Although the applicant claimed that she had been dissuaded from pursuing her complaint by Police, the sentencing judge found that she had decided not to press the charge. The decision was one she later regretted, as Mr Mbele continued to harass her by phone calls and text messages. She formed an intention to take steps to ""scare him a bit"", so he would leave her alone. She discussed the idea with her close friend, Tara Speechley and her boyfriend, Jason Alford. The applicant arranged to meet Mr Mbele on the evening of 2 May 2011. She drove to the assigned meeting place accompanied by Ms Speechley. Mr Alford was also in the vehicle, but hidden in the boot: to the applicant's knowledge, he was armed with a sawn off rifle and ammunition. 

5Mr Mbele sat in the back seat. The car was a two-door Hyundai and Mr Mbele was not able to get out unless one of the women got out first and her seat was pushed forward. The statement of agreed facts continued:

""The offender drove the vehicle to Belmore Road, Riverwood.

The victim became uneasy, and asked the offender to pull the car over so that he could smoke a cigarette. The victim heard SPEECHLEY ask the offender: 'Is this the guy that raped you?' The offender said: 'Yes'. The victim asked: 'What are you talking about? Stop playing games'. The offender said: 'Don't worry about it'. The offender, SPEECHLEY and the victim got back into the car.

The offender drove the vehicle to Kentucky Road, Riverwood, and parked the vehicle near the intersection of Michigan Road, next to Salt Pan Reserve. The offender opened the boot, and then exited the vehicle. The victim was unable to exit the vehicle, as the offender did not move her seat forward.

The victim heard the boot open. He then heard ALFORD say: 'Hey fuckhead, don't move, don't even look at me.' The victim saw ALFORD standing behind the car holding a firearm. The firearm was pointed at the victim's head, through the open boot. The victim said: 'Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me.'

SPEECHLEY got out of the vehicle, and moved her seat forward, to allow the victim to exit the vehicle. The victim attempted to get out of the vehicle. The offender reached into the car and attached a metal handcuff to the left wrist of the victim. The offender pulled on the cuff, and the victim exited the vehicle. The victim grabbed the offender's wrist.

ALFORD said to the victim: 'You think this is not a real gun?' ALFORD hit the barrel of the firearm against the top of the victim's head. The firearm discharged. The victim saw ALFORD re-load the firearm. ALFORD said 'Should we cut his fingers off now?' SPEECHLEY started to walk away. ALFORD said: 'Tara, get the knife out of the boot.' SPEECHLEY went to the boot and found a knife, which she handed to ALFORD.

The victim then struggled against the offender. He ran along Kentucky Road, away from the offenders. ALFORD discharged the firearm into the air to frighten the victim. 
...

The offender, ALFORD and SPEECHLEY got back into the vehicle and drove around the area, attempting to locate the victim. The trio then made their way to ALFORD's premises.""

6The applicant was later arrested and charged with a single offence of taking Mr Mbele ""with the intention of obtaining an advantage, to wit, to assault, handcuff and threaten Julius Mbele ... while the said accused was in the company of Jason Alford and Tara Speechley"", contrary to s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Ms Speechley was charged in similar terms. Mr Alford was also charged under s 86 and with three additional offences under the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW).

7The applicant and Mr Alford both came to be sentenced by Sides DCJ on 12 September 2012. For some reason which is not clear from the record in this Court, Ms Speechley had already been sentenced by Judge Bennett SC to a term of 23 months; the sentence was suspended. An appeal against that sentence by the Director of Public Prosecutions came before this Court in June 2012. The Court allowed the appeal and re-sentenced Ms Speechley to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on the date on which her sentence had originally been imposed, with a balance of term of 11 months: R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130. In effect the period of imprisonment was not varied, but a non-parole period was fixed, which was required to be served and was not suspended. That outcome was before Sides DCJ when sentencing the Applicant and Mr Alford. He took that sentence into account with respect to the offences under s 86 of the Crimes Act, in order to ensure that the sentences imposed on the applicant and Mr Alford were not disproportionate to that imposed on Ms Speechley.

Factual error
8Against this abbreviated background, it is convenient to identify the factual error which appears from the reasons of the sentencing judge. It arose from the fact that the statements of agreed facts in relation to the applicant and Mr Alford differed. (They also appear to have differed in some respects from that before the Court sentencing Ms Speechley.) The fact that three people involved in a common enterprise are sentenced on differing factual bases may give rise to apparently anomalous results. That occurs because people charged with offences who propose to plead guilty commonly seek to negotiate agreement with the prosecution as to the factual basis upon which they will be sentenced. Unsurprisingly, each will seek to minimise his or her particular role in the criminal conduct.

9Superficially, to sentence co-offenders on different factual assumptions may appear arbitrary or artificial and, accordingly, a result which a prosecutor should seek to avoid. Frequently, however, that is not a fair representation of the circumstances. For example, absent admissions by the individuals, the prosecution may have no means of proving beyond reasonable doubt what role each played in the preparation for the crime. To similar effect, evidence admissible against one offender may not be admissible against the others. The result, which is that the Court may need to sentence on differential facts, is a practical inevitability in many cases.

10The particular difference which gave rise to error in the present case arose from the passage set out above from the statement of agreed facts in relation to the applicant in which it was Mr Alford who asked the threatening question, ""Should we cut his fingers off now?"" There was no reference to this event in the facts agreed with respect to Mr Alford himself. The trial judge was conscious of the differences in the agreed facts: reasons, p 3. However, in dealing generally with the background events, the sentencing judge stated (at p 6):

""According to the facts in connection with the Offender Aubourg, the Offender said: 'Should we cut his fingers off now?' At this point the co-offender started to walk away and the offender Alford said: 'Tara, get the knife out of the boot.' She, that is the co-offender, went to the boot, obtained a knife and handed it to the offender Alford. This conversation about the knife and the handing of it to the offender Alford is not contained in the facts concerning Alford ... and in his case the Court has ignored that aspect of the matter.""

11After setting out the general background, the sentencing judge dealt separately with the case against Mr Alford and then turned to the applicant. After dealing with variations in her statements to police, her role in instigating the offence and the significance of the gun, the sentencing judge stated (at p 20), in terms which were similar to those set out in the previous paragraph:

""That may well be the case concerning the gun for the offender Aubourg, but in her case, the evidence about and the terms in which the offender Aubourg spoke about cutting the fingers and directing the co-offender [to] get the scissors indicate that the purpose that she was intent upon was a little different and included a physical assault upon the victim and was therefore not limited to threatening or intimidating him.""

12It is clear that, in this respect, the sentencing judge erred. Not only was it Mr Alford and not the applicant who referred to ""cutting his fingers"", but it was Mr Alford, not she, who directed Ms Speechley to get the knife (not scissors).

Materiality of error
13Counsel for the Director submitted that the error was not material. She did so on the basis that the substance of the case against the applicant had been summarised earlier in the judgment (p 18) in the following terms:

""Based upon her admissions in the second ERISP interview to the police, the Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that she instigated the offence and that her initial plan included the use of the gun. That is consistent in the Court's view with the level of her fear of the victim that emerged during cross-examination by Miss Hickleton.

The Court is also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, along with her, the other two discussed and planned the offence.

The evidence before the Court indicates that she played an active role in the execution of the offence in that:

· she enticed the victim into the car;
· provided and drove the car;
· provided and used the handcuffs;
· let the offender Alford out of the boot;
· handcuffed the victim; and
· pulled him from the car and held onto him until he struggled free. 

Her role was crucial in the execution of the offence. Without her initiating it and providing the car it seems to the Court the offence would never have been committed.

By the same token, because of her level of fear, it is unlikely that she would have gone ahead with the plan without the gun that was supplied by the offender Alford. Clearly, she was motivated by revenge. The victim's harassment of her in the days preceding the offence fuelled that desire.""

14Counsel for the Director then referred to a later passage, shortly after the error was made, in which the sentencing judge noted that the ""active role"" of the applicant was greater than that of Mr Alford, although her moral culpability was reduced for subjective reasons. The repetition of the phrase ""active role"", it was submitted, was a reference back to the earlier passage in which there had been no reference to the threat of physical injury by cutting the fingers.

15This approach cannot be accepted in full. On the one hand, the error about the knife was not the most important factor in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending. Although a knife can be a lethal weapon, the threat posed by the loaded gun was significantly more serious than that which followed from the threat to use a knife for cutting fingers. On the other hand, it is clear that the sentencing judge did rely upon the erroneous statement that it was the applicant who had suggested a physical assault by cutting the fingers of the victim. It may well be that the applicant's role in instigating the offence, including the plan to use the gun, raised her level of culpability above that of Mr Alford, but given the fact that Mr Alford was the person responsible for making threats with the loaded gun, it seems likely that the threat to use physical violence, incorrectly attributed to the applicant, was also a significant feature in that assessment. The error cannot be rejected as immaterial. 

Whether Court should intervene
16Despite the factual error, there remains a large question as to whether the Court should intervene to reduce the applicant's sentence. Determination of this issue requires consideration of three broad issues, namely:

(a) the objective seriousness of the offending;

(b) mitigating factors personal to the applicant, and

(c) issues of parity with co-offenders.

(a) objective seriousness
17The correct approach to sentencing for an offence of taking or detaining for advantage was discussed by Johnson J in Speechley, in relation to the circumstances of this particular offending. To the extent that the facts on which Ms Speechley was sentenced differed from those relevant to the applicant, the variations were not significant to the overall assessment of the objective gravity of the offending. Nor should there be any doubt that the assessment of the Court in Speechley that this was ""an offence of significant objective gravity, well above the lower end of the scale"" is equally applicable to the present applicant: Speechley at [117].

18Although the physical detention of the victim did not commence until the applicant placed a handcuff around his left wrist, and was thus of short duration, that matter was of limited assistance to the applicant, as the victim was not released by her but rather broke free from her and fled out of fear: cf Speechley at [106].

19Further, the fact that the victim was not physically injured is of limited assistance to the applicant. That the gun discharged by accident rather than intent demonstrated the real risk of causing serious injury when threatening a person with a loaded gun. After the accidental discharge, not only did Mr Alford re-load the gun, but he fired it again, though not at the victim. Further, once the victim broke away, the three offenders re-entered the car and spent some time driving around trying to relocate him.

20In Speechley, Johnson J noted that this offence constituted a form of ""vigilante action"", noting ""the need to condemn actions of this type and to reflect general deterrence on sentence"": at [110].

21Although s 86 undoubtedly covers a wide range of conduct, it is necessary to bear in mind that the maximum penalty for an aggravated offence under s 86(2) is 20 years imprisonment. It will be necessary to return to the outcome in Speechley in considering issues of parity, but it is relevant for present purposes to note that a sentence of two years six months imprisonment, before discounting and disregarding the suspension, was held to be within the appropriate range. On a prosecution appeal, that means that it was not erroneously lenient. Given the more serious involvement of the applicant (as compared with that of Speechley) it is not possible to say that a sentence of four years before discounting was manifestly excessive, having regard solely to the objective seriousness of the offending.

(b) subjective circumstances
22The circumstances of the applicant were carefully addressed by the sentencing judge and need not be repeated in detail. Relevant mitigating circumstances were:

(a) a dysfunctional upbringing because of her parents' substance abuse and domestic violence (judgment, p 21);

(b) her efforts to obtain qualifications and responsible employment (p 22);

(c) her physical health issues (p 22), and

(d) her significant mental health issues arising from the sexual assault in August 2010 which lead her to ""self-medicate with cannabis"" (p 23) and, more importantly, a reduced ability, due to post-traumatic stress disorder, to control her anger (p 21).

23On the other side of the coin, the sentencing judge was not satisfied that her expression of regret constituted ""genuine remorse"": p 23. Further, the applicant made inconsistent statements to the police and, more troublingly, gave evidence on the sentencing hearing which the Court found ""lacked credibility"" (pp 15-16). The trial judge noted (at p 18):

""The thrust of the Crown's position is that in regard to this aspect of the case she lied to minimise her involvement. Having considered all the evidence, including her explanations, the Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that that is what she did during her evidence."" (See also at p 25.)

24In these circumstances, the most powerful subjective consideration was the applicant's diagnosed psychiatric condition of post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by the rape which was accepted to have occurred and to have been the act of the victim of the present offending.

(c) parity
25Questions of parity loom large in a case involving three co-offenders, to the extent that each was charged with an offence under s 86. Sides DCJ treated the applicant and Mr Alford as on a par in respect of that offence: judgment, p 21. However, he described the offence as ""within the low range but it is certainly not at the bottom of the low range because of the gun and because the detention came to an end when the victim escaped by his own devices"". No doubt there is a level of imprecision in characterising offences as within a low, middle or high range. Nevertheless, that characterisation would seem to be inconsistent with the description in Speechley that the offence was ""well above the lower end of the scale"", in respect of objective gravity.

26In the event, the sentencing judge appears to have calculated each sentence from a starting point of four years. The reduction to 33 months in the case of the applicant derived from a combined discount of 25% (for an early plea) and 5% (for assistance to police). In sentencing Ms Speechley, Bennett DCJ commenced with a term of two years and six months which, after a discount of 25% (for the utility of an early plea), gave a sentence of 23 months. Despite the higher starting point, the terms of mandatory custody imposed on Ms Speechley and the applicant vary by only three months, because the applicant received a greater discount (30% as against 25% for Ms Speechley) and because of a degree of leniency accorded with respect to her non-parole period, which constituted less than half her total sentence. As each is entitled to automatic release on parole at the end of the period of mandatory custody, in considering parity significant weight should be given to the respective non-parole periods. 

27On the other hand, to reduce the applicant's sentence by any significant amount (such as 15%) would be to leave the applicant with an almost identical non-parole period to that imposed on Ms Speechley. That would tend to minimise the very real disparity in their culpability. Thus, unlike the applicant, Ms Speechley had no real interest in punishing or intimidating the victim; she did not instigate the offending; she did not obtain the car used in the offence; she did not know that Mr Alford had a gun until it was used in the course of the offending, and she did not assault the victim with handcuffs. 

Conclusion
28First, although the factual error made by the sentencing judge was material, it did not relate to the most serious aspects of the offending. Secondly, once the error is disregarded, the sentence is not shown to be manifestly excessive for the objective offending. Nor was the applicant's culpability significantly reduced by her subjective circumstances. Thirdly, to reduce the applicant's sentence by any amount which is not mere tinkering would be to produce an inappropriate disparity with the sentence imposed by this Court on Ms Speechley. For these reasons, I joined the grant of leave to appeal, but dismissed the appeal.

2761799,LA v R [2013] NSWCCA 146,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with Hidden J.

2HIDDEN J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to seven counts of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 14 and 16, an offence under s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. On 21 June 2012 he was sentenced to a series of partly cumulative terms of imprisonment, commencing on 21 February 2012 so as to take account of a discrete period of pre-sentence custody. The sentences were as follows:

On counts 1 and 2: concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 1 year, commencing on 21 February 2012;

Counts 3 - 5: concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years, commencing on 21 February 2013;

Counts 6 - 7: concurrent terms of imprisonment for 3 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year, commencing on 21 February 2014.

The aggregate sentence was imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.

Facts 

3The victim of the offences was a 15 year old girl, who was the sister of the applicant's partner. The applicant was aged between 28 and 29 years at the time of the offences. The victim moved in to the home of the applicant and his partner late in 2008, and the offences occurred throughout 2009.

4An agreed statement of facts recorded that the first two counts arose from an occasion early in 2009, when the applicant entered her bedroom, woke her, penetrated her digitally and had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. The third, fourth and fifth counts relate to an occasion in May 2009 when, in the bedroom occupied by the applicant and his partner, he penetrated her digitally, performed cunnilingus upon her and again had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. The sixth and seventh counts arose from an occasion in October 2009 when, in that same bedroom, he digitally penetrated her and had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. After each of these occasions the victim felt pain in her vagina.

5After recounting the offences on the first occasion (counts 1 and 2), the statement of facts asserted that the victim engaged in sexual activity with the offender on other occasions. On each occasion the victim was approached by her sister and asked, ""Could you do me a favour?"" The victim knew this to mean that her sister was asking her to have sex with the offender. This could convey that the seven counts were part of a wider pattern of abuse. However, that is not entirely clear. Neither the sentencing judge nor the Crown prosecutor in this court approached the matter in that way. In the circumstances, it is fairer to treat the seven counts as the only incidents. 

6On the second occasion (counts 3, 4 and 5) the sister woke the victim and asked her to do her ""a favour."" She then took the girl to the bedroom she shared with the applicant, where the offences occurred in her presence. On the third occasion (counts 6 and 7) the victim wanted to go to a party, and her sister told her that the applicant had said that she would be allowed to do so if she would come home and ""do a favour"" for him. The offences occurred after she returned home, when the sister again woke her and asked her if she would ""go lay with"" the applicant ""for a while."" 

7The sister's behaviour, of course, is disturbing. She was not charged with any offence arising from that conduct, and the circumstances of her complicity are unclear. It was not suggested in this court that her behaviour in any way diminished the applicant's culpability. 

8On the first and second occasions the victim was affected by alcohol and cannabis. On the third occasion she had used cannabis earlier in the night. The applicant was drunk on each occasion. 

9In assessing the gravity of the offences, the sentencing judge said in his remarks that the applicant's ""action in involving and having a relationship with a 15 year old girl while she was in the offender's and his partner's care must place this in at least the middle of the range of sentence."" I shall return to this observation, which is the focus of the first ground of the application.

Subjective case 

10The applicant had a difficult upbringing and struggled at school. He left home in his early teens and lived on the streets of Sydney, where he came to abuse alcohol and illicit drugs. He has had minimal employment. He has a criminal history comprising various offences, including some offences of violence, although there are no entries for offences of a sexual nature. A matter not referred to by his Honour was that at the time of the incidents the subject of the third to seventh counts the applicant was on bonds for offences of assault and affray, which had been dealt with in a Local Court in February 2009. 

11To a Probation and Parole officer who prepared a pre-sentence report, the applicant said that his relationship with the victim's sister had been unstable. He described it as an ""open relationship"", and claimed to be unaware that the victim was under the age of consent. He acknowledged that his ""thought processes were somewhat distorted due to excessive substance abuse ... ."" He advanced the same explanation in evidence in the sentence proceedings, but said that he now saw his conduct as ""wrong"" and expressed his remorse for what had happened. He also gave evidence that he had gained insight into his drug dependence, had been able to moderate his use of drugs, and saw the risk to himself and others by his continued use. His Honour accepted that evidence. 

12His Honour allowed a discount of 20% for the applicant's pleas of guilty.

The application

13Counsel for the applicant, Mr Rosser QC, argued the application on three grounds: 


His Honour took into account an aggravating feature, offending the principle enunciated in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 


The difference between the sentences passed for counts 3 to 7 from those passed for counts 1 and 2 could not be justified. 


The aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive.

De Simoni

14As I have said, in placing the offences in the ""middle of the range of sentence"" his Honour had regard to the fact that they had occurred while the victim was in the ""care"" of the applicant and his partner. Mr Rosser submitted that this was tantamount to a finding that she was under the authority of the applicant, an aggravating factor under s 66C(5)(d) of the Crimes Act, characterising the offences as aggravated offences under s 66C(4), carrying the higher maximum sentence of 12 years imprisonment. Mr Rosser noted the provision in s 61H(2) of the Act that ""a person is under the authority of another person if the person is in the care, or under the supervision or authority, of the other person."" He argued that his Honour's finding that the victim was under the care of the applicant and his partner fell within that definition, elevating the offences to the aggravated form, so as to be in breach of the De Simoni principle.

15Reading his Honour's remarks as a whole, it does not appear to me that he was using the word ""care"" as a term of art in this context. It is noteworthy that he spoke of the victim being in the care not only of the applicant but also of her sister. I am satisfied that his Honour was saying no more than that the offences occurred while the victim was being cared for by the applicant and his partner as a member of their household. This was an appropriate observation in the circumstances, and not one which fell foul of the De Simoni principle. Nor, I might add, could it be said that the aggregate sentence reflects an erroneous finding of a circumstance of aggravation under the section.

Individual sentences

16Next, Mr Rosser questioned how it could be that the acts of digital and penile penetration on the second occasion, the subject of counts 3 and 5, attracted fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years when the same conduct on the first occasion, the subject of counts 1 and 2, attracted fixed terms of only 1 year. Moreover, he noted, the same conduct on the third occasion, the subject of counts 6 and 7, resulted in head sentences of 3 years. This pattern of sentence, he argued, was inconsistent with the approach required by Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57, 194 CLR 610, in the joint judgment at [44], requiring a sentencing court to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence before considering questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. 

17I appears to me, however, that his Honour was adopting the practical approach to the sentencing exercise sanctioned in the joint judgment in Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15, 78 ALJR 616, at [26] by lowering some of the sentences and aggregating them for determining the time to be served. Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ saw that approach as consonant with Pearce, as did Gleeson CJ at [2]. 

18No doubt, the fixed terms which his Honour passed for the first five counts represented the non-parole periods he would have fixed if he had passed sentences with a non-parole period in respect of them. The sentences of 1 year for each of counts 1 and 2 are lenient. The 2 year sentences for each of counts 3, 4 and 5 are less so, but they were directed to be served concurrently and, of course, also embraced the criminality of count 4, the cunnilingus. The sentences of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year on each of counts 6 and 7 were appropriate for those offences, and the structure of all of the sentences was such as to produce an aggregate sentence which properly reflected the applicant's criminality. 

19In my view, no error has been demonstrated in his Honour's approach. 

Manifestly excessive?

20Finally, Mr Rosser submitted that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive. He argued that the offences should be viewed as ""towards the lesser end of the spectrum"", and that it was not apparent that the discount of 20% for the pleas of guilty had been applied to the sentences.

21This submission also must be rejected. As Mr Rosser acknowledged, the significant difference in age between the applicant and the victim demonstrates a breach of trust on his part, and there were a number of offences extending over the best part of a year. After allowing for the 20% discount, and the favourable features of the applicant's subjective case, I consider that the aggregate sentence and effective non-parole period were well within the bounds of the proper exercise of his Honour's discretion.

22Accordingly, none of the grounds of the application has been made out. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

23FULLERTON J: I agree with Hidden J.

		27 June 2013",2013-06-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761800,Hendra v R [2013] NSWCCA 151,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with McCallum J.
2McCALLUM J:  On 28 August 2011, a man was assaulted by a number of security guards at the Ivy nightclub.  The applicant was one of the security guards charged as a result of that incident.  He was arraigned on an indictment containing one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Act.  He pleaded not guilty to both offences and was tried before Berman DCJ with a jury.  He represented himself at the trial.  The jury returned a verdict of not guilty of the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and guilty of the charge of common assault.  
3The applicant was legally represented at the proceedings on sentence.  The maximum penalty for the offence of common assault is imprisonment for a period of two years.  The judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months and a balance of term of nine months, giving a total sentence of 18 months imprisonment.  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.
Circumstances of the offence
4The victim of the assault was Mr Nicholas Barsoum.  The judge found that Mr Barsoum was drinking at the Ivy when, in the early hours of the morning, he was approached by an ex-girlfriend, who punched him.  He became cross and grabbed her as she ran away.  That led to the intervention of security guards other than the applicant.  They directed Mr Barsoum to leave the nightclub and escorted him out of the premises.  He remonstrated with them.  One of the security guards, probably Paul Fenukitau, punched him in the face.  The punch caused a significant injury to Mr Barsoum's lip, which later required stitching.  Mr Barsoum sent a text message to friends who assembled outside the Ivy and returned to talk to the security guards, evidently to find out the name of the security guard who had assaulted Mr Barsoum.
5The judge stated that it was difficult to tell from closed-circuit television footage whether the violence that followed was started by Mr Barsoum and his friends or by the security guards.  Within a short space of time, the security guards had isolated Mr Barsoum and he was set upon outside the club. The judge described him as having been ""beaten savagely"", being kicked, punched and stomped upon by the guards.  It is important to note, as observed more than once by the sentencing judge, that the applicant is not alleged to have been involved in that part of the assault.  The judge's purpose in reciting that history was that it explained the condition in which the applicant found Mr Barsoum, which the judge evidently regarded as a significant factor aggravating the seriousness of the offence.  An eyewitness who saw Mr Barsoum after he had been assaulted outside the club said:
His face was like, I've never seen anything like his face.  He was just, I couldn't even see his eyes, like it was like somebody literally drew a line, like just a thick line on his face and that was his eyes.  Like, he was just like a balloon.  His face was like, blown up like a balloon and there was blood all over him.  I couldn't even recognise what nationality he was, anything. 
6Mr Barsoum was then taken downstairs inside the club.  The judge, who saw the CCTV footage during the trial, described it as revealing a man ""who had been beaten so much he was barely able to sit upon a stool"".  While Mr Barsoum was seated on the stool, the applicant approached him and kicked him once, apparently to the stomach or chest area.  There was CCTV footage of the assault which was viewed by the judge during the trial.  
7The applicant had at his trial run a defence that he was acting in self- defence on the basis that, as he approached Mr Barsoum to assess him for the purposes of first aid, Mr Barsoum spat blood at him.  The judge, consistently with the jury's verdict, rejected that contention and found beyond reasonable doubt that if Mr Barsoum did spit blood, it was only in response to other security guards spitting at him.  The judge found that the applicant was not acting in self-defence or in the defence of any other person but was an aggressor who had lost his temper.
8After Mr Barsoum was kicked by the applicant, other security guards continued to beat him.  The judge noted that the applicant was second in charge of security that evening and had done nothing to intervene to prevent the further attack upon Mr Barsoum.  
9The judge noted that, in accordance with the jury's verdict and noting that Mr Barsoum had in fact suffered actual bodily harm at the hands of others during the downstairs phase of the attack, it should be concluded that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was acting in company.  However, as noted by the judge, it did not follow that what occurred after the applicant kicked Mr Barsoum should be ignored.  The judge said:
Having kicked Mr Barsoum, no feelings of remorse came upon [the applicant].  He did not do a single thing as Mr Barsoum was savagely beaten again.  He looked after Mr Fenukitau and Mr Vacic [another security guard], ignoring what was happening to Mr Barsoum a short distance away.   This lack of remorse has continued to this day.
10His Honour's reference to the continuing lack of remorse found unequivocal support in the report of a probation and parole officer who recorded that the applicant had told her he had no remorse in relation to the commission of the offence.  As to that evidence, the judge described the applicant's attitude towards his criminality as ""remarkable"" and noted that the applicant appeared to see himself as the victim, accusing police who investigated the matter as having political allies and ""being primed for bigger things"".
11The judge acknowledged that the assault was based on a single blow but described it as one revealed by the video evidence as being ""a significant one"".  His Honour also recorded the fact that it was a blow inflicted on a man who was ""already exhibiting the signs of terrible injuries"".  His Honour concluded that it was ""one of the worst types of common assault that it is possible to contemplate"".  
12As to the applicant's subjective circumstances, the judge noted that the applicant had a difficult upbringing entailing violence at the hands of his own father.  The violence he had experienced during his childhood had been bad enough to prompt the applicant to leave home at the age of 15.  The judge noted the applicant's history of gainful employment and observed that character references tendered on his behalf spoke very highly of him.  The references included a description of the applicant's good works particularly at the time of the Brisbane floods when he had given his own time and organised other people to travel to Queensland to assist people harmed through the floods.  The judge noted that the applicant had no prior convictions which, noting his age of 35 years, the judge thought spoke strongly of the applicant's underlying good character.  
13The first ground of appeal is:
that his Honour erred in failing to take into consideration that the matter could have been disposed of in the Local Court.
14Chapter 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 requires certain indictable offences to be dealt with summarily (in the Local Court) unless an election is made to have the offence dealt with on indictment.  The relevant offences are listed in schedule 1 to the Act.  The schedule is divided into two tables.  Offences listed in table 1 are to be dealt with summarily unless either the prosecutor or the person charged elects to have it dealt with on indictment.  Offences listed in table 2 are required to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor elects to have the offence dealt with on indictment.
15The offence of common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act is a table 2 offence and was accordingly required to be dealt with summarily in the absence of an election by the prosecutor.  The maximum penalty that the Local Court could have imposed had the offence been dealt with summarily was imprisonment for 12 months or a fine:  s 268(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act as it stood on the date of the offence (s 268 has since been amended so as to provide a uniform maximum term of imprisonment for table 2 offences of two years unless the maximum term provided by law for the offence is shorter: s 268(1A)).
16Accordingly, had the applicant been sentenced in the Local Court, the maximum penalty that Court could have imposed was imprisonment for 12 months, whereas in the District Court he faced the maximum penalty of two years prescribed by s 61 of the Crimes Act.  The relevance of that circumstance was not in dispute in the appeal.  The applicant relied upon the summary of the applicable principles by Hall J in R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 at [15].  As his Honour noted, when an offence is dealt with on indictment which could have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court, the District Court is not bound by any lower maximum penalty that binds the Local Court, but may have regard to that circumstance in an appropriate case.  The fact that the sentencing judge does not expressly refer to the fact that the matter could have been dealt with summarily does not necessarily establish that the judge failed to have regard to that consideration.  One way of testing whether or not silence on that issue is indicative of error is to consider whether the sentence appears to be manifestly excessive and whether a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate.
17It may be acknowledged that the sentencing judge in the present case did not expressly refer to the fact that the offence could have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court.  However, it should be observed that no submission was put to his Honour on that issue.  For the reasons explained in Johnson J's careful treatment of a similar argument in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, the failure to raise the possibility of summary disposal as a mitigating factor at the time when an offender is being sentenced in the District Court may be seen as ""a very practical barometer as to whether such an argument was realistically available in the circumstances"":  at [83].  Johnson J stated at [111] to [112]:
111. The ground of appeal can only be meaningful if this Court determines that the total sentence for the particular offence should not have exceeded the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court. It might be thought that a ground asserting manifest excess is capable of covering the same ground, if the position is that clear in the particular case.
112. Unless it is plainly wrong that the offence is in the District Court, it is difficult to see how an offender can succeed on a ground of appeal which claims that a relevant factor has not been taken into account by the sentencing Judge.
18Having regard to the experience of the sentencing judge in the present case, I consider it unlikely that his Honour failed to have regard to the availability of summary disposal of the charge.  For the reasons explained in Zreika, it is otherwise appropriate to return to this ground in the context of the ground of manifest excess considered below.
19Ground 2 is:
that the applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when his sentence is compared to related offenders.
20In support of that ground, the applicant pointed to the sentences imposed on Emmanouil Ntaras and Jason Mendelow, who set upon the victim while he was sitting on the stool downstairs, and Paul Fenukitau, who attacked the victim upstairs (striking him many times around the head) and punched him again to the head whilst he was seated on the stool downstairs.
21The Crown provided a helpful table comparing the circumstances of the four sentences.  The three co-offenders were sentenced by Flannery DCJ after the applicant had been sentenced.  Each had pleaded guilty to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, which carries a maximum penalty of 7 years' imprisonment.  Mr Ntaras and Mr Fenukitau were given the maximum discount of 25 percent to reflect their pleas.  Mr Mendelow pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity but subsequently withdrew his plea, entering it again at a later point.  He received a discount of 20 percent.  
22Taking the pleas into account, the starting point for Mr Ntaras was a total sentence of 3 years and for Mr Mendelow a total sentence of 2 years and 6 months.  Mr Ntaras received a non-parole period of 14 months with an additional term of 13 months while Mr Mendelow received a non-parole period of 12 months with an additional term of 12 months.  Mr Fenukitau was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 22 and a half months which was ordered to be served by way of intensive correction order.
23Mr Ntaras was sentenced on the basis that he had subjected the victim to a prolonged attack which was due to a desire for retribution and extreme irritation he felt towards the victim for talking back.  
24Mr Mendelow was sentenced on the basis that he was in company with Mr Ntaras during his prolonged attack upon the victim.  Her Honour concluded as to each offender that their offences were serious but not in the worst category.  
25Each had strong subjective circumstances.  As to Mr Mendelow, Flannery DCJ accepted the assessment of a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, that the offender had a low risk of re-offending.  Mr Mendelow gave evidence at the proceedings on sentence.  Her Honour accepted that he was ""very much"" sorry for what he had done; that there was little likelihood of his re-offending and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good.  Her Honour made similar findings in respect of Mr Ntaras.  Her Honour found that his behaviour on the evening was an aberration for which he was now remorsefull and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend.   
26The applicant's argument in support of ground 2 relied principally on the case of Mr Fenukitau, who was dealt with by the more lenient penalty of serving his term by way of intensive correction order.  Specifically, the applicant noted that Mr Fenukitau had a charge of common assault taken into account on a form 1 which was itself objectively more serious or at least indistinguishable from the offence for which the applicant was sentenced.  The submission ignores a number of aspects of the sentence passed on Mr Fenukitau.  First, his assaults were committed after Mr Barsoum had assaulted him and caused a fracture and laceration to his eye.  Flannery DCJ found that, after being struck by Mr Barsoum, Mr Fenukitau was in a state of ""hyper arousal"" brought about by reactivation of a post-traumatic stress disorder and that he had acted in shock and anger as a result of being struck.  That was found to have reduced his ability to respond appropriately, significantly reducing his moral culpability for the offences. 
27Mr Fenukitau also had a strong subjective case.  He was of good character.  The judge found that he was extremely remorseful.  He had had trouble forgiving himself for the offences and had undertaken extensive cognitive behavioural therapy to address his offending.  The judge found that he was ""most unlikely to re-offend"".  No such findings were made in favour of the applicant in the present case.  The applicant's submission also overlooks the aggravating circumstances of his offence which included the fact that he was the second in charge of security that evening and thus in a position in which he should have been controlling violence for the benefit of others, not inflicting it himself.
28I am not persuaded that the applicant should have a legitimate sense of grievance at the penalty imposed upon him in comparison with those imposed on his co-offenders.
29The third ground of appeal is:
that his Honour erred in finding that the offence is ""one of the worst types of common assault that is possible to contemplate"".   
30It is well established that a sentencing judge's characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is an evaluative judgment with which this Court will not interfere unless the finding was not open.  The sentencing judge had the benefit of hearing all of the evidence at the trial, including viewing the CCTV footage and seeing the applicant give evidence.  His Honour evidently placed weight on the vulnerability of the victim due to the horrific injuries he had already sustained and the fact that the applicant was in a position of seniority among the security guards present that evening.  The judge squarely raised with counsel the opportunity to say why this was not the worst kind of this offence.  The response was unedifying.  In my view, the conclusion his Honour reached in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending was well open.
31Ground 4 is that the sentence is manifestly excessive.  
32Once it is accepted, as in my view it must be, that it was open to the judge to sentence the offender on the basis that the offence was within the worst type of common assault, in my view it follows that the sentence imposed was within the permissible range.  The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment which was three quarters of the maximum penalty.  The finding of special circumstances was reflected in a generous adjustment of the statutory ratio and resulted in the imposition of a non-parole period which, had it been imposed as a fixed term, would have been within the range of penalty that could have been imposed in the Local Court.
33I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
34R A HULME J:  I agree with McCallum J.

2761802,Cassar v R [2013] NSWCCA 147,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Button J and with his Honour's reasons.

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Button J that the combined discount of 35% for the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities was open to Judge Ainslie-Wallace, on the material before her. 

3JM v R was a special case. There was evidence of assistance to authorities by that applicant, including a confidential document, exhibit B. Among other things, it disclosed that he had undertaken to give evidence against several people, including the person referred to by Simpson J as ""X."" 

4Counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings had expressed the view that his prospect of doing so was ""remote."" However, exhibit B envisaged that those people might be prosecuted, and its author noted that the information the applicant had given about X was such as might have opened up a previously unlikely prospect of his being prosecuted: see the judgment of Simpson J at [16] - [20].

5After sentence was passed on that applicant X was charged, and a statement by the applicant was part of the brief against him. In the event, X pleaded guilty. This was the fresh evidence relied upon.

6What Simpson J found was that, even on the evidence before the sentencing judge, the significance of the applicant's undertaking to give evidence against others, including X, was underestimated, a fact which became more evident in the light of what occurred after sentence was passed. At [30] her Honour referred to the willingness of the applicant to give evidence against X and another man, and at [31] her Honour concluded:

""There was no basis in the evidence for counsel for the applicant to assess that prospect adversely to the applicant, as 'remote', nor for the judge to accept it. It represents a misconception of the effect of exhibit B. That misconception can be more clearly seen because of the post-sentence events.""

7It was this which led her Honour to apply the principle to which she referred at [26], set out in the judgment of Button J. The present case is not of that kind, and does not invoke that principle. Judge Ainslie-Wallace's assessment of the value of the applicant's assistance was properly based on the material she had. However, his continued assistance thereafter justified the more favourable view taken by Judge Zahra, reflected in the discount which his Honour allowed. 

8I agree with the orders proposed by Button J.

9BUTTON J: Leave to appeal is sought with regard to sentences imposed by Judge Ainslie-Wallace in the District Court of New South Wales on 16 April 2010. The single ground of appeal is ""[t]he discount on sentence given to the applicant for assistance to authorities was insufficient in all of the circumstances."" 

10The application was brought well out of time, but the Crown did not oppose leave being granted in that regard. Due to the length of the sentences imposed by her Honour, and the significance of the issue raised by the applicant, leave to appeal out of time should be granted.

The first proceedings on sentence

11On 16 April 2010, her Honour sentenced the applicant for four offences: manufacturing a large commercial quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA); manufacturing a large commercial quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone (MDP2P); possessing a precursor intended to be used in the manufacture of MDA; and possessing proceeds of crime, namely $340,100, when the applicant knew that the money was such proceeds and intended to conceal its true nature. 

12The first and second offences were brought pursuant to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The third offence was contrary to s 24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The fourth offence was brought pursuant to s 193B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

13The maximum penalty for the first two offences was imprisonment for life, and there was also an applicable standard non-parole period of 15 years. The maximum penalty for the third offence was imprisonment for 10 years. The maximum penalty for the fourth offence was imprisonment for 20 years.

14Due to the tight focus of the ground, it is not necessary to recite the objective and subjective features of the matter in any great detail. In short, the applicant was sentenced on the basis that he was deeply entrenched in the illegal business operation of producing very large quantities of the drug commonly known as ecstasy, and his role included the sourcing of materials and financial oversight. 

15The proceeds of crime offence was to do with the provision by the applicant of false passports, a topic to which I shall return shortly. 

16With regard to the objective features, her Honour found:

""Although the offender said that he started out in this venture as a banker, over time that role evolved and he became involved in the manufacturing process albeit, acting on the directions of others. Even so he played a continuing role in facilitating the process of manufacture and was able to assist, as directed, in processing the chemicals towards their eventual completion.

The conversations and the offender's evidence persuades me that he was aware of the processing steps and the ultimate products to be able to speak knowledgably even if he did not have a wealth of technical knowledge.

Although it was submitted that the offender's role was to act, in effect, as a warehouse assistant, I am of the view that his role was more substantial and more important than that. He was trusted to hold the money and deal it out for purchases when required. Over time his role changed to doing work in the unit and assisting in the manufacture and process and buying and delivering equipment. I am of the view that his role could reasonably be described as providing logistical support to the enterprise.

While it is helpful to try and assign a role in any hierarchy to an offender so as to determine, among other things, where the offender's criminality lies in relation to others, the overriding principle is that the offender has to be sentenced for what he did in committing the crimes.""

17Subjectively, the applicant was 61 years of age when he was sentenced. He had a long history of having suffered from depression. The applicant stated that he had left school at the age of 15 years and had not obtained any further education since. He had been subject to imprisonment for most of his adult life, but had had some legitimate occupations from time to time. In a pre-sentence report tendered before her Honour, it was recorded that whilst the applicant had taken responsibility for the offences, he had not displayed ""a great deal of insight into the effects of his offending behaviour on the wider community"". He had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to all offences, and received a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of those pleas. 

18The applicant had a lengthy record for offences relating to prohibited drugs. In 1988, for conspiring to supply such drugs, he received a head sentence of imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. In 1998, for the offence of supplying prohibited drugs, he received a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. In those circumstances, it was completely inevitable that her Honour would impose lengthy custodial sentences upon the applicant.

19The issue of assistance was an important one in the proceedings on sentence. Her Honour noted in the remarks on sentence that, whilst in prison, the applicant had been approached by the Australian Crime Commission. He had provided a statement to the officers of that organisation, and indicated in it that he was prepared to give evidence against three co-offenders. 

20Her Honour also recorded that a letter to the Court by an officer of the Australian Federal Police (""AFP"") was to the effect that the police had been aware since April 2006 of the possession of false passports by a number of criminals. After arrest, the applicant had accepted his involvement in the possession of false passports, and given information to the AFP. That information confirmed what the police already knew, but also provided them with information not previously known about a particular person. A police theory as to the methods of the applicant was confirmed by what he told them.

21The letter from the AFP revealed that the police regarded the information provided by the applicant as frank and full, and that they believed that the applicant had told them everything that he knew. The police estimated the value of the assistance as low.

22In the remarks on sentence, her Honour repeated that the applicant had confirmed his undertaking to give evidence against two of the co-offenders, along with the third, if that person were ever able to be arrested.

23Her Honour proceeded to say: 

""I am of the view that the offender has provided all of the information he possesses in his assistance and is prepared to give evidence.

Whilst perhaps not of a high order of value the assistance should be recognised and I will give the offender a further discount for his past assistance and his offer to give evidence, of ten per cent.""

24For the four offences, her Honour imposed a total head sentence of imprisonment for 14 years with a total non-parole period of 9 years. Because the ground of appeal is founded on neither the length of the total sentence, nor the length of any individual sentence, nor the place of the individual sentence in the sentencing structure, it is not necessary for me to detail the individual sentences or their place in that structure.

The second proceedings on sentence

25On 24 August 2011, in the District Court of New South Wales, Judge Zahra SC sentenced the applicant for 11 offences to do with false passports. Two counts were brought for making a false statement in an application for an Australian passport. Two counts were brought for improperly using an Australian passport that had not been issued to the applicant. One count was brought for producing to another person false documents in connection with an application for an Australian travel document. Six counts were brought of aiding and abetting the commission of offences by a second person, in that that person produced documents to a third person, the documents were false or misleading, and the documents were produced in connection with an application for an Australian travel document.

26The first count of making a false statement in an application for an Australian passport was brought pursuant to s 10(1)(a) of the Passports Act 1938 (Cth), and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years. The second count of making a false statement in an application for an Australian passport was brought pursuant to s 29(1) of the Australian Passport Act 2005 (Cth), and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 10 years. 

27The two counts of improper use of an Australian passport were contrary to s 32(2) of the Australian Passports Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The offence of producing to another person false documents in connection with an application for an Australian travel document was contrary to s 31(1) of the Australian Passports Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The six counts of aiding and abetting the commission of offences by a second person by producing false or misleading documents to a third person which were produced in a connection with an application for an Australian travel document were brought pursuant to s 31(1) of the Australian Passports Act and s 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for those six offences was imprisonment for 10 years. 

28With regard to objective features, there is no need to detail the modus operandi of the applicant. In short, he used the personal details of deceased persons in order to assist in the obtaining of false passports over a period of two years. No doubt the purposes of those who obtained such documents were illicit. The applicant undertook this course of conduct for profit.

29Again, the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and received a utilitarian discount of 25 per cent. His depression, his age, and his health were emphasised as subjective features.

30Again, assistance from the applicant played in important role in the proceedings on sentence. A separate statement of assistance dated 11 May 2011 was placed before his Honour. That statement showed that, despite the arrest of the applicant, in December 2007, he had not been charged with the passport offences because it was believed that that would compromise the investigation of other persons. It was said that the applicant had provided information which led to the authorities being able to identify some of the recipients of the false passports, and some of those persons may have otherwise remained unknown to the authorities. It was also said that important parts of the information provided by the applicant had been corroborated. The authorities believed that the offender had provided all information that was available to him. In referring to the letter in the remarks on sentence, his Honour said: 

""The offender has continued to co-operate with the authorities. He has indicated a willingness to continue to assist by giving evidence against those persons arrested in connection with the supply of fraudulent Australian Passports and has signed an undertaking to give evidence. The offender by the provision of assistance, which has led to a number of arrests, has to an extent removed some of the potential harm arising from his conduct.""


31His Honour recounted that the letter was to the effect that the offender had given information to the authorities in the face of considerable risks to the safety of himself and his family. It was also said that one person had pleaded guilty at committal because of the proposed evidence of the applicant; that the offender had indicated a willingness to give evidence in at least two other trials; and that that evidence was assessed as being likely to strengthen the prosecution case in those trials. In short, his Honour recorded that the letter assessed the value of the continued assistance of the applicant as high. His Honour went on to say: 

""The offender has spent some time in protective custody with some hardship prior to being transferred to his present custody.

I am of the view that the offender is entitled to a combined discount for his plea of guilty and his past and future assistance in the order of 50%. The component referrable to future assistance is fifteen percent.""

32Later in the remarks on sentence, his Honour referred to the fact that the sentences of the applicant had been split into two separate proceedings on sentence. His Honour noted that the offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime that had been dealt with by Judge Ainslie-Wallace pertained to the passport offences, not the drug offences. It will be recalled that the subject matter of that offence was cash in the sum of over $310,000. His Honour expressed the view that it would have been more appropriate for the passport offences to have been dealt with at the same time as the proceeds of crime offence relating to them. His Honour also expressed the view that, if that had been the case, the sentence for the proceeds of crime offence could well have been wholly concurrent with the sentences imposed for the passport offences. His Honour noted that the sentences to be imposed for the passport offences, in light of the totality principle, needed to reflect that probability.

33Ultimately, his Honour imposed a total head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years 6 months with a single non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. The total sentence commenced on 9 December 2015; that is, one year before the expiry of the non-parole period of the sentences imposed by Judge Ainslie-Wallace. Accordingly, the net effect of the sentences imposed by Judge Zahra is that the pre-existing non-parole period is extended by 18 months.

Submissions on behalf of the applicant

34It was not submitted that Judge Ainslie-Wallace was in error by failing to indicate in the remarks on sentence the separate amounts by which the sentence had been reduced for past and future assistance. That is because s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 did not, at that time, require such differentiation.

35The submission of the applicant was founded upon, but not confined to, the proposition that the contrast between the evaluations of the value of the assistance (""low"" by Judge Ainslie-Wallace, ""high"" by Judge Zahra) should lead to intervention by this Court. 

36It was said that events since the remarks on sentence of her Honour in April 2010 demonstrate that, with the benefit of hindsight, the discount for assistance of 10 per cent was too low. It was submitted that this Court should receive evidence of what had occurred subsequently, including the evaluation made by Judge Zahra, as fresh evidence. It was submitted that the well-known principle, most commonly applied in cases of serious illness, that evidence may be received on appeal of the subsequent development of matters taken into account by a sentencing judge, should apply in this case.

37Separately, and as a secondary matter, it was submitted that the evidence before her Honour with regard to assistance was defective, in that the date of the statement detailing such assistance was 6 October 2009, some six months before the determination of the facts in the remarks on sentence and the imposition of sentence.

38Finally, and again as a secondary matter, it was submitted that, even leaving aside the evolution of events subsequent to the remarks on sentence of Judge Ainslie-Wallace, this Court would evaluate her Honour's classification of the value of the assistance as low as being erroneous.

Submissions on behalf of the Crown

39Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that there was no error in the evaluation by her Honour of the value of the assistance or in the discount provided. In fact, it was submitted, Judge Ainslie-Wallace applied a combined discount of 35 per cent for the plea of guilty and the assistance. It was emphasised that such a discount is not insubstantial.

40In any event, it was submitted, the evaluation of the value of the assistance, and the determination as to the discount to be derived from it, were certainly reasonably open on the evidence before her Honour.

41It was submitted that the events subsequent to the sentencing by her Honour could not, at least in this case, be relied upon to call into question the discount that her Honour had provided for the assistance. Reference was made to R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177, in which Street CJ (with whom Moffitt P and Lee J agreed) said at 178:

""It has been made plain in this Court on many occasions that the Court is essentially charged with an appellate function involving the determination of whether a decision at first instance upon sentence was right or wrong, was excessive or inadequate, as things existed at the time when it was passed. The review of a sentence in the light of subsequent events is the proper province of the executive Government and not of an appeal court.""

42Senior counsel for the Crown also referred to JM v R [2008] NSWCCA 254. That was an appeal to this Court founded upon the asserted inadequacy of a discount provided for assistance in light of fresh evidence. In that case, Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) and Nettle AJA agreed) said at [25] - [27]: 

""[25] It is well established that events that post-date sentence are not available to be used as a basis for disturbing the sentence imposed at first instance. This is because this Court is a court of error, and error cannot be demonstrated by circumstances that did not exist at the time of sentencing: see R v Willard [2001] NSWCCA 6; Application of Antoun El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330; R v Scullion, (unreported, NSWCCA, 15 July 1992); R v MJM [2004] NSWCCA 66. 

[26] However, the authorities draw a distinction, not always clearly, between events or circumstances that did not exist at, or that post-date, sentencing, and events or circumstances relevant to, and casting new light on, circumstances that did exist and were known, although, perhaps, imperfectly, at the time of sentencing. The most frequent example of this is new or additional information concerning a medical condition an offender is known at the time of sentencing to have suffered. 

[27] When the circumstances of this case are closely examined, the present case is analogous. The applicant had provided relevant information; he had undertaken to follow up the provision of information by giving evidence. What was not fully appreciated was what that undertaking would involve in practical terms. That X would be charged was not then certain.""

43It was accepted that perhaps that decision opens the door a chink to the kind of argument advanced by the applicant. But it was said that, at least in this case, the applicant could not pass through that doorway. 

44In short it was submitted that this Court would not have regard to the subsequent events reflected in the evaluation and judgment of Judge Zahra as providing a foundation for intervention by this Court with regard to the evaluation and judgment of Judge Ainslie-Wallace.

Determination

45It is convenient to deal first with the subsidiary submissions of counsel for the applicant.

46First, the sufficiency of the evidence before her Honour of the assistance cannot found the ground of appeal. If it be the case that the letter was somewhat out of date and did not adequately reflect developments between the date upon which it was written and the date upon which sentence was imposed, that was a matter for the parties. It is noteworthy that the applicant was represented at all relevant times by a solicitor most experienced in criminal law. An applicant can hardly criticise, in this Court, a sentencing judge for proceeding on the basis of nothing more or less than the evidence that the parties have seen fit to place before the Court at first instance.

47Secondly, the discount of 10 per cent for past and future assistance, provided as part of a combined discount for the plea of guilty and assistance of 35 per cent, was reasonably open to the evaluative judgment of her Honour. Such a discount is not insignificant, and does not inherently demonstrate error. It was reflective of the evidence from the police that the value of the assistance had been assessed as low. 

48Sentencing judges are in the best position to weigh up all of the evidence with regard to assistance, including of course evaluating the oral evidence, if any, given by offenders and other persons. In light of its role as a court of error, this Court should be slow to interfere with such evaluations, and will only do so when they are clearly wrong.

49Turning to the substantive foundation of the ground, it is true that, in JM v R, Simpson J at [27] and following proceeded to examine events subsequent to sentencing in the context of evaluating the value of assistance. It was held that there had been a misconception at first instance, and ""[t]hat misconception can be more clearly seen because of the post-sentence events."" However, the appeal was dismissed on the basis that any lesser sentence than that imposed would have been unreasonably disproportionate to the offence and thereby would have offended against s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In those circumstances, I do not consider that the decision in JM v R mandates the result in this case. 

50As was said in JM v R, there has been a long-standing exception to the general rule that events subsequent to the imposition of sentence that could have led to a shorter sentence if fully appreciated at the time of sentence are a matter for the Executive, and not this Court. The exception has been most commonly demonstrated in cases where a medical condition of the offender known at the time of sentence subsequently becomes markedly worse: see R v Smith (1987) 27 A Crim R 375 and R v Bailey (1988) 35 A Crim R 458.

51However, I consider that that exception should be circumscribed and not extended beyond its current parameters. If matters known to sentencing judges that subsequently develop in favour of a shorter sentence could found successful appeals to this Court in the ordinary course, this Court would be swamped with such appeals. It is useful to consider two hypothetical examples.

52First, an offender is to be sentenced and it is clear that the sentence will be served in Sydney. Evidence is placed before the court that the partner and children of the offender live in Coffs Harbour, and as a result it will be difficult for them to visit the offender. The sentencing judge takes that hardship into account, to some degree, in sentencing. Two years after sentence is imposed the partner and children of the offender must move to Perth. Is the offender to be permitted to return to this Court and obtain a reduction in his or her sentence as a result of that subsequent development?

53The second hypothetical example is as follows. In sentencing, a judge assesses the prospects of rehabilitation of an offender and and finds them to be quite good. Over the next five years, the offender engages in rehabilitation that can only be described as exemplary. Can the offender impugn the original finding and sentence in this Court, based upon those subsequent events?

54I consider that the answer in both of the hypothetical examples must be in the negative. 

55In the same vein, it could hardly be the case that the Crown could successfully appeal against inadequacy of sentence if the partner and children moved to the same suburb as the gaol in which the first offender was held, or the second offender engaged in no rehabilitation at all subsequent to sentence. 

56It seems to me that the proposition that appeals against sentence to this Court are confined to the identification of error in the proceedings on sentence or remarks on sentence at first instance should not be undermined. The long-standing exception to that principle should not, in my opinion, be expanded to apply to circumstances such as those that exist in this case.

57Here, there can self-evidently be no criticism of Judge Ainslie-Wallace for not taking into account in sentencing the events that occurred subsequently. The fact that Judge Zahra arrived at a different evaluation of the worth of the assistance emanating from the applicant some 14 months later cannot found any criticism of her Honour, in light of the fact that the evaluation of Judge Zahra was founded upon markedly different evidence. And whilst it is true that, with the benefit of hindsight, it would perhaps have been better for the offence with regard to the proceeds of crime to have been dealt with at the same time as the offences with regard to the passports, Judge Zahra explicitly referred to that position and reflected it in the sentences that his Honour imposed.

58In short, whether on the primary basis or the secondary bases, I would not uphold the single ground of appeal.

Orders

59I propose the following orders: 

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

2761814,R v Webber [2013] NSWSC 870,"Judgment
1Geoffrey Webber, the Accused, is charged with one count of murder contrary to s 18(1)A of the Crimes Act 1900 in relation to the death of Luke Aaron Robins on 2 May 2012 at Brookvale.  The question of the fitness of the Accused to be tried having been raised, this is an inquiry under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 whether the Accused is unfit to be tried for the offence of murder.  I note that under s 6 of the Act findings are to be on the balance of probabilities. 2The Crown case statement discloses that at about 11.30 on Wednesday 2 May the Deceased, who was aged 24, was sitting on a seat at the south bound bus stop on Pittwater Road, Brookvale, opposite Warringah Mall; he was waiting for a bus to Sydney City where he was to pick up his motor vehicle which he had left there the previous night.  The Accused who was aged 25 was standing near him.  They did not know each other.  
3Witnesses who were sitting at the north bound bus terminal on the opposite side of Pittwater Road then saw the Deceased and the Accused standing at the bus shelter and facing each other.  The Deceased called out, ""Help me, help me.""  The Accused was holding a large black handled kitchen knife, about 30 centimetres in length, in his right hand. He was holding the knife with the blade of the knife towards the Deceased.
4The Deceased was holding the Accused's right forearm with both of his hands in an attempt to prevent the Accused stabbing him.  The Accused stabbed the Deceased in the chest.  The Deceased fell to the ground lying on his back.  The Accused then straddled him, sat on the Deceased's stomach and stabbed him in the chest again.  The Accused placed his left hand on the handle of the knife and continued to push the knife blade further into the Deceased's chest.  The Accused then covered the Deceased's mouth and nose with his hand. 
5Several witnesses telephoned the police who arrived on the scene within minutes.  The Accused stood up from straddling the Deceased and ran on to a bus which had stopped at the bus stop.  The Accused waved the blood covered knife at the driver.  The police boarded the bus in pursuit.  The Accused struggled with the police who were attempting to arrest him.  He was wrestled from the bus on to the footpath area of Pittwater Road at the bus shelter.  During the struggle he dropped the kitchen knife.  It was later found on the road area of lane one next to the footpath. 
6As the Accused was arrested and cautioned by the police he smiled and made grunting noises.  Other police officers performed CPR on the Deceased until ambulance officers arrived.  The Deceased was immediately taken to Royal North Shore Hospital.  Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful and the Deceased was pronounced dead within minutes of arriving at the hospital.  
7The Accused was taken to Dee Why Police Station where he was entered into police custody.  He declined to seek legal advice or to be interviewed.  He was charged with murder, remanded in custody and taken to Long Bay prison where he was admitted to Long Bay Hospital.
8Dr Rebecca Irvine, a forensic pathologist, conducted an autopsy on the Deceased the following day.  She found a single stab wound on the Deceased's left upper chest.  It was 25-30 centimetres in depth and there were surrounding associated abrasions suggestive of a hilt or guard mark.  
9There were two distinct incisions to the cartilage sub adjacent to the stab wound indicating at least two passes of the blade through this area.  The wound perforated both lobes of the left lung.  There were 1750 millilitres of blood within the left chest cavity and the left lung was collapsed.  The wound tract penetrated the left lateral chest wall and very likely incised the intercostal artery.  
10Multiple sharp force defensive injuries were found on the Deceased's hands.  Blunt force injuries were also found to his face, trunk and hands.  Dr Irvine found that the Deceased's death was caused by the stab wound to the chest.
11The legal test on which unfitness is to be judged is not in doubt.  It is to be found in the R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48 which was approved in Ngatayi v R (1980) 147 CLR 1 at [8] and Kesavarajah v R (1994) 181 CLR 230 at [246].  In Robinson v R [2008] NSWCCA 64, RS Hulme J at [24] helpfully summarised the criteria as follows:  
A person accused needs to be able -(i)  To understand what it is that he is charged with;
(ii) To plead to the charge;
(iii) To exercise his right of challenge;
(iv) To understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely, that it is an enquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with;
(v) To follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formalities;
(vi) To understand ... the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him;
(vii) To make his defence or answer to the charge.

12There is before me a report by Dr Grant Sara from North Sydney Local District Health who has provided background on the Accused in terms of his mental health issues.  The information that Dr Sara has provided is that the Accused is the youngest of six children.  Both his parents suffer from serious psychiatric illness.  His father reportedly had schizophrenia and his mother had a chronic recurrent psychosis which has been variously described as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.  His sister also had recently developed a psychotic illness in the period up to 2005.
13Following the separation of his parents when he was five years of age, the Accused was raised, in part, by his older siblings due to the fluctuating illness of his mother, and was said to have experienced physical and sexual abuse.  A different history in that regard was provided to Dr Allnutt by the Accused.
14Dr Sara said that due to the Accused's mother's illness the children were made wards of the State when the Accused was about 15 and he spent his late adolescence in supported or group homes.  From the ages of 15 to 18 he was in contact with child analysts and mental health services with symptoms of depression and social isolation.  He was assessed as suffering from a dysthymic disorder and had a period of psychotherapy.  Although he made it to year 12 at school, he dropped out of school during that year. 
15He has been examined by two psychiatrists for the purposes of determining his fitness to stand trial.  He was first examined by Dr Richard Furst on 15 June 2012 on behalf of the Legal Aid Commission.  Dr Furst reported on 25 June 2012.  He provided some family background which also included a history of domestic violence in the family home, exacerbated by the Accused's father's mental health issues.  When Dr Furst examined the Accused he said that the Accused did not answer any questions during the assessment.  He did not respond to simple questions such as how old he was or where he was living at the time of his arrest.  He provided no details about the alleged offence in question nor any explanation of his actions.
16Dr Furst obtained his information about the Accused's background and about the offence from other sources, including the Legal Aid Commission, Justice Health medical file and the police statement of facts.
17Dr Furst concluded Mr Webber was a mentally ill person who was suffering from severe paranoid or catatonic schizophrenia.  He was mute and unresponsive during the assessment, making it impossible to gauge his understanding of charges he is facing for the legal process ahead of him. 
18Dr Furst concluded:
Having regard to the standards of Presser  [1958] VR 45 and Kesavarajah (1994) A Crim R 100, I was of the opinion that he was not fit to be tried.
19Dr Furst examined the Accused again on 19 October 2012.  He reported on 9 November in relation to that examination.  On this occasion the Accused spoke to Dr Furst and provided some information to him about his background, his feelings and well-being as at the time of the assessment.  Dr Furst reported that the Accused was slow in his responses and movements and was somewhat restless during the assessment and was distractible.  He was able to communicate and no longer catatonic but he was slow in his manner and Dr Furst thought he was still paranoid.  
20Dr Furst's conclusion with regard to his fitness was that the Accused was a mentally ill person who was suffering from severe paranoid or catatonic schizophrenia.  He had shown some improvement over the months since Dr Furst had first seen him.  He was aware of the charge he was facing.  He was aware that he would be required to enter a plea and was aware that a plea of guilty would lead to him being sentenced and a plea of not guilty would lead to the matter going to trial.  He lacked understanding as to the nature and effects of the mental illness defence which Dr Furst thought might be available to him.
21Dr Furst said that the Accused thought he could explain his version of events to his lawyer but had only a superficial understanding of the legal process, the effect of giving instructions and legal advice that have been provided to him.  He could not explain the role of the Judge in a criminal trial or distinguish this role from the role of the jury.  He was not sure how many people would be on a jury and he was not aware of his right to challenge in the selection of a jury.  The Accused thought that he could follow things in court but Dr Furst commented that there were signs of distractibility during the assessment period and the Accused may well be vulnerable to the effects of his ongoing paranoid delusions when attempting to follow evidence or attend to other legal matters in a trial setting.
22Dr Furst said, although the Accused had shown some signs of improvement, he was still psychotic and may well struggle to appreciate his legal situation, give instructions, accept legal advice and follow what was said in court.  Having regard to the standards of Presser and Kesavarajah, Dr Furst was of the opinion that the Accused was not fit to be tried.  He thought he might become fir to be tried within the next 12 months if he continued to improve. 
23The Accused was then examined by Dr Steven Allnutt on 1 April 2013 on behalf of the DPP.  Dr Allnutt examined the Accused on 22 and 28 March and reported on 1 April.  The Accused spoke at some length to Dr Allnutt providing details of his background and it was during that time that he told Dr Allnutt that he was not exposed to domestic violence, sexual abuse or physical abuse.  It is not necessary to resolve the inconsistency in that evidence for the present purposes.
24Dr Allnutt concluded that the Accused manifested symptoms consistent with a paranoid schizophrenia and he noted that there was a long history of psychotic symptoms characterised by persecutory delusions.  There was also some evidence of mood disturbance associated with the psychotic symptoms in the form of depression and thought process disturbances characterised at times by catatonia, perseveration and delayed or slowed thoughts processes.  He thought a differential diagnosis would include schizoaffective disorder.
25Dr Allnutt said this in relation to his fitness to stand trial: 
In my opinion the defendant manifests capacity to understand the nature of charges... - he understood the role of the Judge, the jury, his lawyers, the prosecution, the various pleas available to him and the consequences of the pleas as well as the purpose of the hearing;  he had capacity to understand the substantial effect of any evidence - he understood what evidence was and that it could be used for and against him.  
In my view he has capacity to plea[d] to the charge... - he understood what a jury was and in my view, with the assistance of counsel, he could exercise his right of challenge;...
I have concern about his capacity to give necessary instructions and let his counsel know his version of facts or tell the Court what it is - while the defendant is improving, he is in an early phase of recovery and still remains psychotic.  I am of the view that the quality of his attention remains impaired and there is  unacceptable risk he will be unable to consistently and adequately follow proceedings in a trial.  
I believe the defendant probably has capacity to plea[d] to the charge, but if the matter went to trial he would be unfit to stand trial at this stage on balance.
26The Accused's solicitor, Dianne Tipper, gave evidence before me.  She was admitted as a solicitor in 1991 and had extensive experience in mental health issues.  For eight years she was the presiding member of the Guardianship Tribunal.  She said that on Tuesday of this week she spoke to Dr Furst who, in turn, had spoken to Dr Chan, the Accused's treating psychiatrist.  Dr Chan had said that in his opinion the Accused was still not fit to stand trial, that he was not very communicative and that there were still present psychotic symptoms. 
27Ms Tipper saw the Accused in the cells this morning before the hearing.  She asked him questions consistent with what is required for the Presser test.  His answers to the questions disclosed that he knew he was at court today for a fitness test, he knew that a Judge decides the sentence, that a jury which consists of 12 people decided whether you were guilty or not guilty.  
28She said in respect of a number of questions he did not provide verbal answers, there was little eye contact but he nodded his head in a negative way that indicated that he did not understand the following matters:  He did not understand what pleading was about, he did not understand challenging jurors, he did not have an understanding of evidence and he did not understand what his defence was, if any.  He did not understand what evidence was.  Ms Tipper was also of the opinion, having spoken to him, that he did not understand generally what was going on and that he would not be capable of giving instructions.
29It is apparent from the reports of the psychiatrists that the Accused's position, at least up until and including the time that Dr Allnutt had seen him, had been one of consistent improvement, albeit that even when Dr Allnutt saw him, Dr Allnutt still considered that he was not at the stage where he was fit to stand trial, in particular because of what Dr Allnutt thought would be his difficulty in providing instructions.
30I accept the evidence of Ms Tipper, particularly based on her long experience in relation to matters such as these.  It is apparent that, at least as of today, there has been something of a decline in the Accused's position, in that matters that he understood at the time Dr Allnutt saw him in March, he now is no longer able to understand or explain.  It may well be that that is simply a result of the illnesses that he suffers and their fluctuating nature.
31I accept the evidence of Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt and also Ms Tipper that at the present time the Accused is not fit to be tried for the offence with which he is charged. In reaching that conclusion I have particular regard to those matters from Presser and Kesavarajah summarised by Hulme J in Robinson.  
32In those circumstances I make these orders: 
1. I find that the Accused Geoffrey Webber is unfit to be tried for the offence of the murder of Luke Aaron Robins on 2 May 2012;
2. In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
3. Pursuant to s 14(b)(iii) of that Act, I remand the Accused in custody pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 16 of that Act.
4. I direct the Court Registry to provide the following documentation to the Tribunal:
a. A copy of this finding;

2761816,R v Ali; R v Amiri; R v Feili; R v Haidari; R v Parhizkar [2013] NSWSC 871,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The offenders Haider Hussein Ali, Mohammed Naim Amiri, Taleb Feili, Ali Haidari and Majid Parhizkar are to be sentenced following a jury having found them to be guilty of criminal offences.  Mr Ali was found guilty of affray and the other four men were found guilty of riot.  These offences were committed at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""Villawood"") on 20 April 2011.
2Riot is an offence contrary to s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years.  Affray is an offence contrary to s 93C and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.
3After almost two weeks of pre-trial hearings the trial itself commenced with the empanelment of the jury on 11 February 2013.  The jury retired on 11 April and returned with their verdicts on 17 April.  
4I have previously sentenced a number of other men who either pleaded guilty or were found guilty of affray:  R v Dadash [2012] NSWSC 1511; R v Darabi, Mansoor & Razai [2013] NSWSC 387; R v Chenarjaafarizad [2013] NSWSC 388; and R v Abdollahi [2013] NSWSC 428.
Facts
5To put into context the actions of each offender which led the jury to find them guilty of the offences I have just indicated, it is necessary to set out in some detail what occurred at Villawood on 20 April 2011.  For this purpose I will adopt what I said in sentencing Mr Chenarjaafarizad (with appropriate modifications where necessary):
[4] [Villawood] is an approved place under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) for the detention of persons not authorised to enter or remain in Australia. Staffing at [Villawood] was contracted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (""DIAC"") to a company known as Serco. 
[5] There are three compounds within [Villawood]; [each of the offenders were] housed in the Fowler Compound. There were four residential buildings within Fowler, named the Macquarie Building, the Nepean Building, the Clarence Building and the Darling Building. There were sundry other buildings, such as an office, mess, recreation room, gym and a laundry. There were 158 detainees within Fowler on 20 April 2011.
6The Crown case was that on 20 April 2011 a large number of detainees within the Fowler Compound set about a course of protesting the nature and circumstances of their detention and did so with the use of violence.  
[8] Two detainees, Mehdi Darabi and Amir Morad Mansoor, were seen on the roof of the Macquarie Building early in the morning of 20 April 2011. Thereafter they were seen to engage in various activities which included abusing Serco staff and throwing roof tiles. 
[9] In the early afternoon the activities officer tried to commence a game of soccer but Darabi and Mansoor told him not to because they were ""making a point by being on the roof"". More tiles were thrown. A detainee on the ground, Mahmood Dadash, approached the activities officer and remonstrated with him in an attempt to have him desist from starting the soccer game. Another detainee, Ali Abdollahi, approached in the company of a large number of other detainees and threw punches at the activities officer but fortunately they did not connect. 
[10] Around the middle of the afternoon a staff member who was taking refreshments to staff near the Macquarie Building was abused, told to ""fuck off"" and had a tile thrown at him. Mansoor called out, ""we're up here for a reason, don't drink in front of us, we are up here for a reason. How dare you eat or drink in front of us. If you drink or eat in front of us, we're going to throw tiles at you"". Staff who had formed a cordon around the Macquarie Building to prevent other detainees getting onto the roof were ordered to move back.
[11] Detainees on the ground threw bedding and water bottles up to the roof. This activity continued and at about 6.00pm Mansoor called out to staff, ""Don't stop them otherwise you'll get a tile thrown at your head"". 
[12] More detainees attempted to join Darabi and Mansoor on the roof after 7.00pm. There was a large group on the ground, estimated to be between 40 and 60, aggressively yelling at Serco staff and management. There was a rush towards the Macquarie Building and more detainees made their way to the roof. 
[13] At about 7.30pm, detainees were yelling, ""we want freedom"". This continued for some time. Some of the detainees on the roof made ropes out of bed sheets to assist others to climb up.
[14] At about 8.00pm, there was encouragement to those on the ground to continue the disturbance and come up to the roof. Tiles were thrown at staff who were trying to prevent them. One tile landed no more than a metre from one staff member who, naturally enough, had concerns for the safety of her staff and the other detainees.
[15] One officer estimated that at about 8.20pm there were 80-90 detainees around the Macquarie Building. Thereafter the situation deteriorated with more shouting, yelling and abuse, tile throwing and other threatening behaviour towards staff.
[16] There was a bank of payphone booths near to the Macquarie Building. At about 10.00pm, [Saied Chenarjaafarizad] was seen to be banging on the Perspex side of one of the booths. ...
...
[18] There was an altercation between [Chenarjaafarizad] and a male member of staff. [He] repeated the demands that were being made by one of the detainees on the roof, Majid Parhizkar, for cigarettes and food. He twice grabbed the staff member and then walked away; raising his arms and saying ""fuck you, fuck you"". 
[19] Detainees ... started to run around the compound discharging fire extinguishers. ... [I]t is not suggested that any member of staff was affected by any of the spray or hit by [a] fire extinguisher.
[20] Detainees dragged wheelie bins onto the soccer field where the rubbish was tipped out and then set alight. ...
[21] Timber tables and chairs were taken onto the field and put on the fire. ...
[22] A number of detainees ... dismantled a set of soccer goal posts.  ... One of those involved threw parts at Serco staff. ...
[23] These various events ... contributed significantly to the utter mayhem that was going on in the compound at around 11.00pm. Staff were confronted with detainees on the roof throwing tiles at them and at buildings; a roaring bonfire on the soccer field; detainees running around discharging fire extinguishers and throwing them and other objects at staff. They were forced to retreat behind a wall of the office so as not to be struck by tiles. 
[24] Eventually a group of around 20 or 30 detainees turned their attention to the staff and advanced towards them. The most senior officer described them as advancing ""quickly and purposefully"". One of them was holding a fire extinguisher above his head. When they got near, this man looked like he was going to throw the fire extinguisher at the staff but he hesitated and threw it at a window in the office. Another detainee then came from the bonfire with a burning piece of wood and leaned in through the broken window and set fire to the office. At this point the staff fled the compound. 
[25] Fires were set in a number of other buildings thereafter. The total amount of damage caused in the Fowler Compound and in other areas within Villawood was extreme; the estimated cost of reconstruction and repair is said to be in the order of $9 million. ... 
Activities of the present offenders
7Mr Ali was, on the Crown case, aware at an early stage of the evening, at least in a general sense, of what was developing within the compound.  He warned a female member of staff in the vicinity of the laundry to ""go away"" and to ""go back to the office"".  Later he was present when Mr Feili said to a male officer at the gate leading to the gymnasium, ""officer, leave now"". 
8There was evidence in the Crown case from a single witness that Mr Ali was involved in the movement of wheelie bins and tables and chairs to the fire on the soccer field.  I take the jury's verdict of not guilty to the primary charge of riot to mean that they were not satisfied to the necessary standard in respect of that evidence.  Accordingly, I will put that to one side.
9It was common ground that Mr Ali was involved in activity related to the dismantling of soccer goal posts.  The evidence was not entirely satisfactory but, consistent with the jury's verdict of guilty on the alternative charge of affray, I will proceed upon an acceptance that Mr Ali held a post above his head and moved in a menacing fashion towards one or more others before putting the post down.  This occurred during the height of the tumult within the compound prior to the staff evacuation, although it indicates that Ali's role was relatively minimal.  Significantly, his offence was not directed at Serco staff.
10Mr Amiri climbed onto the roof of the Macquarie Building at around sunset.  He was the third or fourth to do so.  He encouraged another detainee by gestures and words to come up to the roof.  Thereafter he was seen to be throwing roof tiles towards staff and towards some contractors who were in the vicinity.  He recently told a psychiatrist that he ""picked up a tile and threw it on the ground; he did not throw it at anybody"".  However, in written submissions by his counsel it is accepted that he is depicted in video footage to be ""throwing a few tiles into the compound"".  
11It is disputed as to whether Mr Amiri deliberately threw tiles at contractors, or at a particular female member of staff.  I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those people were his targets.  But he must have been aware of the potential for the tiles he threw to cause injury as he singled out one member of staff and said:  ""Simon, move away, I don't want to hurt you"".  
12There was no suggestion that anyone was hit by any of the tiles but undoubtedly the people in the vicinity of where the tiles were landing would have been fearful for their safety.  It was conceded on the offender's behalf that staff would have been traumatised and that he must bear some responsibility for the damage to the compound. 
13Mr Feili was not one of the detainees who went up onto the roof of the Macquarie Building but he was one of the most active of the participants in the riot on the ground.  In the early evening, he approached one Serco officer, clicking his fingers and threatening her with his arms in the air.  He was ranting and swearing in English and in his native tongue.  He was heard to say, ""You can help this stop. You can stop this now"".  He came quite close to the officer and grabbed at her.  She said, understandably, that she felt ""very frightened, very scared"" (T295-296).
14It was submitted on Mr Feili's behalf that he was trying to assist Serco officers by drawing their attention to an apparent suicide attempt being made by one of the detainees on the roof.  If that was so, it remains the case that the manner in which he did so was perceived as being more provocative than helpful.
15Sometime later, Mr Feili approached a male officer and said, in what was described as a loud and forceful manner, ""I need to speak to someone high up from Immigration now and if you do that I can stop this now"" (T514-515). At another time he approached another female officer and told her that he could ""stop it"" (T861).
16Mr Feili was one of the oldest of the detainees in the compound and these activities suggest that he was a person of some influence.  However, he did nothing to try and prevent the subsequent violence; in fact, he played a significant role which encouraged its escalation.
17Mr Feili took up fire extinguishers and discharged them before throwing them in the direction of Serco staff.  He involved himself in the movement of wheelie bins and a timber table and chairs to the fire on the soccer field.  He was also involved in the dismantling of soccer goal posts and was seen to throw one part in a spear-like action towards staff.  Finally, just before the staff evacuation, Mr Feili held a fire extinguisher above his head and threw it through a window of the office behind which the staff were cowering.
18It was submitted for Mr Feili that the evidence does not enable a conclusion that he was aware that someone intended to set the office alight.  I accept that.  But what he did facilitated the continuance and escalation of the destructive conduct that was going on around him.
19The Crown submitted that Mr Feili was involved in numerous acts of violence towards both people and property; he encouraged others, at least implicitly, to become involved; and he was directly threatening to staff.  The evidence in the trial clearly supports those propositions.  It also supports the submission that ""he was central to the violent activities on the ground"". 
20It was submitted for Mr Feili that he had consumed alcohol and that ""his judgment and inhibitions may have been clouded by that factor"".  The evidence on this issue was not entirely persuasive but I am prepared to accept on balance that he probably was.  The relevance of this is not to reduce his moral culpability but it does support a finding that his actions were out of character.  Such a finding does not distinguish his case from any of the other offenders; all of them did things that were not typical of their normal behaviour. 
21Mr Haidari was seen on the roof of the Macquarie Building at around 7.30pm.  He was involved in lifting up tiles and passing them to another detainee (Parhizkar) who threw them.  He also threw some tiles himself.
22Mr Parhizkar was one of the most active detainees in the violent activities.  He had been in the visits area elsewhere within Villawood and returned to the Fowler Compound in the early evening.  I accept the evidence in the trial that he immediately went to his room where he shaved his head and then went up onto the roof of the Macquarie Building.  There he became the most active of the tile throwers.  A number of witnesses gave evidence of this but it was clearly depicted in video footage which was an exhibit in the trial.  Many of the tiles he threw were directed at buildings and other physical structures as well as at staff.
23One Serco officer gave evidence of seeing Mr Parhizkar throwing at least 30 tiles.  He said, ""As the tiles hit the ground they just broke up and on impact they just - like they exploded, they just broke up and shattered and [bits of tiles] flew off in all directions.""  One of the tiles passed within a foot of the officer's head and left a dent in a wall behind him.  When asked how this made him feel, the officer responded, ""Terrified"" (T698-699).  The officer was evidently still distressed when giving evidence about these events.
24While he was on the roof, Mr Parhizkar made demands for cigarettes, food and water.  He also demanded that immigration officials attend.  Otherwise he was heard to be shouting and swearing, saying things such as ""Fuck Australia, Serco no good"".  
25Mr Parhizkar pleaded guilty on arraignment before the jury panel to an alternative charge of affray.  The Crown did not accept that plea; I presume because of the active and influential role that he played in the incident.  The evidence against him on the charge of riot was overwhelming and it is little wonder that he was found guilty.
Seriousness of the offences
26Although the activities of the present five offenders varied in both nature and extent, account must also be taken of the context in order to make a meaningful assessment of the appropriate sentence to impose.
27In a general sense, because the activities of those detainees involved in the incident at Villawood on 20 April 2011 were carried out over a significant period of time, and were directed at public infrastructure and unarmed public officials who were merely endeavouring to carry out their duties, the matter is of considerable seriousness.  The safety of staff was put at grave risk and it appears to be only by good fortune that no physical injuries were sustained.  
28Staff were forced to cower behind the office wall to avoid being struck by the torrent of missiles from the roof of the Macquarie Building while other detainees on the ground were running rampant with fire extinguishers and setting fire to bedding, tables, chairs and other items on the soccer field.  Ultimately they were forced to evacuate the compound as a large number of detainees advanced upon them and set fire to the office. 
29It is not only the activities of those involved in perpetrating acts of violence towards people and property that must be considered.  Other detainees showed their support by yelling and shouting.  There was the continual chanting of ""freedom"" and some were calling out things such as ""fuck Australia"", ""fuck Immigration"" and ""fuck Serco"".  Clearly, this must have been a most terrifying experience for the Serco staff.  It must also have been terrifying for other detainees who were not involved and sought refuge elsewhere within the Villawood complex.  They had to be evacuated as well. 
30The psychological harm caused to a number of staff members must be recognised; indeed it was palpable with some in the distress that they exhibited in the course of recounting the events.
31There was a suggestion that the incident was premeditated by some detainees.  However there is no evidence that any of the present offenders did anything other than participate spontaneously.
32Of those of the offenders to be sentenced for riot, I assess the offences of Feili and Parhizkar as being the most serious because of the significant roles they played in perpetrating violent acts and in influencing the involvement of other detainees.
33The roles played by Amiri and Haidari were not identical but broadly similar.  This was largely accepted by their counsel.
34If the context was disregarded, the offence of affray committed by Mr Ali might be regarded as almost trivial.  However it is more than that when seen in the light of preceding and concurrent events that he must have appreciated he was involving himself in.  The more people who involved themselves, in whatever way, the more serious the overall incident became.
35I have had regard to the circumstances of the offences of affray for which I have previously sentenced six other offenders.  They are described in considerable detail in the various sentencing judgments I referred to earlier and do not bear repeating now.  Suffice to say that I regard the offence by Mr Ali as being the least serious, except in the case of Mr Abdollahi.
Personal circumstances of the offender Ali
36Mr Ali arrived on Christmas Island as what is termed an ""irregular maritime arrival"" on 13 January 2010.  At the time of the offence he had been found not to be a genuine refugee by a Refugee Status Assessment and two Independent Merits Reviews.  Unlike others, he has not sought any judicial review of those determinations.  It seems that his immigration status, that is whether he will be permitted to remain in Australia or will be deported, will be determined after these proceedings are concluded.
37Mr Ali was born in Iraq in 1972.  He is now aged 40.  He is the sixth eldest of nine siblings.  He was educated until the age of 10. His family was forced to move to Iran after the Faili Kurds were ejected from Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein.  For the first 18 months the family lived in a detention centre and then set up home in the city of Qom.  They experienced difficulties living in Iran; he has claimed that they were continually humiliated, marginalised and persecuted, and this mirrored their previous experience in Iraq.
38Mr Ali has generally been in employment, most recently in a family business, before leaving Iran. He married when aged 18 and he and his wife have 4 children.
39At one point after the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, Mr Ali returned to Iraq to explore the possibility of re-establishing a life for his family there.  He soon realised that this was not an option and returned to his family in Iran.  It seems that it was soon afterwards that he made the decision to flee to Australia.  A psychologist has summarised Mr Ali's reasons as being ""not as a result of one specific event that made him particularly fearful for his survival but because of the cumulative impact of a long term and ongoing experience of deprivation, persecution and trauma for himself and his family.""  Another psychologist recorded that Mr Ali had said that he ""left Iran in search for a safe place and better future for his family.""   
40Since being in immigration detention Mr Ali has been documented as exhibiting increasingly severe symptoms of depression.  This has arisen from his anxiety and frustration from a combination of separation from his family and from the nature and circumstances of his detention.  The former includes concern of news from home about the harassment his children were experiencing and the family's general financial difficulties.  The latter includes suicides and attempted suicides by fellow detainees.  A further matter exacerbating his difficulties in detention is that he has converted to Judaism and this has resulted in him being mistreated by detainees who adhere to the Islamic faith.  He has become socially withdrawn and isolated. 
41A report in October 2010 recorded him as exhibiting psychological signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress, the latter being the predominant feature which is related to a number of traumatic events in Mr Ali's life in Iran.  Another psychological report prepared recently (February 2013) records no significant change in the intensity of Mr Ali's symptoms of post traumatic stress and anxiety. However, his symptoms of depression had worsened in both frequency and intensity.  
42Three reports by Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, were tendered.   They include an extensive review of medical records with repeated and consistent history that support the conclusions of the psychologist I have referred to.  That history, together with that obtained from Mr Ali by Dr Allnutt, amply supports the doctor's conclusion which is encapsulated in the following paragraph of his most recent report of 12 June 2013:
In my opinion at this stage I would be of the view that your client demonstrates a constellation of anxiety and depressive symptoms consistent with either depression with associated panic attacks or a post traumatic stress disorder with secondary depression; overall the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that he has a diagnosable psychiatric condition; differential diagnosis would include an adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious mood.
43In the concluding paragraph of the section of that report under the heading ""Opinion"", Dr Allnutt recounts a variety of matters commencing from Mr Ali's life in Iraq and Iran through until 20 April 2011, leading the doctor to conclude that Mr Ali ""would have [been] vulnerable to reacting to a process of civil disobedience"".
44Dr Allnutt made three recommendations.  The first two concern the need for Mr Ali to receive psychiatric and psychological counselling and treatment.  The third is ""that the Immigration Department determine his case as soon as possible as maintaining him in detention would be seen as causal of mental illness"".
45The Crown tendered some documents sourced from DIAC for the purpose of demonstrating that the account Mr Ali had provided in the course of the assessment of his claim for refugee status varied from that which he had provided to Dr Allnutt.  Assuming for present purposes that this is so, there is, however, no reason to doubt the symptoms which have been recorded, in a largely consistent fashion, in the documents to which Dr Allnutt refers.  I have no reason to doubt the correctness of Dr Allnutt's assessment of Mr Ali.
46I am satisfied that the psychiatric condition of Mr Ali as at 20 April 2011 was such that his moral culpability was at a reduced level; the offence is less serious than it otherwise might be perceived on that account; and that there is a similarly reduced need for emphasis upon general deterrence.  Personal deterrence is of no real significance.
47If it was not for the fact that Mr Ali was charged with the offence of riot (of which he was acquitted), this would have been a case well suited to disposal in the Local Court.  If that had occurred, the case would have been resolved a long time ago.  Mr Ali has been kept in a state of uncertainty for a considerably longer period; the adverse effect that prolonged detention has had upon his mental state is clear.
48Further in Mr Ali's case is the fact that he has no prior convictions; he is a person of good character; he has good prospects of rehabilitation; and is unlikely to re-offend.
49Another matter that must be taken into account is that Mr Ali was held in corrective services custody after being charged and refused bail for a period of 10 months 16 days (22 April 2011 to 8 March 2012).  Moreover, having regard to his mental state, he undoubtedly found that experience considerably more onerous than a more typical remand inmate would.
50The Crown contended that no sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment is appropriate, although when pressed, conceded that nothing more than what he has already served is necessary.  
51It would be easy just to sentence Mr Ali to imprisonment for the same period, or a lesser period, than that which he has served.  But I must determine a sentence based upon the objective gravity of what he did, which was relatively minimal, but aggravated by the context in which he did it, as well as upon all of his subjective circumstances. In my judgment, that calls for disposition under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
Personal circumstances of the offender Amiri
52Mr Amiri arrived on Christmas Island as an irregular maritime arrival on 27 November 2009.  At the time of the offence he had been found not to be a genuine refugee.  The third rejection of his claim came about a week before the riot.  He subsequently sought judicial review but failed in the Federal Magistrates Court and on appeal to the Full Federal Court.  An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court is pending.
53Mr Amiri was born in Afghanistan in 1986.  He is aged 26.  He is the eldest of seven siblings, two of whom died in early childhood.  The family was relatively well-off.  His father was a shopkeeper.  He completed eight or nine years of education and then worked in his father's business.  The shop was sold and a petrol station was purchased.  It was attacked and destroyed by Taliban soldiers in 2008.  Thereafter the family fled their village.  Mr Amiri was sent to Kabul where he paid a smuggler to take him out of the country.  The rest of the family went to another place elsewhere in Afghanistan.  Mr Amiri claims that earlier in his life he witnessed a number of war-related events which were distressing; he was exposed to dead bodies and people being killed.
54His journey to Australia was lengthy and traumatic.  He was detained for about four months on Christmas Island before being transferred to Villawood.  At Villawood, he witnessed aspects of the suicide of two detainees.  He was held in corrective services custody after he was charged and bail refused for his role in the riot on 20 April 2011.  He claims that he was held in isolation for two months (according to what he told a psychologist in June 2012) or 21 days (according to what he told a psychiatrist in January 2013).  After he was allowed out in the main stream of the gaol population he was threatened on occasions by other inmates and had to seek protection from gaol staff. He considered that these experiences negatively impacted upon his psychological and emotional health. 
55Mr Amiri was assessed in June 2012 by a psychologist with the Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors.  It was considered that he was exhibiting symptoms of anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder.  An earlier assessment by another psychologist with that service in May 2010 also detected symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder which were thought to have increased in intensity after his detainment in Australia.
56More recently, Mr Amiri was assessed by Dr Allnutt.  His conclusions are perhaps best encapsulated in the following from his report of 12 June 2013:
Given his circumstances he would have been vulnerable, given the futility of his position, to engaging in the offending protest to bring attention to his and others plight; at the material time he was manifesting depressive symptoms consistent with a chronic adjustment disorder (and developing a depressive disorder) and symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder; that is, ongoing persistent psychological distress in the context of the persisting detention and its associated stressors.
57Dr Allnutt recommended that Mr Amiri should engage with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist. He qualified for the prescription of antidepressant medication.  He required ongoing cultural and social support.  Dr Allnutt also recommended that DIAC finalise the determination of Mr Amiri's case ""as soon as possible as to any intents and purposes his circumstances with regard to levels of stress would be seen as extremely high, long term, persistent and causing psychological pathology"".
58Dr Allnutt was cross-examined about his conclusions.  I have considered what he said in that context.  In the end, I am prepared to accept his report.
59I am not satisfied that Mr Amiri is genuinely remorseful.  He told Dr Allnutt that he ""now felt bad about what he had done; he felt sorry for what he had done and acknowledged it was wrong"".  But that was in the context of him falsely claiming that he had only thrown one tile and that it was simply thrown on the ground.  I have not heard a word from Mr Amiri himself.  He did not have to give evidence, but avoiding any direct challenge to his veracity by cross-examination makes it difficult to accept him on this topic.
60There were about 30 testimonials tendered in support of Mr Amiri.  I have read them all.  They are positive in their support for him and attest to his many fine character attributes.  Some of the authors strayed into offering opinions about the Australian government's immigration policies and the treatment of asylum seekers.  These are matters that I must put to one side. I do, however, accept in large part what is said about the frustration Mr Amiri must have been feeling about the length of time he had been kept in detention.  I accept that in his case, as with others, that it was the motivation for them participating in the events of 20 April 2011 at Villawood.  It does not, of course, excuse their use of violence and I cannot imagine that it assuages the trauma and distress of those who suffered as a consequence.
61One thing that clearly emerges from the number of testimonials tendered in Mr Amiri's case is that he has a large support network.  Many people regard him as a friend, are prepared to visit him regularly and indicate that they will continue to support him.
62I will say more about the findings I have made about Mr Amiri, and the others I am about to refer to, towards the end of these sentencing remarks.
Personal circumstances of the offender Feili
63Mr Feili arrived on Christmas Island as an irregular maritime arrival on 17 June 2010.  At the time of the offence he had twice been found not to be a genuine refugee. He has not sought judicial review of those determinations.  It was subsequently determined that he did not meet the criteria for referral to the Minister for Immigration for consideration of granting him a visa pursuant to s 195A of the Migration Act.  On 10 May 2011, Mr Feili sought removal from Australia but he withdrew this request two months later.  At the present time Mr Feili's immigration status is in limbo until the finalisation of the criminal proceedings.
64Mr Feili was born in 1956 in Baghdad, Iraq.  He is now aged 57.  He is the sixth eldest of nine siblings and the family environment has been described as ""close knit"" and ""nurturing"". His family was of Kurdish ethnicity and they were forced to flee to Iran under the regime of Saddam Hussein when he was 16 years old. They then had an unsettled existence before moving to live in Tehran.
65He completed primary school education in Iraq.  He had some unskilled employment after the family moved to Iran but opportunities were extremely limited because of his Iraqi origin and Kurdish ethnicity.  On another account he had worked as a carpenter, in a metal shop and also in making ladies' decorative apparel.  He had not had any significant relationships, was single and had no children.  His father passed away some 30 years ago.  One of his siblings has also died.  His mother continues to live in Tehran and his siblings are in either Iran or Iraq.  When he was interviewed by Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist in March this year for the purpose of a fitness to be tried assessment he said that his family had not been in contact with him for the past 7 or 8 months.
66Mr Feili was assessed by a psychologist with the Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors in two interviews in February this year.  The essence of what he told the psychologist was that life in Iran was hard; his family was subjected to discrimination, humiliation and a moderate level of violence.  He had one experience himself some eight or nine years ago of having been brutally assaulted and detained for three days by police. Testing by the psychologist indicated the likelihood of post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. 
67His physical health is worth mentioning as well; he has had two heart attacks, one in Iran about eight years ago and another shortly after arriving in Australia.  He claimed to have had a tumour removed from his back when he was in corrective services custody. 
68Mr Feili was interviewed by Dr Allnutt in January 2013. The history provided included that he found life in detention difficult but more so since arriving at Villawood.  He had witnessed suicide and self-harm incidents which he found distressing.  At the time of the offence he felt depressed, upset and frustrated.  
69Dr Allnutt offered the following:
At the material time of the ... offending [Mr Feili] was experiencing depressive symptoms and states he was intoxicated; he was, in my view vulnerable to interpreting his circumstances as hopeless and was prone to impulsivity and disinhibition; given his circumstances he would have been vulnerable to perceiving his behaviour as justified in staging a protest in order to bring attention to his situation; that is a situation of persisting loss of liberty, loss of dignity, loss of control of his destiny and uncertainty, not unlike his prior experiences in Iran, but unexpected in Australia.
70Dr Allnutt's recommendations were that the offender would benefit from interactions with a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a general practitioner.  He should also be encouraged to persist with his present two year abstention from the use of alcohol and from his use, in Iran, of opium. 
71Dr Westmore's report of 11 March 2013 was primarily focussed upon the fitness to be tried issue (he was found fit - R v Feili [2013] NSWSC 492).  But it included the doctor's diagnosis that Mr Feili suffered from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, alternatively, dysthymic disorder or a major depressive disorder.  Substance and alcohol abuse disorders were felt to be in remission.
72The issue as to Mr Feili's psychological and psychiatric state at the time of the offence is less than clear.  I have Dr Allnutt's assessment but, unlike the cases of others, there are no contemporaneous or previous documented assessments that support it.  However I am prepared to accept Dr Allnutt's conclusions on balance.  The degree to which Mr Feili was affected by the depressive symptoms at the relevant time does appear to be less than in the cases of others.  I accept that the position is clearer as to Mr Feili's mental state in more recent times and I will take it into account as a more significant factor in the assessment of sentence. 
73Three testimonials were tendered which each speak highly of Mr Feili's various positive character traits.  One was written by his wife; they were married only last month.  I have taken these matters into account.
Personal circumstances of the offender Haidari
74Mr Haidari arrived on Christmas Island as an irregular maritime arrival on 2 April 2010.  At the time of the offence he had twice been found not to be a genuine refugee.  He sought judicial review; failed in the Federal Magistrates Court; but then succeeded on appeal in the Full Federal Court.  The matter was remitted for redetermination but the Federal Magistrates Court again dismissed his application and this time the finding was affirmed on appeal. He failed in a referral to the Minister for consideration of being held in community detention in March this year.  As things presently stand, he is awaiting the resolution of the criminal proceedings, after which it is expected there will be a decision by immigration authorities as to whether he will be deported.
75Mr Haidari was born in Afghanistan in 1983.  He is now aged 29.  He is the eldest of five children.  His siblings still live in his native country with his mother; his father having passed away from natural causes a few years ago.  He is married.  His wife and their 3 year old child also still live in Afghanistan.
76According to the history provided to the author of a psychological report in March 2011, Mr Haidari's family were of the Hazara ethnic minority and for this reason they experienced discrimination and persecution. This included a denial of access to education and employment.  The history includes, however, that Mr Haidari worked with his father as a shopkeeper and later travelled to Iran where he worked as a bricklayer.  He returned to Afghanistan when about 23 years of age where he met his wife and married soon after. 
77The event which triggered Mr Haidari's decision to leave Afghanistan involved him being threatened with death by a member of the Taliban if he did not provide information about a person connected with the recent murder of the Taliban member's brother. Mr Haidari was unable to provide the information and fled the country instead.
78The psychologist reported that Mr Haidari spoke of difficulties with sleeping and that he experienced intrusive memories and flashbacks to the incident just mentioned.  Being in immigration detention made him feel that he was being treated unjustly, just as people of his ethnic origin had been treated in his home country.  He is also reported to have difficulties trusting people, especially authority figures.  He associated well with other detainees; he felt that they too were being mistreated and shared his feelings of injustice.
79The psychologist found that Mr Haidari exhibited some of the symptoms associated with post traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder.  She expressed the opinion that the symptoms were likely to worsen with prolonged detention and recommended that he receive psychological treatment and counselling.  The report is over two years old; what the present situation is remains unclear.  Medical records tendered by the Crown indicate that the symptoms continued until at least October 2011 and he was being provided with antidepressant medication. The Crown Prosecutor indicated in submissions that it was not disputed that Mr Haidari exhibited symptoms of depression.
80It was submitted that Mr Haidari's moral culpability for the commission of the offence was less on account of him likely experiencing these symptoms at the time and also that there should be less emphasis placed upon general deterrence.  I am prepared to accept that this is so.
81Four testimonials were tendered on Mr Haidari's behalf, each of which speak to many positive character traits.  They include descriptions of him being a ""quietly spoken, gentle individual""; ""well behaved, quiet, gentle, thoughtful and considerate""; ""a man of exceptional integrity and nobility of character""; and ""a gentle, shy and unassuming, straightforward person who exhibits self control in spite of his difficult situation"".  There is also reference to him making efforts to advance his English language skills and there is confirmation of this in two certificates of his attendance at courses.
82Another aspect that was raised in Mr Haidari's case was his ""current physical ailments"".  He underwent a day surgery procedure recently for the investigation of a urinary tract problem.  There was also some suggestion of him having had an abnormal ECG.  There has been no definitive diagnosis of either matter so it is difficult to take these matters into account.
Personal circumstances of the offender Parhizkar
83Mr Parhizkar arrived on Christmas Island as an irregular maritime arrival on 14 September 2009.  At the time of the offence he had three times been found not to be a genuine refugee.  He subsequently sought judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court but failed.  In April last year he was notified of a positive outcome of an International Treaties Obligations Assessment - that is, he could be considered by the Minister for the granting of a visa notwithstanding he was not a genuine refugee.  However, referral to the Minister for consideration of this issue was deferred until after the criminal proceedings had concluded.  In January this year he was found to meet guidelines for referral to the Minister for the purpose of his consideration of permitting detention within the community.  The Minister has not determined that referral at the present time. 
84Mr Parhizkar was born in Iran in 1986.  He is now aged 27.  He is the youngest of five children and was raised in a loving and supportive familial environment.  He completed school where he is said to have been an average student. He established a photography business and he also had a company trading in phone and barter cards.  He travelled internationally to participate in the sport of karate.  His mother, sister and a brother are in Australia whilst his father and presumably his other brothers remain in Iran.  He is single and has no children.  He has a girlfriend who he met three years ago whilst in immigration detention.  He has a reasonable command of English.
85Various reasons have been advanced by Mr Parhizkar in his attempt to be accepted into Australia as a genuine refugee.  Initially it was confined to a claim that he had committed adultery with the wife of a policeman and he fled in fear of retribution after the man discovered the relationship.  Later, after his initial claim had been rejected, he added that he had been involved in political protests.  He also claimed that he was liable to be the subject of religious persecution if he was returned to his home country because since being in Australia he had converted from Islam to Christianity.  Mr Parhizkar's brother fled from Iran as well but he was unaware of this until by coincidence they met up in Indonesia.
86Documents tendered by the Crown in relation to this aspect of the case were objected to by Mr Parhizkar's counsel.  I provisionally received them and, having had the opportunity to consider them in detail, conclude that they are relevant and admissible, not for the opinions expressed by the assessors of Mr Parhizkar's case but for the statements and claims that he has made himself.  They have a bearing upon the question of whether he is a reliable and credible historian.  They are also relevant to show that frustration was likely to be at least one motive for Mr Parhizkar to involve himself in the events of 20 April 2011.  The documents show that he had gone to considerable lengths to make out a case for being accepted as a refugee but had failed in a second Independent Merits Review only weeks before.
87Mr Parhizkar was assessed by Dr Allnutt in an interview conducted at Villawood in January this year.  There is reason to be cautious about the veracity of the history set out in the doctor's report; for example, the reasons he provided for his flight from Iran are not entirely consistent with his previous claims. He told Dr Allnutt that he had been charged for having published political material in the lead up to the presidential elections in 2009 and that he and his brother had fled the country together.  Dr Allnutt did not hear anything about the adultery that Mr Parhizkar had first advanced to immigration authorities.
88The history provided to Dr Allnutt included that Mr Parhizkar had become depressed during the time he had been in immigration detention. He had been provided with medication for this.  He witnessed a number of distressing incidents which occurred to other detainees including self-harming and suicide attempts.  He attempted suicide himself near the end of 2010 after one of the rejections of his claim for asylum.  At the time of the incident on 20 April 2011 he was in a state of helplessness and despair and felt significantly more depressed after the recent rejection of what he thought was his last hope to remain in this country.
89Mr Parhizkar claimed that he was the last person to go onto the roof of the Macquarie Building.  He thought he had nothing to lose by joining those who were already there.  His purpose was to ""protest"" but he also claimed that he took a knife with him and attempted to slash his wrists, only being prevented from doing so by the intervention of other inmates.  I note that nothing of this was raised in the course of the trial and I do not accept it. The history provided to Dr Allnutt completely omitted any mention of tile throwing; indeed it was to the effect that after the failed suicide attempt his next memory was of still being on the roof and the compound being on fire.
90Dr Allnutt was of the view that at the time of the offence Mr Parhizkar was ""experiencing active symptoms of a depressive disorder with associated post traumatic stress symptoms which compounded feelings of worthless[ness], despair and hopelessness, as well as anger at the system"".  
91Dr Allnutt was challenged about his diagnosis on the basis that it depended upon acceptance of the veracity of the history provided by Mr Parhizkar.  His response was to the effect that a diagnosis of mental illness is not automatically precluded by an offender having told lies about their background and the circumstances of the offence.  Nevertheless, he was mindful of the possibility that if a person lied about those types of matters there could be questions about whether they were being truthful about other matters more germane to the diagnosis, such as, in this case, difficulty in sleeping, nightmares, and loss of appetite. 
92Whilst there is real reason to question the veracity of a number of aspects of the history recorded by Dr Allnutt, it seems reasonable that the more significant matters bearing upon the doctor's diagnosis should be accepted.  There is a consistency of the complaints by Mr Parhizkar recorded in the medical records reviewed by Dr Allnutt of problems with sleeping and nightmares and there is a record of the self-harming incident in 2010.  Antidepressant medication had been prescribed as long ago as late 2009.  In October 2010, a psychologist reported that Mr Parhizkar was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder with depressive features.  
93Justice Health records included notes of a psychiatric assessment of Mr Parhizkar on 6 May 2011.  The history he provided on that occasion contained falsities; for example that he had never previously self-harmed and had no past psychiatric history.  He had in fact been admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Perth in 2010 following the attempt at suicide.  But Dr Allnutt preferred the consistency that appeared in other records over a considerable period of time as being the more reliable.  I accept his evidence in that respect.
94As at January 2013, Dr Allnutt was of the view that Mr Parhizkar was suffering from a depressive disorder and exhibiting some signs of post traumatic stress disorder.  
95It was submitted that I should find that Mr Parhizkar's moral culpability and the need for general deterrence are less on account of his mental condition.  I accept that submission. 
96Numerous testimonials were tendered on the offender's behalf.  They included one from his girlfriend, Ms Fariba Jaffari, who wrote positively about their relationship and their plans for the future.  Others describe Mr Parhizkar in terms such as ""warm, considerate and respectful"", ""well-mannered, considerate and honest""; ""respectful and amicable"", ""playful and friendly"", and an ""individual with a fantastic sense of humour"". Some, however, also noted a decline in his mood over time.  Some also seek to offer opinions as to the cause and motivation underlying Mr Parhizkar's offending behaviour; the authors who did so were not qualified as experts and I have ignored such opinions.
97A matter that is of some minor benefit to Mr Parhizkar is that he pleaded guilty to affray at the commencement of the trial.  The Crown did not accept that plea and, of course, he was ultimately found guilty of the primary charge of riot.  What this meant, however, was that there was no dispute about the nature of the activity Mr Parhizkar was involved in.  There was some dispute about the extent and duration of it; but the primary issue was whether he was involved in a common purpose with at least 11 others to protest their detention by violent means.
Other matters relevant to sentence for Amiri, Feili, Haidari and Parhizkar
98I readily accept that the events of 20 April 2011 were prompted by frustration, and perhaps despair, that some of the detainees at Villawood were experiencing.  But that does not excuse what might be termed ""mob violence"".  Whatever views might be held about the regime of immigration detention within this country, the fact remains that it is pursuant to valid laws of the Commonwealth Parliament.  Nobody can question that there is a right to protest, but those of violence is completely unacceptable.
99General deterrence is a significant aspect of sentencing in the circumstances of these four offenders.  Legal avenues are available for detainees who seek to question or challenge decisions made by government officials concerning their claims for asylum.  The courts will certainly not condone the actions of those who resort to violence instead.  There will, however, be some reduction of the weight given to general deterrence on account of the mental state of the offenders.
100I am satisfied in respect of each of the offenders that they are of prior good character in the sense that there is no suggestion that they have previously committed any criminal offences.  I have also taken into account the positive evidence as to their character. 
101Given that finding, coupled with the length of time in which they have each been held in immigration detention and that there is no suggestion of any violent conduct by them on any other occasion, I am satisfied that they are unlikely to re-offend and have good prospects of rehabilitation.
102I am not persuaded that any of the offenders are genuinely remorseful for the offending conduct. 
103Having regard to the seriousness of the offences I am satisfied that no sentence other than one of imprisonment is appropriate.  In this respect I have taken into account the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  as well as all of the circumstances of their respective cases.  Imprisonment was specifically conceded as the only available sentencing option for each of these four offenders. 
104I accept that each of them would find that the conditions of a custodial sentence will be more onerous than would be the case for the average prison inmate on the basis, as Mr Flynn put it on behalf of Mr Feili, of linguistic and cultural factors.  The psychological and psychiatric conditions I have referred to are another factor.
105I am satisfied that there are special circumstances for setting a non-parole period that is less than the usual proportion of the total term of the sentence required by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  In this regard I have taken into account the fact that the offenders have spent a considerable period of time in one form of custody or another and that the various psychiatric and psychological issues disclosed in the various reports indicate that it would be preferable for both them, and the community, that they be allowed a lengthier period of parole supervision upon release.  It should be noted that the law is clear that I am required to ignore any prospect of deportation in relation to this issue.
Pre-sentence custody
106The offenders Amiri, Feili and Parhizkar were arrested and charged on 4 May 2011.  Haidari was not charged until 12 January 2012.  However, they were removed from an immigration detention facility and held in gaol at other times.  I have previously indicated an acceptance of the proposition that time in which an offender has been held in gaol as a result of involvement in the events of 20 April 2011 should be taken into account, even if it pre-dated arrest and charge.
107Amiri and Feili were in custody from 22 April 2011 until 8 March 2012 (10 months 16 days).  Haidari was in custody from 22 April to 11 May 2011 and from 12 January 2012 to 21 February 2012 (61 days).  Parhizkar was in custody from 4 May 2011 until 25 May 2012 (1 year 22 days).  I will take this into account by backdating the sentences by the periods indicated.
108I have also taken into account in favour of each offender, although in an unquantifiable sense, that it is likely that the length of time they have been kept in immigration detention has been exacerbated by the fact that there have been pending criminal proceedings against them.

		28 June 2013",2013-06-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761832,Tan v R [2013] NSWCCA 164,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J.

2LATHAM J : The applicant, Kim Tan, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of four (4) years and six (6) months' imprisonment, including a non parole period of two (2) years and nine (9) months, imposed by Syme DCJ for an offence of cultivate not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited plant (s 23(2)(a) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). An offence of possess cannabis (36gms) was taken into account on a Form 1. 

3The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment.

4The single ground of appeal asserts that the sentence is manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case. Taking into account the full discount afforded to the applicant for his early plea of guilty, the proposition is that the starting point of 6 years is manifestly excessive. 

The Offence

5On 3 June 2011 a search warrant was executed at the applicant's home. A sophisticated indoor cultivation operation, consisting of an array of filters, lamps, pumps, hoses, watering equipment, nutrients and artificial lights, was discovered in the home. Fifty three cannabis plants were found, ranging in size between 20 cm and 1 m high. This is three plants more than the prescribed commercial quantity applicable to cultivation by enhanced indoor means.

6Of the five bedroom home occupied by the applicant, only one of the bedrooms was used for anything other than the cultivation of cannabis. That was the room occupied by the applicant. The applicant rented the premises for $600 a week. 

7Following his arrest, he admitted that he was the principal in the commission of the offence. He acknowledged that he had personally purchased all of the equipment used in the indoor cultivation of the cannabis. He also diverted electricity to enable him to undertake cultivation. A charge in relation to the diversion of electricity resulted in the imposition of a wholly concurrent sentence.

8The applicant spent approximately $10,000.00 setting up the plantation. It was anticipated that he would receive a gross amount in the vicinity of $187,000.00 on the harvest and sale of the cannabis.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

9The applicant was 33 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence. His criminal history consists of summary property offences and motor vehicle offences between 1999 and 2009. There is a significant gap between 2000 and 2008 during which the applicant did not offend. Prior to the imposition of the instant sentence, he had not received a sentence of imprisonment.

10The applicant is the youngest of three children whose parents separated in 1989 when his mother migrated from Malaysia to Australia. The applicant came to Australia in 1992 and obtained his citizenship in 1997. He completed his secondary education to year 10. His employment consisted largely of unskilled labouring positions. 

11The applicant was married for four years but divorced his wife in early 2011 due to his drug and gambling activities.

12The applicant claimed that he used cannabis on a daily basis from the age of 22 and had progressed to using ice on a weekly basis at the age of 28. He developed an extensive gambling problem that deprived him of all available funds, including loans from banks and friends. His gambling debts and ongoing illicit drug use was said to be the motive for the commission of the offence. The applicant resigned from his employment to devote himself full-time to the cultivation of cannabis. He borrowed money from friends and family members to pay for the necessary equipment.

13The applicant demonstrated significant remorse. The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge and claimed that he had learnt from his mistake, that he would refrain from the use of illicit drugs and that he was thankful he had not distributed any of the drugs into the community.

14A psychological report indicated that he has a low to medium risk of re-offending, which was capable of being reduced if he undertook programs that addressed his gambling and drug addiction. The applicant appeared motivated to engage in such programs.

Manifest Excess ?

15Where there is no complaint of any patent error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court may nonetheless conclude that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust, and therefore deserving of the description ""manifestly excessive"" : Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25 at [25] ; Hili v The Queen ; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [59].

16Counsel for the applicant recognised that the relevant question is whether the sentence is within ""a proper range"" (or appropriate range) and that sentencing statistics and/or ""a detailed analysis of other decided cases"" are of limited utility in answering that question : Papworth v R [2011] NSWCCA 253 at [53] - [55]. Nonetheless, counsel sought to demonstrate that proper range by reference to R v Godden [2005] NSWCCA 160 (including the cases reviewed therein), a table of District Court cases handed up to the sentencing judge and the relevant JIRS statistics. Early pleas of guilty apply to that material and to the analysis that follows. 

17I accept that reference to previous cases and statistics may be helpful in identifying the appropriate range for offences of the type committed by the applicant, in so far as it can :-

provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. But it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that ""unifying principles"" may be discerned: Wong and Leung, at [59]. 
In the end, the sentencing discretion is individual: it must be exercised by the individual judge, in respect of the individual offender. Significant sentencing considerations include the role played by the offender in the particular importation or enterprise, the quantity of the drug involved, and its estimated street or wholesale value (having regard, inter alia, where relevant, to its purity). Also of considerable significance are the character and antecedents of the offender ... This last consideration bears upon the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, and also to any claim for leniency made on his or her behalf by reason of prior good character.


DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [304] - [305]: referred to with approval by the plurality in Hili v The Queen ; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [54]. 

18There are two qualifications to the utility of the material relied upon by the applicant that should be observed. The first is that, arguably, the table of 26 District Court cases carries less weight than sentences that have been reviewed by an intermediate appellate court : per Basten JA in De La Rosa at [144]. The second arises out of Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 266 concerning the change in the statutory regime which prescribes the quantity of plants for the purposes of a commercial quantity. I repeat what I said in that case (Young JA and Hidden J agreeing) :-

13 The applicant seeks to support [the contention that the sentence is manifestly excessive] by reference to two decisions of this Court [namely R v Godden [2005] NSWCCA 160 and R v Quan [2006] NSWCCA 382], both of which relate to the hydroponic cultivation of a commercial quantity of cannabis plants, prior to the introduction on 14 July 2006 of the penalty regime applicable to cultivation by ""enhanced indoor means"". In practical terms, these decisions relate to the hydroponic cultivation of more than 250 plants, because at that time the Act did not reflect the potential for increased risk of harm to users of hydroponically grown cannabis. Following recognition of the significantly increased yield of the more potent parts of the cannabis plant when grown hydroponically, the legislature prescribed 50 plants as the commercial quantity for such crops. 
14 ............[It] is noteworthy that this reduction of the threshold for a commercial quantity in such cases was intended to signal an increase in the gravity of the offence of cultivation by these means, as viewed by the legislature. The second reading speech introducing the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Amendment (Hydroponic Cultivation) Bill on 25 May 2006 included the following :- 
Cannabis plants cultivated by hydroponic and other enhanced indoor means grow much faster than plants grown by traditional outdoor methods, and produce between five and seven times the yield. The current quantity amounts in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act at which maximum penalties apply for cannabis cultivation offences are based upon the yield, harvest patterns and profitability of outdoor, or ""bush grown"" cannabis. They are not an accurate reflection of the commerciality of hydroponic cannabis operations. This bill addresses this inequity.Schedule 1 amends the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Item [1] inserts in the Act a definition of ""cultivation by enhanced indoor means"" in relation to a prohibited plant. The two leading methods of enhanced indoor cannabis cultivation-hydroponics and aeroponics-are covered by the definition. Item [16] inserts a new plant category into schedule 1 of the Act entitled ""Cannabis plant cultivated by enhanced indoor means"", with the commercial and large commercial quantities being set at levels five times lower than for outdoor cannabis to reflect the much higher yields produced by this method. This means that existing maximum penalties for cultivation offences involving commercial and large commercial quantities will cut in at these lower levels in respect of cannabis cultivated by enhanced indoor means to reflect the commerciality of operations of this size.


19Thus, reliance upon Godden is of limited assistance to the applicant. While the quantity of plants in that case was 319, it was only 69 plants above the then prescribed commercial quantity of 250, not more than 6 times the commercial quantity that now applies to indoor hydroponic cultivation. 

20However, it remains true to say that there is some relativity between the applicant's case and Godden. The offender in Godden was 43 years of age, had a minor record but was on a bond at the time of the commission of the offence, had a favourable subjective case, was genuinely remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. The quantity of plants he grew hydroponically as the principal was 27% more than the relevant commercial quantity. The sentence of 3 years 2 months was reduced on appeal to 2 years and 2 months.

21By way of comparison, the applicant hydroponically cultivated 6% more than the relevant commercial quantity.

22None of the cases referred to in Godden allow for a meaningful comparison. One was a Crown appeal, in another the quantity of plants is unknown, and in R v Daoulas NSWCCA (28 October 1993) the offender performed a secondary role to the principal. They cultivated 816 plants on the banks of the Darling river, that is, more than 3 times the relevant commercial quantity. The offender took part in the cultivation after losing his employment following retrenchment. He was 36 years of age with no priors. He was genuinely remorseful. A sentence of 4 years 8 months was reduced to 3 years 4 months on appeal.

23In Nguyen v R [2012] NSWCCA 42, the Court dismissed an appeal against the severity of a sentence of 5 years and 3 months, imposed upon a principal, 34 years of age, who cultivated 157 plants (3 times the relevant commercial quantity) inside residential premises. The offender had no priors and was not remorseful. The offence was committed in part because of gambling debts.

24In the course of that decision, Davies J (McClellan CJ at CL and Garling J agreeing) reviewed the following cases of indoor cultivation at [35] :-

(a) Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 322 
In this matter the Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of cultivating not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means. There were 105 plants involved. He also pleaded guilty to supplying cannabis in that he had in his possession 3708.7 grams of cannabis leaf. The maximum penalty for the first offence was 15 years imprisonment. His Honour considered that the offences fell within the middle range of seriousness. He allowed a 30% discount for the plea of guilty and for his remorse and contrition. It appears that he was the principal involved in the cultivation. In relation to the first count of cultivation he was sentenced to a total sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. An appeal to this Court was dismissed. 
(b) Thi Lan Nguyen v R [2009] NSWCCA 181
In this matter the Applicant pleaded guilty to cultivating not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means. The charge involved 172 cannabis plants. The maximum penalty for the offence is 15 years imprisonment. It was found that she agreed to look after the house where the plants were cultivated in return for financial gain and accommodation. There was no evidence to suggest that she initiated the cultivation. She was given a 25% discount for an early plea and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. An appeal to this Court reduced the sentence to a period of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months.
(c) Van Cuong Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 266
The Applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of cultivating by enhanced indoor means a commercial quantity of cannabis. There were 112 plants involved. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment. The Judge found that the Applicant's role in the commission of the offence was at a relatively low level, he having been recruited by other unidentified persons. In effect he acted as a ""babysitter"" for the crop in return for receiving something between $10,000 and $15,000. The Applicant was given a 25% discount for an early plea. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months. An appeal to this Court alleging that the sentence was manifestly excessive was dismissed.
(d) Thi Don Truong v R [2009] NSWCCA 41
The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of cultivating not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis. The maximum penalty was fifteen years imprisonment. There were 189 plants involved. The judge considered her criminality fell a little below the middle of the range. The applicant received a 25% discount for an early plea and was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months with an additional term of two years. On appeal to this court against the severity of the sentence it was held that even if she did not initiate the cultivation enterprise she took it over and maintained it for commercial gain. The appeal against severity was dismissed.

25In (b), (c) and (d), the offenders were aged between 43 and 45, had no criminal history and had cultivated between two and four times the relevant commercial quantity of 50 plants. The sentences confirmed on appeal ranged between three and three and half years' imprisonment. The case of Nguyen in (a) is silent on the question of the offender's age and priors. A starting point of 7 years appears to have been adopted by the sentencing judge for the cultivation offence.

26Of the 26 District Court cases summarised in the table, eleven relate to the indoor cultivation of more than 50 but less than 100 plants. Only five of those concerned a principal. All but one of those five had no relevant prior convictions. These offenders were between the ages of 20 and 53 and committed the offence for reasons of financial hardship. The sentences imposed ranged between 18 months (suspended) and two years and nine months' imprisonment. 

27Finally, the JIRS statistics reveal that, of 21 cases between October 2005 and September 2012, where the offender pleaded guilty and had no prior criminal history, 20 offenders received between one and three years' imprisonment. One offender received a sentence of 8 years' imprisonment. A proportion of these cases may have involved the cultivation of more than 250 plants.

28Having regard to this material, it is clear that the judge's starting point in the instant case was outside the appropriate range established by current sentencing practice. In my view, the appeal must succeed.

29The judge found special circumstances in order to allow the applicant to address his gambling and drug addiction under supervision. Accordingly, there should be a moderate alteration to the statutory ratio.

30The orders I propose are :-

(1) Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal allowed.

(3)The sentence imposed on 27 April 2012 is quashed.

(4)In lieu, a non-parole period of two (2) years and two (2) months is imposed, commencing 3 June 2011, expiring 2 August 2013. The balance of term is ten (10) months, expiring 2 June 2014. The applicant is to be released on 3 August 2013.

31BARR AJ : I agree with Latham J.

2761855,Cambey v R [2013] NSWCCA 170,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  On 29 January 2006, Derrick Reid was viciously assaulted in his unit at Cartwright and died shortly thereafter from his injuries.  The principal offenders were Todd Carney and Luke Cambey.  At a trial conducted in July 2012 each was convicted of manslaughter.  The presiding judge, Schmidt J, sentenced each offender on 7 November 2012.  The present applicant, Luke Cambey, was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years and two months with an additional term of two years and six months, giving a total sentence of seven years and eight months.  He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.
2The grounds of appeal were twofold, but were interrelated.  The first ground was that his culpability was less than that of Mr Carney and, although he received a lesser sentence, there was inadequate differentiation to reflect the true disparity between their respective actions.  Secondly, he complained that he received an inadequate discount for an offer to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter, at a time when he was facing charges of both murder and manslaughter.  
3The applicant was first taken into custody in relation to the charges on 16 September 2008.  Accordingly, his sentence was set to commence on that date.  His non-parole period will expire on 15 November 2013, that is approximately four months from the date of hearing his application in this Court.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court was satisfied, by a majority, that it was appropriate to grant leave to appeal and substitute a lesser sentence for that imposed by the trial judge.  Accordingly, orders were made resentencing Mr Cambey to a non-parole period of four years and 10 months, with a balance of term of two years and four months.  The effect of the reduction of the non-parole period was to allow the applicant to be considered for release on parole from 15 July 2013.  My reasons for joining in the order of the Court are as follows.
Facts established for purpose of sentencing4Because the accused were placed before a jury on charges of both murder and manslaughter, but verdicts were returned finding each guilty of manslaughter, it was necessary for the trial judge to make findings as to the basis of the convictions for the purpose of sentencing each offender.  This was done.  The trial judge also had before her some brief evidence from the applicant, the applicant's criminal record, a pre-sentence report and a psychologist's report.
5The victim, Mr Reid, was a supplier of cannabis.  Mr Carney, Mr Cambey and a younger man who carried a taser, went to Mr Reid's unit with the intention of obtaining cannabis, apparently without payment.  At least part of what ensued after they entered the unit was revealed by the injuries suffered by Mr Reid.  (There was no evidence that any of his assailants were injured.)  The victim's injuries were described by the trial judge in the following terms at [13]:
""Mr Reid's injuries were consistent with him having been kicked, as well as having been hit with a metal pole.  They included fractures to the head, including a depressed fracture which had hair embedded into the fracture; lacerations to the head; lacerations and fractures to two fingers of the left hand; bruising to the chest, shoulder, back, left flank, face head and arms; as well as abrasions to the left arm.  Todd Carney's evidence was that he did not hit Mr Reid in the shoulder, chest, or back and that he saw him being kicked, but not by whom. Luke Cambey's evidence was that he saw Todd Carney hitting Mr Reid.  He was equivocal about whether he had been kicked, but he denied himself kicking Mr Reid.""
6Further evidence for the prosecution, which was not discussed in detail in the judgment on sentence, was identified by the trial judge in the following terms:
""12 Before he died, Mr Reid gave accounts of what had happened to him to a neighbour and to attending ambulance officers.  He told them that three people had bashed him and that he had been tasered to the head.  That a taser had been used to inflict any of his injuries, was not admitted nor established on forensic examination after his death.  It was not in issue at the trial, however, that Todd Carney had repeatedly hit Mr Reid with a metal pole, but where Mr Reid was, when he was struck was in issue.  There was also an issue as to whether he had been kicked by Luke Cambey....
15 There was also evidence given by a number of witnesses to whom Todd Carney, Luke Cambey and the juvenile later spoke.  Their evidence as to what they were told about what had happened, was also consistent with Mr Reid having been hit after falling and with being kicked.  Those accounts included that Todd Carney had kept hitting Mr Reid when he kept getting up and that Luke Cambey had kicked him.  While the evidence of these witnesses was variously disputed by Todd Carney and Luke Cambey, who put the reliability of some of these witnesses in question and in one case, the honesty of the witness as well, their evidence was largely consistent with Mr Reid's accounts, with the injuries which he suffered and also partially consistent with the evidence which Todd Carney and Luke Cambey gave themselves.""
7The trial judge was, however, satisfied that the accounts given by Carney and Cambey were inaccurate to the extent that they failed to give a full account of the events.  She noted that neither had admitted that Mr Reid was struck ""after he fell"" and that the applicant did not admit inflicting any injuries at all: at [17].  She did not accept that evidence.
8The critical evidence, for the accused, as recounted by Mr Carney, which must have been accepted by the jury, was summarised in the following terms:
""20 Todd Carney's evidence was that when he entered the unit where Mr Reid lived with Luke Cambey and the juvenile following, Mr Reid was sitting on the bed.  They did not know him.  Todd Carney approached him and asked about buying cannabis.  He turned to look behind him when he heard the juvenile drop the taser.  He then heard Mr Reid say, loud enough, to 'warn them off', that 'this is not happening to me'.  When he turned back, he saw Mr Reid grabbing the pole from under a pillow or blanket on the bed and getting to his feet, swinging the pole at him.  He said that Mr Reid was slightly taller than him, but he caught the bar with his left hand and then saw someone kick Mr Reid from the right side.
21 He then punched Mr Reid in the head with his right hand and took the bar away from him.  Mr Reid then said 'you're dead you dog'.  It was then that he first hit Mr Reid in the head with the bar.  That blow stunned him, but it didn't drop him and he hit him again in the head, because Mr Reid came at him again.  Mr Reid came at him again and he hit him twice more, once in the arm.  He then he hit him again, before running out of the room.""
9With respect to the applicant's evidence at trial, much was supportive of Mr Carney's account that it was the victim who seized a metal ""pole"" from under the blanket and swung it at Mr Carney, who in turn caught it in his hand and punched the victim in the head with his other hand.  The trial judge, however, continued:
""27 Luke Cambey's evidence was also implausible in a number of respects.  He said that Todd Carney hit Mr Reid only once or twice with the pole, while he remained standing near the bed; that they were both pretty much standing still during the fight; that there was no shouting; that he did not think Mr Reid had been seriously hurt; and that he saw no blood at all.  In cross-examination he said the fight had lasted only 15 seconds and denied that Mr Reid had been knocked down; that the whole time he stood between the coffee table and his bed; and that he had been hit 'twice if that' on the head and shoulder.  He agreed that someone could have shoved Mr Reid to his bed, but claimed that no-one did. 
28 Initially Luke Cambey also denied that he or anyone else had kicked Mr Reid, but later he said that the juvenile could have kicked Mr Reid and later again, that he did not recall Mr Reid being kicked.""
10Critically for present purposes, the trial judge made the following findings:
""31 I am satisfied that the evidence established to the requisite degree that Todd Carney repeatedly hit Mr Reid with the pole, even after he fell to the bed; that Luke Cambey provided him with intentional aid and encouragement, including by kicking Mr Reid; and that the injuries which caused his death were the result of excessive self defence. 
32 On both offenders' evidence, while these events happened quickly, there was nothing physical which prevented them from leaving, once Mr Reid had been disarmed and pushed to the bed, without the need to inflict all the injuries which ended his life.  Viewed objectively these were both serious offences, although the criminality involved in Todd Carney's offending was clearly more serious than that of Luke Cambey.
33 The sentences imposed must thus reflect the serious nature of this offending, which was more serious, as I have noted, in the case of Todd Carney, than of Luke Cambey. That must be reflected in the sentences imposed.""
11The trial judge then embarked on a lengthy consideration of the personal circumstances of Mr Carney.  She accepted that he was ""remorseful"", which she described as involving an acceptance of ""his responsibility for the actions which caused Mr Reid's death"": at [41].  She accepted that this was an acceptance which ""only developed slowly over time"": at [42].  The first time that Mr Carney revealed his use of the metal pole was in the course of his trial, some five and a half years after the event.  He also did not give a complete account of his actions: at [42]. 
12The trial judge also concluded that Mr Carney was ""unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation"": at [70].  However that view was qualified by the conditions that he maintain his abstinence from drugs and alcohol and remain compliant with respect to his anti-psychotic medication: see also at [75].  She further found that although it was a ""brutal killing"" it was ""to some extent the result of Todd Carney's deteriorating mental state"": at [78].  
13The applicant was assessed by a clinical psychologist, Dr Emma Collins, in September 2012, after the trial.  She assessed his risk of ""violence recidivism"" at ""moderate to moderate-low"": Report, par 26.  This view appears to have been accepted by the trial judge: at [92].  Whilst accepting that the applicant had ""matured"" whilst in custody, she concluded that ""there are reasons for having reservations as to the likelihood that Luke Cambey will not re-offend and as to his prospects of rehabilitation"": at [98].
14The trial judge concluded that specific deterrence had a role to play in setting a sentence in respect of the applicant, because ""he still does not have complete insight into his offending and that his risk of re-offending is not small"": at [108].  In respect of Carney, she said that specific deterrence had ""a slightly lesser role to play than it otherwise would, given the mental illness to which he later succumbed and which is now in remission"": at [107]. 
15Finally, the sentencing judge turned to the issue of parity and noted that ""the offenders' involvement in Mr Reid's manslaughter [were] different, with the result that the greater criminality of Todd Carney's offending must be reflected in the sentences which are imposed"".  Carney was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of three years, giving a total sentence of nine years.  As noted above, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years and two months, with a balance of term of two years six months, giving a total sentence of seven years and eight months: at [111].
Grounds of appeal(a) discount for proffered plea16The question of the discount for an offer to plead to manslaughter requires reference to the procedural history of the charges and the possible consideration of further evidence sought to be led on the appeal.
17In February 2010 the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an indictment against the applicant and Mr Carney charging them with the murder of Derrick Reid.  They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted by a jury.  Neither gave evidence and the defence sought to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether they were present at the unit in Cartwright when the victim was assaulted.  The jury believed the prosecution evidence, primarily of persons to whom they had admitted being involved in the assault.  However, the convictions were set aside on the basis that the trial judge ought to have left the alternative verdict of manslaughter to the jury: Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223.  Between the date of that judgment (20 October 2011) and the time they went to trial on an indictment containing counts of murder and manslaughter, the applicant offered a plea of guilty to the charge of manslaughter.  In discussing the mitigating factors relevant to the applicant, the trial judge stated at [91]:
""Account must also be taken, however, of his earlier offer to plead guilty to manslaughter after the first trial.  There was no evidence as to the circumstances of that offer and its refusal.  Its rejection resulted in the second joint trial being conducted, where both offenders defended the charges of murder and manslaughter, so that no utilitarian savings resulted from the offer to [plead].  ...  Nevertheless, in my view the offer must be considered as reflecting at least some willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  In the result, I take the view that account of the offer must be taken in fixing the sentence, by way of a small discount.  In the circumstances I do not propose to separately identify the amount of that discount.""
18Two issues arise with respect to this passage.  The first is that relied upon as a ground of appeal, namely whether the trial judge gave adequate allowance for the proffered plea.  The second is to assess to what extent the discount apparently given accounts for the disparity in the sentences between Mr Carney (who did not offer to plead) and the applicant.  The latter consideration is relevant to the adequacy of the part of the disparity  reflecting the differing involvement of each in the offending.
19In the course of submissions, the trial judge noted that there had been a proffered plea to manslaughter to which his counsel remarked that ""it is certainly not unusual for people to make offers on a pragmatic basis, and it is in that light that that has got to be looked at"": Tcpt, 19/10/12, p 37(47).
(i) tender of further evidence20Perhaps recognising that the paucity of information as to the circumstances of the plea had been correctly identified in the judgment on sentence, counsel for the applicant sought to read in this Court an affidavit of counsel who appeared at the trial and on the sentencing hearing, in order to provide further detail.  That step gave rise to an issue as to the admissibility of such material on appeal.  The Court accepted the affidavit on the basis that its admissibility would be dealt with in this judgment.
21For the purposes of dealing with this application, it is appropriate to note that the affidavit did no more than identify that counsel had received instructions that his client was prepared to enter a plea of guilty to the charge of manslaughter and that he conveyed those instructions to the prosecutor on two occasions in May and June 2012.  He further noted that on each occasion the offer was declined.
22Differing views had been expressed as to the appropriateness of this Court receiving further evidence on an appeal against sentence.  While the nature of the available grounds has consistently been accepted as those stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505, the evidential basis for a challenge is less clear and is not identified in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3).  While evidence is commonly tendered on criminal appeals against sentence, the usual basis is that the further material is provided only for the purposes of resentencing, in the event that the Court decides to intervene.  It is further generally accepted that evidence readily available to the offender at a hearing on sentence should not be accepted on appeal for the purpose of demonstrating that the sentencing judge was in error.  An appeal against sentence is not to be treated as a fresh hearing where the question of the appropriate sentence can be reagitated on a different basis from that before the sentencing judge.
23It is neither necessary nor appropriate, given the absence of full submissions on the question, to deal in this case with the extent to which evidence not proffered to the sentencing judge should be accepted on appeal.  Further, it is not necessary in this case because the evidence proffered does not take the matter any further.  
(ii) extent of discount24As counsel for the Director correctly noted, the plea was offered without any indication as to the factual basis on which it might be justified and at a time when neither accused had suggested that it was the victim who had first produced the metal bar and had attempted to assault Mr Carney.  In those circumstances, not only was the Director left with little material on which to determine whether or not to accept the plea, but, if accepted, a sentencing judge would have had little if any material on which to determine an appropriate sentence.  For that reason, the trial judge was correct in assigning limited weight to the plea.  
25There is a hint in her reasons that either because the offer was not accepted, or because the co-offender did not offer a plea, the trial did go ahead, or would have gone ahead, anyway, so that there was no utilitarian benefit to be derived from the offer.  Both limbs of such an approach would have been erroneous, but it should not be accepted from the slightly awkward expression of reasoning set out above, that either approach was adopted.  Rather it should be accepted that the trial judge gave an appropriate discount, an assumption which favours the applicant on his primary ground. 
26The second ground of appeal must be rejected.
(b) assessment of parity27The disparity in sentences noted above may be summarised by saying that the applicant's non-parole period was 86% of that imposed on Mr Carney and the full term of the sentence was 85% of that imposed on Mr Carney.  Measured in time, the applicant's non-parole period was 10 months less than that imposed on Mr Carney and his full sentence 16 months less.
28Some part of that differential should be ascribed to the discount which the trial judge accepted was to be allowed to the applicant in respect of his proffered plea.  Given the importance of parity (and disparity) in this case, it is perhaps unfortunate that the discount was not quantified.  It may, however, be assumed that the discount did not exceed 10% and, to be real and not trivial, must have been at least 5%.  It would follow that the disparity in the sentences intended to reflect the different levels of culpability of each offender must have fallen within the range of 5%-10% or, in terms of months with respect to the non-parole period, between three and seven months.  Thus, the issue with respect to the first ground of appeal was whether such a differential adequately reflected the different levels of culpability of each.
29One factor which must be weighed in the balance against the applicant's challenge is that any disparity which appropriately reflected the objective differential in the offending, will be reduced to some extent by the findings of the trial judge that Mr Carney (but not the applicant) demonstrated, if belatedly, remorse and that his prospects of rehabilitation were greater than those of the applicant.
30So far as their levels of culpability are concerned, there are two views available.  On one view, the applicant was equally complicit with Mr Carney in the savage attack on the victim.  Although he did not wield the metal pole, far from seeking to leave to or to dissuade Mr Carney from continuing to attack the victim once he had been disarmed, he actively encouraged and joined in by kicking the victim, presumably when he was on the floor.  On that view, the difference in levels of culpability was limited.
31The alternative view is that, whilst the applicant was clearly complicit in all respects, the primary responsibility lay with Mr Carney, who administered numerous blows with the metal pole, as well as punching the victim in the head.  Although the trial judge found that the applicant provided ""intentional aid and encouragement"", beyond the reference to kicking Mr Reid, there were no findings as to what precisely the applicant did.  Nor was there any finding that the kicking was instrumental in causing death.  Given the nature of the wounds inflicted with the metal pole, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the sentencing judge to assign any lethal activity to the applicant.  In any event, the findings at [31] should not be understood as implicitly doing so.  Rather, as she expressly noted at [32], ""the criminality involved in Todd Carney's offending was clearly more serious than that of Luke Cambey"". 
32The latter view should be accepted.  In that event, even making allowance for the countervailing considerations referred to above, the actual disparity in the sentences was inadequate to reflect the disparate levels of culpability.  Mr Cambey undoubtedly played an active role in the assaults, but he was significantly less culpable than Mr Carney.  That fact should have been reflected in a greater disparity in the sentences.
33There was no challenge, nor could there have been, to the appropriateness of the sentences viewed independently of each other.  Nor should any lesser sentence be imposed on the applicant which would fall below the appropriate range required to reflect the objective seriousness of the offending.  However, to reflect the different levels of culpability, an appropriate non-parole period is four years and 10 months with a balance of term of two years and four months, giving a sentence of seven years and two months.  The non-parole period will expire on 15 July 2013.  That is the first date on which the applicant will be eligible for parole.  The balance of the sentence will expire on 15 November 2015.
34PRICE J:  I have had the benefit of reading Basten JA's judgment in draft.  As his Honour announced when granting leave to appeal and substituting a lesser sentence on 9 July 2013, the Court's decision was by a majority.  I did not join in the Court's decision because I was not satisfied that the disparity between the applicant's sentence and Carney's sentence was unjustified.  However, I agree with Basten JA's reasons for rejecting the second ground of appeal.  I also agree that leave to appeal be granted. 
35I note that Basten JA considers at [28] above that the unquantified discount for the proffered plea to manslaughter must have fallen within the range of 5 per cent - 10 per cent.  In my view, if the discount had been more than 5 per cent, the trial judge would have identified the amount of the discount. 
36In order to justify appellate intervention the disparity must be ""marked"". Where the objective criteria does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, an appellate court will not intervene.  The majority (French CJ, Brennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 observed at [32]:
""A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders."" `
37In my respectful opinion, the trial judge gave careful consideration to the principle of parity.  Her Honour expressly referred to the principle at [109] - [110] of the sentencing remarks immediately before sentencing both offenders.  Her Honour had heard the evidence given before the jury and determined the part that each offender played in the crime.  Her Honour found that the applicant's involvement in Mr Reid's death was less serious than Carney's but the applicant's offending was not at the lowest end of the scale for manslaughter.  She analysed relevant differences in their subjective cases.
38In the case of Carney, the trial judge found that he had accepted responsibility for his actions which caused Mr Reid's death, actions for which he was remorseful.  On the other hand, her Honour found there was no evidence that the applicant was remorseful for his offending.  The applicant had not accepted his involvement in causing the death or criminal responsibility for his conduct. 
39In the applicant's case there were no mental health issues, whereas Carney had suffered from episodes of schizophrenia. Her Honour found that at the time of the offence, Carney was ""in a fragile mental state given the mental illness which he was then clearly developing, as the result of his prior serious drug abuse""  (ROS at [78]).  Her Honour observed that it was a brutal killing ""but one which was clearly to some extent the result of Todd Carney's deteriorating mental state"" (ROS at [78]).  No such finding was made in respect of the applicant.  
40Carney's mental illness impacted upon the weight given by the trial judge in Carney's case to specific deterrence.  Her Honour found that ""specific deterrence has a slightly lesser role to play than it otherwise would, given the mental illness to which he later succumbed and which is now in remission"" (ROS at [107]). On the other hand, her Honour considered that ""specific deterrence certainly has a role to play in [the applicant's sentence]"" (ROS at [108]). Her Honour explained that the applicant did not have complete insight into his offending and that his risk of re-offending was ""not small"" (ROS at [108]). 
41Another difference was in the findings of rehabilitation.  The trial judge found that Carney was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation as long as he maintained his abstinence from drugs and alcohol and remained compliant with the anti-psychotic medication which had resulted in his mental illness going into remission.  On the other hand, her Honour concluded that ""there are reasons for having reservations as to the likelihood that [the applicant] will not re-offend and as to his prospects of rehabilitation"" (ROS at 98).
42All of these considerations were significant.  Having regard to these matters and the differences in the culpability of the applicant and Carney, I was not persuaded that the disparity in sentence gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  Accordingly, the orders that I proposed were that the appeal be dismissed.  
43CAMPBELL J:  I joined in pronouncing the Court's orders of 9th July 2013 for the reasons given by Basten JA.

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  Nature of AppealThe appellant appeared for trial before Hock DCJ and a jury on 1 November 2011 in relation to five counts:
Count 1:  That on or about 17 January 1994 at Sydney in the State of NSW did have sexual intercourse with SB without her consent knowing that she was not consenting (s61I Crimes Act, 1900; max penalty 7 years - no SNPP because of date of commission of the offence).
Count 2:  That on or about 17 January 1994 at Sydney in the State of NSW did have sexual intercourse with SB without her consent knowing that she was not consenting (s61I Crimes Act, 1900; max penalty 7 years - no SNPP because of date of commission of the offence).
Count 3:  That between about 1 March 2009 and 30 April 2009 at Sydney in the State of NSW did assault CS and that he, at the time of such assault, did commit an act of indecency on CS (s61L Crimes Act, 1900).
Count 4:  That between about 1 March 2009 and 30 April 2009 at Sydney in the State of NSW did have sexual intercourse with CS without her consent knowing that she was not consenting (s61I Crimes Act, 1900).
Count 5:  That on 20 March 2009 at Sydney in the State of NSW did assault HL and that he, at the time of such assault, did commit an act of indecency on HL (s61L Crimes Act, 1900).
2Pre-trial proceedings took place between 1 - 3 November and the trial commenced on 7 November 2011.  It concluded on 24 November 2011.  The jury found the appellant guilty on counts 1 and 2 and not guilty on counts 3 - 5.
3On 20 April 2012 her Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months, commencing 24 November 2011 and expiring 23 February 2013, and a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months to expire on 23 May 2014.  The appellant was admitted to parole on 23 February 2013.
4The appellant appeals against his conviction for the offences in counts 1 and 2 on the following grounds:
Ground 1:  Given the course of events at trial, there was a miscarriage of justice occasioned in the failure to order separate trials of counts 1 and 2 from counts 3, 4 and 5.
Ground 2:  The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the Crown was required to prove that penetration was carried out other than for proper medical purposes.
Ground 3:  The learned trial judge erred in failing to admit evidence of the appellant's qualifications and areas of study.
Ground 4:  The learned trial judge erred in the manner in which she directed the jury concerning the evidence of the appellant's ""good character"".
Factual Background and Proceedings at Trial
5In relation to counts 1 and 2, the Crown case was that SB attended the appellant in January 1994 because she was suffering from a skin rash.  She was dressed in her bra and underpants while the appellant performed acupressure on her.  (Acupressure was the application by the appellant of pressure on a client's body and involved close bodily contact and touching.)  It was the Crown case that in the course of this procedure, the appellant without warning twice digitally penetrated SB's vagina using one finger, each event occurring within seconds of the other.
6The Crown case in relation to counts 3 and 4 was that CS attended the appellant in March or April 2009 because she needed a medical certificate.  She was taken to the appellant's consultation room and was asked to lie down on her stomach on the examination table.  The appellant repeatedly squeezed her breast and told her that she had a cyst in her stomach.  He then reached under her skirt and underpants and inserted one or two fingers into her vagina.  He told her that he had been feeling for a cyst.  
7The Crown case in relation to count 5 was that on 20 March 2009, HL attended the appellant for treatment.  She took off the top part of her clothing and donned a gown.  Following a method known as 'cupping', the appellant placed his right hand under her gown and rubbed her abdomen moving his hands up to her ribs and back down and tapping her on the sternum in various places.  The appellant then used a hand to rub her right breast in a circular motion.  HL questioned the appellant as to what he was doing and he answered that he was checking for cysts.
8The appellant's case in relation to each count was that the incidents there described did not occur.  He said that when treating a patient with a skin irritation, he would wear gloves.  He denied ever having issued backdated medical certificates to any patient.  In relation to CS and HL, his receptionist, Ms Gao, would have been present during any treatment.
9Before the trial commenced, the Crown served a tendency and coincidence notice seeking to have the evidence of one complainant admissible in support of the Crown case in respect of the other complainants.  This was done in order to support a joint trial of all five counts and to forestall any attempt to sever the counts.
10The tendency and coincidence, as particularised and sought to be proved by the Crown, was (Exhibit A - Tendency and Coincidence Notice):
""(a) ... To act in a particular way, namely ... to sexually exploit patients under the guise of conducting legitimate Chinese medicine techniques"".
(The notice then proceeded to state that the Crown relied upon the following to support that tendency):
""(i) The fact that the accused was a practitioner of Chinese medicine/
(ii) The complainants were all patients of the accused.
(iii) The alleged assaults occurred during a consultation with the accused.
(iv) The accused touched sexual organs.
(v) None of the complainants presented with complaints relating to the areas that the accused is said to have touched.
(b) To prove that the accused had a particular state of mind, namely to obtain sexual gratification from touching the complainants in that manner.""
11During argument regarding the admissibility of the evidence on a tendency basis, the Crown conceded:
(a) That the only acts of tendency and/or coincidence were the acts on the indictment.
(b) That the passage of time between counts 1 and 2 involving SB, which occurred in 1994 and the other counts which occurred in 2009, weakened the Crown's contention that the evidence was admissible as tendency evidence.
12By way of notice of motion and supporting affidavit the appellant sought to sever the counts on the indictment:
(a) That the counts as between each of the three complainants be tried separately; and
(b) That the Crown not be permitted to adduce evidence of a tendency and coincidence nature in accordance with the tendency and coincidence notice.
13Her Honour delivered judgment on the application for separate trials on 3 November 2011.  Her Honour said:
""I am satisfied that what is established by the relevant parts of each complainant's statement is a tendency on the part of the accused to ""sexually exploit his patients"", that is to sexually assault female patients while purporting to treat them as a practitioner of Chinese medicine.  I am also satisfied that the evidence establishes that the accused had a particular state of mind, namely to obtain sexual gratification from touching his patients in that way.
The accused's counsel stated that the accused would deny any act of sexual assault took place in respect of any complainant.  Therefore, the fact in issue in each count is whether the accused did the act which the complainant alleged.  The tendency evidence is clearly relevant to whether the accused did conduct himself in this way.  Given that each complainant is unknown to the other, the evidence has significant probative value in respect of the question whether each of the individual allegations is to be accepted.""
14Her Honour deferred ruling on whether the evidence was admissible on a coincidence basis until after the evidence was complete.  In the event the Crown did not renew its application concerning coincidence and that matter was never put to the jury.  It is the tendency which forms the basis of the first ground of appeal.  
15At trial CS gave evidence first.  She said that she went with her friend, Rattiga H, to the appellant seeking backdated medical certificates which she needed to provide to her English language school to enable her to stay enrolled.  She said that although she was not ill at the time, she permitted herself to be medically examined by the appellant.
16The effect of her evidence was:
(a) The appellant carried out an examination during which he touched both her breasts, but not for very long.
(b) At the time she did not think anything of the touching.
(c) He was not wearing surgical gloves at the time he touched her breasts.
(d) The appellant, as part of the examination, put his finger in her vagina.  It was not inserted for very long.  
(e) She was not told in advance what was happening.
(f) After he digitally penetrated her, he told her that she had a cyst in her lower abdomen.
(g) The appellant then performed acupuncture on her stomach area.
(h) Because she was shocked by the acupuncture, she shouted out to Rattiga H, who was sitting immediately outside the consultation room, ""He did acupuncture on me"".
17The effect of the evidence in cross-examination was:
(i) She agreed that she was at risk of having her visa cancelled and an early departure from Australia if she breached her 70 percent attendance requirement at her college.  This was why she needed a medical certificate.
(j) She agreed that she did not want to lose her student visa and be deported to Thailand.
(k) In relation to how long he digitally penetrated her, she said ""He just put it in and then he pulled it out"".
(l) CS asserted that she did not want to have acupuncture and that she screamed out when the needles began to be inserted ""I scream, I scream, I was shock, I scream and call out for my friend"".  At the time she screamed out, Rattiga H would have been about two metres away.  She screamed in Thai.  She said that Rattiga H called back to her ""It's going to be - just let it happen"".
(m) It was put to her that she was never digitally penetrated and she stated ""He did that before he did acupuncture on me"".
(n) CS stated that Rattiga H was also examined by the appellant.
(o) She denied that the appellant had a female assistant with him when performing the acupuncture treatment.
18Rattiga H gave evidence in the Crown case.  She said:
(a) She did not leave the area where CS was being examined.
(b) She was told by CS that the appellant had ""inserted his fingers into her vagina"".
(c) She did not hear any noise coming from the room occupied by CS at the time she was with the appellant.
19Under cross-examination she said:
(d) She was never examined by the appellant.
(e) She never heard any shouting coming from the room occupied by CS.
(f) After she left the appellant's clinic, CS did not complain to her that she had been examined or touched on either of her breasts.
20HL next gave evidence.  The effect of her evidence was:
(a) She attended the appellant because she had been referred by her neighbour, Cheryl C.
(b) She was expecting to be given acupuncture.
(c) She attended the appellant's clinic on two occasions.
(d) On the first occasion she received treatment consisting of lying down on the table with her top taken off, where cupping and acupuncture (with needles inserted in her back on either side of her spine) took place.  This was coupled with the use of a heat lamp and a procedure where she was required to stand astride a chair where acupressure was applied to her back.
(e) She returned to the clinic a couple of weeks later.
(f) In the interim she had experienced a fall and hurt her back.  She told the appellant that she did not want any chiropractic manipulation.
(g) On this occasion, she again took her top off and put on a gown.
(h) No-one else was present in the consultation room.
(i) The appellant then treated her by cupping and acupuncture.
(j) She was treated with a heat lamp and the appellant proceeded to crack her back.  She groaned with pain and felt dizzy and sick.
(k) The appellant started tapping her on the throat with his fingers and then he put his hand up her gown and squeezed her stomach, going up to her ribs.  He then started tapping up and down her sternum and ""then he just brushed his hand around my right breast"".
(l) He was not wearing any surgical gloves at the time and she described the appellant's action as ""just a rub"" to her right breast.  Later she said that the touching of her breast was ""just like a wipe"".
(m) She said to him, ""What do you think you're doing?"" and he told her that he was ""checking for cysts"".  She told him that she had cysts.
(n) When she went home, she complained to her next door neighbour, Cheryl C, that the appellant had ""groped me"", but she refused to believe it.
(o) While she did not immediately make any complaint to her husband, she did so a week later.  She said that she did not give the appellant permission to touch her breast.
21Under cross-examination, the following took place:
(p) She agreed that in her witness statement to the police, she said that the appellant's action consisted of a ""circular motion around my right breast"".
(q) She was cross-examined about the use of the words ""sexual violence"" which appeared in statutory declarations by various people and which had been submitted to the court in support of HL.  When asked whether she had told these persons that the appellant had subjected her to sexual violence she said:  ""I don't think I used those words"".  She agreed that the appellant had never used actual violence when he brushed or wiped her breast.
22In relation to the neighbour, Cheryl  C, there was evidence in cross-examination from the police officer in charge that he had approached her for a witness statement, but she refused to provide such a statement.
23HL's husband gave evidence that HL had complained to him about a week after the incident.  He said that in a statutory declaration that he swore he had used the words ""sexual violence was performed on her"" but he denied that those words had been inserted in the statutory declaration at the direction of HL.  He agreed that the words used by her when she complained to him were ""not touched, he groped me"".
24HL made a complaint to another neighbour, Judith F, and this evidence was led by the Crown.  In cross-examination, Ms F was asked questions regarding the use of the words ""sexual violence by [the appellant]"" in a statutory declaration which she had sworn.  Ms F denied that HL had told her what to write in the statutory declaration.
25The Crown led evidence from Yang Gao, the appellant's receptionist at the clinic on the days that CS and HL attended.  The effect of her evidence, in relation to CS, was:
(a) That she was present throughout the whole treatment of CS, the touching of the nerve points and the administration of acupuncture.  She did not see the appellant squeeze or fondle CS's breasts or digitally penetrate her, nor did CS ever cry out for help.
(b) Rattiga H was not treated by the appellant on the day that CS was present at the clinic.
(c) She recalled that when CS was being treated by the appellant, the door to his consultation room was open because her friend Rattiga H was sitting outside the room.
(d) She did not hear CS cry out to Rattiga H, nor did she appear distressed or angry.
(e) Medical certificates were not backdated.
26In relation to HL, the effect of the evidence of Yang Gao was:
(f) She recalled HL attending the clinic and being treated by the appellant.  She said that she was present in the treatment room at all times and that HL was never left alone.
(g) She denied that the appellant had ever touched HL's breast.
(h) She denied that HL had said to the appellant ""What do you think you're doing?"".
27The effect of the evidence of SB was:
(a) SB first attended the appellant in January and February 1992, approximately four - five times to be treated for a skin rash which she had developed in relation to her arms.  This was successfully treated with acupressure.
(b) She again developed a rash on her arms and also on her lips.  She went to the appellant for treatment between December 1993 and January 1994, probably four or five times.  On each occasion, she received acupressure.
(c) She attended the appellant shortly before leaving Australia to go to Switzerland, which was scheduled for 19 January 1994.  She was taken to a room by the appellant with a closed door.  She lay down on the table on her back.  The appellant gave her acupressure.
(d) She was lying down and the appellant stood positioned next to her head and asked her to put her arms behind her and put them on either side of his waist.
(e) When the appellant stood close to her head she ""thought that he had an erection at the time, but I can't be a hundred percent sure"".  Later in cross-examination she said ""I wasn't a hundred percent certain that he had an erection.  I wasn't sure"".
(f) The appellant continued with acupressure on the top of her torso.  At this stage she was in her underwear, i.e. a bra and underpants.
(g) While she was in her underwear, the appellant touched her near her breast.  He then reached down and touched her near her genital area.  The appellant then pushed her underwear aside by pushing it down and pressing on that area.
(h) SB described what happened as follows:
""After that, I mean, I don't remember how much time there was between that incident and the next.  It was, you know, it could have been thirty seconds; it could have been a couple of minutes.  But then he walked down to - to the other end of the bed and, like, he was doing acupressure on me then.  He was standing sort of facing me and, like, without any sort of warning or anything, he put his finger in my vagina, he sort of moved my underpants out of the way and he put his finger in my vagina.  He then withdrew it, he smelt his finger and he said something about, like, I did have a mild case of thrush at the time, and he - I think he said something about that.  And he put it back in again, and he withdrew it and he looked at the fluids on his finger, and he said something about, you know, Dr Zhu is very worried about you because it was the last time - he knew it was the last time that I was coming there and so I wasn't continuing treatment.  He apparently felt that I needed more treatment and, yeah, he said something about Dr Zhu is very worried about you, then he said something about taking herbs overseas with me, and that was the end of the consultation and he then left the room.""  (T.316.19, 11.11.11)
(i) The appellant was not wearing gloves at the time.
(j) The time between the first and second insertion of the appellant's fingers in her vagina, was a ""matter of seconds"".  Later in cross-examination she said ""A matter of seconds, like twenty seconds.  Less maybe.""
(k) At no stage did the appellant indicate that he was going to put his fingers into her vagina, or that he intended to perform a vaginal examination.  She did not give him permission to perform any such vaginal examination.
(l) Under cross-examination she said that she never protested or made a complaint to the appellant about his conduct at the time.  She did not tell him that she felt uncomfortable and that she was leaving.
(m) She did not complain because she thought he was a doctor and that he penetrated her vagina ""under the pretext of testing - you know, testing me to see if I had any sort of infection.  I mean the fact that he even sniffed his finger for God's sake, he did it as a doctor"".
(n) She felt that the vaginal examination ""wasn't warranted ... but at that time I felt very confused"".  
28The next day, SB told her friend PS what had happened at the appellant's clinic.  She told her that the ""Chinese herbalist that I was seeing stuck his finger up me"", as well as having her put her hands on his waist.
29She and PS did not report the matter to the police at the time but did report it to the ""Medical Complaints place"".  In her presence, PS phoned an organisation specialising in medical complaints and said that her friend had a complaint about the appellant.  PS left her contact details, rather than SB's.  Forms relating to making a formal complaint were sent to SB while she was staying in Switzerland.  The forms were received by her about a week to three weeks later.  She did not complete the complaint forms, as she found it difficult to put into words.
30When SB was living in Granada, Spain, in 1999, she was contacted by PS in order to make a statement to police regarding the incident because the police were investigating the appellant.  SB provided that witness statement on 5 September 1999 and a further witness statement on 5 February 2010.  
31PS gave evidence in the proceedings.  The effect of that evidence was:
(a) That a complaint was made to her by SB regarding her vaginal examination by the appellant.
(b) That she contacted the NSW Medical Board on behalf of SB regarding the appellant.  That letter sent to the Board was dated 21 January 1994 and was admitted as Exhibit ""I"".  She also provided the Board with the appellant's business card.  No details regarding the incident were disclosed in that letter.  
(c) PS recalled receiving communication from the police regarding SB's complaint about the appellant, but she could not recall whether she sent those documents directly to her overseas or not.
32The evidence in the appellant's case consisted of the testimony of the appellant, evidence of witnesses who were present when CS was at the clinic and evidence as to the appellant's good character.
33Kevin Sutton gave evidence that he was treated by the appellant on 31 March 2009, at the very time that CS was at the Clinic with Rattiga H.  He said that he never heard any yelling or screaming when he was there and that the walls of the clinic were such that you could hear people speaking in the adjoining room.  The appellant gave uncontradicted evidence that Mr Sutton was at the clinic at the same time as CS and Rattiga H were present.  This was confirmed by a diary entry.  
34The appellant gave evidence that he did not commit any of the offences in relation to CS.  He denied that he provided backdated medical certificates.  He denied that he ever examined her friend, Rattiga H.  He denied that he ever touched CS's breasts.  He denied that he ever digitally penetrated CS.  He stated that he did not hear CS scream out.  
35In relation to HL, he denied touching her breast and said that all that he did was apply a hot liquid to her sternum.  In relation to SB, he denied digitally penetrating her without gloves.
36Character witnesses gave evidence.  Dr Milena Maric, who had a five - six year old daughter gave evidence as to how the appellant had successfully treated her daughter and also a nephew with severe disability involving cerebral palsy.  She said that the appellant had never held himself out as being a western trained doctor.  
37Ms Josephyne Olivieri gave evidence that she had been treated by the appellant from 1993 to 2000, during which time she received acupressure for eczema and other ailments.  She gave evidence that throughout her whole period of treatment, she found him to be totally professional and the charges against him were incomprehensible and outrageous, as far as she knew him as an individual.
Ground 1:  Given the course of events at trial, there was a miscarriage of justice occasioned in the failure to order separate trials of counts 1 and 2 from counts 3, 4 and 5.
38The appellant's original submission did not relate to her Honour's refusal to grant a severance of counts 1 and 2 from the balance of the counts.  In that regard, the appellant accepted that the decision of the trial judge was made on a proper basis, i.e., that the evidence of the three complainants had significant probative value (s97 Evidence Act 1995).  The appellant argued that subsequent events at trial revealed that the joinder of all counts brought about a situation which constituted a miscarriage of justice.
39After the appellant's written submissions were filed, the Court of Appeal of Victoria delivered its decision in Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328.  That judgment held that the decision of this Court in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 was wrong.  On the basis of the Dupas decision, the appellant withdrew his concession that her Honour had properly applied s97 of the Evidence Act and challenged the failure to sever counts 1 and 2 from the balance of the counts on that basis as well.  The appellant now argues that her Honour fell into error in failing to properly apply the Evidence Act.
40This Court recently considered both R v Shamouil and Dupas v The Queen in R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121.  In that case (Basten JA, Simpson J and myself, Blanch J not deciding and Price J contra) held that R v Shamouil correctly stated the law in New South Wales and should be followed.  The matters raised in Dupas v The Queen were extensively analysed by Basten JA and Simpson J in XY.  No useful purpose would be served by repeating that analysis here.  This Court should follow the decision in XY.  Accordingly, the appellant's modified position of challenging her Honour's refusal to sever counts 1 and 2 from the balance of the counts should be rejected.  I accordingly approach this Ground of Appeal on the basis of the appellant's original submissions, i.e. that subsequent events have brought about a situation whereby the failure to sever counts 1 and 2 constituted a miscarriage of justice.
41The appellant relied upon the decision in R v Demirok [1976] VR 244 at 251 where the Full Court said:
""Conversely, if the decision of the trial judge was made on correct grounds and was in itself a decision which the Appeal Court would consider to be unimpeachable, it may nevertheless appear that developments at the trial were such as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.  In the latter case, the ground of appeal taken no doubt should not be the ground that the trial judge's discretions miscarried, but simply that because of the course of events which developed during a trial, the nature of the trial constituted such a miscarriage.""
42The appellant submitted that in retrospect the evidence in the cases concerning CS and HL was found to be unreliable.  Even though the jury entered verdicts of not guilty in relation to counts 3 - 5, it necessarily considered the evidence in those matters which suggested that the appellant had sexually assaulted two other complainants besides SB.  The appellant submitted that the jury may well have been satisfied of the appellant's guilt in relation to counts 3 - 5 on the balance of probabilities, but not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.  In those circumstances, there was a real risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant when the jury came to consider the evidence in relation to counts 1 and 2.
43The appellant submitted that because of the verdicts of not guilty in counts 3 - 5, it became clear in retrospect that the criteria by which the tendency evidence had to be tested was not made out.  In that regard, the appellant relied upon the observations of Priestley JA in R v Zaidi (1991) 57 A Crim R 189 at 205 where his Honour said:
""In a general way, the point was latent in the unsuccessful application for separate trials.  Most importantly, however, there seems to me to have been a real likelihood that the jury were influenced in arriving at their three guilty verdicts by evidence that should not have been considered by them in reaching each of those verdicts.""
44The appellant submitted that had the evidence in relation to the complaints by CS and HL not been before the jury, it would have considered the case concerning SB on its own as if it were the only incident.  That meant that the significant and largely unexplained delay in the prosecution of the SB complaint, would have to have been considered by the jury.  This was not a case where a child complainant made a complaint well after the event as an adult and which was explicable on that basis alone.  
45The appellant submitted that because in retrospect the evidence of CS and HL should not have been before the jury in the SB matter, the possibility of the jury misusing that evidence could not be satisfactorily dealt with by appropriate directions.  The appellant submitted that as a result, a miscarriage of justice had been occasioned warranting the intervention by this Court and a new trial.
46By way of further background, it should be noted that on 24 November 2011 at approximately 11.11am the jury sent a note indicating that it had reached verdicts on counts 1, 2 and 5.  With the agreement of counsel, her Honour then took the verdicts (guilty on counts 1 and 2 and not guilty on count 5).  Her Honour then administered a ""Black"" direction.  Less than an hour after retiring to consider their verdicts, the jury returned with not guilty verdicts on counts 3 and 4.
47For the reasons stated in XY, and as originally conceded by the appellant, the tendency evidence was properly admitted.  In her summing up, her Honour included the usual instruction about determining each count separately and a direction that tendency evidence could only be relied upon in respect of any count if it were established beyond reasonable doubt.
48The relevant part of the summing up was:
""Although you do have three separate complainants, and as I have said you do have to consider each count separately and independently, these trials involving the three separate complainants are being held together because the Crown alleges that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way.  That is that he had a tendency to sexually exploit patients under the guise of conducting legitimate Chinese medicine techniques.  That is that the accused had a tendency to use the female patients for his own sexual needs.  In addition the Crown alleges that the accused had a tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely to obtain sexual gratification in touching the complainants in the manner that they alleged that he did.  By proving that the accused had this state of mind and was willing to act on it, the Crown argues that you will find it more likely that he committed the other counts in the indictment.  In other words, if you are satisfied of two things which I will take you to in a moment, you can use this tendency evidence across the indictment in respect of all five counts.  
The evidence of the accused having this tendency, that is to sexually exploit patients in this way, can only be used by you in the way the Crown seeks you to use it if you make two findings beyond reasonable doubt.  The first finding is that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at least one of the counts has been proved.  You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of these counts on the indictment has been proved.  If you do not find any of the counts on the indictment has been proved beyond reasonable doubt you put aside any suggestion by the Crown that the accused had this tendency to sexually exploit patients in this way.  That is as a matter of logic.  Obviously if you do not find any counts proved beyond reasonable doubt, the accused is not guilty on every count and you would never get to the tendency evidence at all.  But if you do find beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of these counts did occur, then you would go on to consider the second finding.
You ask yourselves whether from that count or those counts that you have found proved beyond reasonable doubt whether you can also conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had this tendency to sexually exploit patients in this way.  If you cannot draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt then again you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had such a tendency.  But if you find one or more of the counts to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and if you conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had this tendency to sexually exploit the patients then you can use that in considering whether the accused committed the other offences charged.  In other words, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had this tendency to sexually exploit the patients, that evidence can be used by you when you are deciding whether the accused committed the other counts in the indictment.  You may use the tendency evidence where proved beyond reasonable doubt as a step in the proof of the prosecution case.  You are entitled, should you think it appropriate, to use that evidence in support of the other charges on the indictment involving other complainants.""  (SU 32.5 - 34.1)
49In the course of summing up the defence case, her Honour said:
""Mr Lavac argued of course that you will never get to this tendency reasoning because you will not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any count on the indictment.  And before you can get to the tendency reasoning as I said to you, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one of these counts did take place.  As I said for that reason Mr Lavac suggested you never get to that position.  In other words, your verdict would be not guilty on each count.""  (SU 35.2)
50The facts of this case and the findings of the jury are quite different to those in Zaidi.  Here the jury clearly considered each complainant separately, as directed by her Honour, hence the initial finding of guilty in respect of counts 1 and 2 and not guilty in respect of count 5.  A reasonable inference is that the delay in relation to the receipt of verdicts for counts 3 and 4, occurred because the jury were considering the consequences for counts 3 and 4 of the finding of guilt in respect of counts 1 and 2.  Accordingly, to the extent that tendency evidence played any part in this trial, it was in respect of counts 3 and 4.
51The findings of the jury were consistent and in accordance with the evidence.  In relation to counts 1 and 2, there was immediate complaint, action taken as a result of the complaint and consistency in the content of the complaint between 1994 and the date of trial.  The Crown case in relation to SB was very strong.  The delay was not due to any conduct or hesitation on the part of SB.
52By way of contrast, there were discrepancies in the Crown case in relation to HL with a real possibility that the brushing of the breast was due to inadvertence rather than deliberate conduct on the part of the appellant.
53In relation to counts 3 and 4, there were glaring inconsistencies in the evidence of CS.  A particular example was her evidence of screaming out when acupuncture was applied, which was not supported by her friend, by Ms Gao, nor by Mr Sutton.  Even the finding of guilt in respect of counts 1 and 2 and the availability of tendency evidence arising therefrom was not sufficient to overcome the problems in the Crown case with respect to counts 3 and 4.
54There is no reason to surmise, as the appellant does, that the jury did not follow the directions of her Honour in the summing up.  On the contrary, the sequence of events is strongly suggestive that it did.  The clear rejection by the jury of the Crown case in respect of counts 3, 4 and 5 and its inherent weakness makes it likely that it had little regard to that evidence when considering counts 1 and 2.
55This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2:  Failure to direct the jury on ""for proper medical purposes"".
Ground 3:  Failure to admit evidence of the qualifications and area of study relevant to the issue of whether penetration was carried out other than for proper medical purposes.
56The relevant sections of the Crimes Act in 1994 were as follows:
""61H(1)  For the purposes of this Division, sexual intercourse means:
(a) sexual connection occasioned by the penetration to any extent of the genitalia (including a surgically constructed vagina) of a female person or the anus of any person by:
 (i) Any part of the body of another person, or
(ii) Any object manipulated by another person, 
except where the penetration is carried out for proper medical purposes ...""
""61R(2)  For the purposes of sections 61I, 61J and 61JA and without limiting the grounds on which it may be established that consent to sexual intercourse is vitiated ...
(a1) A person who consents to sexual intercourse with another person under mistaken belief that the sexual intercourse is for medical or hygienic purposes is taken not to consent to sexual intercourse ...""
57By way of further background, after her Honour had completed her summing up, a note was received from one of the jurors.  It was marked for identification 55 and was in the following form:
""My continuum (revisited): 

The accused did the alleged deeds with sexual intent and no warning to the clientThe accused did the alleged deeds with clinical/diagnostic intent and no warning to the clientThere is reasonable doubt that the accused did the alleged deeds at allAre we to understand that the law views these two scenarios identically. Both are called sexual intercourse and act of indecency and it would be irrelevant for us to make this dichotomy?
The judge did not answer my question directly. She said that she would do so, if I wasn't satisfied that I had received an answer by the close of her 'summing up'. 
After her summing up, I came away with the impression that the answer to the question, that the law views these two scenarios identically - both are called sexual intercourse and act of indecency and it would be irrelevant for us to make this dichotomy was, 'that's right'.
I now want to ask the judge clearly for this direction.
If I believe that the accused put his finger into Claimant 1's vagina twice without consent with clinical/diagnostic intent rather than sexual intent, I must still return a guilty verdict. Is that correct Your Honour?""
58Her Honour discussed the matter with both counsel.  With their consent she answered the question raised as follows:
""Members of the jury I have had a note and I am not sure whether all of you have read the note or not, but I propose to answer the question set out in the note.  I apologise if I did not answer it directly during the summing up but I will attempt to do so now.
The first scenario on the continuum is that the accused did the alleged deeds with sexual intent and no warning to the client, the middle scenario is that the accused did the alleged deeds with clinical diagnostic intent and no warning to the client, and the third scenario is that there is reasonable doubt that the accused did the alleged deeds at all.
I just want to deal firstly with the middle scenario.  As a matter of law, if a person inserted his finger into a woman's vagina for proper medical purposes, then that is not sexual intercourse.  However, I did not include that in the definition section at the bottom of the page for you, because that issue simply does not arise in the circumstances of this trial.  That is, as you are well aware, the Crown case is that the accused did insert his finger or fingers into SB's vagina, the subject of counts 1 and 2 and the accused's case is that he did no such thing.  There is absolutely no room for the middle scenario:  that the accused did insert his finger or fingers into SB's vagina, but he did so with clinical or diagnostic intent.  There is no evidence of that whatsoever.
The Crown does not have to prove what the accused's intent was, and I remind you that the Crown does not have to prove that there was even a desire for sexual gratification.  If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did insert his finger or fingers into - his finger in the case of SB - into her vagina, then you would move to the second question in respect of those two counts.""  (SU 52 - 53)
59The appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed that ""sexual intercourse"" as an element of an offence under s61I required the Crown to prove that penetration was not carried out ""for proper medical purposes"".   The appellant submitted that her Honour erred when she directed the jury that the ""middle scenario"", i.e., clinical/diagnostic intent raised by the jury note (MFI 55), did not arise for consideration. 
60The appellant submitted that the issue did arise.  He based this submission on the evidence of SB at [27(b)] hereof.  He submitted that once the jury had rejected the appellant's sworn denial that he digitally penetrated SB, the following evidence had to be considered:
(a) SB attended the clinic of the appellant, who was a practitioner in traditional Chinese medicine for treatment regarding a pre-existing skin condition.
(b) During his treatment of her by acupressure, without warning he put his finger in her vagina.
(c) He withdrew his finger and smelt it and commented that SB had a thrush infection.
(d) SB did in fact have a thrush infection.
(e) The appellant then inserted his finger in her vagina a second time and withdrew it and looked at the fluid/discharge on his finger.
(f) The appellant commented that he was worried about her continued treatment as he was aware she was going overseas and told her that he was worried about her as he knew (because she had told him) that it was the last time that she was visiting him.  He wanted her to take herbs with her overseas. 
(g) The digital penetration was for a few seconds at a time.  
61The appellant submitted that by reference to that evidence, there was an overwhelming inference available that the appellant was conducting an examination of the fluids found in SB's vagina and attempting to deduce from sight and smell what the problem was for therapeutic purposes.  The appellant submitted that this was a reasonable possibility arising from the evidence adduced in the Crown case, i.e. that such an examination was carried out for proper medical purposes.  The appellant submitted that this remained a live question in the proceedings.  
62The appellant submitted that the error by her Honour was to relieve the Crown from its onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that, if the jury had accepted the evidence of SB that she had been digitally penetrated, the appellant did the act otherwise than for proper medical purposes, i.e., the Crown had to negative that proposition.  It had failed to do so and therefore had failed to make out its case against him.
63The appellant relied upon the statements of principle in R v Forsti [2010] ACTSC 85 per Gray J when considering an identically worded provision being s92(b) Crimes Act (ACT):
""82  However, there is a more fundamental aspect of the charges in counts four and five that the prosecution has failed to make out even if the complainant's evidence as to the event occurring is accepted. The definition of sexual intercourse, as I have earlier noted, contains the exception of penetration carried out for a proper medical purpose. Although expressed as an exception, it remains the fact that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's intention in performing the act of penetration was to do so other than for a proper medical purpose. 
...
84  Suspicion or the possibility that the accused had an ulterior motive is, in my view, not sufficient to discharge the onus on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended an act of penetration other than for a proper medical purpose.""
64He also relied upon R v Zaidi  where Priestley JA (with whom Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ agreed) said at 209:
""The whole of the exception as stated in section 61I(i) is clearly directed to the purpose with which the penetration is carried out by the penetrator; if that purpose is a proper medical one, then the exception applies.  It follows that in cases where the question arises, the Crown must prove as one of the ingredients in the charge that the subjective purpose of the penetrator was not a proper medical one.  That is an essential ingredient for the Crown to prove, although it need not prove anything more and although proof will sometimes consist of inferences to be drawn from the external actions of the penetrator.  Frequently, it will only be from those external actions (including whatever is said) that the subjective purpose will be able to be inferred, one way or the other.
I do not see from the materials in the appeal papers that it was ever clearly brought to the jury's attention that for them to find the appellant guilty of the sexual intercourse charges, it was necessary for them to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not have, subjectively, a proper medical purpose in penetrating the patients in his examinations of them.
It may well be that had the necessary direction been given to the jury they could have been directed, as they were in regard to consent, that in approaching the factual questions they had to consider in dealing with this ingredient of the charge, there would be little difficulty, in light of the way the case was conducted, in finding the ingredient proved.
...""
65In support of this submission, the appellant further relied upon Pemble v R [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 where at 117 - 118 Barwick CJ said:
""...  Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interests of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part.""
The appellant relied upon the observations of Menzies J at 132-133 and Owen J at 141 in that case.
66The appellant submitted that there was no evidence in the Crown case regarding the scope and nature of traditional Chinese medicine, nor was the appellant cross-examined as to his purpose for digitally penetrating SB.  The appellant submitted that in the circumstances of this case, her Honour had failed to direct the jury on an essential element of the offence under s61I, namely that ""sexual intercourse"" fell within the chapeau of s61H(1)(a) and that it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that penetration was carried out otherwise than for proper medical purposes.
67By reference to Pemble, the appellant submitted that her Honour was not relieved of the obligation to give that direction by the stance of the Crown Prosecutor and/or trial counsel for the appellant.  The appellant submitted that the fact that the appellant denied that the digital penetration took place did not of and by itself, relieve her Honour of the obligation to direct the jury on a matter of basic importance.  The appellant submitted that the note from the juror (MFI 55) highlighted that there was some discussion of this subject in the jury room and of itself, warranted a direction.  The appellant submitted that even leaving aside MFI 55, Zaidi required that such a direction be given as a matter of law.
68The appellant submitted that even though the point was not taken at trial, because an important issue of law was involved, leave should be given pursuant to rule 4.
69With respect to Ground 3, both as a separate ground of appeal and in support of Ground 2, the appellant submitted that her Honour erred in rejecting the evidence tendered on behalf of the appellant regarding his qualifications from China on the basis that such evidence was irrelevant.  The appellant submitted that such evidence went to an issue for determination by the jury, i.e., whether the penetration was for a proper medical purpose.
70The appellant submitted that the erroneous rejection of this evidence deprived the jury of relevant and probative evidence on an issue which was subsequently canvassed by the question from one of the jurors (MFI 55).
71It is convenient to deal with Ground 3 first.  The issue of documentation regarding the appellant's Chinese qualifications first arose in the course of the tender of MFI 31 (which subsequently became Exhibit 8).  After argument, the tender of that document was allowed.  Exhibit 8 comprised a list of courses said to have been undertaken by the appellant at the Sun Yat-Sen University during the period 1975 - 1978.
72The documents which were rejected, and to which Ground of Appeal 3 relates, were MFI's 33 and 34.  MFI 33 comprised one page of Chinese script and one page of an English translation.  It purported to relate to a course the appellant did in 1972 and 1974 in acupuncture.  In relation to that document, the following exchange took place between counsel for the appellant and her Honour:
""HER HONOUR:  How does MFI 33 which purports to be translated to read that he did a course between 72 and 74 in acupuncture, explain to the jury why he has the letters MBBS on a card.
LAVAC:  Well he's also done a course in China in acupuncture your Honour.
HER HONOUR:  So what?
LAVAC:  Well why then would my friend object to that document?
HER HONOUR:  Well there are a number of bases to the objection, the first is that the Crown isn't in any position to make a concession as to the accuracy of the translation because he hasn't seen it before today and he hasn't had any expert look at it.  That's the first basis.  How are you going to deal with that?
LAVAC:  I can't call any expert beyond what we've got in this document your Honour.
HER HONOUR:  Then I reject the tender of MFI 33.  It doesn't seem to me to be relevant in any way to the issues in the trial ...""
73MFI 34 comprised an A3 document (in Chinese) and an English translation, dated 2 April 1990, which set out a list of ""subjects"" and ""final assessments"" in respect of the Zhong Shan Medical School.  It turned out (at T.527) that the ""Zhong Shan Medical School"" had subsequently been renamed the Sun Yat-Sen University.  Many of the subjects listed on MFI 34 were included in Exhibit 8.
74Accordingly, there was before the jury a list of subjects which the appellant had completed to University level in China.  It was never made clear to what extent, if at all, the contents of MFI 33 and 34 would have added to that information.  Moreover, in re-examination the appellant gave evidence without objection to the following effect:
He had studied for two years in China to qualify for ""that diploma"" in Chinese medicine and acupuncture.
He had studied for 10 months in ""the Chinese Medicine Hospital"".
He had studied for another 3.5 years in the Zhong San Medical Institute.
He had studied for another 3 years for ""a Masters Degree"" in acupuncture (T.661).
75Because the defence were not in a position to properly prove the contents of MFI 33 and 34, and did not subsequently attempt to rectify that deficiency, the documents were properly rejected by her Honour.  As her Honour also pointed out, their relevance was problematic.  To the extent that the defence required some evidence as to the qualifications of the appellant, and his capacity to administer Chinese medical techniques to patients, that evidence was available from Exhibit 8 and from his oral evidence.  
76In any event, her Honour did not finally reject the tender of MFIs 33 and 34 but deferred making a ruling.  Accordingly, it was not incumbent upon her Honour to return to the documents (Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 at [28] - [29]).  If the appellant's counsel wished to press their tender then it was up to him to do so, not the trial judge.  Even if MFIs 33 and 34 had been admitted, it is difficult to see how they were relevant to the issue raised in Ground 2.
77Ground of Appeal 3 has not been made out.
78The need for her Honour to give the sort of direction sought by the appellant with respect to ""proper medical purpose"" would only arise if the issue was before the jury, i.e., if the issue were raised by the evidence.  This was recognised by Priestley JA in Zaidi in the passage relied on by the appellant when he said:
""It follows that in cases where the question arises, the Crown must prove as one of the ingredients in the charge that the subjective purpose of the penetrator was not a proper medical one.""  (Emphasis added)
In this case this issue was not raised, either by the Crown or the appellant.  On the contrary, on a number of occasions counsel for the appellant disclaimed any reliance upon it.
79It was not for the Crown to adduce evidence concerning the scope and nature of the practice of traditional Chinese medicine, nor to cross-examine the appellant as to his ""purpose"" for inserting his finger into SB's vagina.  Not only was there no evidence to this effect, but there was no suggestion at any time in the trial that conduct of this kind formed part of traditional Chinese medicine.
80This is to be contrasted with the facts in Zaidi, where the issue was fairly and squarely raised because one of the complainants attended the medical practitioner because of a vaginal discharge.  As a result, in that case, there was a live issue as to whether the vaginal penetration by the medical practitioner was or was not for a ""proper medical purpose"".
81In this case, SB attended the appellant complaining of a rash on her arms and lips.  The appellant inserted his ungloved finger into her vagina without warning, or obtaining consent, not once but twice, firstly smelling his finger and then examining the discharge on it.  The fact that SB commented ""Yes I have some thrush"" gave no support to a submission that the examination was done by way of ""proper medical purpose"".  SB was not there for that reason.  She had never asked the appellant to investigate anything to do with her vagina.  There was no evidence that acupressure for a skin rash involved vaginal penetration.  There was no evidence of any medical connection between treatment for a skin rash and the appellant digitally penetrating her vagina.
82The fact that one of the jurors asked a question relating to this issue is interesting, but does not of itself establish that the question of ""proper medical purpose"" arose as a genuine issue in the proceedings.  This is to be assessed by an objective analysis of the evidence.  As the appellant conceded, the only evidence on the issue came from SB when she described the incident ([27(h)] hereof).  In the absence of other evidence, that description could not be found to give rise to the issue.
83Pemble does not assist the appellant's submission.  As was stated by the Court in Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223 (Whealy JA, James and Hoeben JJ):
""25 The expression ""a viable case of manslaughter to be left to the jury"" (as stated by Gleeson CJ and Callinan J) is a useful shorthand expression expressing the correct approach to be taken. Similarly, the question is often asked ""was manslaughter open to be left"".  That too is a useful shorthand manner of approaching the issue. While we consider that the correct position is more akin to that urged by the Crown on the present appeal, namely whether a verdict of manslaughter was ""reasonably open"" on the evidence, we would prefer to state the proper approach (based on Hayne J's statement) in the following terms:

""A viable case of manslaughter means that it was open on the evidence led at trial for the jury to conclude that the appellant was not guilty of murder but was guilty of the alternative charge of manslaughter.""""
(The quotations are from Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1.)
84The facts in Pemble provide a good illustration of the principle.  There the defence had eschewed any reliance on manslaughter.  The proposition put to the jury was murder or nothing.  However, the case put by the Crown to establish murder, clearly allowed a finding of manslaughter as an alternative so that it was necessary in the interests of justice for that to be explained to the jury.  Such is not the case here.  In the words of Carney & Cambey a viable case giving rise to a ""proper medical purpose"" was not open on the evidence led at trial.  
85If I am incorrect in that conclusion, after carrying out my own independent assessment of the evidence and making due allowance for the natural limitations that exist in an appellate jurisdiction, I am satisfied that the appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt to have committed the offences upon which he was convicted (Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300).  Accordingly, if necessary, I would apply the proviso under s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
86The question whether no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred is to be answered having regard to all the circumstances of the trial, including the strength of the prosecution case and the relative merits of the defence case.  In my opinion, the Crown case in relation to SB was more than cogent, it was compelling.  In particular, there was immediate complaint, corroboration and action taken pursuant to that complaint.  Over the years there was consistency in her reporting of what occurred.  
87It follows that Ground of Appeal 2 has not been made out.  If I am incorrect in that assessment, I would still reject Ground 2 in reliance upon the proviso.
Ground 4:  The learned trial judge erred in the manner in which she directed the jury concerning the evidence of the appellant's ""good character"".
88Her Honour said the following concerning the appellant's good character:
""The accused has also called evidence to establish that he is a person of good character.  You will recall that there is evidence that he has no prior criminal conviction and witnesses such as Dr Maric, Ms Olivieri and other people have spoken highly of him, both in terms of his treatment of them and also more generally.  Essentially that evidence has not been challenged by the Crown.  In the light of that evidence, it is open to you, it is clearly open to you, to find that the accused is a person of good character.  The law provides that the accused is entitled to have you take that evidence into account in his favour in the following way.
The fact that the accused is a person of good character entitles you to consider the improbability of his having committed the offences alleged.  In other words, you are entitled to take his good character into account on the question of his guilt.  Secondly, the accused has given evidence in the trial.  The fact - if you find it to be a fact - that he is a person of good character supports his credibility.  It is a factor which he is entitled to have you take into account therefore when deciding whether you accept his evidence.""  (S/U 10 - 11)
No application for a redirection was made by defence counsel.
89The appellant submitted that her Honour inadequately directed the jury regarding his good character and that her direction to the jury was inappropriately curtailed, or limited, in scope.  The appellant submitted that the direction should have clearly stated that the appellant's good character meant that it was less likely that he would lie or give false evidence.  The appellant submitted that her Honour should have expressed the direction in more emphatic terms, i.e. that his good character should be taken into account.
90The appellant also submitted that her Honour should have given a direction in terms of the suggested Bench Book direction, i.e. ""You may reason that a person of good character is less likely to lie or give a false account .... in giving evidence before you ..."".
91The failure to give a direction in terms of that recommended in the Criminal Bench Book goes nowhere.  In Ith v R [2012] NSWCCA 70 McClellan CJ at CL (Adams and Hoeben JJ agreeing) said:
""47 The applicant complained that the trial judge failed to include an additional sentence from the model direction in the bench book in relation to identification evidence.  That sentence read as follows:
""You must give consideration to each of these matters.  Any one of those circumstances may possibly lead to error.""
To my mind, the submission is without merit.  This Court has previously commented on the fact that the Bench Book, although prepared with great care, should not be relied upon as a complete and authoritative statement of the law.  The fact that a trial judge does not direct in the precise terms provided by the Bench Book is not indicative of legal error.  It is necessary to consider the directions which were actually given at trial and determine, in the context of that trial, whether or not they were appropriate:  Hong v R [2009] NSWCCA 242.""
92The point taken by the appellant goes no further than to raise a matter of semantics.  In substance, her Honour did exactly what was required.  She pointed out that the evidence was all one way as to the appellant's good character and that being so, it supported the credibility of his evidence in the trial.  There was no miscarriage of justice arising from the manner in which her Honour directed the jury on the issue of the appellant's good character.
93This ground of appeal has not been made out.
94The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) I would dismiss Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2.(2) I would refuse leave to rely upon Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4.
95FULLERTON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the applicant should be refused leave to rely upon appeal Grounds 3 and 4, and with his Honour's reasons for so holding.  I also agree with his Honour that neither Ground 1 nor Ground 2 has been made out and, accordingly, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
96In so far as Ground 2 is concerned, and after considering the views of McCallum J, I wish to add my own reasons for concluding that, in the particular circumstances of this case, and in accordance with the principled approach most recently considered by this Court in Carney and Cambey, the trial judge was not obliged to direct the jury in the terms advanced by the appellant. 
97As I understand the appellant's submission, the trial judge's obligation to direct the jury that it was necessary for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the penetration of SB's vagina was not for a proper medical purpose arose as a result of the confluence of two factors.  The first related to the way the Crown ran its case at trial.  Counsel submitted that it was the Crown case that the appellant inserted his fingers into SB's vagina (and sexually or indecently assaulted the complainants the subject of counts 3, 4 and 5) under the guise of (or on the pretext of) providing treatment as a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine when, in fact, his intention, or purpose, was sexual gratification.  Counsel accepted that although the Crown is not obliged to prove sexual intent as a constituent element of an offence under s 61I of the Crimes Act, because it sought to prove the appellant's guilt on the basis that he used his practice in traditional Chinese medicine, and his relationship with SB as a client of his practice, to penetrate her vagina under the guise of proper medical treatment, the trial judge was obliged to direct the jury that they must be satisfied that if he did insert his fingers on repeated occasions there was no reasonable possibility that was a legitimate feature of that treatment.  
98Were there some evidence that the penetration of SB's vagina (presumably to detect whether she had thrush) either was, or might reasonably be open to be seen as, an incident of the treatment of her skin rash by a practitioner of Chinese medicine (irrespective of whether the rash was on the lips and arms as SB described in her evidence, or around her eyes and mouth as appears in the treatment records maintained by the appellant), the appellant's submission would carry some force.  However, aside from the fact that the appellant was conducting a practice in traditional Chinese medicine and that he had some qualifications in that field, counsel was unable to point to any direct evidence of that kind or any basis in the evidence for drawing any reasonable inference to that effect.  In addition, as counsel conceded in argument, the effect of the appellant's evidence at trial was that although he had no actual memory of treating SB he would not have digitally penetrated her vagina (or, it would seem, any client who presented at his clinic) since his treatment as a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine was restricted to acupuncture or acupressure, preceded by the application of creams under massage performed by his female assistant, and the provision of herbal remedies where indicated.  I note that by reference to his clinical records the appellant gave evidence that he provided SB with Chinese herbs and what he described as ""formulated pills"" to apply to her skin rash to address any residual itching after treating her with massage and acupuncture. 
99In my view, the mere fact that the appellant was a practitioner in Chinese medicine and that the penetrative acts occurred in his treatment rooms was not sufficient to raise a viable case that the penetration of SB's vagina was, or might have been, for a proper medical purpose in the absence of some evidence of a clinical connection (or possible clinical connection) between a skin rash and a vaginal infection for diagnostic or treatment purposes.  In both Forsti and Zaidi, cases relied upon by the appellant as authority for the obligation of a trial judge to direct a jury as to the need for the Crown to negative that the penetrative act relied upon as constituting sexual intercourse was for a proper medical purpose, the particulars relied upon by the Crown for proof of that charge included circumstances where the possibility of the treatment being a proper medical purpose was squarely raised.  
100The second factor relied upon as warranting a direction from the trial judge was SB's evidence set out in paragraph 27(h) of Hoeben CJ at CL's judgment.  In my view, on a proper interpretation of her evidence, it was simply a matter of coincidence that after inserting his finger into her vagina the appellant saw some evidence of the mild case of thrush she was aware she had at the time she sought treatment for her skin condition.  I am unable to see how it could be otherwise than coincidental since she did not complain of thrush and certainly did not seek any treatment from the appellant for it; the appellant did not raise it with her as a possible dimension to her skin complaint and it was her evidence that the appellant inserted his finger without warning and without her consent, conduct which is wholly inconsistent with a legitimate medical motive.  
101The Crown's submission on the appeal that the evidence called by the appellant from Ms Maric that because the appellant was not medically trained in the conventional sense he always recommended to her and her family members that their medical condition should be followed up by a specialist or general practitioner of Western medicine, and that no recommendation of that kind was given to SB, also served to discount the viability of the penetration of SB's vagina being for the diagnosis of a vaginal infection. 
102Despite the obvious import of the jury question (set out in at paragraph 57 of Hoeben CJ at CL's judgment) and the issue of ""clinical or diagnostic intent"" inherent in that question, again in the absence of evidence properly raising the issue, the trial judge's direction to the jury that it did not arise for their consideration was appropriate.
103McCALLUM J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL, for the reasons his Honour has stated.  As to ground 2, I agree with his Honour that this was not a case in which the question of proper medical purpose arose.  Indeed in my view the notion of there being a proper medical purpose for inserting a finger in SB's vagina when she presented for treatment of skin irritation around the eye and mouth (T582.35) is frankly ridiculous.  There was absolutely no evidence to warrant leaving a case to the jury on that basis.  The appellant gave a detailed account of the treatment he would have offered for the skin condition.  He did not suggest that per vaginal examination formed part of that treatment or assessment and he specifically denied inserting his finger in her vagina (T582-590).  In cross-examination he said that he did not remember much about SB but he maintained his denial that he had inserted his finger in her vagina (T655).  I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: Between 7 and 21 May 2012 the applicant was tried before Armitage DCJ and a jury on an indictment containing eight counts.

Count 4: Between 1 June and 30 December 1995 at Medlow Bath, the applicant had sexual intercourse with KJ without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that she was then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s61J(1) Crimes Act 1900.

Count 5: Between 1 January and 31 December 1996 at Wentworth Falls the applicant had sexual intercourse with KJ without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that she was then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s61J(1) Crimes Act 1900.

Count 6: Between 1 January and 31 December 1996 at Wentworth Falls the applicant attempted to have sexual intercourse with KJ without consent, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that she was then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s61J(1) Crimes Act 1900.

Count 7: Between 1 January and 31 December 1996 at Wentworth Falls the applicant indecently assaulted KJ then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 8: Between 1 January and 31 December 1996 at Wentworth Falls the applicant had sexual intercourse with KJ without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that she was then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

2On 18 May 2012 the jury returned verdicts of not guilty to counts 2, 3, 5 and 6 and guilty to count 8. On 21 May 2012 the jury returned verdicts of guilty to count 1, and not guilty to count 7. The jury could not reach a verdict on count 4, and the trial judge discharged the jury in relation to that count. The DPP decided not to further prosecute count 4.

3On 3 August 2012 Armitage DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment as follows:
Count 1: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years from 21 May 2012 to 20 May 2014.

Count 8: Imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 21 May 2013 and to expire 20 May 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years, to expire 20 May 2018.

The total effective sentence was imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.

4The applicant seeks leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence. His appeal in relation to conviction relies upon one ground.

Ground of Appeal 1: The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

5Because of the way in which the appeal was argued, it is necessary to set out the factual background to all of the counts, even though the applicant was acquitted of five of them and discharged in respect of count 4.

6The Crown case was that KJ was born in 1981. Her mother is JW, who was married to a man whom KJ regarded as her father. In about November 1993, JW fell pregnant to the applicant. JW left her husband and commenced to live with the applicant. At about the same time, KJ's older sister, LD, who was not living at home, also became pregnant.

7From about the middle of 1994 KJ, JW and the applicant, and later the baby, lived together in a house in Langford Street, Wentworth Falls. KJ turned 13 in June 1994. KJ's bedroom was in a detached garage. The baby girl was born on 18 August 1994. At about the same time, LD gave birth to a son. 

8There was an occasion when KJ and her mother went to buy marijuana from a street dealer. He did not have any of that substance, but sold them some acid drops, which were described in the evidence as ""microdots"". KJ, her mother and the applicant took the acid drops. KJ and her mother went for a walk and experienced the effects of the acid drops. KJ was laughing so much that she wet herself. She went into her bedroom in the garage to get changed and lie down. 

9It was the Crown case that the applicant came in and lay on the bed beside KJ. He exposed his penis and then put his hand inside her pants and rubbed her vagina (count 1). JW walked in when he had his penis in his hand and then stormed off. The applicant got off the bed and left the garage. He and JW argued. The next day KJ and her mother argued in the course of which she called KJ a slut. JW told KJ to leave. KJ went to live with her sister, LD, at Medlow Bath.

10On 7 September 1994 KJ made an application to the Department of Social Security (DSS) for the Young Persons' Homeless Allowance. In the application she said she left home on approximately 22 August 1994. The application was approved.

11KJ lived for a short time in a house in Taylors Road in Wentworth Falls with three other young persons. She said that the applicant brought a stereo over and told her that she could keep it if she kept her mouth shut. After a short time, KJ moved to another house. Her mother signed the lease. KJ would contact her mother on occasions, in order to get household items.

12KJ said that on one occasion the applicant brought over some pots and pans. He exposed his penis and put it on the kitchen bench and started to touch KJ's breasts (count 2). He then moved his hands onto the area of her vagina, and rubbed it (count 3).

13In about June 1995 KJ moved into a unit at Haveland Avenue in Blackheath. She said that on an occasion when she was living there, the applicant was driving her to her mother's house in Wentworth Falls when he pulled over to the side of the road at Medlow Bath. He pulled his penis out and asked her to suck it. He pulled her head down onto his penis and put it in her mouth (count 4).

14KJ moved in with her sister LD for a period of time. At the start of 1996 she moved in with her mother and the applicant at Bass Road, Wentworth Falls. KJ said that there was an occasion when she was in the shower and she called out to her mother for a towel. The applicant came into the bathroom with his penis exposed and a towel. He said that she could have the towel if she sucked his penis and then forced her mouth onto his penis (count 5).

15KJ spoke of occasions when the applicant would joke about his penis and expose it in the kitchen. JW would tell him to put it away.

16KJ alleged that on an occasion at Bass Road, the applicant grabbed her and pushed her into her mother's bedroom. He got on top of her and asked her to suck his penis and when she said ""no"", he hit her in the face with his penis (count 6).

17KJ said that on an occasion at Bass Road, the applicant came to her in the kitchen and put his hands down her pants and rubbed her vagina (count 7).

18On another occasion at Bass Road, KJ was in her bedroom, lying on her bed listening to music. The applicant came in and lay on her bed and exposed his penis. He put his hand down her pants and started rubbing her vagina. He penetrated her vagina digitally with his fingers. She told him to stop and he replied ""Gee it takes you a long time to get wet"" (count 8).

19After this event, KJ spoke to her mother and told her that the abuse from the applicant was getting worse. Her mother called her a liar and a slut and told her to leave.

20On 2 October 1996 KJ again applied for the Young Persons Living Away From Home Allowance. She told a social worker that she had left her mother's house on 29 September 1996. She said that her mother's boyfriend had made sexual moves and advances towards her. She said that her mother had been angry and had not believed her and that is the reason she left home.

21At various times KJ spoke to her sister, LD, about what the applicant had done to her. KJ made a formal complaint to the police in 2009. The applicant was interviewed by the police and denied all the allegations.

22KJ said that she had been given her first cone of marijuana when she was aged 8, but had not started using it regularly until she was aged 12. She said that as well as using marijuana when she was a teenager, she also used heroin and amphetamines. She started using heroin when she was aged 15 and used it for about 5 years. She said that she had been clean of any drugs since and she was now aged 30.

23In cross-examination she agreed that she had first complained to the police at the Mount Druitt Police Station in February 2009. She agreed that she had made a statement at Redcliff Police Station in Queensland but she was not sure of the date. She agreed that it could have been April 2009. She said that she had not included everything in that statement and felt that there was more to add, but she was emotionally exhausted. She said that after making that statement, she went to the DSS and obtained some documents, following which she made another statement to police at Springwood, but she could not recall the date. She signed a third statement a couple of months later at Windsor.

24KJ agreed that her drug taking had affected her memory as far as dates went, but she remembered everything else. She agreed that she had spoken to caseworkers at the DSS between 1994 and 1996 and thought that her recollection as to what she told the social workers then would be the same as at trial.

25KJ was not certain if JW's baby had been born or not on the night of the acid incident. She thought that it probably had been born because she did not think that her mother took drugs while pregnant. She agreed that the baby was born on 18 August. She agreed that the social worker's notes said that she had left home on approximately 22 August 1994. She said that she had not filled out the form but that she had signed it. As a 13 year old she thought she could have signed it without reading it. The Crown conceded that hospital records showed that her mother came home from hospital with the baby on 22 August 1994.

26KJ agreed that she was under the influence of drugs when count 1 occurred. The Crown conceded that the notes of a conference with a DPP female solicitor and male Crown prosecutor recorded her as saying ""Mum and RO walked outside, laying there feeling guilty, tripping out"" (T.95). She said that she moved out of home because she was kicked out, but agreed that she did not like the applicant. She agreed that she had told the social worker that she had just broken up with her boyfriend, her dog had been stolen and that she was having problems at school. She agreed that she had not told the social worker on that occasion (7 September 1994) about the applicant's sexual misconduct and her arguing with her mother about it.

27KJ agreed that there were discrepancies between what she had said in her statements and her evidence. In particular that she had not said anything in her Queensland statement about the applicant putting his penis on the bench, that in the Springwood statement she had said that in relation to count 7, he had put his hands on her vagina on the outside of her clothes and she had made no mention of the allegation of the applicant forcing her to have oral sex in the car at Medlow Bath in her Queensland statement. KJ said that various events and documents had jogged her memory so that she was confident that what she said in evidence at trial was more accurate than that which was recorded in some of the statements.

28LD, KJ's older sister, gave evidence. She confirmed that shortly after the applicant moved in, KJ was kicked out of home. LD was not living at home at the time and KJ came to stay with her on more than one occasion over the next 12 months, always for short periods of time.

29LD recalled one occasion when KJ told her that the applicant had been touching her on her private areas. KJ told her that this had taken place at Langford Street in Wentworth Falls. KJ told her that the applicant would give her a lift home to Falls Road and would make her pay, either by masturbation or making her masturbate him. She could not say when this conversation took place in terms of time, as she was only young and trying to deal with a new baby. 

30LD said that she had spoken to JW about these allegations and that JW had said that both of them were lying and that they just did not want her to be happy in her new relationship with the applicant.

31In cross-examination LD said that KJ had not told her whether the applicant was touching her inside or outside her pants, just that he was touching her. KJ had told her of the sexual misconduct of the applicant by August/September 1995 and she did not add any further allegations after that. KJ had since talked about them to her, but that was more recently. 

32Mr Habegger gave evidence that during the 1990's he ran a service station at Katoomba. The applicant worked there as an adult apprentice. One day he recalled the applicant saying to him ""You know you wouldn't believe it KJ asked me to make her a cup of coffee and I said 'yeah I'll make you a cup of coffee but you have to suck my dick' and guess what she did"". He estimated that this conversation occurred in about 1994.

33Under cross-examination he said that he had not made any notes about this conversation, but had dated it by going back to when he left the business. He said that he thought about going to the police but he was in the middle of a nasty divorce at the time. He confirmed that his wife had slept with the applicant, but said that he held no animosity towards him at the time of trial, even though he was very angry at the time.

34Anne Kocek was a senior social worker with the DSS. She had available to her records and reports concerning KJ for the years 1995 to 1997. She was the case worker assigned to this matter but had little independent recollection and needed to rely on her notes. She said that she met KJ on 14 November 1995 at the Katoomba office. It was to review the payment she was receiving of Special Benefit and Homeless rate of allowance. Her notes showed that KJ had been granted this allowance in September 1994 and that at the time, she was 13 years old.

35In the interview of 1995 KJ said that she was living in a flat on her own in Blackheath and that she was unable to return home due to tension between her and her mother's de facto. The interview recorded that ""she gets on with her mother and had contact with her but she is not allowed and does not want to return home"". Ms Kocek confirmed this with a conversation with KJ's mother. JW said that she was not going to provide financial assistance to KJ, but she had helped her set up her own flat.

36On 4 October 1996 another interview was conducted to allow KJ to claim the independent homeless rate. In a statement that was written by Ms Kocek, but in the words of KJ, she said that she was residing at Gardiner Street, Katoomba. She said that she had been living away from home for three years because she did not get on with her mother's boyfriend. She said that she was home for a week or two last month and that she was looking for another place to live and that it was horrible living there. She was not comfortable being around him and they argued a lot so she left on Sunday, 29 September 1996 because she would prefer to be on her own.

37In another document, dated the same date, under a heading ""Reasons for Leaving Home"" the following was recorded:

""According to K she only went home temporarily while she was finding another place to stay. The main reason she left is that she told her mother on a weekend that the mother's boyfriend had made ""sexual moves and advances"" towards her in the past. Apparently her mother had acted angrily and not believed her. K said she had left for this reason. K said that she'd only just begun disclosing sexual abuse and only did so because a close friend had encouraged her to tell her mother. She had been very hurt by mother's disbelief. K is now staying with a friend's mother, BA, at the above address in Katoomba. K then told me that the Monday night following her leaving home, the mother attempted suicide, was taken to hospital. K said she went up there to visit her mother but she refused to see her. K said that since then her mother will not talk to her."" (T.213)

38Ms Kocek said that she discussed accommodation options with KJ and confirmed that she could stay with BA for the time being. She did not feel it appropriate to contact the mother at this stage. Ms Kocek said that the earlier statement did not include allegations about the sexual moves and advances because firstly, the purpose of that report was focused on the eligibility for payment and also a lot of people see these statements and it was not appropriate to include a lot of detail which was not relevant. She confirmed that KJ had mentioned the sexual abuse but she had used her judgment and not included it in the handwritten statement. (T.214-215)

39JW gave evidence that she had four daughters. LD was the oldest and was a few years older than KJ. B was born in 1991 and J, her child to the applicant, was born 18 August 1994. Shortly after KJ was born, she married KJ's father. She first commenced a relationship with the applicant in 1993. She was then living at Cascade Street, Katoomba. After Cascade Street, they moved to Langford Street, Katoomba. This was before J's birth. KJ had a bedroom in the garage of the premises. 

40JW said that one night she, KJ and the applicant had taken a trip on a drug. She said she and KJ had gone into Katoomba to get drugs. KJ was 12 or 13 at the time. She said that later she was looking for the applicant as she did not know where he was. She passed KJ and asked where he was. KJ told her that he was in the garage, but that she should not go in there right now. She did go in and the applicant was on KJ's bed, lying on his back with an erection. She said to him ""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" She could not remember what he said but it erupted into a big fight and they yelled at each other. She could not remember what was said. She said that she could not remember talking to KJ about it.

41She could not remember what happened the next day but she rented a flat for KJ to live in. She did that because KJ was very independent and it was hard to keep the peace between the three of them. She thought that the flat was in Falls Road at Wentworth Falls.

42After Langford Street they moved to Bass Road. JW said that she ended up taking KJ back, but not straight away. She could not remember KJ visiting them at Langford Street or Bass Road, but she thought that she did because she ended up moving back. She thought that KJ lived with them for about 8 months, between about August 1995 and the middle of 1996.

43KJ left when they had an argument. KJ said to her ""I'm going to tell you something that's going to blow your world apart"". KJ said: ""It is the applicant, he is not as innocent as you think he is"" and ""If you don't believe me, ask LD"". She could not remember the exact confrontation with the applicant, but they had words and he ended up moving out. She could not remember what she said to him. JW said that she suffered from bad memory loss after a heart attack in 2002 and a stroke in 2009. 

44In cross-examination she was taken through statements she had made to the police, but could not remember the questions or answers which she gave.

45She was shown a statutory declaration that she had signed that declared that in the period of time that she had known the applicant, he had never displayed any signs of violence or sexually inappropriate behaviour. She agreed that she had signed the document, but said that she had lied when she did so. She said that she had lied in the document because she wanted to keep the lines of communication open between the applicant and J.

46The applicant's ERISP was played to the court. He said that KJ was 13 years old when he took up with her mother and was a ""pain in the ass"" because she would not go to school and was too busy taking drugs and alcohol.

47In the ERISP the applicant could not recall the acid drop incident. He did not have anything to say about the pots and pan allegation. He did not want to comment about the shower allegation. He denied placing his penis on the table. He denied the allegation in count 8 and the conversation.

48The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings. He said that on the night when they took LSD, KJ was sleeping in the garage. He denied lying on her bed and exposing his penis and rubbing her vagina. He thought that the night of the LSD was probably mid 1995 because KJ occupied the garage. He thought that she moved out a few weeks after that event.

49Under cross-examination he said that he could not remember JW accusing him of having sexual contact with KJ and denied that he had ever done so. He agreed that he occasionally gave KJ a lift in his ute, but denied that he had engaged in any sexual contact. He agreed that KJ had left home when she was aged 13, but said that this was a matter between KJ and her mother.

50He assumed that the night they took acid was in 1995 because it would have been irresponsible to take acid with a three day old baby in the house. He denied everything that KJ said about the acid drop night. He said that he could not remember why he and JW split up, but it was possible that it had occurred because she had accused him of sexual misconduct with KJ.

51It should be noted that there had been a previous trial of these counts, but the jury had been discharged because of an answer which KJ gave in cross-examination.

CONVICTION APPEAL

The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.

Applicable law

52In raising this ground of appeal, the applicant was relying upon s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). So far as relevant, that section provides:

""6(1) The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision on any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal ...""

53The relevant principles were discussed in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 where Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said:

""23 The case was one in which the jury's assessment of the three principal witnesses, the complainant, MA, and the appellant was vital. The alleged offences arose out of sexual activities between the appellant and boys of a much younger age. The activities were not brought to notice as a result of any complaint by the boys. When first approached by the police, they denied the activities. In court, they sought to explain this by fear and shame. Furthermore, in evaluating the effect of the evidence of MA, the jury were entitled to take account of his age at the time of the alleged events, and the possibility of some confusion on his part. None of this relieved the Court of Criminal Appeal of its responsibility in scrutinising the evidence, and making its own assessment of the reasonableness of the guilty verdicts. However, in making that assessment, the Court would properly have been conscious of the fact that there were aspects of the case that would not be reflected adequately in the written record.""

54At [26] those judges said:

""The test, as formulated in M, should not be confused with the question whether a trial judge ought to have directed a verdict of not guilty. This is made clear by the opening words of the above passage. The difference between the function of an appellate court in reviewing the totality of the evidence at a trial in order to determine whether a verdict of guilty was unreasonable, and the function of a trial judge in considering whether as a matter of law there is evidence on which an accused could be convicted, was explained in R v R, a decision which was approved by this Court in Doney v The Queen.""

55With relevance to the finding of the jury in this case, those judges said:

""34 Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.""

56The remaining members of that court (McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ) expressed themselves in similar terms:

""56 The majority in M pointed out that ""[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced"". In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 

""If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence."" ""

(The quotations referred to are from M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494.) 

57Those statements of principle were approved by the majority in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ):

""11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

...

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""

58In relation to count 1 (the acid drop incident), the applicant submitted that KJ's evidence was unreliable. Not only was she giving evidence of an incident which took place nearly 18 years earlier, but as she conceded, this was her first ""acid trip"", it affected her pretty quickly and she was feeling giddy and strange. She was so severely affected that she did not see or hear the applicant come in as she was ""out of [her] mind on acid"". KJ said that it ""happened all so quickly"" before JW walked in.

59The applicant submitted that count 1 was not supported by the evidence of JW. Her evidence directly contradicted that of KJ in that she said that she saw KJ outside the garage. JW expressly denied witnessing any sexual impropriety by the applicant. There was also the content of the statutory declaration (which JW subsequently asserted was a lie) to the effect that the applicant had never displayed any sexually inappropriate behaviour.

60The applicant submitted that there was a real doubt whether any offence in relation to the acid drop night took place on the dates specified in the indictment (21 August - 7 September 1994). He submitted that KJ was almost incapable of giving unassisted evidence as to dates and periods of time. The DSS records had the acid drop incident occurring on 21 August and KJ leaving home on 22 August. This was inconsistent with JW coming home with the baby on 22 August. KJ could not remember the baby when she was a few days old. The applicant submitted that the evidence of LD did not support the evidence of KJ as to dates.

61The applicant submitted that taking those three matters in combination, there had to be a real doubt that he was guilty of count 1. The applicant submitted that the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing KJ could not resolve the doubt which must exist in relation to count 1.

62The applicant made similar submissions in relation to count 8 (listening to music in bed). The applicant submitted that there were inconsistencies in the statements which KJ made concerning this incident and that the statements described an escalating level of seriousness. In the Queensland statement, KJ did not say that the applicant penetrated her vagina. She said that the applicant asked her for a ""hand job"" which she refused. In the Springwood statement, KJ did not mention the incident. It was not until her conference with the DPP solicitor and Crown Prosecutor in May 2011 that KJ for the first time, mentioned penetration.

63The applicant submitted that KJ's evidence of living at Bass Road, and thus providing the opportunity for the incident in count 8 to have taken place, was not satisfactory. KJ's evidence was that she was in and out of Bass Road, but she could not provide any details. JW was not able to provide any detail of when KJ lived at Bass Road. The evidence of KJ was that the incident in count 8 and the incidents which made up counts 5 - 7, took place over six months on and off and not within one to two weeks. KJ, however, was unable to say that she lived at Bass Road before about 15 September 1996 and said that she told JW about all the incidents on about 29 September 1996. The basis for this evidence was the DSS documents which showed that KJ provided information that she ""was at home for a week or two last month and she was looking for another place to live ... [She] left on Sunday, 29 September 1996"". DSS records showed that KJ was receiving the living away from home allowance until September 1996 when she started a job.

64The applicant submitted that these matters must cause the Court to have a doubt, which the jury should also have had, concerning his guilt.

65The applicant submitted that when one compared the jury's verdicts of guilty to counts 1 and 8, with its verdicts of not guilty to counts 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 and no verdict to count 4, the result was unreasonable and anomalous. 

66The applicant relied on other inconsistencies in KJ's evidence. In her evidence in relation to counts 2 and 3 (the pots and pans incident), KJ said that the applicant placed his penis on the bench, touched her breasts, put his hands inside her underpants and started to rub her vagina. In the Queensland statement, KJ did not mention the bench, nor that the applicant had touched her breasts or put his hands inside her underpants. In the Springwood statement, she did not mention that the applicant put his hands inside her underpants. In both statements, KJ said that the applicant's hands were on the outside of her clothes. Similarly, in relation to count 8, KJ had previously given a different less serious account of the incident. The applicant submitted that in those circumstances, it was unreasonable for the jury to find him not guilty of counts 2 and 3, but guilty of count 8.

67The applicant made a similar submission in relation to count 4 (the Medlow Bath driving incident). At trial, KJ gave evidence that the applicant told her to suck his penis or walk, and physically forced her to perform oral sex on him. KJ did not mention this incident in the Queensland statement. There was some evidence suggesting that during the time when this incident was said to have occurred, JW and the children were living at Kingscliff. Accordingly, KJ had no occasion to come in contact with the applicant in the Blue Mountains while JW was living in Kingscliff. There would have been no need to drive through Medlow Bath.

68The applicant submitted that the offences and lack of consent in relation to counts 5 and 6 were more clearly articulated than for count 8. In relation to count 8, the evidence of penetration had been added recently, whereas that had not occurred in relation to counts 5 and 6. Nevertheless, the jury found him not guilty of counts 5 and 6, but guilty of count 8.

69The applicant submitted that the evidence of LD was unreliable. There was no evidence, except from her, as to the applicant making KJ ""pay either by masturbation or making her masturbate him"". Although LD said that she was concerned by the allegations of KJ when she heard them, she did not report them to the police, remained friends with the applicant and even invited him to her wedding in 2007.

Consideration

70The counts on the indictment related to distinct incidents. The only occasion when one incident gave rise to more than one count was the ""pots and pans"" incident, which gave rise to counts 2 and 3 upon which the applicant was acquitted. Because count 1 (acid trip) and count 8 (listening to music) each arose out of a distinct incident, the different verdicts do not give rise to any immediate concern that one count in an incident had been accepted, but another count arising from the same incident had not been.

71There was no issue that KJ had a poor recollection for dates. In relation to counts 1 and 8, however, the time periods set out on the indictment were established by reference to evidence from sources other than the recollection of KJ. Accordingly, her imprecision as to dates is not decisive. 

72The dates for count 1 were set by reference to the birth of JW's baby, and the date on which she brought the baby home, namely 22 August 1994, as the start date. The end date was set by reference to the date of the application by KJ for the Living Away From Home allowance, i.e. 7 September 1994. The fact of an incident involving the acid trip was confirmed by the applicant, although he placed it much later in time. He was not, however, able to point to any external reference point to confirm that date, but relied upon an assumption that JW would not take an acid trip shortly after having given birth. Some doubt must arise in relation to that assumption, given that JW was a person who had introduced KJ at the age of 8 to cannabis and took acid in her company when she was aged 13. 

73Perhaps the most compelling confirmation of the dates for count 1 is the coincidence in time of KJ's description of the offence, her mother's reaction to it and her ejectment from the family home. The departure of a 13 year old girl from the family home without support is a sufficiently unusual event to allow an inference that some special incident had occurred to bring that departure about.

74The offence in count 8 is said to have happened when KJ was living at Bass Road in the period between 1 January to 31 December 1996. KJ, JW and the applicant all agree that in 1996 they were living at a house in Bass Road. There was evidence from the DSS records that KJ made an application and complaint about the applicant's sexual misconduct in October of that year. Although it was not clear how long KJ had lived there, the evidence did establish that she was there for a period, at least until 4 October 1996. The time period was again set by reference to evidence, other than the recollection of KJ. Accordingly, it was well open to the jury in relation to both count 1 and count 8, to find that there was an opportunity for the applicant to commit the offences between the specified dates.

75It is not without significance that counts 1 and 8 are the only counts where there was independent evidence as to dates and events, which assisted in giving the offences a temporal context. Such evidence was lacking in relation to the other counts.

76An important part of the applicant's challenge to count 1 was the state of sobriety of KJ. The fact that she was under the influence of LSD at the time does not mean that her evidence should be rejected. Her description of the offence is at T.12 - 15. She described the effect on her as ""a buzzy feeling"". After she had returned to her room and got changed, she ""laid down because I was feeling dizzy and strange"". KJ was able to provide considerable detail as to what happened. When asked under cross-examination whether she was hallucinating, she said that she was not: ""It was more like a buzzing, dizzy sensation"" (T.93.42, T.94.40).

77The question of the reliability of the evidence of KJ, in relation to count 1, was fundamentally a jury question. This is one of those areas where the jury's assessment of KJ was vital and where the jury was in a better position than an appellate court. Neither in chief nor in cross-examination did KJ demonstrate that her memory of count 1 was deficient. There was no evidence that KJ had given inconsistent versions of count 1. There was nothing in her evidence which was incapable of belief or otherwise indicative of a drug induced hallucination.

78Whatever reservations the jury may have had as to the evidence of KJ concerning count 1, that did not apply with respect to count 8. There was no evidence that she was under the influence of any drug at the time. There was no deficit in detail and nothing to indicate that her memory was deficient in any way. While KJ had given different versions of the offence in count 8, there was some confirmation of such an offence by reason of the complaint made to Ms Kocek in October 2006. The jury was well placed to assess the inconsistencies and those inconsistencies did not compel the conclusion that a verdict of guilty on that count was unreasonable or such as could not be supported by the evidence 

79There was some support for KJ's evidence concerning count 1 from JW. The applicant was found by JW to be lying on KJ's bed with an erection. This was after KJ had warned her not to go into the room. JW's reaction is also significant: ""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"". While the detail does not match the evidence of KJ, the overall circumstances support the proposition that something of a sexual nature took place between the applicant and KJ at the time which upset JW.

80The strongest support for KJ's evidence concerning counts 1 and 8 comes from Ms Kocek and the DSS notes. They confirm that she had been granted a Living Away From Home allowance in September 1994 when she was 13. In November 1995 she told Ms Kocek that she was unable to return home due to tension between her and her mother's de facto, and that she was not allowed and did not want to return home. In the October 1996 interview, she is recorded as saying that she was home for a week or two in the last month, but it was horrible living there. KJ was not comfortable being around him and they argued a lot so she left on Sunday, 29 September 1996 because she would prefer to be on her own (T.212). The other document headed ""Reasons for Leaving Home"" recorded her first complaint about the applicant making ""sexual moves and advances"" towards her. It also, consistent with her testimony, recorded her mother's refusal to believe her complaint about the applicant.

81The applicant's challenge to the offence in count 8 was based on inconsistencies between statements which KJ had made to the police and her evidence at trial. The applicant submitted that KJ had embellished her descriptions of what had occurred over time so as to make the offence more serious.

82When the evidence is examined, the discrepancy is not as marked as has been submitted. There is no argument that KJ had mentioned the incident in a statement she made in Queensland (T.125) but had not mentioned it again in a later statement she made at Springwood. When this was put to her KJ said that the Springwood statement was only made to clarify dates and times.

""Q. Have you been attempting to make the allegation more serious by adding details such as that he penetrated your vagina?
A. I've been attempting to get the truth out and to move on.

Q. And to not worry about less serious allegations like him asking you to give him a hand job?
A. I don't understand.

Q. I'm saying to you have you substituted a more serious allegation that he penetrated your vagina for a less serious one that he asked you to give him a hand job?
A. No, I don't know, I don't have a legal background, I don't know what the difference is between the two. I've spoken the truth. It's taken a long time to be able to get it out.

Q. Ms J would you agree that penetrating your vagina with his fingers is more significant than asking you to give him a hand job?
A. I think they're both just absolutely disgusting."" (T.127.11)

83The Crown clarified what in fact had been said by KJ in her Windsor statement concerning the event:

""Q. In your Windsor statement do you say this, ""In my Queensland statement at paragraph 84 I refer to an incident with RO in my bedroom at Bass Road, Wentworth Falls. When I say that RO was rubbing my vagina for a long time, he actually penetrated my vagina digitally with his fingers, while he masturbated his penis with his other hand. My vagina was fairly dry and his actions were causing me pain as he penetrated me with his fingers."" (T.185.26)

84Accordingly the suggested material inconsistency and attempt to exaggerate was not as marked or significant as was put in the applicant's submission. By way of contrast, there were material inconsistencies in relation to the allegations with respect to the subject matter of counts 2, 3 and count 4. What the jury seems to have done is to look for corroborating detail in relation to the counts before them and where such detail was lacking, they were not prepared to find guilt. Their approach appears to be similar to that described and implicitly approved by Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA at [34] (see [55] hereof).

85In relation to counts 1 and 8, there was a coherent body of evidence upon which it was open to the jury to convict. The evidentiary problems that emerged in relation to other counts did not exist in relation to counts 1 and 8. Most particularly, there was the confirmatory evidence of the DSS notes as to dates and in relation to count 8, as to actual complaint. There was also the confirmatory detail relating to the birth of J, that an acid drop event did take place and that KJ did leave home at the age of 13 in August 1994. The findings of guilt in relation to counts 1 and 8 are readily explained because there was more and better evidence in relation to them than in relation to the other counts.

86Not only was it well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had committed the offences in counts 1 and 8, but having examined the evidence for myself, I am also satisfied to that standard that the applicant was correctly found to be guilty of those offences. Ground of Appeal 1 should be dismissed.

SENTENCE APPEAL
Proceedings before sentencing judge

87In the sentencing proceedings, the following evidence was placed before his Honour. A custodial history of the offender, a victim impact statement from KJ dated 20 June 2012, a pre-sentence report of Gavin Moore, dated 18 June 2008, a report of Dr Andrew Robertson, dated 26 April 2008, two reports of a psychologist, Ms Young, dated 17 June 2008 and 1 August 2012. The defence material on sentence included affidavits from Ms Willoughby and Ms Hicks. The applicant's brother gave evidence.

88His Honour set out the history of the offending and then said:

""It is sufficient to say at this point that of course I shall sentence in accordance with the facts I have found on sentence and not on any other facts, whether contained in histories given by the offender to various people or in the victim impact statement.

Having said that, the victim impact statement depicts a young woman who, though damaged in a number of respects as a result of her life generally and in particular, as a result of what I can only describe as inconsiderate and irresponsible treatment by her mother, who should have known better, has suffered greatly as a result of the offender's offending against her. It has contributed, I am satisfied, along with many other events, to her current distress which, according to her statement, has resulted in a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder.

I do not have any psychiatric evidence on that subject, so I cannot verify that diagnosis, although I accept that the victim has been told by doctors that that is her diagnosis, and I cannot make any finding, unguided by expert evidence, as to the exact causation of her post traumatic stress disorder, although it defies common sense to suppose that it has not been contributed to in some way by the offender's offending. The degree to which that has occurred is something I cannot determine without expert evidence.

... (ROS 6)

It may be that she would have been kicked out by her mother anyway for some other reason, but this was in fact the operative reason why she was kicked out by the mother on the occurrence of the first and second offences after she complained of them. That contributed significantly to the ongoing damage of which she now complains in her victim impact statement. 

I think it is possible to say that the victim has suffered significant psychological damage as a result of the offences, despite counsel's submission to the contrary."" (ROS 17)

89Without analysing in detail his Honour's reasons, his Honour made the following findings:

(i) The sentences were to be in accordance with the sentencing regime existing in 1994 and 1996.

(ii) The sentences were to be backdated to 21 May 2012, the day the applicant went into custody.

(iii) The applicant had one prior offence of offensive conduct in 1989 and so he was to be regarded as a person of good character.

(iv) Since these offences, the applicant had committed two offences of indecent assault on a person under 16.

(v) The maximum penalties are a clear indication of the great seriousness with which the offending is to be regarded. In relation to the more recent offences, reports show that the applicant indicated that he did not need treatment as he did not see that he had a problem.

(vi) The applicant was the youngest of three siblings. He was adopted at 8 months and had a supportive and stable upbringing. Both his adoptive parents were dead. He had occasional contact with his biological mother. After leaving school, he completed an apprenticeship in automotive light vehicles and has since qualified in automotive radiator repair and was a liquefied petroleum gas mechanic. He had been employed for five years with an auto repair business in Lithgow at the time of his arrest. He was regarded as a valuable employee and there was work for him when released from custody.

(vii) In 1997 after the relationship with JW had broken up, he entered another significant relationship with a woman who had three daughters and a son. He committed the two recent offences on his stepdaughters during this time. 

(viii) Since separating from this partner in 2008, he has lived with a friend and has not posed any problems.

(ix) He entered a new relationship in 2011. There were young children present in this relationship. The report of the psychologist, Ms Young, of 1 August 2012 concluded that he constituted a low risk of re-offending in relation to other male offenders but in terms of ""dynamic"" risk, there was a moderate risk of him re-offending.

(x) The pre-sentence reports and medical reports indicated that he was in denial and that during previous supervision, his response was superficial. 

(xi) The first offence (count 1) was in the middle of the range of seriousness for offences of this kind. The second offence (count 8) was in the middle of the range of seriousness but ""I prefer not to set either offence in a precise position on a range because of the danger of adopting a two step process in sentencing which was stigmatised in Muldrock v R (ROS 15, 19).

(xii) The vulnerability of the victim was not an aggravating factor under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ROS 15) but the Crown submission that the victim was entirely vulnerable is correct. The defence submission that the victim was not vulnerable in relation to the second offence because she had a boyfriend, lived away from home, had a job and interacted with the DSS was not accepted. (ROS 16)

(xiii) The harm suffered by the victim was substantial and an aggravating feature under s21A(2)(g) of the Act (ROS 20).

(xiv) The fact that the applicant was not arrested until 2009 because the victim kept the offences hidden was not a mitigating factor (ROS 18).

(xv) Special circumstances were found because this would be the first time in custody and he needed a longer than usual period of supervision on parole. (ROS 18)

Ground 2: Armitage DCJ erred in finding that the harm suffered by KJ was substantial and an aggravating factor pursuant to s21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, ""the Act"".

90The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in concluding that KJ had ""suffered significant psychological damage as a result of the offences"". There was simply no evidence to distinguish the effect of these offences on her from the other major adverse influences in her life, including her disturbed family life and drug abuse. It was not open to his Honour to accept KJ's assertions as to the effect of the offences on her since this would have involved some kind of medical assessment in circumstances where there was no medical evidence to that effect.

91The Crown acknowledged that his Honour had erred. The Crown accepted that there was no evidence to establish, in accordance with s21A(2)(g) of the Act that ""substantial"" harm had been caused to KJ by the offences. The Crown accepted that the cause of KJ's psychological damage was multifactorial and that in the absence of medical evidence which separated out the effects of these offences, the finding which his Honour made was not open to him.

92The Crown submitted, however, that it was open to his Honour to have found that these offences did cause some psychological damage to KJ. It would defy common sense not to make such a finding. What his Honour could not do on the statement of the evidence before him was make a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the extent of that harm. I agree with that submission by the Crown.

93This ground of appeal was made out.

Ground 3: Armitage DCJ erred in assessing the offence of aggravated sexual assault as around the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.

94The applicant submitted that in relation to count 8, the sentencing judge had erred in placing that offence at around the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind. The applicant based this submission on the following considerations. At age 15 KJ was towards the top of the range for the offence, its duration was no more specific than ""a long time"", the penetration was digital, there was no evidence as to the extent of the penetration and there was no violent forceful or threatening conduct.

95As a matter of principle, assessments of objective seriousness are matters within the particular purview of the sentencing judge. This Court has been slow to set aside such assessments: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [47]; Couloumbis v R [2012] NSWCCA 264 at [24]. 

96The offence in count 8 was contrary to s61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The elements of that offence are sexual intercourse without consent. The victim's age, being under 16, is an aggravating circumstance but it is not an element of the offence. The age of the victim is important but the gist of the offence is the absence of consent. 

97While the description ""a long time"" is imprecise, it is clear that this was not a momentary or opportunistic action on the part of the applicant. The remark attributed to him suggests some considerable length of time.

98The offence in count 8 also needs to be looked at in the light of the offence in count 1. This offence was not isolated and reflected an escalation of the first offence. KJ was the applicant's stepdaughter, was vulnerable and he took advantage of her on her own bed where she was entitled to feel safe.

99The nature of the sexual intercourse is not of particular significance. This Court has consistently rejected an informal rating in levels of seriousness of the various forms of sexual intercourse. Each offence depends upon its own particular facts. Digital penetration, such as occurred here, can be particularly confronting and destructive in its effect. It was well open to his Honour to assess the offence in count 8 as being in the middle range of seriousness. This ground has not been made out.

Ground 4: The sentence for the offence of aggravated sexual assault is manifestly excessive.

100The applicant submitted that by reference to sentences imposed in other cases for offences contrary to s61J in the 1990's, the sentence imposed for count 8 in this case was manifestly excessive. The Court was taken to eight cases decided during the period 1994 - 2005. The cases commenced with R v Gebrail (NSWCCA 18 November 1994) where the complainant was aged 17 and the aggravating element was malicious infliction of actual bodily harm. The offender had no criminal record. On a Crown appeal, the offender was re-sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. The most recent case in the series was R v RTGS [2005] NSWCCA 293 where the offender was found guilty. The offender was found to have put his hand down the underwear of his 11 year old step niece and touched the inside of her vagina with his fingers for about 15 minutes. He received a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.

101The applicant submitted that his sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years was the most severe sentence by comparison with those cases. The longest head sentence in the series was 3 years and 3 months and the longest non-parole period was 2 years and 3 months. The applicant pointed out that in both those cases, the offenders had been found guilty after a trial and in one of the cases the offender had a history of sex offences. The applicant submitted that although not much was known of the subjective circumstances of the offenders in those cases, even a very favourable subjective case could not be enough to explain the significant severity in the sentence imposed on him.

102It is trite law that for an applicant to be successful in making out a ground of appeal based on manifest excess, he or she must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": R v Hayek [2010] NSWCCA 139 at [53]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357. It is not enough to show that the sentencing judge could have taken a different course or that appellate judges would have done so: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504 - 505.

103The relevant question on appeal is whether the sentence was within a proper range. It is not a question of whether other sentences can be said to be more or less lenient by undertaking a detailed analysis of other cases as there is often a wide range of differences in objective and subjective circumstances to which the sentencing judge may have attached particular weight; R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368.

104Appellate intervention on a manifest excess ground is not justified simply because the result arrived at is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though it is not apparent from the sentencing judge's statement of reasons, or where the sentence is so far outside the range available that there must have been error: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [59] citing Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321.

105In Hili the plurality, French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Keifel and Bell JJ, said:

""48 Consistency is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence. Presentation of the sentences that have been passed on federal offenders in numerical tables, bar charts or graphs is not useful to a sentencing judge. It is not useful because referring only to the lengths of sentences passed says nothing about why sentences were fixed as they were. Presentation in any of these forms suggests, wrongly, that the task of a sentencing judge is to interpolate the result of the instant case on a graph that depicts the available outcomes. But not only is the number of federal offenders sentenced each year very small, the offences for which they are sentenced, the circumstances attending their offending, and their personal circumstances are so varied that it is not possible to make any useful statistical analysis or graphical depiction of the results.

...

53 ... Care must be taken, however, in using what has been done in other cases.

54 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 

""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" 

But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"". When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".""

106While the cases relied upon by the applicant are generally comparable in the sense that the same section of the Crimes Act was relied upon, the circumstances surrounding each episode of offending are all different. Gebrail was a Crown appeal where the offender had no record for similar offending and a finding was made that the offender was unlikely to offend again. The sentence passed of 3 years and 3 months with a minimum term of 2 years and 3 months was said to be at the bottom of the range because of the restraint to be observed by an appellate court when dealing with a Crown appeal.

107Two of the other cases referred to were also Crown appeals in which the Court noted that a heavier sentence should have been imposed but declined to intervene, again because of the principle of judicial restraint when dealing with a Crown appeal. In three of the cases, the appeal related to conviction and no consideration was given to the sentence imposed. RTGS was one of those cases where an appeal against conviction was dismissed but there was no appeal against the sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.

108While it is clear by a simple reference to the sentences imposed in those cases that the sentence imposed in this case was heavy, it needs to be kept in mind that in this case the applicant did have a history of previous offending (the count 1 offence) and the maximum penalty for the offence was 20 years. In the circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded that by reference to sentences imposed in the 1990's the sentence for count 8 imposed by his Honour involved a misapplication of principle, or was so far outside the range available that there must have been an error. On the contrary, I am of the opinion that the sentence imposed was within range and clearly open at the sentencing judge's discretion. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 5: Armitage DCJ erred in his partial accumulation of the two sentences.

109The applicant submitted that a greater level of concurrency was required in the structure of the sentences. Concurrency of 1 year when the offences occurred more than 15 years ago and when there was a considerable amount of similarity in the conduct constituting the offences, was insufficient.

110Sentencing judges have a wide discretion when fixing sentences and determining questions of concurrency and cumulation. The discretion is subject to the correct application of the principle of totality. In R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 Simpson J (with whom Mason P agreed) said at [67]:

""7 ... Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with established principle. Features common to two or more offences are all matters relevant to be taken into account (pointing towards concurrence) as are features indicating the disparate nature of the offences (pointing the other way). There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong.""

111It needs to be kept in mind that the offences arose from separate incidents and involved different offending. The two offences occurred some two years apart. In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27] Howie J said:

""27 In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""

112No error has been demonstrated in the structure of the sentences imposed by his Honour. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Conclusion

113Error has been made out in respect of Ground of Appeal 2. The nature of the error is one of degree. Whereas it was open to his Honour to find that KJ had been damaged psychologically by the offending, it was not open to his Honour to make a quantitative or qualitative finding in that regard, i.e. that the damage was either significant or substantial. In that regard, it is not clear to what extent, if at all, that erroneous finding on the part of the sentencing judge affected the sentences which he imposed.

114If it did contribute to the length and structure of the sentences, I would not interfere. This is because I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). The offences carry maximum penalties of 7 and 20 years imprisonment respectively. As discussed above, each offence cannot be regarded as being of low objective seriousness. The prospects of rehabilitation are not particularly good, having regard to the similar offences committed by the applicant since these offences and the somewhat equivocal assessment by Ms Young.

115The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal with respect to the conviction and sentence appeals be granted but that the appeals be dismissed.

116ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the reasons for judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour, and with the reasons therefor.

117As explained in the reasons for judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL, the applicant for leave to appeal was charged with eight counts in each of which the victim was alleged to be KJ. On two of those counts, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, being counts 1 and 8. The jury returned verdicts of not guilty in relation to counts 2, 3, 5 and 6 initially, and a later verdict of not guilty in relation to count 7. The jury could not reach a verdict on count 4, and the DPP has indicated, the trial judge having discharged the jury, that it will not further prosecute that count.

118I have read all of the evidence in the trial with particular attention to the evidence of the applicant, the victim and the victim's mother and sister.

119In my view, the complainant/victim is unreliable on dates, but otherwise a compelling witness. She concedes her unreliability on dates, particularly in relation to the microdot incident, because of the passage of time and the effect of drug use.

120Nevertheless, her evidence is compelling. I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the distinction between Counts 1 and 8, on the one hand, and the remainder of counts, on the other hand, is that the timing of counts 1 and 8 is more definite and is corroborated either by other witnesses or by the timing of independent facts to which the timing of the incident related.

121Each of the counts had a defined time during which it was said the conduct occurred. Each of the counts upon which the jury did not find the applicant guilty required the jury to find that the conduct about which complaint was made occurred during a specified time. As earlier stated, the victim/complainant was unreliable as to time.

122Like Hoeben CJ at CL, I do not have a reasonable doubt as to the verdict on counts 1 and 8. As a consequence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the charges in counts 1 and 8: SKA v R; M v R; MFA v R.

123In Singh v R [2011] NSWCCA 100, I said (Latham and Price JJ agreeing), without the benefit of the judgment of the High Court in SKA v R, citing M v R:

""[10] The focus must be on the unreasonableness of the verdict, and the term 'unsafe and unsatisfactory', although sometimes still used, ought not be. Further, whether the verdict was 'open to the jury' does not itself, answer the question. The focus of the examination is whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt, which is answered by whether the appellate court has a reasonable doubt that cannot be answered by paying regard to the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence. See also The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 85 ALJR 8. 

[11] Concentration on the expression as to whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt may lead to some confusion. The focus of the enquiry is not whether there is evidence upon which a jury could have convicted (i.e. whether there was evidence of each element of the offence), but whether it was open to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. whether, on all of the evidence, it was open to be satisfied that there was no reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence).

[12] In examining the issues, it is the evidence as a whole that must be considered; not each part of the evidence in a piecemeal fashion: R v Rasic [2009] NSWCCA 202.""

124On the evidence as a whole, the charges in counts 1 and 8 have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the appeal against conviction must be dismissed.

125I agree with the reasons for judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL. I also agree with his Honour's reasons on the sentence appeal.

126McCALLUM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL, for the reasons his Honour has stated. I am satisfied that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of counts 1 and 8. In reaching that conclusion, I have undertaken my own assessment of the evidence. The jury saw a DVD of the complainant's evidence-in-chief (given at an earlier trial which miscarried). She gave some further evidence in chief, and was cross-examined, in the presence of the jury in the trial now appealed from. My own impression from reading her evidence is that she was an intelligent and compelling witness. She was aged 30 at the time she gave her evidence. She was frank about shortcomings in her account including the impact of her former drug use on her memory, differences between statements made at different times and the fact that she was ""very sketchy with dates"". She coped well with a skilful and persistent cross-examination by Ms Avenell. Whilst it is difficult to assess on paper the appellant's evidence appears, by contrast, to have been unimpressive. My assessment of the complainant's evidence and the other evidence in the trial has not left me in any doubt as to the appellant's guilt. I do not think that the jury's verdicts on counts 1 and 8 were unreasonable or that those verdicts cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

127As to ground 2 in the sentence appeal, it must be acknowledged that it was not open to the judge to make a quantitative assessment on a medical issue without medical evidence. In my view, however, it was open on the evidence to find that the two offences of which the appellant was found guilty on their own must have caused substantial emotional harm to the complainant. Accordingly, I doubt whether the error is of any significance.

128I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

2761891,R v Jacobs (No 7) [2013] NSWSC 948,"ex tempore Judgment

1The issue at this stage of the proceedings is whether manslaughter should be left to the jury. The Crown Prosecutor submits that manslaughter is simply not viable on the evidence. 

2Defence counsel submits that manslaughter should be left. Earlier, in submissions in support of that proposition, he drew attention to the evidence that the shot fired from the .38 calibre revolver hit the deceased when the deceased was more than three metres away from the muzzle of that weapon. He has also referred in his address to the possibility that the deceased was taking cover as trained, and moved into the path of a bullet not fired at him. He also submitted to the jury that the words ""I'm sorry"" said repeatedly by the accused at a subsequent stage at the scene could have been a reference to him having fired without intending to hit the deceased. 

3Furthermore, right at the end of defence counsel's address he asked the jury to consider whether, if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the shooter, they were also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of one of the three requisite mental elements of murder. 

4To my mind, the evidence is very strong that whoever fired the shot was very close to the deceased. I will not review all of the evidence supportive of that proposition. It is also noteworthy that when the accused was shot, that is, within no more than two seconds after the deceased had been shot, he, the accused, was very close to the Glock pistol. 

5Separately, to my mind, it is quite possible that two shots were fired from the revolver at the scene and not one. 

6There is no question of a partial defence that would reduce culpability for murder to manslaughter. Nor are there any complications arising from the principle of accessorial liability with regard to murder and manslaughter. 

7All of those matters militate firmly against leaving manslaughter for the consideration of the jury. On the other hand, the test is a low one and it is simply whether manslaughter is a ""viable"" proposition. Also, the fact that one counsel submits that it should be left is significant, though not of course determinative. 

8The learned Crown Prosecutor accepted in discussion of this question that the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State has adopted a cautious approach to the question over the years. Perhaps it is broadly analogous to the position with regard to defences not relied upon, as explained in Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; (1971) 124 CLR 107.

9A recent example of the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal is to be found in Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223. In that case, although the Crown case was that the deceased had been hit repeatedly to the head with a piece of metal and thereafter kicked or stomped on, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that it had been an error for the trial judge not to leave manslaughter for the jury's consideration. 

10Following that cautious approach to the question, and although at first blush the proposition that this could have been manslaughter perhaps appears to be almost fanciful, on reflection I consider that manslaughter is viable, although just barely. It follows that I will leave manslaughter for the consideration of the jury.

		16 July 2013",2013-07-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761902,R v Gibbons [2013] NSWCCA 166,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA: This is an appeal by the Crown against a sentence imposed on the respondent by a judge of the District Court. The respondent was charged with five counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, being a knife. He pleaded guilty to those five counts. The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence for all offences, consisting of imprisonment for five years and six months, with a non-parole period of three years. 

2I have a read in draft form the reasons of R S Hulme AJ, in which his Honour sets out the circumstances of the offences. It is significant that the offences occurred within two months after the respondent had entered into seven bonds undertaking to be of good behaviour. The offences could not be described as uncharacteristic aberration. Rather, they exhibit a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. 

3I agree, for the reasons given by R S Hulme AJ, that the sentence imposed by the District Court is manifestly inadequate. I agree that, for the reasons given by his Honour, the appeal should be allowed and the sentence imposed by the District Court should be quashed. I agree with the sentence and orders proposed by R S Hulme AJ.

4R A HULME J: I agree with R S Hulme AJ.

5R S HULME AJ: This is a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed by North DCJ on 14 November 2012. The Respondent to the appeal had pleaded guilty to five counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife. Taking advantage of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months including a non-parole period of 3 years, both such periods commencing on 26 August 2012. 

6The five offences were committed within the period 7 - 25 January 2012. In the first the Respondent robbed a service station attendant of $150 in cash and $152 of cigarettes.

7In the second the Respondent robbed a drive-in bottle shop attendant of $1,226.85. 

8In the third he robbed a supermarket attendant of $1,650.

9In the fourth he robbed another supermarket attendant of $1,050.

10In the fifth offence he robbed a service station attendant of $800.

11According to a Statement of Agreed Facts, shortly prior to each of the offences the Respondent had been at a friend's place in Cessnock. On at least four of these occasions he was there with a view to purchasing drugs but lacked sufficient money to do so. On the first occasion he rode a push bike to the service station something under a kilometre away. On the second he drove a vehicle to the scene of the offence. On the third he walked some 3.5 kilometres to the supermarket. On the fourth he took a 20 minute bus ride and on the fifth he travelled about 11.5 kilometres to the scene of the offences. 

12The knife used in the first 4 offences was a 30cm long kitchen knife taken from the friend's house. That used in the fifth offence was a similar large kitchen knife. Prior to embarking on the fourth offence, the Respondent dressed in a hooded jumper with clothes on underneath so he could change his appearance at short notice. On a number of occasions the Respondent waited in or in the vicinity of the relevant premises for customers to leave or for the circumstances to be otherwise propitious.

13Each of the offences was captured on CCTV and in some cases the footage was of high quality. The Respondent was arrested on 26 January 2012. He then participated in an ERISP in which he made full and frank admissions and provided information to assist police to locate the knives which he had disposed of.

14The Respondent who was born in March 1983 has a not inconsiderable criminal history. In 2002 he was fined for offences of driving with a mid-range PCA and for dangerous driving. In 2003 he was subjected to 2 community service orders for driving a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner and driving whilst disqualified and placed on three 18 month bonds for destroying or damaging property, assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty and resisting or hindering police. Later in the year he was called up and sentenced to 2 months imprisonment for breach of those bonds and also for common assault.

15In 2006 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 months in respect of one count of larceny and a second of driving whilst disqualified. Of more significance is the fact that in that year he was also sentenced to imprisonment in respect of two counts of attempted aggravated robbery and 2 counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon. In respect of the first two of these offences the sentences imposed were of imprisonment for 3 years 11 months including a non-parole period of 1 year and 7 months. In respect of the third and fourth the sentences were imprisonment for 3 years including non-parole periods of 15 or 16 months. Because of staggered commencing dates the effective non-parole period was 2 years and 4 months concluding on 9 February 2008.

16In April 2008 he was sentenced to the rising of the Court in respect of a number of offences including possessing a prohibited drug. He was also sentenced to 4 months in prison for a third offence of driving whilst disqualified. In April 2010 he was convicted for the fourth time of driving whilst disqualified and given an 8 months suspended sentence.

17The Respondent was again in custody from 2 October 2011 to 11 November 2011 when seven suspended sentences were imposed on him for 2 counts of common assault, 1 count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, 1 count of stalking or intimidating and 3 counts of destroying or damaging property. Conditions of the bonds were supervision by the Probation and Parole Service which was ""asked to consider full time residential rehabilitation if thought desirable"". In May 2012, as a result of the offences with which this Court is concerned, he was called up on those bonds and sentenced to largely concurrent periods of imprisonment, commencing on 26 January 2012. The longest of these periods was 16 months and the longest non-parole period concluded on 25 October 2012.

18North DCJ accepted that the Respondent had a disruptive and complex upbringing after his father left home and his mother died when he was 10. His Honour also recounted that the Respondent had told the author of the Pre-sentence Report that he was subjected to violence by a stepfather and eventually ran away from home at the age of 14. 

19The Pre-sentence Report stated that the Respondent appeared to respond best to strict monitoring and intensive supervision although he had primarily demonstrated a poor response to past supervision. However, there had been an extended period of stability and progress in 2009 and 2010. During this period the Respondent rose from being a casual worker to full time head chef at a winery. He returned to that position on release from custody in 2011 but his work performance declined and he resigned. According to the Pre-sentence Report the Respondent was then participating in an opiate replacement program. The report goes on to say that at the time of the subject offences, the Respondent had missed his program doses for 3 days, was taken off the program and then missed an appointment with his prescribing doctor.

20The report also records the Respondent had a long standing dependence on opiates and to a lesser extent amphetamines and had undertaken intervention programs in custody and that despite supportive attempts from his partner, after the Respondent's release from custody in late 2011 his drug abuse became uncontrollable. 

21In evidence the Respondent acknowledged that in the 6 to 8 weeks before committing the October 2011 offences he was using drugs, and that he had continued to do so and though he had previously found the Probation and Parole Service of assistance, he did not seek that organisation's help in 2011. Although he considered entering a rehabilitation program he did not.

22His Honour said he was willing to accept that the Respondent was genuinely remorseful and had some insight into the impact of his crimes. He continued:

""I found the offender's evidence quite impressive despite his very troubled background, criminal antecedents and the seriousness of these matters. The real issue apart from ensuring any sentences send a clear deterrent message to the wider community and to the offender himself, are the questions of re-offending and rehabilitation.

...From the way in which he gave evidence I do accept that he, at least at this time is genuine about keeping away from drugs and of course the criminality associated with them. 

Whether or not he is at the crossroads only time will tell. The Crown does not concede that the Court would find special circumstances in this case. However, having listened to him carefully in evidence I think that, for the benefit of the community and of the offender, a longer period on parole may well be of benefit. If he re-offends then his future is bleak as he will serve any unexpired parole period and be sentenced on any new matters, no doubt to gaol. ...""

23His Honour went on to find special circumstances in a need for longer than normal supervision in the community, in the Respondent's long-standing drug addiction and, because of the length of incarceration (contributed to by partial accumulation with the sentences consequent on the breach of bonds), that he was likely to become further institutionalised. Thus it was that he imposed the non-parole period that he did. 

24Otherwise his Honour made no findings as to the Respondent's prospects of rehabilitation.

25It is clear that the focus of attention in the submissions made to North DCJ was how the Respondent's offences compared with the circumstances hypothesised in the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 where the Chief Justice said that for an offence having the characteristics identified, sentences should generally fall between 4 and 5 years for the full term. Those characteristics were:

(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history 
(ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury 
(iii) Limited degree of planning 
(iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof 
(v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver 
(vi) Small amount taken 
(vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.

26Later authority - see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [161] - has made clear that the plea of guilty contemplated in (vii) was one entered late, and likely to attract a discount of the order of 10%.

27North DCJ recorded that the Respondent's plea was entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity and the Respondent was entitled to a 25% discount. His Honour noted a submission by the Crown that with the 25% discount the adjusted sentencing range in accordance with Henry for full term imprisonment would range between 3 years and 4 months and 4 years and 2 months. He went on to say, ""given my finding in relation to the objective seriousness of the matter, I think that in each case a full term of 3 years and 9 months is appropriate."" The difference between this period and the 5½ years imprisonment imposed was because, as has been said, his Honour elected to impose an aggregate sentence referable to all offences. 

28In arriving at the decision that the sentence should commence on 26 August 2012 his Honour took into account 40 days the Respondent had spent in prison between 2 October 2011 and 11 November 2011 when he was released on the seven s 12 bonds.

29In written submissions the solicitor appearing for the Crown below submitted that, except for his criminal history and the fact his plea was entered earlier than contemplated in that case, the Respondent answered the description of the typical offender referred to in R v Henry. She submitted however that because of the suspended sentences that the Respondent was subject to at the time, his criminality fell outside the R v Henry guidelines. 

30For his part the solicitor for the Respondent conceded that the Respondent was not young and while the breach of the 7 bonds was an aggravating factor, that was offset by the early plea and accordingly the sentencing range referred to by the Chief Justice applied. North DCJ said that he accepted that submission and believed that the offences fell ""squarely within the Henry guideline"". Later his Honour referred to each of the 5 counts as being a ""typical Henry case"".

31Notwithstanding that conclusion, his Honour did observe that the Respondent had a significant criminal history and in that respect his situation was more serious than the typical Henry offender, and that there had been some planning and time to reflect, although the offences were unsophisticated. His Honour described the average amount taken of just under $1,000 as a ""relatively small amount"". His Honour also remarked that ""a need to acquire funds to support a drug habit...is not itself a matter of mitigation, however I do find that it can be taken into account in regard to the impulsivity of the offences and the extent of any planning.""

""Further, his objective criminality is to some extent reduced by the fact that I accept that he committed the offences to purchase drugs and not to fund some other serious criminal venture.

Finally, I accept that his state of mind and his capacity to exercise judgment was clouded by the urgent need to acquire prohibited drugs.""

32It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, despite what he had earlier said, his Honour did in fact allow the Respondent's drug addiction to operate as a matter of mitigation. Certainly his Honour erred in regarding the objective criminality as reduced because the Respondent had not in mind some more serious offending - see Grove J in Saddler v R [2009] NSWCCA 83 at [3]; Simpson J in SKA v R; R v SKA [2009] NSWCCA 186 at [194]. 

33His Honour erred also in concluding that each of the Respondent's offences could be characterised as a ""typical Henry case"". At age 28 the Respondent was neither ""a young offender"" nor one with ""no or little criminal history"". Nor did all of the Respondent's offences reflect merely a ""limited degree of planning"". In this connection I have in mind to some degree the 3rd and 5th, but particularly the 4th offence. I also have doubts whether the amounts of $1,226.85 and $1,650 answer the description of ""a small amount taken"" although I note that in R v Kelly [2010] NSWCCA 259 at [62] and [67] Kirby J regarded $1,100 as a ""small amount"" and $2,000 as ""approximately the same"". There are authorities that argue to the contrary - see also R v Harris [2011] NSWCCA 105 at [15] and [88] and Hampton v R [2010] NSWCCA 278 at [48].

34However, in that the concessions of counsel for the Crown who appeared below may have led his Honour into error in some of these respects, it would not be appropriate to rely on them in deciding whether to allow a Crown appeal and I put those aside. There remains the Respondent's criminal history and his breach of the 7 good behaviour bonds incidental to his 7 suspended sentences. As I have indicated, the Crown relied on these breaches as taking the Respondent outside the Henry guideline but his Honour thought that they merely offset the extra 15% discount the Respondent was regarded as entitled to. Though recognising the Respondent's criminal history, nowhere does his Honour seem to have given it any weight or indeed seriously considered it. 

35And the 2 matters, the previous criminal history and the breach of the bonds need to be considered together. Of course the Respondent is not to be again punished for offences in his past but that past throws considerable light on how he should be dealt with for the subject offences. 

36The 4 convictions for driving whilst disqualified tend to demonstrate an attitude of disobedience to the law whenever it suits the Respondent. So do his offences in 2003. His 2006 convictions for robbery must have brought home to him the evils of that sort of activity. Yet he chose to repeat it within 2 months of entering into 7 bonds undertaking to be of good behaviour. And that repetition was not merely in spur of the moment decisions. In some cases his offending was after embarking on a journey giving him plenty of time to reflect on the crime he had made a deliberate choice to commit in breach of his bonds. And despite having found the Probation and Parole Service of assistance in the past, in 2012 he preferred to offend rather than seek assistance again. His record invites reflection on remarks of the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at [14]:

""The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.""

37I do not ignore the presence of the word ""may"" in that passage and North DCJ's favourable remarks concerning the Respondent although it is fair to say that many offenders, facing a substantial gaol sentence in consequence of their drug taking, would at that time be genuine about abstaining in the future. It is to be noted that his Honour refrained from any opinion as to the Respondent's prospects of rehabilitation. 

38The Respondent's offending in the face of not one but 7 good behaviour bonds might also be compared with remarks in this Court in the case of R v Speeding [2001] NSWCCA 105; 121 A Crim R 426. There the offender had pleaded guilty to 5 charges of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and one charge of robbery simpliciter. He had been arrested and charged and released on bail after the fourth offence, so was on conditional liberty when he committed the last 2 offences. At the time of offending he was 19. His life had significantly deteriorated over the preceding 2 years following the death of a family member and he had become drug, alcohol and gambling addicted but had some prospects of overcoming the first 2 of these addictions. In fact, the original sentencing judge was satisfied that the offender had made ""a quite significant break"" from his heroin addiction. A Crown appeal against an effective sentence of 5 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months was allowed, both periods being increased by 2 years. In the course of reasons with which the other members of the Court agreed Giles JA remarked, at [21]:

""Further, the respondent's continuance of his deliberate course of criminal behaviour after he came under police notice, and after he had been charged with the robbery of 15 May 2000 and given the benefit of bail, was more than foolhardy. It showed a contempt for the law and the processes of the law, and a particular contempt when, having the benefit of bail conditioned upon being of good behaviour, the respondent soon engaged in two further offences. It is well-established, see for example R v Richards (1982) 2 NSWLR 464 at 465, that severely deterrent sentences will be imposed on those who abuse their freedom on bail by taking the opportunity to commit further crimes. This the respondent did.""

39Against the R v Henry guideline of 4 to 5 years imprisonment, even reduced on account of the Respondent's plea to 3 years and 4 months to 4 years and 2 months as suggested to North DCJ by the Crown, his Honour's indicative sentence of 3 years and 9 months is impossible to reconcile with Giles JA's remarks and for which there is plenty of other authority - see e.g. R v Henry & Barber [1999] NSWCCA 107 at [28] and [29] and the cases there cited.

40However, this being a Crown appeal, it is not enough merely to find error. The question remains whether the sentence ultimately imposed was manifestly inadequate. 

41In support of the contention that it was not, counsel for the Respondent, while submitting that the legitimate objective of consistency in sentence ""is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence"" - see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [48] - drew the Court's attention to 4 cases. 

42In one of those cases, R v Hamilton [2000] NSWCCA 31, the offender had also pleaded guilty to 4 counts of offences against s 97(1). Each offence involved the robbery of a service station employee who was threatened with a knife. On one occasion the employee and an 8 year old boy were pushed. Amounts taken varied between $60 and $350. The offender was 21 at the time and of generally good character until a drug addiction overwhelmed him. This Court allowed a Crown appeal, and but for the imminent expiry of the non-parole period imposed at first instance, would have imposed a sentence of 5 years including a non-parole period of 3 years. The Court did not suggest that this sentence was below the bottom of the range appropriate for the offending and, so it was submitted, sufficiently close to that imposed on the Respondent as to demonstrate that the full terms of the indicative and ultimate sentences here under appeal are not manifestly inadequate.

43I do not find the argument persuasive. The difference in the ages and in the records of the 2 offenders and the fact that Hamilton was not on conditional liberty are clear and significant points of distinction. 

44In a second case, R v Kelly [2010] NSWCCA 259, the offender had been convicted of 5 armed robberies, at least most of which were more serious than the Respondent's offences. Individual sentences varying between 3 years and 9 months and 6 years were imposed, the aggregate sentence being 7½ years including a non-parole period of 5 years. Mr Kelly was on parole at the time. However Mr Kelly had a mental illness that was regarded as relevant in contributing to the commission of his offences, in rendering him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence or at least as moderating that consideration, and resulting in a custodial sentence weighing more heavily upon him than the population generally. Because of this illness, the weight of which was not quantified, the individual sentences imposed on Mr Kelly provide limited if any guidance as to the sentences appropriate to the Respondent's offending. However, once one recognises, as seems to have been the case, that Kelly's mental illness had the effect of reducing his sentence from what it otherwise would have been, the result argues in favour of the sentence here being too low. A fortiori is this so when Mr Kelly's youth - he was 20 at the time of offending - was regarded as a mitigating factor.

45The third case, R v Renton [2002] NSWCCA 74 was a decision of a 2 judge bench dismissing an offender's appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years including a non-parole period of 3 years imposed for 7 counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. In my view this Court should maintain its stance that decisions of 2 judge benches are not authoritative but in any event in that case the offender had been pressured to commit the offences, the adequacy of the sentence imposed did not arise for consideration in this Court, and I find the case of no persuasive value.

46In the fourth, R v Henry & Barber [1999] NSWCCA 107 Simpson J, in whose reasons 3 other members of the Court agreed said that, having regard to a first offence committed by Henry it would be appropriate to sentence him more severely for the second and indicated that an increase from 5 years imprisonment for the first offence to 5½ years imprisonment for the second offence was an appropriate increase. Henry had a limited criminal record, was 23 at the time of the first offence, on a recognisance at the time of both offences and on bail at the time of the second. In fact concurrent sentences, each of 5½ years including non-parole periods of 3½ years were imposed. Relying on this matter, counsel for the Respondent submitted that if 6 months extra was sufficient for a second offence in Henry's case, it could not be said that the 21 month difference between the indicated sentences of 3 years and 9 months and the 5 ½ years ultimately imposed for 5 offences was erroneous.

47Reference may also be made to R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100 where this Court upheld a Crown appeal and imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 5½ years including a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months on an offender who had pleaded guilty to 6 offences against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Four other offences were taken into account but were of a minor nature and may presently be disregarded.

48All offences had been committed during a 6 week period and all involved the offender, in company with others, entering business premises at night and demanding money from the attendants, some of whom were punched. On one occasion a knife was used as a threat. The offender was 18 at the time of the offences. At the time of offending he was a daily drug user and had not sought help for those issues. Evidence indicated that he had significant psychiatric or psychological issues. His only previous conviction was for assault some 2 months prior to the s 97 offences and for which he was placed on a good behaviour bond. He had been arrested after the first offence and given bail. The other 5 offences were committed during the currency of this bail.

49In a judgment agreed to by the other members of the Court, Simpson J remarked, at [66], [68]:

""Multiplicity of offences plainly calls for a total sentence well in excess of the four to five years so promulgated [in R v Henry]. While it may be correct that each individual sentence could fall appropriately within the four to five year range, it must also be recognised that, as the offending continues, each succeeding offence calls for a greater punishment than the earlier, if only by way of personal deterrence.
...

I would not disturb the finding of special circumstances, and would, accordingly, impose an overall non-parole period of three years and nine months. Even this is barely adequate to recognise the criminality involved, or the affront to the victims. I propose it in acknowledgement of the well-known principles applicable to sentencing after a successful Crown appeal. I also have in mind the respondent's youth, and that the offences were committed over a short space of time.""

50In arriving at her decision Simpson J referred to R v Speeding [2001] NSWCCA 105; 121 A Crim R 426 to which I have referred above. Her Honour did not identify which of the principles applicable to sentencing after a successful Crown appeal she had in mind. Sometimes the Court imposed the lowest sentence that should have been imposed at first instance. Sometimes it imposed one that was lower - see R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at [205] - [207] for a collection of cases evidencing each approach. Of course the recent changes to the law concerning double jeopardy mean that many of those principles are now out of date.

51In the above discussion, I have referred to each of the cases to which the Court was taken in argument by way of comparison. There are differences between each of them and the circumstances here and I do not find any decisive. Nor have I thought it necessary or appropriate to trawl through the vast number of cases where other offenders have been sentenced for multiple offences under s 97(1). I am content to approach the matter upon the basis of the statutory provision, the principles to which reference has been made, and the guideline in R v Henry.

52Is the sentence here manifestly inadequate? In my view it is.

53Accepting that the R v Henry guideline range should be reduced as the Crown suggested to North DCJ, I am unable to accept that the sentence for one offence should be as low as 3 years and 9 months as North DCJ held. Even assuming that it was appropriate for his Honour to start from the bottom of that range, the extra 5 months implicit in the 3 years and 9 months term gives scant recognition to either the fact that the offence breached 7 good behaviour bonds or the Respondent's regrettable record - two factors that were very relevant to determining the appropriate sentence. The indicative sentence for each offence should not have been less than 4½ years. And while I appreciate that period is but 9 months more than his Honour fixed, the 9 months is almost double any allowance his Honour made for these factors. 

54Nor am I able to accept that the 21 months increase to 5½ years for all offences was within his Honour's sentencing discretion. While it may be that a 6 months increase for a second offence by Henry was regarded as appropriate in that case, it does not follow that that period is appropriate in all cases, or even generally sufficient, particularly when that period is in due course effectively divided into a non-parole and parole eligibility terms.

55Twenty-one months represents a little more than 5 months for each of the Respondent's second to fifth offences, which even North DCJ thought individually merited sentences of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment. I appreciate that considerations of totality have to be taken into account but the periods are grossly disproportionate. The matter is a fortiori if, as was said in R v Smith, succeeding offences (with the same characteristics) call for greater punishment than an earlier one.

56The non-parole period of 3 years fixed by North DCJ is 55% of the total sentence of 5½ years. If one combines the sentence his Honour imposed with the 7 months consequent on the breach of bonds, the effective non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months represents 59% of the total effective sentence of 6 years 1 month. 59% of 21 months is a little over 12 months so effectively the time the Respondent was required to serve by way of a non-parole period for each of the second to fifth robberies was a little over 3 months. These sorts of periods provide little by way of deterrence to an offender once he has committed one robbery. 

57The question then arises whether this Court should interfere. The High Court has made it clear that the primary purpose of Crown appeals is to lay down principles not the general correction of errors - Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [1], [36]. In my view the Court should intervene and allow the appeal. It is important that it be generally understood that second and subsequent offences will be met with significant punishment.

58The sentences that were imposed by North DCJ were manifestly inadequate. The least sentence that should have been imposed on the Respondent for his 5 offences was one that broadly accords with the sentences in R v Speeding and R v Kelly, viz imprisonment for 7 years. The non-parole period should be 4 years, a period that roughly maintains the relativity between the head sentence and the non-parole period fixed by North DCJ. In expressing the matter thus I am intending to reflect North DCJ's decision to impose an aggregate sentence. This Court should adopt the same approach. Were I imposing individual sentences of the Respondent for each of his offences I would have made each sentence of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment.

59Before I proceed to formulate the orders to be made there is however, one further possible error by North DCJ to which I should advert, albeit an error which would not have caused me to allow the Crown appeal. His Honour recorded that the Respondent had served 40 days in custody before the 7 suspended sentences and bonds were imposed and seems to have taken that fact into account in choosing to commence the Respondent's sentence from 26 August 2012 rather than the date when the sentences, originally suspended, expired, viz 26 October 2012. If his Honour did so he was in error. That period of custody was referable to the offences in respect of which the suspended sentences were imposed and may have influenced the court sentencing at that time to sentence as it did. The 40 days was not relevant to North DCJ's sentencing. However, there were other bases on which his Honour could have chosen 26 August 2012 and I would date the sentence I propose from the same date. 

60An affidavit of the Respondent referring to his activities in custody, to the impact on him and his family of the Crown appeal, and to difficulties his family has in visiting him in Junee was read during the hearing of the appeal. In accordance with sentencing principles not all of these matters are relevant but I have taken account of those that are. The orders I would suggest are:

(i) Appeal allowed;

(ii) Quash the sentence imposed by North DCJ on 14 November 2012;

(ii) Pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes Act 1900, sentence the Respondent in respect of each of the 5 counts of armed robbery to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 7 years commencing on 26 August 2012;

(iv) Set an aggregate non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 26 August 2012 and expiring on 25 August 2016;

(v) Record as the date when it appears to the Court that the Respondent will first become eligible for parole 26 August 2016.

		16 July 2013",2013-07-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761937,Kemp v KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 965,"Judgment

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed on 12 July 2013 by the prosecutor, Peter Stewart Kemp, seeking an order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the defendant, KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd, be brought before a judge of this Court to answer a charge under s 55(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005.

2The prosecutor, a senior investigator in the Investigation and Enforcement Unit of the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), relied on an affidavit he had sworn on 11 July 2013, to support the application. 

3When the proceedings came before me, sitting as duty judge, on 12 July 2013, I made orders in terms sought in the summons. My reasons for making those orders follow.

The factual background

4The prosecutor relied on briefs of evidence prepared by RMS and by NSW Police, as part of their investigations into an accident that had occurred on 14 July 2011 at Bathurst. They revealed that a heavy vehicle combination was delivering a load of steel beams from Newcastle to Orange that day. Part of the load swung out from the combination while it was travelling along the Mitchell Highway, colliding with a vehicle being driven in the opposite direction by Ms Leonie Darling, causing her death. Part of the load then fell from the combination, striking five other vehicles. 

5The driver of the combination, Mr Basil White, was later charged with manslaughter.

The charge under s 55(1) of the 2005 Act

6Section 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act empowers the Court to order a person to be brought before the Court for the purpose of answering a charge brought under the Court's summary jurisdiction. The prosecutor's case was that such an order would be made if a prima facie case under s 55(1) of the 2005 Act was established on the material relied on.

7Section 55(1) of the 2005 Act provided:

""55 Liability of loader
...
(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:
(a) a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs, and
(b) the person is the loader of any goods that are in or on the vehicle or combination concerned.""


A prima facie case of breach of the load restraint requirements of s 55(1)(a) was established

8The prosecutor's case was that relevant to the breach of the load restraint requirement alleged was the provisions of clause 61 of the Road Transport (Mass, Loading and Access) Regulation 2005, which provided:

""61 Load requirements

(1) A load on a vehicle or a trailer must not be placed in a way that makes the vehicle unstable or unsafe.

(2) A load on a vehicle or a trailer must be secured so that it is unlikely to fall or be dislodged from the vehicle.

(3) An appropriate method must be used to restrain the load on a vehicle.

(4) In proceedings for a contravention of a requirement under this clause, it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the load on the vehicle was not placed, secured or restrained (as the case requires) in a way that met the performance standards recommended in the Load Restraint Guide: Guidelines and performance standards for the safe carriage of loads on road vehicles, Second Edition, as published by the National Transport Commission in April 2004.""



9Annexed to the prosecutor's affidavit, amongst other things, was a report of Mr Di Cristoforo, a road safety engineer who had been instructed by NSW Police to provide an expert report as to the manner of loading the load on the combination. There Mr Di Cristoforo referred to the 'Load Restraint Guide' published in 2004 by the National Transport Commission, which refers to various requirements, including dunnage to be placed on a trailer deck. He explained the basis for his opinion that the type of wood used in the dunnage of the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident was inadequate for the load being carried, permitting the catastrophic movement of the load which caused the accident. 

10I was satisfied that the material relied on established a prima facie case that the breach of the load restraint requirements of s 55(1)(a) alleged, had occurred.

A prima facie case that KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd was the loader of the goods carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident was established

11The prosecutor also alleged that KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd was the loader of the goods being carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

12The prosecutor relied on a transcript of an Electronically Recorded Interview of a Suspected Person (ERISP) annexed to his affidavit. The ERISP recorded a police interview with Mr Basil White on 14 July 2011. Mr White was the driver of the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident. During the interview, Mr White said that he witnessed the loading of the combination by KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd in Newcastle prior to the accident.

13I was satisfied that the material relied on established a prima facie case that it was KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd who was the loader of the goods being carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

Result and orders

14In the result, I was satisfied that the prosecutor had established a prima facie case that KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd had committed the offence alleged and accordingly made the orders sought under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

2761938,Kemp v Walker [2013] NSWSC 962,"Judgment

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed by the prosecutor, Peter Stewart Kemp, on 12 July 2013. Thereby an order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the defendant, Robert John Walker, be brought before a judge of this Court to answer a charge under s 56(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 was sought.

Section 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 

6Section 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act empowers the Court to order a person to be brought before the Court for the purpose of answering a charge brought under the Court's summary jurisdiction. 

7The prosecutor's case was that an order under s 246 of the 1986 Act would be made if a prima facie case under s 56(1) of the 2005 Act was established on the material relied on, Mr Walker being a director of the company which had committed the offence alleged. 

Section 56(1) and s 178 of the 2005 Act

8Section 56(1) of the 2005 Act provided:

""56 Liability of operator
...
(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs, and
(b) the person is the operator of the vehicle or combination concerned.""


9In this case the prosecutor also relied on s 178 of the 2005 Act, which provided:

""178 Liability of directors, partners, employers and others for offences by bodies corporate, partnerships, associations and employees
...

(1) If a body corporate commits an offence under the road transport legislation, each director of the body corporate, and each person concerned in the management of the body corporate, is taken to have committed the offence and is punishable accordingly... ""



A prima facie case under s 56(1)(a) established

10The prosecutor's case was that relevant to the breach of load restraint alleged were the provisions of clause 61 of the Road Transport (Mass, Loading and Access) Regulation 2005, which provided:

""61 Load requirements

(1) A load on a vehicle or a trailer must not be placed in a way that makes the vehicle unstable or unsafe.

13I was satisfied that the material relied on established a prima facie case, that the breach of the load restraint requirements of s 56(1)(a) alleged, had occurred.

A prima facie case under s 51(b) established 

14The prosecutor relied on two documents annexed to his affidavit, to prove the second element of the alleged offence. Firstly, a witness statement signed by Robert John Walker on 28 September 2011 where Mr Walker acknowledged that he was the owner, and a director, of the company that operated the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident, Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd. Secondly, the printed results of an ASIC company extract search also evidenced that Mr Walker was a director of Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd.

15I was satisfied that the material relied upon established a prima facie case that Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd was the operator of the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident and that Robert John Walker was a director of that company. 

The effect of s 178(1) of the 2005 Act

16It followed that as a consequence of the operation of s 178(1) of the 2005 Act, Mr Walker, as a director of Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd, was deemed to have committed any offence committed by that company in breach of the 2005 Act.

Result and orders

17In the result, I was satisfied that the prosecutor had established a prima facie case that Robert John Walker had committed the offence alleged and accordingly made the orders sought under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

Thereby an order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the defendant, KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd, be brought before a judge of this Court to answer a charge under s 53(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 was sought.

2The prosecutor, a senior investigator in the Investigation and Enforcement Unit of the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), relied on an affidavit he had sworn on 11 July 2013, to which was annexed various documents, to support the application. 

3When the proceedings came before me, sitting as duty judge, on 12 July 2013, I made orders in terms sought in the summons. My reasons for making those orders follow.

5The driver of the combination, Mr Basil White, was later charged with manslaughter.

The charge under s 53(1) of the 2005 Act

6Section 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act empowers the Court to order a person to be brought before the Court for the purpose of answering a charge brought under the Court's summary jurisdiction. The prosecutor's case was that such an order would be made if a prima facie case under s 53(1) of the 2005 Act was established on the material relied on.

7Section 53(1) of the 2005 Act provided:

""53 Liability of consignor

...

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs, and
(b) the person is the consignor of any goods that are in or on the vehicle or combination concerned.""


A prima facie case of breach of the load restraint requirements of s 53(1)(a) was established

12The prosecutor also alleged that KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd was the consignor of the goods being carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

13The prosecutor relied on a document annexed to his affidavit. It was a document under the letterhead of KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd, signed by Dusko Knezevic, Operations Manager of KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd, which confirmed its consignment of the load carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

14I was satisfied that the material relied upon established a prima facie case that it was KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd who was the consignor of the goods being carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011accident.

2761941,Kemp v Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 963,"Judgment

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed on 12 July 2013 by the prosecutor, Peter Stewart Kemp. An order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the defendant, Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd, be brought before a judge of this Court to answer a charge under s 56(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005, was sought.

2The prosecutor, a senior investigator in the Investigation and Enforcement Unit of the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), relied on an affidavit he had sworn on 11 July 2013, to which were annexed various documents, to support the application. 

3When the proceedings came before me, sitting as duty judge, on 12 July 2013, I made orders in terms sought in the summons. My reasons for making those orders follow.

The factual background

4The prosecutor relied on briefs of evidence prepared by RMS and by NSW Police, as part of their investigations into an accident that had occurred on 14 July 2011 at Bathurst. They revealed that a heavy vehicle combination was delivering a load of steel beams from Newcastle to Orange that day. Part of the load swung out from the combination while it was travelling along the Mitchell Highway, colliding with a vehicle being driven in the opposite direction by Ms Leonie Darling, causing her death. Part of the load then fell from the combination, striking five other vehicles. 

5The driver of the combination, Mr Basil White, was later charged with manslaughter.

The charge under s 56(1) of the 2005 Act

6Section 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act empowers the Court to order a person to be brought before the Court for the purpose of answering a charge brought under the Court's summary jurisdiction. The prosecutor's case was that such an order would be made if a prima facie case under s 56(1) of the 2005 Act was established on the material relied on.

7Section 56(1) of the 2005 Act provided:

""56 Liability of operator
...
(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs, and
(b) the person is the operator of the vehicle or combination concerned.""


A prima facie case of breach of the load restraint requirements of s 56(1)(a) was established

8The prosecutor's case was that relevant to the breach of the load restraint requirement alleged was the provisions of clause 61 of the Road Transport (Mass, Loading and Access) Regulation 2005, which provided:

""61 Load requirements

(1) A load on a vehicle or a trailer must not be placed in a way that makes the vehicle unstable or unsafe.

(2) A load on a vehicle or a trailer must be secured so that it is unlikely to fall or be dislodged from the vehicle.

(3) An appropriate method must be used to restrain the load on a vehicle.

(4) In proceedings for a contravention of a requirement under this clause, it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the load on the vehicle was not placed, secured or restrained (as the case requires) in a way that met the performance standards recommended in the Load Restraint Guide: Guidelines and performance standards for the safe carriage of loads on road vehicles, Second Edition, as published by the National Transport Commission in April 2004.""



9Annexed to the prosecutor's affidavit, amongst other things, was a report of Mr Di Cristoforo, a road safety engineer who had been instructed by NSW Police to provide an expert report as to the manner of loading the load on the combination. 

10There Mr Di Cristoforo referred to a 'Load Restraint Guide' published in 2004 by the National Transport Commission, which refers to various requirements, including dunnage to be placed on a trailer deck. By reference to these requirements, he explained the basis for his opinion that the type of wood used in the dunnage of the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident was inadequate for the load being carried; and that for reasons which he explained, that this deficiency permitted the catastrophic movement of the load which caused the accident. 

11I was satisfied that the material relied on established a prima facie case, that the breach of the load restraint requirements of s 56(1)(a) alleged, had occurred.

A prima facie case that Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd was the operator the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident was established

12The prosecutor also alleged that Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd was an operator of the goods being carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

13The prosecutor relied on two documents annexed to his affidavit, to prove this element of his case. Firstly, the printed results of an ASIC company search that evidenced that a Mr Robert John Walker was a director of Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd. Secondly, a witness statement signed by Robert John Walker on 28 September 2011 which recorded Mr Walker confirming that he was the owner, and a director, of Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd, and that that company operated the combination involved in 14 July 2011 accident.

14I was satisfied that the material relied upon established a prima facie case that Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd was an operator of the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

Result and orders

15In the result, I was satisfied that the prosecutor had established a prima facie case that Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd had committed the offence alleged and accordingly made the orders sought under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

		24 July 2013",2013-07-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761944,Parkes v R [2013] NSWCCA 167,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA: The question in this appeal is whether the sentencing judge erred in not giving effect to a finding made by her Honour of special circumstances. The appellant was sentenced in the District Court on two counts of possession of a prohibited firearm, two counts of selling a prohibited firearm and one count of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. The total effective sentence imposed was imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of six years and six months with a balance of term of two years and six months. The appellant complains that the ratio in the overall effective sentence imposed by the sentencing judge between the non-parole period and the total sentence is 72% and that that does not adequately reflect the finding of special circumstances. 

2I have read the reasons of Price J in draft form. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour for the reasons proposed by him. 

3PRICE J: As this appeal involves a single issue which has been conceded by the Crown my reasons for upholding the appeal will be brief. The sole ground of appeal that the appellant relies on is that the sentencing judge erred in not giving effect to her finding of special circumstances. The grounds of appeal identify five other grounds, all of which have been abandoned by the appellant. 

4The appellant was sentenced in the District Court on 16 December 2011 as follows:

(i) Possession of a prohibited firearm on 12 August 2010 contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996; imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 13 October 2011 and expiring on 12 October 2013 with a balance of term of 1 year commencing on 13 October 2013 and expiring on 12 October 2014. 

(ii) Selling a prohibited firearm on 12 August 2010 to a person unauthorised to possess it contrary to s 51(1A)(a) Firearms Act; imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 13 October 2011 and expiring 12 October 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 13 October 2016 and expiring on 12 April 2019. 

(iii) Possession of a prohibited firearm on 2 September 2010 contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act; imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 13 April 2012 and expiring on 12 April 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year commencing on 13 April 2014 and expiring on 12 April 2015. 

(iv) Selling a prohibited firearm on 2 September 2010 to a person unauthorised to possess it contrary to s 51(1A) (a) Firearms Act; imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 13 April 2012 and expiring on 12 April 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 13 April 2017 and expiring on 12 October 2019 (CAN H42510466/004).

(v) Recklessly causing grievous bodily harm on 14 June 2010 contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act 1900; imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months commencing on 13 October 2010 and expiring on 12 February 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year 2 months commencing on 13 February 2014 and expiring on 12 April 2015. 

5The sentencing judge had been asked by the appellant to take into account on sentence an offence on a Form 1 that involved the possession of a small amount of cannabis.

6The total effective sentence imposed as a result of partial accumulation and concurrence was imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months commencing on 13 October 2010 and expiring on 12 April 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 13 April 2017 and expiring on 12 October 2019.

7During her remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge found special circumstances being the appellant's ""youth and his need ...for substantial supervision and guidance post release"" (ROS 11). Her Honour considered that the appellant ""will require assistance in financial control issue[s], substance abuse prevention, violence prevention and some thoughtful assistance in addressing his past violent upbringing"" (ROS 11). 

8The appellant's complaint is that the ratio in the overall effective sentence between the non-parole period and the total sentence is 72 per cent which the appellant contends does not adequately reflect the finding of special circumstances. The appellant does not contend that the overall head sentence of 9 years is excessive but submits that the non-parole period should be reduced. 

9The Crown supports the appellant's argument that her Honour erred in not giving effect to the finding of special circumstances. The Crown submits that the sentencing judge's variation in the statutory ratio is very minor and it appears that her Honour made a mathematical error such that the ratio does not reflect her stated intention. The Crown pointed out that the non-parole period in three of the individual sentences is 66 per cent of the total of these sentences. 

10In Stoeski v R [2008] NSWCCA 230, I said (Allsop P and Johnson J agreeing) at [25] - [26]: 

Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances. The size of an adjustment to the statutory ratio special circumstances having been found is essentially a matter within a Judge's discretion. As was observed by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] the size of an adjustment for special circumstances ""raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this court should be very slow to intervene"" and will not usually be interfered with unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive: see Cramp per Spigelman CJ at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [19]. There have been cases where this Court has intervened where it seems that the proportion of an effective non-parole period to an overall sentence has failed to give effect to a finding by a Judge of special circumstances: see for example Cicekdag v Regina per James J at [50]. 
The ultimate constraint, as was explained by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [63], upon a sentencing Judge's discretion following a finding of special circumstances, is that: 

""...the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.""

11The offences for which the appellant has been sentenced are serious. In short, the firearms offences involved two sales by the appellant of non-commercially manufactured 9mm submachine guns, with large capacity magazines and sound suppressors to an undercover police officer for $15,000 each. The sentencing judge found that the sale of the firearms was a planned or organized criminal activity in which the appellant was a minor player, as the final conduit between others more highly involved in the manufacture and supply of larger quantities of weapons.

12As to the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, the appellant, unprovoked by the victim had run up to him and punched him on the left side of his face. The victim was knocked unconscious. The injuries that the victim sustained as a result of the assault include a left orbit-zygomatic fracture of the cheek, permanent nerve damage to the left side of the face, some loss of vision in the left eye and two broken front teeth. Her Honour noted that the injuries suffered by the victim were significant but not in the worst category for an offence of this type. Her Honour found that the offence was below the mid-range of seriousness. 

13The material before the sentencing judge justified a finding of special circumstances. At the time of sentence, the appellant was a 23 year-old single man, with a minor criminal record as an adult. He had a history of chronic and quite severe poly-substance abuse, but was a person of average or better intelligence. Her Honour found that the appellant was motivated to avoid relapsing into substance abuse and had the support of his family. 

14Given the Crown's concession, I am persuaded that the adjustment in the statutory ratio by only three months was not intended by her Honour and a mathematical error has occurred. The Crown does not submit that an effective non-parole period of less than 6 years 6 months does not appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the appellant's offending. The appellant is to be re-sentenced. 

15The principal finding by her Honour of special circumstances was the appellant's need for supervision upon release. Clause 228 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 limits the amount of supervision that the appellant may receive on parole to 3 years. 

16It appears from the affidavit of the appellant's solicitor that the appellant is making an effort to overcome his substance abuse whilst in custody. He has been an active participant in the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program and has undertaken other educational courses. 

17In my opinion, the total effective sentence should be 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

18Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 

1. The appeal is upheld.
2. The sentence imposed by Syme DCJ for the sale of the prohibited 
firearm on 2 September 2010 (CAN H42510466/004) is quashed. In lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced for that offence to a term of imprisonment comprising of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 13 April 2012 and expiring on 12 October 2016 with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 13 October 2016 and expiring on 12 October 2019.
3. All other sentences imposed by Syme DCJ are confirmed. 

The earliest date the appellant is eligible to be released on parole is 13 October 2016.

19SCHMIDT J: I agree with Price J.

		19 July 2013",2013-07-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761946,R v Kristi Anne Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On the first day of a trial scheduled to commence in Sydney on 17 June 2013, the offender pleaded guilty to the first count in an indictment alleging that between 11 July 2010 and 18 July 2010 at Mount Druitt in the State of New South Wales she did murder Kiesha Weippeart. The offender had earlier, on 2 May 2013, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased and guilty to a second count on the indictment alleging that between the same dates at Shalvey and other places she improperly interfered with the body of the deceased. The Crown accepted the latter plea but not the former. 

2The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The deceased was the daughter of the offender and was aged six years and three months at the time of her death. In the event that a determinate sentence is imposed, a standard non-parole period of 25 years applies by reason of the age of the deceased. In proceeding to determine the appropriate sentence, I am not required to commence by considering whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period of 25 years. Similarly, I am not required to make an assessment of whether or not the offence is within the mid range of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]). The relevant statutory provisions generally, and the provisions of ss 55B(2), 54B(3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in particular, require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a judgment is reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]). The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27] and [31]).

3The offence of improperly interfering with the body of the deceased carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment.

The circumstances of the offence

4The offender and Christopher Weippeart were in a de facto relationship for a period from approximately 2002 until 2005. The offender gave birth to a son on 6 February 2003. He died from sudden infant death syndrome on 23 March 2003 aged six weeks. The deceased was born on 22 April 2004.

5On 4 July 2005 the deceased was admitted to Mt Druitt Hospital overnight for observation with a bite mark. The offender was subsequently charged with assault upon her and pleaded guilty. She was placed on a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for 12 months. The offender and Mr Weippeart separated after this offence. The deceased went from hospital into the custody of Mr Weippeart and his mother, and then into the care of the Department of Community Services.

6Following the separation, the offender formed a relationship with Robert Smith in 2006. He was introduced to the deceased during the course of DoCS approved visits. The deceased was returned to the care of the offender on 23 December 2006. Thereafter the offender and Mr Smith lived together with the deceased in a unit at Mt Druitt. Mr Weippeart had little involvement in raising the deceased. The offender and Mr Smith had two children of their own born respectively on 9 February 2008 and 7 July 2010. The deceased occupied one bedroom of the unit while the offender and Mr Smith shared the other bedroom with their two children.

7On Sunday, 1 August 2010, the offender called ""000"" and reported that she had awoken at approximately 9:30am and found that the deceased was missing from the unit. She said that the front door of the unit was open and that Mr Smith had gone to search for her. Police were immediately dispatched to the unit and a large-scale search and investigation commenced. They were unable to find any signs of forced entry into the unit, or any independent evidence of the deceased wandering out of the house by herself. The deceased was last seen by anyone other than the offender and Mr Smith at her cousin's birthday party on 11 July 2010.

8A police operation commenced in 2011. On 21 April 2011, the offender was secretly recorded making various admissions regarding the deceased's death. Until this time both she and Mr Smith had consistently told police, DoCS and the media that they had no knowledge of, or involvement in, the deceased's disappearance. 

9In the course of the recorded conversation, the offender stated that about one and a half to two weeks prior to reporting the deceased missing, she was in the deceased's bedroom where the deceased was crying. The offender wanted the deceased to put her pyjamas on and she gave her ""a little nudge"" with her foot. The deceased jumped and hit her head on the bottom of the bed. The offender said that the deceased went ""funny"" and she put her in the shower to try to ""wake her up"". At one point the offender agreed that it was a cold shower, at another point she said that it was lukewarm. The deceased made ""weird"" noises that the offender thought would go away but did not. The Crown does not accept this account of the act causing death.

10The offender said that the deceased then started to defecate and Mr Smith cleaned her. She said that the deceased felt like ""jelly"". The deceased appeared to be breathing so the offender and Mr Smith put her on a little fold-out lounge in their bedroom. The deceased did not bleed although there could be blood in the deceased's room from previous injuries she received. The offender and Mr Smith fell asleep and when they woke up the next morning the deceased was not breathing.

11Around 9am on the morning of the deceased's death, the offender and Mr Smith got a suitcase from their garage. Mr Smith placed the deceased's body in the suitcase, and put the suitcase in the deceased's bedroom. Mr Smith later took a hammer and a bike, and went to find a burial site. He located the burial site in bushland near his mother's residence at Shalvey.

12A few days after the deceased's death in the early hours of the morning, the offender and Mr Smith took the suitcase with the deceased's body to the burial site in a taxi. They took precautions with the pick-up and drop-off addresses, including booking the taxis under false names and disguising themselves to avoid being identified. Taxi records show that the offender and Mr Smith were picked up from Woodstock Avenue, Mt Druitt at 5.00am on 18 July 2010. They were subsequently collected at 7:15am on the same day from Sedgman Crescent, Shalvey, returning to Mt Druitt.

13Mr Smith dug a hole with the hammer and tipped the deceased's body out of the suitcase into the hole, poured petrol on the body, and burnt it. The deceased was wearing pink pyjamas and a purple jacket. Mr Smith placed dirt and a big branch over the body. They walked away some short distance where Mr Smith burnt the suitcase. The offender said that she did not go to the gravesite again but that Mr Smith returned the next day to make sure everything was all right. The offender threw out the clothing and shoes she had worn while disposing of the deceased's body. About one or two weeks after the deceased's death the offender phoned police to report the deceased missing.

14On the evening of 21 April 2011, the offender and Mr Smith unwittingly took members of the police service to the deceased's gravesite ostensibly to offer assistance with the disposal of the deceased's remains. Around 1.12am the following morning, the offender and Mr Smith were arrested near the gravesite and taken to Mt Druitt Police station. They were both offered an opportunity to be interviewed but declined.

15After the arrests on 22 April 2011, police went to the gravesite where they discovered skeletal remains, teeth, and fragments of hair in a shallow grave and scattered over the adjacent grounds in bushland. An examination of the remains found fresh, sharp chipped teeth fractures that occurred at or near the time of death. The deceased sustained other bony injuries over the weeks and months prior to her death. A forensic anthropologist determined that the state of preservation of her remains suggested that her death had occurred months prior to discovery. The deceased's body had been partially burnt prior to burial. A combination of decomposition and the burning of the deceased's body prevented a determination of the cause of death.

Medical evidence - cause of death

16Dr Matthew Orde, a forensic pathologist, conducted a post-mortem examination. Dr Orde's examination confirmed that the remains were those of the deceased. He found that the state of preservation of the remains suggested that death had occurred several months prior to discovery.

17Dr Orde could not conclusively determine a cause of death due to the prolonged post-mortem period and resultant tissue loss. However, he concluded that the presence of fresh-appearing fractures to several teeth raised the real possibility that the deceased may have sustained a severe head injury at or around the time of death, caused by the forcible closure of the mouth as the result of a blow to the head. He also found that many of the bones, notably the rear portions of the ribs and spinal bones, appeared to show features of burning. Some marks were also observed on the remains indicative of post-mortem predation by scavengers.

18Dr Orde further found evidence of earlier bony injury to the lower margins of the nasal bones, the maxilla, both sides of the mandible, and both clavicles. There was a possible prior injury to the parietal bone. A healing injury to the upper arm indicated trauma possibly two to four weeks prior to death consistent with having being caused by traction and/or twisting of the limb. Although Dr Orde could not make any reliable assessment of the timing of the majority of the bony injuries sustained by the deceased, their appearance suggested repeated injuries over the weeks and months prior to death.

19Dr Middleton, a specialist forensic odontologist, noted the loss of tooth enamel to be consistent with fracturing of the teeth. Those fractures appeared to be recent because they had sharp, fresh margins. The freshness of the fractures suggested that they occurred a maximum of three days prior to death although probably much closer. Dr Middleton found that the distribution pattern of the fracturing and the degree of staining were consistent with trauma during life rather than post-mortem fracturing.

20Dr Middleton further found that the pattern of distribution of the tooth fractures was consistent with the lower teeth (or jaw) being forced up against the upper teeth. The type and degree of force required to cause that fracturing of the enamel would not be within the parameters of normal function. Fracturing of the teeth on both sides was consistent with a similar significant amount of force being applied to the off-centre of the jaw area from different directions. Dr Middleton was of the opinion that one impact would not have been sufficient to cause the injury and that at least two impacts to the jaw occurred. In Dr Middleton's opinion, the type and degree of force required for such an injury would be equivalent to sporting contact or jumping from a height and landing heavily on the ground. In particular, Dr Middleton's evidence revealed the following matters.

21The deceased's tooth fractures occurred at or around the time of death but not after it. They were the result of blunt force trauma and were consistent with being punched in an upward direction. There were at least two, possibly three, separate abnormal and unexpected impacts to different sides of the deceased's jaw. The pattern and number of injuries is inconsistent with the account of the act given by the offender. The injuries were caused by the offender and resulted in the death of the deceased.

22A Certificate of Analysis dated 8 March 2012 was prepared by the Division of Analytical Laboratories in relation to DNA testing of various swabs taken by police from the crime scene at the offender's Mt Druitt premises. Test screening for blood returned positive results with a DNA profile matching that of the deceased in various areas of the unit, including on a mattress, blanket and bed sheet in her bedroom, as well as on the bedroom door, the linen cupboard door, a wall in the master bedroom, a rug in the dining room, and a lounge chair. There is no evidence as to the amounts of the deceased's blood detected or its age. 

23The offender has denied causing any prior injuries to the deceased. The Crown does not accept this.

Basis of liability for murder - relevant intent

24It is uncontroversial that the offender's plea of guilty to murder carries with it an acknowledgment that she caused the death of the deceased. In the present case, the offender's version of the events surrounding the death of the deceased is neither accepted by the Crown nor on one view consistent with the expert medical evidence. The precise cause of death is therefore not known and cannot be ascertained. That necessarily confounds any proper analysis aimed at determining beyond reasonable doubt the question of whether or not the offender committed an act or acts with the intention of killing the deceased, or did so only with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, or was recklessly indifferent to the life of the deceased. 

25The question as to whether there is a ""sliding scale of seriousness"" according to whether a murder offence was committed with an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference appears to be unsettled. In Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290, Simpson J said [at 49]:

""[49] Certainly, in a case of murder, the state of mind in which the offence is committed is a relevant consideration going to objective seriousness. As is well known, murder may be established by proof of an act causing death committed when the act is accompanied by any one of three states of mind: in descending levels of seriousness they are: intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference. I have no doubt that an intention to kill as distinct from either of the two alternatives, is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness rather than the lesser. So much is obvious...""




26However, in Tran, Hoai Vinh v R [2011] NSWCCA 116, after an analysis of a number of authorities on the issue (including Apps), Hidden J said at [39].
""[39] What emerges from these cases is what one would expect. Whether a killing was premeditated or, in any event, whether it was accompanied by an intention to kill are important questions in an assessment of where a murder lies in the range of objective gravity, but of themselves are not necessarily determinative. Invariably, there will be other circumstances in the particular case bearing on that assessment. In Versluys [2008] NSWCCA 76 at [36], McClellan CJ at CL said:

'When assessing the objective seriousness of any offence the court is required to identify the relevant facts and form an intuitive judgment based upon the experience of the courts in sentencing for the particular offence. This is true of murder as it is of any other offence... .'

Of course, the assessment of the objective gravity of an offence is an important aspect of any sentencing exercise, and one which requires careful consideration. For obvious reasons, this is particularly so when sentencing for offences for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed."" 


27Johnson J agreed with Hidden J but added a further observation at [44]-[45]:
""[44] Although it will generally be the case that an intention to cause grievous bodily harm is less culpable to a greater or lesser degree than an intention to kill in a case of murder, that is not always so and there may be circumstances where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm could reflect similar criminality to other cases involving an intention to kill: R v Nelson (NSWCCA 25 June 1996, unreported); R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312; 164 A Cnm R 252 at 258 [16].

[45] These statements have been made in decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal which predate the standard non-parole systems (R v Nelson) and which postdate that system (R v Hillsley). The statements are pertinent to the determination of objective seriousness of a crime of murder under the standard non-parole period system and, in my view, should be kept in mind in conjunction with the authorities and principles referred to in the judgment of Hidden J.""




28Since first frankly revealing her involvement in this matter, the offender has consistently maintained that her act causing the deceased's injury was ""an accident"". Indeed, the only account of the act causing death is that given by her. It was contended by the Crown that the offender's acts committed towards the deceased were more extreme than she admitted. It is agreed that the deceased sustained a lethal injury at the hands of the offender. The Crown submitted that the evidence concerning the number and direction of impacts apparently sustained by the deceased is at odds with ""a little nudge"" and a fall. It also submitted that I was entitled to find that the impacts described by Dr Middleton were occasioned during an assault upon the deceased by the offender, which resulted in a life-threatening state of health.

29The Crown contended that the number and intensity of the impacts inflicted upon a small and defenceless six-year-old child provided powerful evidence of an intent to cause really serious injury. Coupled with other evidence, that was sufficient to establish an intention to kill. The Crown raised the following matters in that context:

The offender's attitude towards the deceased

30On 3 July 2010, the offender bit the deceased. The deceased was aged 15 months at the time. On 1 May 2006, the offender pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was subsequently released on a s 9 bond for a period of 12 months. 

31The deceased's physical resemblance to the offender's former partner apparently annoyed her and triggered physical and verbal abuse towards the deceased. A few weeks prior to the deceased's death, the offender wanted her father to take the deceased because she predicted that she would kill her. According to the Crown, this statement informs how the offender felt towards the deceased and more importantly what she would do to her. 

32The offender has been recorded saying that after the deceased went ""funny"", she put her into the shower, and then into bed. She did not call an ambulance or make any effort to obtain medical assistance, thereby demonstrating a high level of disregard for the deceased. The Crown contends that the offender's treatment of the deceased's body after death is further evidence of enmity towards her.

The offender's intention to relocate the deceased

33The offender was at one time intending to send the deceased to live with her father in Canberra. The Crown contends that this suggests that there was an insurmountable problem between the offender and the deceased, and that the offender's ability to cope with the deceased had reached an irreversible level. The offender's proposal was effectively to send her six-year-old daughter to live interstate with a man who she had barely seen or spoken to for 15 years and who the offender claims had abused her as a child.

The offender's concealment of the deceased

34The deceased only attended school for four days, and had little contact with people other than the offender. She was kept in the apartment because she was regularly exhibiting signs of injury or abuse, and the offender could not risk those injuries being observed by others, particularly given the offender's previous dealings with DoCS and her opinion of its ""interference"". The offender was unconcerned about the deceased's attendance and development at school, pre-school, or day care, and did not attempt to include her in normal day-to-day activities such as playing in the park or visiting the shops.

Injuries sustained by the deceased prior to death

35There is considerable evidence that the deceased sustained many severe injuries during her life apart from those that ultimately caused her death. Such evidence is only relevant if I were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender caused them. The Crown contended that it would be relevant in a number of ways, primarily in order to support the proposition of the offender's enmity towards the deceased. 

36Dr Orde's evidence identified ten separate sites of injury to the surface of bones that occurred in the weeks and months prior to the deceased's death. These injuries included sharp-edged teeth fractures, injuries to the maxilla, a severe blunt force injury to the lower left side of jaw bone, a severe blunt force late healing injury to the right parietal bone above the right ear, healing fractures of the lower margins of the nasal bones caused by significant force, late healing injuries to both clavicles and a healing fracture of the upper right humerus occasioned by traction or twisting two to four weeks prior to death. None of these injuries would appear to have been the subject of medical intervention.

37The Crown contended that the history of injuries to the deceased demonstrated an escalation in their seriousness, particularly in the last 18 months of her life and that at least some of them, such as the bony injuries, amounted to grievous bodily harm. The Crown contended that even if I were not satisfied that the offender caused them, I could still be satisfied that she was the primary caregiver at the time the deceased sustained the injuries but that she did not obtain medical assistance for her. These matters are said to be relevant to the offender's state of mind at the time of the act causing death.

38The evidence indicates that both the offender and Mr Smith had the care of the deceased at all relevant times. Even if Robert Smith had caused the injuries, it would have been apparent to the offender. Unless I can be satisfied that the offender was directly responsible for these injuries, the evidence cannot be used against her except in terms of her failure to summon medical care. 

39The offender emphasised the following matters. Dr Orde could not determine the cause of death. The only evidence of injury that is capable of revealing a cause of death is Dr Middleton's evidence of ""more than one blow"" to the deceased's head.

40It is apparent that the offender did not call for medical help when she saw the severity of the deceased's injury, despite the deceased not dying for some hours. It is on this basis that the offender says she acted with reckless indifference to the deceased's life.

41It is acknowledged in the agreed facts that the offender had difficulty coping with parenting, and that she was at times bad-tempered towards the deceased. Her father's evidence that the offender said she would hurt or kill the deceased is derived from his conversation with her that took place more than a month before the deceased died and in the context that he telephoned the offender possibly an hour or two after their first conversation, by which time the offender had ""calmed down"".

42The offender contended that her participation in the disposal of the deceased's body and her lies to the police and the media were not evidence of ""enmity"" towards the deceased, but rather evidence of her continuing desire to avoid detection and the likely removal of her children.

43The offender submitted that there was no evidence to establish anything other than that she had a reckless indifference to the deceased's life.

44I do not consider that it is possible to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender inflicted the earlier identified non-lethal injuries upon the deceased. The collocation of events and circumstances identified by the Crown undoubtedly raises a high level of suspicion that the offender was either directly involved or indirectly complicit in the infliction of the injuries. Suspicion alone is not however a proper basis to make findings adverse to the offender. 

45On the contrary, I do find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender at least recklessly failed to take any appropriate steps to deliver or secure prompt or appropriate care and attention to the deceased after she sustained her ultimately fatal injuries. Such a finding is available beyond reasonable doubt upon the basis that the offender committed the act that eventually caused death, that she was aware that the deceased had sustained a life threatening condition, that she realised that death would probably occur if medical attention was not sought but that she proceeded to take that risk nothwithstanding.

46I pause to observe that there is no expert or other medical evidence or opinion offered to enable me to determine the time of death of the deceased. It is not therefore possible for me to make any findings beyond reasonable doubt about the nature or extent of the offender's opportunity, in the period between her infliction of the injuries that caused the death and when it occurred, to obtain medical assistance for the deceased or correspondingly about whether that would have altered the outcome. For example, according to a version of what occurred given by the offender, the deceased went like jelly and was defecating during the unsuccessful attempts to revive her. One might be prepared to conclude from those matters that the deceased had already died before, or at least by the time, she was taken to the shower. It will be apparent, however, that such a conclusion cannot be reached without evidence and certainly not beyond reasonable doubt. The only findings available upon the time of death are that the deceased died at some time before the offender observed her the following morning and that no medical assistance was sought before that occurred.

47Logically anterior to a finding that the offender acted with reckless indifference to human life, and necessarily in this case more difficult, is the question of whether or not the offender also either intended to kill the deceased or committed the act or acts that killed her with the intention of inflicting serious injury. Written submissions provided to me by Ms Manuell SC for the offender specifically concede that the deceased ""sustained a severe head injury at the hands of the offender and that [she] died as a result"". The offender's concession, however, is relevantly neutral in this context. 

48On the one hand the offender's version of events, that she gave the deceased ""a little nudge"" with her foot and that she struck her head on the bottom of the bed, cannot be accommodated by or within the expert evidence that the deceased sustained a series of blows of sufficient force to cause her teeth to become chipped or fractured. I reject the suggestion that those injuries could have been caused by striking her head on the bed as suggested by the offender. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were not. On the other hand, the expert opinions concerning the posited force and direction of the blows or impacts that caused the deceased's observable injuries do not circumscribe or explain precisely what happened to her in fact. There is therefore an evidentiary gap between the offender's concession that she committed the act that killed the deceased and a satisfactory understanding of just how that occurred. Any finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender committed the act that killed the deceased with the intention of doing so or of causing her really serious injury must therefore accommodate that gap.

49It was in these circumstances that Ms Manuell's submissions quite understandably directed attention to the extent of the use that could be made of Dr Middleton's prognostications concerning what happened to the deceased and specifically to the issue of how many blows might have been inflicted upon her. It is necessary to consider them.

50Dr Middleton gave evidence of his opinion as to the number of blows said to have been sustained by the deceased. He was first qualified in respect of this matter in April 2011. Since then he has provided four reports and had a conference with the DPP on 22 June 2012. Dr Middleton agreed that in each of his reports he gave the opinion that the deceased sustained ""more than one blow"". In the notes of the conference on 22 June 2011, Dr Middleton is noted as saying, ""If limited to one side, there would not have been bilateral injuries to the teeth, so a number of collisions to the jaw occurred"". The words ""a number of collisions"" are not, on their face, inconsistent with Dr Middleton's earlier, repeated opinion that there was ""more than one blow"".

51In his oral evidence, Dr Middleton said, ""The absolute minimum would have to be three [blows] and I would be hesitant to go that low. I would say more like four or five absolute minimum."" In cross-examination he was asked, ""In fact, in your reports, when you were carefully considering the material over a period of more than two years, the only conclusion you could safely draw was that there had been more than one blow; isn't that right?"" He replied, ""That's correct."" 

52Dr Middleton's evidence that there were possibly three but more likely a minimum of four or five blows sustained by the deceased is clearly more adverse to the offender than simply ""more than one blow."" He agreed that he had not previously described the blows in that way. It must be presumed that the Crown did not know Dr Middleton was going to give this evidence, since notice of it was not given to the offender. It was submitted in these circumstances that Dr Middleton's evidence of three, four, five or more blows had the hallmarks of recent invention and should not be accepted.

53Additionally, a fundamental difficulty with Dr Middleton's evidence as to the number of blows sustained by the deceased is that it is evidence of biomechanics. Dr Middleton is not a biomechanic and had no expertise in the area, both matters with which he agreed. He also agreed that there were no papers or research that he could rely upon to support a more exact estimate of the number of blows. Dr Middleton's attempt to quantify the number of blows the deceased sustained is clearly a matter that is outside his expertise. The purported, and spurious, proffering of ""expert"" evidence in the field of biomechanics was discussed in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [466] - [477].

54Moreover, in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85], Heydon JA said: 

""In short, if evidence tendered as expert opinion evidence is to be admissible, it must be agreed or demonstrated that there is a field of 'specialised knowledge'; there must be an identified aspect of that field in which the witness demonstrates that by reason of specified training, study or experience, the witness has become an expert; the opinion proffered must be 'wholly or substantially based on the witness's expert knowledge'; so far as the opinion is based on facts 'observed' by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on 'assumed' or 'accepted' facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way; it must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it; and the opinion of an expert requires demonstration or examination of the scientific or other intellectual basis of the conclusions reached: that is, the expert's evidence must explain how the field of 'specialised knowledge' in which the witness is expert by reason of 'training, study or experience', and on which the opinion is 'wholly or substantially based', applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded. If all these matters are not made explicit, it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert's specialised knowledge. If the court cannot be sure of that, the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible, and, so far as it is admissible, of diminished weight. And an attempt to make the basis of the opinion explicit may reveal that it is not based on specialised expert knowledge, but, to use Gleeson CJ's characterisation of the evidence in HG v R (1999) 197 CLR 414, on 'a combination of speculation, inference, personal and second-hand views as to the credibility of the complainant, and a process of reasoning which went well beyond the field of expertise' (at [41]).""




55The only evidence Dr Middleton could properly give within his area of expertise was that the positioning of the fractures to the deceased's teeth established that different directional forces from more than one blow caused them. He was unable legitimately to say more than that. Significantly as well, Dr Middleton was not able to rule out that the deceased's teeth could have been damaged in the period between death and burial. His opinion as to the timing of the fractures was ultimately predicated on soil staining of the teeth, not the date of death. It is not in issue that there was a period of some two to three days between death and burial, and that during this period there was rough handling of the body. 

56Associate Professor Richard Widmer, who is a paediatric dental specialist rather than a forensic odontologist, gave unchallenged evidence that the dental damage evident on the teeth of the deceased, as depicted in the post mortem photographs, was strongly suggestive of traumatic dental damage. He offered the opinion that it would appear to have happened around the time of the death of the deceased.

57I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender relevantly formed an intention to kill the deceased. There is no direct evidence to support such a finding. Such inferences as are available from the evidence are weak or ambiguous. For example, there is evidence of physical abuse of the deceased over an extended period before her death but unrelated to it. Putting aside the fundamental problem with that evidence, that it cannot be established that the offender committed the acts that caused the injuries concerned, the assumed conduct was non-lethal and correspondingly uninstructive upon the question of the offender's intent with respect to the offence of murder. The injuries to the deceased cannot in my opinion be confidently arranged in an order suggesting a chronological increase in severity. Indeed, the particular mechanisms by which they were inflicted are in every case necessarily mired in doubt.

58The mechanism of the death of the deceased is also unknown beyond general and hypothetical terms. My rejection of the offender's version of what happened does not automatically operate to elevate some otherwise available competing hypothesis about it to the requisite level of satisfaction. Indeed, even accepting for the purposes of the analysis that the deceased died as the result of a series of blows to her jaw sufficient to cause the observed damage to her teeth, such an acceptance produces no more than a reasonable suspicion that she was struck in that way in order to cause injury of some sort. It is insufficient, except with the illegitimate benefit of hindsight, with which to reason to a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries were inflicted with an intention to cause death. A significant countervailing inference arises from the fact, which I find on the balance of probabilities, that the offender sought, albeit unsuccessfully, to revive the deceased in the immediate period following the infliction of the ultimately fatal injuries.

59Nor does the apparently fraught physical and emotional relationship between the offender and the deceased reliably inform this inquiry. The Crown has emphasised, for example, that the offender has admitted that she was intending to send the deceased to live with her father. As extraordinary as that proposal may on one view appear to have been, it is not altogether inconsistent with the offender acknowledging that the deceased would be better off if she were moved. It does not come close in my view to assisting a determination of the offender's intentions at some later stage. The same applies to the offender's attempts to conceal the deceased's injuries from childcare professionals employed by the relevant department.

60On the contrary, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased when she committed the act that caused her death. I am satisfied that the offender caused such harm, by reason of the combination of the offender's concession that the deceased sustained a severe head injury at her hands, and the evidence of damage to the deceased's teeth referred to by Dr Middleton and Dr Orde. I have formed that view upon the basis that the force required to cause the injuries described by these doctors was only consistent with an intention to cause really serious injury. I am confirmed in arriving at that finding by the fact that more than one blow was administered to the deceased. An attack upon a six-year-old child with that amount of force is wholly inconsistent with the existence of an intention to cause less than really serious injury. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that no more than two blows were inflicted.

Objective gravity of the offence of murder

61The determination of where on the scale of criminality a given offence lies is an essential part of any sentencing exercise, whether or not the offence attracts a standard non-parole period: Hinchcliffe v R [2010] NSWCCA 306 at [31]; Mitchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 145 at [16]. The following matters appear to be relevant to a consideration of that question.

62The evidence establishes that the deceased is likely to have suffered a severe brain injury which, together with the failure to obtain medical care, caused her death. The offender was the deceased's mother and so had a high duty of care towards her. The offender significantly breached that duty. The trust reposed in a parent by a child must be taken to be of the highest and utmost importance: R v Ha [2008] NSWSC 1368 at [42]. I must be mindful of ""the heavy responsibility that rests upon a parent to care for a child who is otherwise utterly defenceless"": R v Wilkinson [1999] NSWCCA 248 at [26].

63The deceased was vulnerable because of her age, although this is reflected in the standard non-parole period and should not be double-counted. The deceased was towards the lower end of the range of ages encompassed by the standard non-parole period but not at the very lowest end. The standard non-parole period applying to cases involving the death of a child and the maximum penalty make it plain that the offence is regarded as a serious offence.

64There is no evidence to suggest that the offence of murder was planned. It was submitted on the offender's behalf that she appears to have acted spontaneously, possibly as the result of fatigue. She then had the care of three young children, including her baby less than two weeks old. A submission to this effect may accord with possibilities informed by human experience but the evidence about it rises no higher than supposition.

65There is no evidence that a weapon was used to inflict injury upon the deceased.

66Although the evidence establishes that the offender had been short-tempered with the deceased in the past, and that she was not coping, I have already indicated that the evidence is insufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had previously caused injuries to the deceased, other than the bite mark in 2005. In any event, before any evidence of an uncharged act may be taken into account on sentence, the offender must admit to it: see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [18] as follows:

""[18] The offender may have conspired with others to import the drugs; the offender may very well have intended to deal with the drugs in Australia in ways that amount to the commission of other offences in this country. But it would be quite wrong to sentence an offender for crimes with which that offender is not charged..."" 

67This principle was explained further by Spigelman CJ in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; (2000) 112 A Crim R 466 at [54]-[56]:

""[54] In England the Court of Appeal considered the practice of specimen counts in R v Kidd [1998] 1 WLR 604 (reported sub nom R v Canavan [1998] 1 Cr App R 79). Lord Bingham CJ said at 607; 81-82:
'A defendant is not to be convicted of any offence with which he is charged unless and until his guilt is proved. Such guilt may be proved by his own admission or (on indictment) by the verdict of a jury. He may be sentenced only for an offence proved against him (by admission or verdict) or which he has admitted and asked the court to take into consideration when passing sentence: see R v Anderson (Keith) [1978] AC 964. If, as we think, these are basic principles underlying the administration of the criminal law, it is not easy to see how a defendant can lawfully be punished for offences for which he has not been indicted and which he has denied or declined to admit.

It is said that the trial judge, in the light of the jury's verdict can form his own judgment of the evidence he has heard on the extent of the offending conduct beyond the instances specified in individual counts. But this, as it was put in R v Hutchison [1972] 1 WLR 398, 400 is to 'deprive the appellant of his right to trial by jury in respect of the other alleged offences'. Unless such other offences are admitted, such deprivation cannot in our view be consistent with principle.'

[55] The effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is that, absent an admission, the court should not take into account commission of other offences when sentencing for particular offences charged. The position is otherwise, it appears, in the case of an admission.

[56] The reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Kidd is consistent with the reasoning of Brennan J in Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 288-289:

'Even where the practice of charging a representative offence has been sanctioned, it has been held essential that the express and unequivocal assent of the offender be given before an offence for which he has not been convicted is taken into account: R v Anderson [1978] AC 964 at 977. Without the offender's assent it would be wrong to deprive him of his right to trial by jury for that offence: R v Huchison [1972] 1 WLR 398; (1972) 56 Cr App R 307; R v Reiner (1974) 8 SASR 102'."" 
68The offence was committed in the home, when two other young children were present. There is however, no evidence to establish that either of the other children (then aged respectively two years and less than two weeks) witnessed the act causing the deceased's brain injury, or were in any other way aware of what occurred.

69The offence, or more particularly the failure to call medical care, was committed in company, but not in the aggravating sense that it caused fear in the victim so that resistance was futile because reinforcements were at hand.

70The offender was not subject to conditional liberty. She has an intellectual disability and had a highly dysfunctional childhood, both of which led to her emotional dysregulation. In her ""interview"" with the undercover operative, the offender repeatedly says that what happened to the deceased was ""an accident"" and that she did not intend seriously to hurt her. It was submitted on her behalf that the known circumstances are highly suggestive that the offender's intellectual disability, in combination with her childhood experiences, contributed to this offence, in the sense that ""the offender's capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected"": R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [86].

71It has also been contended that immediately following the commission of the acts that led to the death of the deceased the offender was subject to considerable conflict. It was apparent to her that the deceased had been seriously injured and yet she had the certain knowledge that informing the authorities of what had just occurred would result in her children being taken into care. The offender's limited cognitive reasoning skills are very likely to have contributed to her decision not to call an ambulance following the deceased's injury.

72In R v O'Brien [2003] NSWCCA 121, the offender failed to have her 14-month-old child hospitalised when advised by a medical practitioner that urgent hospitalisation was required. Dunford J said at [74]: 

""[74] This was a very serious offence. The appellant allowed her 14 months old, helpless and defenceless child to die. She was the child's mother, the person from whom above all others, the child was entitled to expect nurture, care, sustenance and protection, and she failed the child in her most important duty, with fatal results."" 

73In R v Turchino [2005] NSWSC 1214 Latham J said this at [62] and [64]:

""[62] It is difficult to comprehend Mr Turchino's concern about the intervention of the Department of Community Services and/or the police over and above his concern for the welfare of the child, especially one he considered to be his own. ...

...

[64] ...His failure to notify the authorities or to seek assistance as soon as he realised that the child had been scalded is simply inexplicable.""




74The offender contends that she is remorseful. In this respect I note that the offender did not give evidence before me. The submission is based principally upon what the offender can be seen and heard to have done and said when covertly recorded in a conversation with the police. During the course of that conversation the offender can be seen to become upset when recalling some of the circumstances closely associated with the death of the deceased. It is submitted that the emotions exhibited by her in those circumstances were genuine, as there was no apparent reason for her to feign such emotions at the time.

75The Crown has contended on the contrary that the offender's conduct at other times indicates a complete lack of contrition and remorse. For example, it is noted that she was prepared to stand by whilst the deceased's body was burnt and buried with the intention that her remains might never be discovered. That circumstance is said to counter any display of emotion that may have been evident in her recorded conversation.

76The offender had a prior conviction for an offence of ""serious personal violence"" (the biting offence) against the deceased in 2005. She was convicted of this offence but was placed on a good behaviour bond.

77It is unlikely that the offender will re-offend, at least because at the end of her term of imprisonment her children will no longer be young. She is unlikely again to be exposed to the same pressures. The offender has pleaded guilty to the offence.

78I consider that this offence of murder lies in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of cases of its type. In making that assessment I expressly disregard the evidence tending to suggest that the deceased had been abused on other occasions for the reasons already noted. I also expressly disregard the circumstances attending the post-offence conduct and the disposal of the deceased's body, as they are either wholly or significantly referable to the additional charge.

79I also note in making that assessment that it seems highly likely that the death of the deceased occurred quickly and that it was the result of an impulsive and uncontrolled act of violence. I have regrettably not been provided with medical opinion upon the issue but the condition of the deceased described by the offender during attempts to revive her appears to me to have been consistent with some form of flaccid paralysis or total neurological collapse. It is unknown precisely how much time elapsed before the offender took the deceased to the shower but I consider that more probably than not she was unconscious and moribund from the time of the infliction of the injuries that led to her death or from a very short time thereafter. I do not accept and I specifically reject the offender's version, given to the undercover police officer, that the deceased was able to respond to a request to squeeze the offender's finger.

80I have already indicated that it is not possible on the state of the evidence to make findings about the timing of death beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover, there does not appear to be evidence that the offender has either prevaricated concerning the sequence of events following infliction of injury, as opposed to the circumstances that occasioned it, or about the precise period for which she relevantly delayed seeking medical assistance. I consider on the balance of probabilities that even the timely summoning of medical care would not have altered the outcome having regard to the offender's description of the deceased during attempts to revive her. To that extent this case is not one where an offender has stood by at length to let a child die when timely intervention would certainly have prevented it.

81The objective seriousness of this case lies in the circumstance that the offender caused the death of the deceased by the infliction of a violent, lethal force upon what was a vulnerable and defenceless child in her care, who was entitled to expect and receive her protection, and who could not have consciously caused or contributed to whatever emotions or loss of control accompanied the assault. I have already found that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in doing so the offender assaulted the deceased with the intention of causing really serious injury.

Objective gravity of the s 81C(b) Crimes Act 1900 offence

82This charge relates to the disposal of the deceased's body. The evidence establishes that following the death of the deceased, the offender and Mr Smith placed the body in a suitcase and put it in the deceased's bedroom. About two or three days later, they took the suitcase to bushland near Shalvey and placed it in a shallow grave dug by Mr Smith. He then poured petrol on the body and set fire to it. He placed dirt over the body, to extinguish the fire and cover it. The offender stood by watching. The offender and Mr Smith then did a number of things to conceal their disposal of the body, including burning the suitcase, throwing out the clothes and shoes they wore to the bush and destroying their mobile phone SIM cards.

83The conduct of an offender following the death of a victim, depending on that conduct, can be an aggravating circumstance of a murder offence: Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126. However where, as here, the offender's conduct is separately charged, a separate punishment must be imposed without the offender being doubly punished.

84In Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at [40] and [45]:

""[40] To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.

...

[45] To an offender, the only relevant question may be 'how long', and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59.""




85The offender contended that in light of her plea of guilty to this offence, her actions following the death of the deceased could not be used to aggravate the sentence imposed for the murder. Rather, the criminality of each of the offences must be carefully identified and then separate sentences must be formulated for each. The issue of totality must then be considered. In this last respect, regard must be had to the offender's subjective circumstances common to both offences. I agree.

86I have expressly disregarded any of the offender's conduct consisting of uncharged acts allegedly occurring before the act that caused the death of the deceased and any conduct thereafter in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence of murder. I am even so of the opinion that the circumstances surrounding the disposal of the body constitute a very serious example of improperly interfering with or offering an indignity to the body of the deceased.

87The body was kept in a suitcase at the home for something in the order of three days. It was then transported unceremoniously and without respect in the same container to a remote location, hopefully to be hidden from view and, so it would clearly appear, never to be seen again. The body was set on fire for no reason beyond an assumed desire further to reduce recognition and presumably detection.

88This offence falls objectively into the most serious category of offences of this type.

The offender's subjective circumstances

89It is contended on behalf of the offender, and properly conceded by the Crown, that she has the benefit of a strong subjective case. That understanding derives in a significant degree from material contained in a series of very comprehensive and helpful reports prepared by Mr Peter Champion, a clinical psychologist. Mr Champion had the unique but valuable benefit of having examined and assessed the offender when she was only ten and a little more than three years later when she was just 14. He also examined and reported upon the offender for the express purposes of these proceedings in May this year. There is however other evidence that is relevant to the offender's subjective circumstances as well. 

Mr Champion's reports

90The offender is currently 30 years of age and so was 27 years of age at the time of the commission of the offences.

91Mr Champion first saw the offender in June 1994 following her mother's death. He was retained by DoCS to assess her and her brother prior to her being made a ward of the State. He saw her again in May 1997. Mr Champion initially assessed the offender's intellectual capacity and found her to be functioning in the borderline disabled range. He also noted various issues that confronted her. These included her grief and sense of loss following the death of her mother. It would appear that an inappropriate degree of responsibility had been given to the offender for managing her mother's epilepsy. This was completely inappropriate for a child then of her age and was made worse because of her intellectual disability. This created the unfortunate prospect that the offender might irrationally come to blame herself for her mother's death.

92The offender was also found to have been exposed to serious domestic violence. This is referred to in more detail later in these remarks. The offender formed the belief that her father had caused her mother's death. The offender ended up rejecting her father and his family, and consequently her own aboriginality. In this setting she became subject to racist comments from a close family member that were inconsistent with the love and care she was entitled ordinarily to expect from that person. Considerable and detrimental tension developed between the offender and that person who was, or should have been, her only potential alternative primary carer. This led the offender to feel that this person's anger about the death of her mother was being directed at her.

93Mr Champion detected that the offender was in a state of denial and suffered from severe anxiety. She developed problems at school, as well as sleep problems and lethargy. The offender's residential and educational status was severely disrupted and remained unstable over many years. The offender was in a constant state of uncertainty as to her future placement.

94Mr Champion assessed the offender again in May 1997 at the request of Care Force. He noted that after the offender and her brother were made wards of the State, they were placed separately in foster care, then together into an Aboriginal group home, and then together into foster care for three months before being sent back into the Aboriginal group home.

95Mr Champion did not undertake an intellectual assessment of the offender in 1997 because she had been recently assessed at school. He noted her results showed that she was functioning in the range of upper mild to borderline developmental disability, with a full IQ score of 68. He observed that ""the fact of her disability is... undoubted"". He said consideration could be given to placing her in special education, although it was thought to be preferable to keep her in mainstream schooling to aid her social progress. He recommended that plans be developed to assist with her social and vocational development.

96Mr Champion expressed the following opinion:

""She tended to be quite defensive in her reporting, which I gather is not uncommon for her, in that she tends to shy aware [sic - away] from having to explain her thoughts and feelings to others. One cannot of course ignore the issue of her intellectual competence in all this, in that she might well find it threatening to have to try to confront issues which are of themselves traumatic, which are difficult to conceptualise, which are difficult to explain, and into which she perhaps has limited insight. One might also surmise that her reticence is also a function of the confusion she herself feels in relation to many topics, where many of her thoughts are in conflict. She is also of course a lass who has been faced with more than a measure of uncertainty and turmoil in terms of placement, despite the fact that she has been in care for some time now, and thus in a situation of flux and unpredictable future, it is perhaps not unusual for any child to keep their own counsel.""

97In terms of the issues facing the offender in 1997, Mr Champion noted the following matters:



She suffered from an incomplete resolution of her grief at the death of her mother.

She had a sense of ""guilt that she had not in some way avoided [her mother's death] or acted in a way to prevent it"".



She was challenged by her family member's blame of ""an aborigine"" for the death of her mother since it conflicted with her own sense that she too was Aboriginal.



She had a difficult and conflicted relationship with her brother: on the one hand, she felt the need (and perhaps had made a promise to her mother) to look after and protect her brother, so she felt a deep sense of responsibility for him but, on the other hand, was aware of her brother's behavioural difficulties and felt that he might be a bar to her placement in a foster family that she very much wanted.



She experienced significant feelings of emotional deprivation, poverty of emotional connection and loneliness, causing her to over-eat and become obese. 



She demonstrated inconsistent maturation. Although she appeared to be socially able, she had ""a great affection for things which are more in keeping with a much younger child"", such as ""Bananas in Pyjamas paraphernalia"", even at the age of 13 years 11 months. This suggested that her emotional needs had not been met for many years, and that despite her social maturation ""there [were] still significant immature dependency needs present"".

98Mr Champion administered a test for depression and expressed the following opinion:

""Looking at [the offender] responding, the impression was that she was subject to a variety of troubling thoughts and feelings, which she perhaps did not understand very well and did not know how to cope with... Overall her pattern of performance was broadly consistent with what one might expect of a lass who has been subject to abuse, who has lost both her parents, and who has not been able to find a viable reliable replacement for them, and who is subject to feelings of guilt and inadequacy."" 

99Mr Champion noted that the offender's rejection of her father meant that any contact with him at all was ""contraindicated"".

100Mr Champion summarised his 1997 report, saying that the offender had a ""significant level of intellectual disability"" but that because she was quite well socialised, ""her limitations [were] not always obvious"". He said that rather than therapy, which would have been of limited utility for her because ""she finds intrusive discussions about her feelings confronting and anxiety provoking"" in the context of her intellectual disability, the better option was to place her ""in a family where she could begin to receive the sort of emotional care she has been desperately seeking for some years"".

101Despite the very strong terms of Mr Champion's report of 29 May 1997, the offender was not placed with a family but instead remained in the Aboriginal group home until she left to live in a girls' refuge at the age of 16 years.

102Mr Champion again assessed the offender on 30 May 2013. At this time she had indicated an intention to plead guilty to manslaughter and the s 81C(b) offence. He once again assessed her intellectual functioning, confirming his earlier findings that she had a mild to borderline intellectual disability. There was some variability in her sub-tests, which is not unusual, but he found that overall the offender functioned in the bottom two percent of the population.

103Mr Champion summarised his findings in fairly guarded language having regard to the status of these proceedings, but was of the following opinions: 



The offender has a demonstrated intellectual disability, ""which could be expected to limit her in terms of judgment and learning and coping with stressful situations"".



The offender was not mentally ill within the meaning of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.



As a result of her inadequate bonding and attachment, the offender's needs have probably not been met and, combined with the other problems she has experienced, ""she may struggle to prioritise the needs of her children over her own needs"".



A diagnosis of a personality disorder could not be made on the basis of one assessment as an adult, but if she does have such a disorder then the symptoms of the condition ""tend to make [sufferers] unpredictable parents, unable to provide consistent care and nurturance, and with the potential to be abusive"". 



A child's exposure to violence might impact negatively on development, attitudes, values and behaviours. It might also negatively impact on parenting behaviour either because of ""underlying anger resentment which is easily triggered and externalised (towards children for instance)"" or because it might encourage aggression in the individual.



If the allegations of previous abuse were to be established, it could probably be assumed that the offender ""lacked the ability to parent appropriately, lacked the ability to control her own behaviour and to quarantine her emotions and hence lacked the ability... consistently [to] parent her children without aggression"". 



In gaol, the offender should be given psychiatric and psychological care as required and access to appropriate educational programs. She should also be supported by DoCS or such other department as may be appropriate to her age and status upon her release.

Intellectual disability

104An offender's intellectual disability is relevant on sentence in the ways identified by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1. There, his Honour said at [177] - [178]:
""[177] Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing...They can be summarised in the following manner:

· Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence...

· It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed...

· It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced... 

· It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence...

· Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public... 

[178] I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence..."" [Citations omitted]

105In coming to the views I have formed, I have taken account of these matters. I have also had regard to Mr Champion's evidence in the light of the stated principles.

Confidential Exhibit ""1""

106A letter signed on 23 June 2013 by a member of the offender's family provides significant background information about her early family circumstances. I marked the letter in question as a confidential exhibit because of a concern that its author and others to which it referred should not be publicly identified. The Crown accepted the authenticity of the reasons for that concern as well as the reliability of the contents of the letter. I have also taken the view that it is not appropriate to disclose the reasons why the author of the letter had such concerns, as that may itself be inimical to the maintenance of the confidence.

107It is evident from this letter that the offender's first ten years were characterised by:

(1) The extreme violence of her father, both towards her mother (which was witnessed by the offender) and to the offender herself.

(2) Her mother's lack of bonding with the offender because of the mother's distraction with the ongoing violence in her relationship.

(3) Her mother's preference for the offender's young brother.

(4) Her mother's epilepsy, in circumstances where the offender appears to have been made responsible for caring for her mother when she had seizures, and where ultimately it was the offender who listened to her mother's last seizure and then found her mother dead.

(5) The constant dislocation from home to home and between States.

(6) Poverty.

(7) Disrupted and erratic schooling, with a correlating failure educationally to address the offender's intellectual disability. 

(8) Disrupted social and extended family connections.

108The family member also detailed the offender's circumstances following the death of her mother. The offender's father was, it would seem, neither interested in taking, nor equipped to take, the children or in maintaining any kind of contact with them. The offender was initially placed with another family member who was in poor health, grieving the death of the offender's mother and ill-equipped to cope with the physical and emotional demands placed on her by two young and disturbed children.

109In July 1994, when the offender was 11 years old and her brother three years old, the children were made wards of the State. It was the recommendation of DoCS that a care order be made and that the children should be placed together in a non-Aboriginal family. This recommendation was made despite statutory provisions to the effect that Aboriginal children should be placed in Aboriginal care. This was because the offender's experiences with her Aboriginal father caused her to reject her aboriginality. Despite the recommendation, the offender and her brother were placed in an Aboriginal children's group home. The offender remained there for three or four years despite advertisements being placed for a foster family to take the children. It appears from the family member's letter that the emotional support that the offender so greatly needed was not provided within the Aboriginal group home. It also appears that, at this time, contact between the offender and her maternal extended family was disrupted, partly because members of that family had their own problems and partly because of the difficulty in communication between the group home administrators and the family.

110The letter has a series of attachments. At least one of them requires mention. As part of legal proceedings that ensued following the death of the offender's mother, she was asked to write down everything that she remembered about her father's violence towards her or that she had seen. She was eleven years old at the time. The offender produced a two-page document in her own handwriting. It is sometimes slightly difficult to read by reason of the immature script, and it also contains spelling errors. Making allowance for each of these, the document is in the following terms:

""The things I remember what my dad did to my mum

1. When my dad strangled my mum when we were going out of the car. That was in Queensland.

2. When my dad had steel capped boots on and kicked her in the head.

3. When my dad had a big bottle and went to throw it in between my mum's legs.

4. My dad went to punch her on the nose and broke her nose.

5. And he kept hurting my mum...on the head.

6. When my mum went to work and my dad was minding me and when my mum came home I had bruises all over me.

7. And when I went to school I fell off a big beam and when I went was home time he went to kick my very sore leg.

8. My dad went to kick my mum in the tummy really hard.

9. When my dad went to hit my mum in the mouth and my mum has a fat lip or mouth.""

111There is a tragic and terrible redolence in the circumstances of the present case with the offender's own unfortunate and frightening childhood. 

Mitigating features

112There are no particular or separate mitigating features that can be taken into account that have not otherwise been incorporated in or accommodated in the matters that I have referred to already.

Pleas of guilty

113The offender pleaded guilty to the charge of murder on the first day of her trial. It was anticipated to be a lengthy trial requiring a large number of witnesses. There is a significant utilitarian value of the plea for that reason. I consider that the offender is entitled to a discount for that plea of 10 percent. The Crown specifically agreed with that.

114The offender pleaded guilty to the s 81C(b) offence some six weeks earlier on 2 May 2013. She had not been charged with that offence until her re-arraignment on that day. She accordingly pleaded guilty to that offence at the first available opportunity. I consider that she is entitled to a discount for that plea of 25 percent in those circumstances.

Special circumstances

115There is no material before me that indicates that the statutory ratio of parole to non-parole periods should be varied. Having regard to the sentence that I intend to impose, the offender will necessarily be subject to a lengthy period of supervision on parole following her release.

General deterrence

116The Crown contended that there is an important need to ""ensure that the sentences reflected a significant element of general deterrence, recognising the need for parents to understand the serious consequences of breaching the trust reposed in them to care for their infant children"": R v Sam [2011] NSWCCA 36 at [151]. That submission was expressly qualified by the need to take account of the offender's subjective circumstances, although the Crown contended that it arguably remained as an important consideration notwithstanding.

Comparable cases

117It goes without saying that each case depends upon its own facts and the offender is entitled to be sentenced having regard to those facts and none other. Caution also needs to be exercised in circumstances where reference is made to cases drawn from earlier and different sentencing regimes, or where standard non-parole periods were non-existent or different.

118Taking those qualifications into account, senior counsel for the offender relied upon the helpful remarks and summary given by McClellan CJ at CL in SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 103 at [117] - [118] as follows:

""[117] His Honour concluded that reference to sentences imposed for comparable crimes is appropriate 'so long as they are understood to form part of an overall sentencing pattern' (at [67]). It is with that caveat in mind that I have considered the cases set out below. I have borne in mind the diminished utility of those cases that predate the increase in the standard non-parole period for murder to 25 years. However, even those cases are of some value when the question is whether life imprisonment fits within the range of appropriate sentences. I have also taken due account of the fact that the sentences in some of these cases were imposed after a plea of guilty.

R v Lane [2011] NSWSC 289, where the offender was sentenced to an overall term of 18 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 13 years and five months, for the intentional murder of her newborn daughter following her discharge from hospital. The sentencing judge found that the offender did not suffer from any mental illness or disorder, although he did accept that the offence could in part be explained by her personality disorder.

R v Pfitzner [2009] NSWSC 1267, where the offender was sentenced to an overall term of 25 years and six months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 19 years and two months, for the murder of her two-year-old son, in circumstances where she shook the child for up to five minutes and threw him to the ground. The psychiatrist retained by the Crown concluded that the offender suffered from substance abuse disorder and severe borderline personality disorder, whereas another psychiatrist was of the opinion that she had a defence of substantial impairment open to her. On appeal, the sentence was found to be severe but not excessive: R v Pfitzner [2010] NSWCCA 314 at [46] (McClellan CJ at CL, Hislop and Price JJ agreeing).

R v PJS [2009] NSWSC 153, where the offender was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to an overall term of 26 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 20 years, for the murder of his three-year-old stepdaughter, in circumstances where he assaulted the child repeatedly for a period exceeding 20 minutes. A longer non-parole period would have been imposed but for the fact that PJS was the son of a magistrate and therefore had to serve his entire term in protective custody.

R v Jalaty [2006] NSWSC675, where the offender was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to an overall term of 20 years, with a non-parole period of 15 years, for the murder of her three-year-old daughter, in circumstances where she administered methadone to the child as part of a deliberate plan to kill her. There was no indication that the offender suffered from depression or any other mental disorder, although the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant's life had been a tumultuous one. The offence was assessed as lying within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.

R v Folbigg [2003] NSWSC 53, where the offender was sentenced, after trial, to an overall term of 40 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 30 years, for the murder of three of her children, the infliction of grievous bodily harm on one of those children, and the manslaughter of another, in circumstances where the offences took place over 10 years. There was evidence that the offender was a depressed and psychologically damaged person who was incapable of bonding effectively with her children. The sentence was reduced on appeal to a maximum of 30 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 25 years. The inappropriateness of a life sentence was acknowledged on the appeal: R v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23. 

R v Fraser [2004] NSWSC 53, where the offender was sentenced after trial to an overall term of 32 years, with a non-parole period of 27 years, for the premeditated murder of his three children, aged seven, five and four years, in circumstances where the offender was fearful that he would lose the children as a result of his wife having formed a new relationship. The offender had a longstanding history of psychiatric disturbances and was in a disordered mental state at the time of the killings. On appeal, the sentence was held not to be manifestly excessive. However, the Court observed that the offender's motivation to punish the other parent was a feature of the case which exacerbated his culpability: R v Fraser [2005] NSWCCA 77 at [41]-[42] (Grove J).

R v Merritt [2002] NSWSC 1159, where the offender was sentenced, after a plea of guilty, to life imprisonment for the murder of his three children, aged six, 11 months and 11 weeks, in circumstances where he acted spontaneously and was in a state of depression, or at least in a significantly depressed mood. The sentence was reduced on appeal to an overall sentence of 34 years, with a non-parole period of 24 years: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19.

R v Cikos [2001] NSWSC 35, where the offender was sentenced, after a plea of guilty, to 21 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years and 6 months, for the murder of his de facto partner and two sons, aged four years and 18 months, in circumstances where he had suffered months of physical and verbal abuse by his partner. The forensic psychiatrist concluded that the offender did not suffer from any cognitive defect or serious mental disorder.

R v Cheatham [2001] NSWSC 580, where the offender received an overall term of imprisonment of 24 years, with a non-parole period of 16 years, for the murder of his wife and three-year-old daughter, and for wounding his baby daughter with intent to murder, at a time when he was depressed and suffering from delusions. On appeal, a majority of this Court reduced the sentence to 22 years overall, with a non-parole period of 14 years, on the basis that the sentencing judge had given insufficient weight to the fact that the sentence was to be served in protective custody: R v Cheatham [2002] NSWCCA 360.

R v Velevski (Unreported, NSWSC, Dunford J, 26 September 1997), where the offender was sentenced after trial to an overall term of 25 years, with a non-parole period of 19 years, for the murder of his wife, six-year-old daughter and three-month-old twins, in circumstances that involved a high degree of planning.

R v Park (Unreported, NSWSC, Sperling J, 3 August 2000), where the offender was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to a head sentence of 26 years with a non-parole period of 19 years and six months, for the murder of his wife and two children, aged three and two, in circumstances where the offender was in a highly charged emotional state, disposed of the bodies, and attempted to escape detection. The sentence was undisturbed on the Crown appeal against sentence, although it was described as ""lenient"": R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 142 at [19] (James J).

R v Hughes and Ashfield (Unreported, NSWSC, Badgery-Parker J, 16 December 1994), where the two co-accused were each sentenced, following pleas of guilty, to a maximum term of 21 years penal servitude, with a minimum term of 16 years, for the murder of their six-year-old son, whom they subjected to 'hideous brutality'. The crime was found to fall marginally short of the worst category of cases.

R v Gorman and Armstrong (Unreported, NSWSC, Badgery-Parker J, 25 August 1995), where the step-father was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to a head sentence of 17 years with a non-parole period of 13 years, for the murder of his step-daughter. It was found that there was no element of premeditation or planning, and that the offence in a general way was attributable to the prisoner's immaturity and inability to cope with domestic situations. The sentence corresponded with a crime at the higher end of the scale of objective seriousness.

[118] The established range does not fix the boundaries within which judges must or even ought to sentence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54]. As the plurality said in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [59], 'recording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal'. Accordingly, it is necessary to endeavour to identify the 'unifying principles', if any, which can be derived from the abovementioned sentences for child murders.""

119In addition to the cases to which his Honour referred is R v F.A.P. [2007] NSWSC 905. In that case, the 24-year-old Aboriginal offender caused a severe, fatal head injury to his 15-month-old son. The offender pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial. He admitted having previously assaulted the deceased. The offender had a record of serious offences, including time in custody, although he had no convictions in the five years before the offence. He was intellectually disabled and had had a very disadvantaged background. Howie J found the offence to be slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. His Honour imposed a sentence of 14 years 6 months imprisonment with a balance of term of 5 years (with an applicable 20 year standard non-parole period, but pre-Muldrock). His Honour said this at [38]-[40]:

""[38] The offender's background has given him very few advantages, either subjectively or of a material kind. He has low intelligence, poor hearing, lack of insight into many of his problems such as drug abuse, and his upbringing did not dispose him to be able to cope with the behaviour of the child. He made what must be considered to be disastrous choices about the child's welfare through fear of his wife leaving him. This would hardly be mitigating except that it is understandable given his background. He is a very immature and inadequate person who simply cannot be judged against the standard of other members in the community. 

[39] He is on protection at his own request. This is unsurprising given that he has killed a very young child but I know nothing about the nature of his custody so I cannot take it into account in any significant way. Many of the sentencing considerations that were referred to in Fernando are relevant here. The offender has been particularly disadvantaged as a result of his upbringing despite the best endeavours of persons in the community to assist him. He was introduced both to alcohol and drug use at a young age within the community in which he lived. 

[40] It is a difficult sentencing exercise. On the one hand members of the community generally and those close to the mother would be outraged that a young child can be so brutally injured by the person who is responsible for its care and safety with so little provocation. On the other hand the offender is very much a product of his upbringing with his immaturity, low intelligence and inadequacies. Although there would be reasons in many cases to find special circumstances it appears to me that the statutory proportion will adequately permit the offender to have such assistance as he may need on release to parole. He does not present a danger to the community unless he finds himself again in the care of a young child but that will be after hopefully some maturity by reason of the passage of time serving this sentence.""

120I would not ordinarily extract in such detail cases of an arguably similar factual or legal character. I consider that it is potentially instructive to do so in this case, however, because a number of them have attracted considerable public attention and media interest. SW v R is an example of a case that attracted a great deal of interest and publicity. This case has done so as well. It is therefore preferable that a quiet and patient review of these remarks should conveniently provide all readers, lawyers and non-lawyers alike, with easy and immediate access to the matters that have been taken into account in arriving at the final result. 

121It is important to bear in mind at all times, however, that sentencing principles and discretionary considerations forming part of the sentencing process are not dictated by the notoriety of any particular case or the lack of it. Cases are to be decided, and offenders are to be sentenced, upon the basis of evidence and legal principles distilled and developed over many years by the legislatures and the courts. They are never to be decided upon the basis of commentary or opinion that is offered for general consumption from time to time in the absence of the parties and beyond the courtroom, or unconstrained and unchecked by a rigorous application of legal principle. They are certainly never to be decided upon anything that does not become evidence that is available for consideration and scrutiny in a court of law, far less upon the often vile, obscene, ill-informed and plainly irrelevant outbursts that have characterised so many of the anonymous and unaccountable opinions publicly at large and accessible in this case.

122The many decisions to which I have been referred have all been decided, and in some cases reviewed on appeal, according to proper principles. I am mindful of the need, and of my obligation, to decide this case, and to sentence the offender, in the same way.

Consideration

123Precisely what happened when the deceased was killed would seem to be known only to the offender and Mr Smith. It is not known to me. I have rejected the offender's version of what happened but I have been unable to provide a satisfactory version to replace it. Expert witnesses have only been able to do so to a limited extent.

124Just as significantly in my view is the total absence of any reasonable explanation for what happened. No motive for the offence has emerged. Indeed, in a civilized community it is distressing even to consider that a mother could rationally formulate any possible reason for killing her child. There is no suggestion that the offence was associated with the consumption of alcohol or the ingestion or administration of drugs. There is no evidence of planning or premeditation. There is no evidence or even any suggestion of the use of a weapon. Even the offender's unguarded revelations of what happened, made to an undercover police officer, fail to cast any light upon why this death occurred.

125A search of the past offers some clues, but not all of them. In the immediately preceding period the offender had given birth to her fourth child, who was no older than two weeks at the time the deceased was killed. The other of her children was almost two and a half years old. I have been left to speculate about the physical state of the household in which the deceased died and the mental or emotional state of the offender when she did. The offender denied that she had postnatal depression but has otherwise given no useful or reliable insight into her mental or emotional state at the relevant time. There has been no evidence from her friends or neighbours who might reasonably have been expected to observe it.

126It seems uncontroversial that the offender was intellectually and emotionally incapable of controlling whatever impulse it was that led her to harm the deceased. She reported to Mr Champion that she was having difficulty coping with the care of three children, including nursing the youngest, with little help from Mr Smith. Her own tragic experiences as a child in a disrupted home of violence and abuse, in fear of her father for herself and her mother, the distressing death of her mother and her subsequent rejection by significant members of her family, and the unimaginable effects of custody proceedings and unsatisfactory foster care placements as a ward of the State, are all necessarily beyond most people's understanding. The offender is an inevitable product of entrenched intergenerational failures. As anyone knows, the burdensome responsibilities of parenthood are not bestowed only upon those who are capable of meeting them. The offender was patently ill-equipped for the role and probably equally unable to recognise it. Mr Champion recorded her demonstrated intellectual disability that could have been expected to limit the offender's ""judgment and learning and coping with stressful situations"". The death of the deceased was in these circumstances the foreseeable and preventable consequence of equally foreseeable and preventable causes. The offender's failings are mirrored in the failings of others.

127The offender has been publicly vilified. The death of a child stirs many emotions in the community, not the least of which I strongly suspect is guilt. The offender is nevertheless entitled to be sentenced dispassionately having regard both to the objective circumstances of her crimes and the subjective considerations at play.

128I do not consider that there is any need for specific deterrence. The offender is never likely in my opinion to reoffend and is likely to be rehabilitated in the course of her imprisonment. Nor do I consider that the offender is a good vehicle for general deterrence in light of her particular subjective circumstances although the sentence I impose must reflect a significant degree of punishment and disapprobation. The offender showed herself to be remorseful when secretly recorded and also reported similarly to Mr Champion. She did not give evidence before me but I necessarily must accept the existence of forensic imperatives that influenced that fact. Retribution and mercy are important in equal measure.

		18 July 2013",2013-07-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761962,Blackstock v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 172,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Campbell J.
2CAMPBELL J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 24th February 2012 by his Honour Judge Woods QC.  The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court, at the first available opportunity on 23rd August 2011, to the common law offence of misconduct in public office.
3The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 24th August 2012 and expiring on 23rd August 2015, and an additional term of one year commencing on 24th August 2015 and expiring on 23rd August 2016.
4The offence was one of nine charges to which the applicant had admitted his guilt.  Of the other eight, three were making a false statement to obtain money contrary to s.178BB Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (""Crimes Act""), with an additional three such offences taken into account on a Form 1; the other two were one charge of giving false evidence at a public inquiry before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), and one additional count of the same nature taken into account on a Form 1. The applicant pleaded guilty to each principal offence.
5The total effective sentence was one of imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months commencing on 24th February 2012 and expiring on 23rd August 2015 with an additional term of 12 months commencing on 24th August 2015 and expiring on 23rd August 2016.  The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole therefore is 24th August 2015.
6That total effective sentence resulted from the imposition of the following individual sentences and structure:
(a)For the false evidence charge, taking into account its Form 1, a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 24th February 2012;
(b)For the misconduct in public office offence, the subject of this application, for which there was no Form 1, the term of imprisonment I have referred to at [3] above.  As can be seen, this sentence is entirely cumulative on the false evidence sentence;
(c)For the making false statement offences (taking into account the Form 1 offences) a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year and 3 months on each of the three of them, commencing on 24th August 2012 and expiring on 23rd November 2013. These sentences run concurrently with each other and the misconduct in public office sentence.
7The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the misconduct in public office sentence only on the single ground of manifest excess. Other grounds advanced in writing were abandoned.
Misconduct in public office
8Misconduct in public office is a common law offence in respect of which the penalty is at large, that is to say, no maximum penalty is fixed by law.  In respect of such matters it is the practice of the Court to adopt an analogous or corresponding statutory offence, where one is available, as a reference point for the imposition of penalty:  R. v. Hokin, Burton and Peisley (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 280 at 291 - 2 per the Court. 
9In Jaturawong v. Regina [2011] NSWCCA 168 Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) (Hall and Harrison JJ agreeing) adopted the offences created by Part 4A Crimes Act relating to corruptly receiving commissions and other corrupt practices as the appropriate reference point for this common law offence.  The offences created by the provisions of that part each impose a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years.
10I do not understand R. v. Hokin to establish a rule that the sentence imposed for the common law offence cannot, as a matter of law, exceed the maximum imposed for the statutory analogue.  In delivering the judgment of the Court, Gordon J said at 291-2:
It was contended that on a conviction for a common law misdemeanour the Court could not impose a sentence as in this case of five years and four years imprisonment. In my opinion that contention is untenable. In R. v. White (13 S.C.R. p. 338) the Court imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment with hard labour on a person convicted of a common law misdemeanour. It was held that such sentence was illegal not because of the term of imprisonment imposed but because there was then no power to impose hard labour. That is not now the law, vide s. 432 of the Crimes Act of 1900. In that case it was stated by Faucett J, expressing the view of all the members of the Court, that there was no limit in law to the term of imprisonment which might be imposed on a person convicted of a common law misdemeanour. As a rule undoubtedly the practice of the Court (where the misdemeanour charged is an ""attempt"" to commit a statutory offence) is not to impose a greater punishment than that imposed by Statute for the complete offence. For example, if A were indicted for the common law misdemeanour of attempting to commit a statutory offence, the Court would not as a rule inflict upon conviction a heavier punishment than that imposed by Statute for the full offence. Here, no doubt, in one sense the offence charged as a common law misdemeanour was a conspiracy to commit perjury and by so doing to defeat justice. The penalty provided by statute for perjury is by s. 327 of the Crimes Act a maximum of seven years penal servitude or a maximum of two years imprisonment with hard labour. An increased penalty is provided by s. 328 which does not apply to this case. In my opinion there is in law no such limit as that contended for on the term of imprisonment which the Court can impose on a person convicted on indictment of a common law misdemeanour.   If this had been a case of a person convicted of an attempt to commit an offence for which the punishment is prescribed by Statute, I should have been prepared to hold that the Court ought not to impose a heavier punishment than that prescribed by Statute for the completed offence. In this case, however, I do not think that rule applies. Here the accused were convicted of a conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice by committing perjury and incidentally branding as a common prostitute a girl who was in fact not such an abandoned character.   It was argued (1) that this being a conviction for a common law misdemeanour the Judge could not by law impose a sentence of more than two years imprisonment.   That contention is directly contrary to R v. White in which the Court imposed a term of imprisonment for three years, and to the judgment in that case, and also to Re Forbes (8 N.S.W.L.R. 68);    (2) that the Judge ought not to have imposed a longer sentence than that imposed by statute for perjury, i.e., s. 327, by which the maximum penalty is seven years penal servitude or two years imprisonment with hard labour.  There is, of course, no power to impose penal servitude as a punishment on a person found guilty of a common law misdemeanour. This is, I think, a matter of discretion to be used in each case according to its circumstances. The presiding Judge sentenced Hokin, the principal offender, to a term of imprisonment for five years, and each of the other two appellants to a term of imprisonment for four years.  While in no way suggesting that such sentence was illegal, I think that in view of the youth of the accused and in view of the maximum term of imprisonment imposed by law for perjury the sentence ought to be reduced in the case of Hokin to three years imprisonment, and in the case of Burton and Peisley to two years imprisonment in each case with hard labour, such sentences to commence as from the date of conviction [emphasis in the original]. 
11I have set out this whole passage because, in my view, a consideration of it demonstrates that the statutory analogue provides no more than a reference point which does not fetter the discretion, which remains at large.  The result and the reasoning in R. v. Hokin illustrate this. This will have relevance to the disposition of this case.  Although the Court found the sentences imposed excessive, on re-sentencing the offenders the Court took into account the maximum term of imprisonment imposed by the statutory analogue, but sentenced the main offender to a term of imprisonment which exceeded the statutory maximum by 50 per cent.  In the case of each of the two lesser offenders, terms of imprisonment equal to the statutory maximum were imposed. It is also worth observing that the Court approved the statement in White that ""there was no limit in law to the term of imprisonment which might be imposed on the person convicted of a common law misdemeanour"" (emphasis added). These considerations are relevant to the disposition of this case.
The elements of the offence 
12Because part of the argument advanced to make good the ground of manifest excess was to the effect that the learned sentencing judge had either overstated the objective seriousness of the offending, or may have taken into account as an element of aggravation an aspect of the offending which was in truth an element of the offence, contrary to s.21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Act""), it is appropriate to summarise the elements of the common law offence by reference to the authorities to which the Court was taken by counsel.  As the Court does not very often see instances of this offence, it may be useful in any event to bring its elements to mind for the purpose of deciding this sentence appeal.  I might add, however, that the applicant's offending was detected by an ICAC investigation.  And it may well be that the discharge by it of its statutory functions may bring an increasing number of instances of this type of offending to light.  
13In Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR (2002) 5 HKCFAR 381, Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, with whom the four other members of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal agreed, set out the elements of the common law offence of misconduct in public office at 817[84] - 818[86].  His Honour said:
... the elements of the offence of misconduct in public office are:
1. a public official;2. who in the course of or in relation to his public office;3. wilfully and intentionally;4. culpably misconducts himself.
His Honour emphasised that the misconduct must be both wilful and intentional.  His Honour explained that this conjunctive formulation ""signifies knowledge or advertence to the consequences, as well as intent to do an act or refrain from doing an act"".  His Honour further emphasised that his phrase ""culpably misconducts himself"" connotes ""serious misconduct"" which ""is to be determined having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the office holder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities"".
14By way of explanation of the rationale for the offence, Doyle CJ said in Question of Law Reserved (No. 2 of 1996) (1996) 67 SASR 63 at 66:  
It is clear, I consider, that the .... offence ... strikes at the public officer who deliberately acts contrary to the duties of the public office in a manner which is an abuse of the trust placed in the office holder and which, to put it differently, involves an element of corruption. It may be that the mere deliberate misuse of information is sufficient to give rise to an offence, but the further allegation of an intent to receive a benefit clearly, in my opinion, brings the matter within the ambit of the common law offence.
This statement of the purpose of the applicable rule of criminal responsibility assists in the task of assessing the objective seriousness of the offending in this case:  see also R. v. Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 27 VR 310 at 322 [44] - 323 [47]; and Attorney Generals Reference (No. 3 of 2003) [2004] EWCA Crim 868; 1 QB 73 at 90 [55] - 91 [61].
The relevant charge
15As I have said, the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and the Court Attendance Notice which brought him there provided the following short particulars of his offending:
That Allen Michael Blackstock between 16 December 2003 and 26 November 2007, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being a public official employed in the capacity of a project manager at the Rail Infrastructure Corporation and RailCorp, in the course of or connected to his public office did wilfully misconduct himself, by act or omission, without reasonable cause or justification.
By his plea of guilty, the applicant admitted all of the elements of the offence with which he was charged: R. v. Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 1999 CLR 270 at 275[4]. Notwithstanding the apparent generality of the particularisation of the offending, the applicant's plea should be understood in the light of the analysis of the elements of the offence offered above.
The proceedings on sentence
16As I have already said, the applicant's offending came to light as a result of an investigation carried out by the ICAC, culminating in a public inquiry at which the applicant gave evidence on 26th November 2007.
17A statement of facts on sentence was tendered.  At the proceedings on sentence that document was referred to as ""a Statement of Agreed Facts"" (1.40.T).  Documents relating to the previous sentencing of co-offenders were also tendered.  None of those persons faced the misconduct in public office offence and each of them was dealt with somewhat leniently, including the applicant's ""business partner"".  The sentencing judge decided the parity principle was not engaged and there is no proposed ground of appeal relating to that part of his decision.  Other evidence included a pre-sentence report, a report of a psychologist relating to the applicant, a psychologists report in relation to the applicant's wife, and a character reference from a neighbour.
18The sentencing judge was provided with information about reparations made by the applicant, including the surrender of title to a holiday unit, a four-wheel drive and a boat - all purchased with the proceeds of his crime - and repayments or promises to repay the additional sum of $414,000 (127.1 - .25T).
Objective seriousness of the offending 
19The facts underpinning the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty involved the establishment of a business in partnership with another person, through a corporation, for the provision of services to the applicant's employer, RailCorp. These services consisted of the company performing maintenance work by way of wire feed welding between 16th December 2003 and 26th November 2007. Wire feed welding is a means of carrying out running repairs to railway lines. RailCorp employees perform some of this work ""in-house"", the rest is ""outsourced"" to independent contractors.
20In 2003 the applicant became a project officer responsible for one of RailCorp's regions. His responsibilities covered maintenance work.  In this capacity he acquired knowledge of the nature of the wire feed work and the rates charged by the contractor. During the period from his appointment up until December 2003, one company only was performing the work and there were complaints about the quality of it.  
21The applicant was consulted by his superiors about their dissatisfaction with the contractor's work. He contributed to discussions which led to the decision to look for a new service provider, or providers.  
22Knowing this, and to take advantage of the information for personal gain, the applicant consulted the man who became his business partner, an accountant.  A company was formed named Precision Wire Feed Welding Pty Ltd (""Precision"") for the purpose of tendering for this work.  From the information he had received in his official capacity, the applicant knew the work to be lucrative.
23On 16th December 2003, the applicant and one of his superiors, who was unaware of the applicant's intentions, sent a memorandum to a senior officer providing the details of six companies, including Precision, said to be capable of performing the work.  None of them, the previous contractor excepted, had experience in performing the wire feed work.  Indeed, at this time, Precision did not even employ any suitably qualified welders.  
24The applicant did not disclose his interest in Precision.  Had he done so, to his knowledge Precision would not have been considered, let alone successful in its bid.  Moreover, the applicant was aware of his obligation to disclose conflicts of interest and to seek the approval of his employer prior to engagement in secondary income.  He did neither. The sentencing judge found his non-feasance in this regard to be wilful, intentional and serious, in accordance with the applicant's plea.
25Moreover, in circumstances where Precision had never before engaged in welding work of any kind, and did not then employ wire feed welders, putting the company forward for consideration as capable of undertaking the work itself involved a significant misrepresentation on the applicant's part.
26There is no suggestion, apart from his part in formulating the list of contenders, that the applicant was involved in the decision making process that resulted in the approval of Precision as a supplier of wire feed services to RailCorp. But approved Precision was, and from December 2003, until a new panel was established on 17th October 2005, Precision performed all the contract wire feed work within the applicant's region. 
27Throughout the whole of the period from 16th December 2003 to 26th November 2007, the applicant kept his interest in (and the profit he made from) Precision secret from RailCorp.
28The applicant played a part in the allocation of work to Precision.   When a need for wire feed work was identified, the matter was reported to the applicant who requested another public official to arrange for the work to be performed.  Initially the availability of RailCorp staff was ascertained.  If none were available, the other public official, after obtaining union approval, selected a contractor, advising the applicant of the allocation.  Until the new panel was established, as stated, all of the work in the region was allocated to Precision which performed its first contract on 3rd January 2004.  
29Clearly, Precision through its employees acquired the necessary competency to perform the work.  It was an agreed fact that all work performed by Precision throughout the period covered by the charge was completed satisfactorily.  It may not, therefore, surprise anyone then that when Precision was required to tender for a place on the panel in 2005 it was successful.  The agreed facts include the following statement:
Precision, by that stage, was competitive for inclusion on the panel due to all the work Precision had completed during the period when there was no panel. In the tender process, [the applicant] helped complete the tender document that Precision submitted in 2005 [emphasis added].
30On re-establishment of the panel, it seems that ""Precision was number 1 on the tender list"" (Agreed Facts - page 3).  
31Between 3rd January 2004 and September 2007, Precision was paid $4,300,186.48 for the work it performed.  The before-tax-net-profit earned by Precision was $2,700,736, which was divided equally between the applicant and his business partner.  Each received a share of $1,350,368.  
32The business partner was responsible for the management of the business and arranged for payments to be made to the applicant, who used the money to fund a lifestyle otherwise beyond his means, including feeding his poker machine habit, and acquiring substantial assets.
33The ICAC investigation seems to have commenced in about June 2007.  Surveillance undertaken by ICAC officers from that time until August 2007 demonstrated frequent payments from his business partner to the applicant in sums as large as $24,000 at a time.  
34The applicant was dismissed from RailCorp's service on 26th November 2007 as a result of the evidence gathered through the ICAC investigation.  It is clear that over the almost four years that he had been involved in the enterprise his personal wealth had increased substantially.  The applicant took steps to conceal this by putting substantial assets in the name of his father-in-law.
35I will not detail the facts relating to the other offences, which are not the subject of this application for leave to appeal.
36For the purpose of assessing the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending, it should be said that despite the high profitability of Precision's business there is no suggestion in relation to the misconduct in public office offence of any overcharging, price-gouging or direct defalcation.  The work was competently done, satisfactorily completed and, given that it was allocated by a decision-making process involving officers about whom no question arises concerning their probity and conscientiousness, the natural inference is that Precision's rates and performance made it competitive in a business sense.  But one should not overlook that the applicant doubtless had ""inside information"" about acceptable rates, as well as other information relevant to performance standards, which he used to his financial advantage.
37On the other hand, in respect of the false statement offences, invoices were raised and time sheets completed in relation to work not performed. The amounts involved in these matters were very small compared to the misconduct offence. As I have said, these considerations will be put to one side.
The applicant's subjective case
38The applicant was born on 29th July 1972 and accordingly was 40 years old when sentenced on 30th April 2013.  He and his wife had then been married for fourteen years, but had been in a relationship since the applicant was fifteen.  There are two children of their marriage, a son and a daughter.  His mother raised the applicant and his sister as a single parent after she separated from the father of her children, who was a violent drunk.  By parental instruction and her strong example, the applicant's mother instilled the work ethic and a sense of financial responsibility in him.
39He left school after completing year ten and went to work for the State Rail Authority at the age of fifteen as a station assistant.  He worked his way up to the project manager's position he occupied during the period of his offending.
40Like most white-collar criminals, he has no prior criminal record of any significance.
41As has already been stated, as much as $273,000 of the unlawful profit generated by the Precision enterprise was gambled in poker machines according to the information obtained by the ICAC investigation.  Notwithstanding this he tended to deny a problem with gambling (see Mr. Henckleman's report 30th December 2011; Pre-Sentence Report 9th November 2011).
42Mr. Henckleman considered that the applicant was experiencing clinical depression not only because of his offending and the pressure of the legal process since 23rd November 2007, but also because of his childhood difficulties.  The psychologist expressed the view that the applicant's depression was not only consequential to his involvement in the offences, but also may have been causative of his offending. In a sense the offending reflected his deprived childhood.
43The trial judge accepted that ""until he embarked upon the stupid enterprise, [he was] a person of prior good character.  He is a family man and he has a history of hard work.""
44As I have already said, he pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and was subject to anxiety during the period of five years and six months it took for the matter to come before the court for sentencing.  The delay was not the responsibility of the applicant, as the trial judge accepted by allowing a discount for the vexation due to it.
45The evidence also indicated that the offending, or at least its discovery, had a very adverse impact upon the applicant's family, particularly his wife.  The psychologist's report tendered about the condition of the applicant's wife expressed the view that she suffered an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood as a result of her husband's offending and its consequences.  
Reasons for sentence
46I will exclude from what I say his Honour's reasons relating to the sentences from which there is no application for leave to appeal.
47At the outset, his Honour indicated that in respect of the early plea, he would apply a discount of 25 per cent on account of ""contrition and some assistance in the administration of justice"".  His Honour accepted that there had been ""an inordinate delay between the time of the revelations at ICAC and the bringing of the charges"".  He proposed to allow a further discount for that consideration, and in the end indicated an overall reduction in the head sentence for the misconduct in public office offence of one-third.
48The sentencing judge recognised that the misconduct in public office charge was ""brought under the common law, for which the maximum penalty is unlimited"".  His Honour acknowledged that ""the offence here is not an offence of incompetence or failure to repair the rails, but rather a crime of fraud related to [the applicant's] public position"". Indeed, his Honour found in accordance with the agreed facts that the work was competently performed.  
49His Honour also found that had RailCorp known of the applicant's involvement with - and profiting from - Precision, it would not have placed the company on the panel.  The applicant had a duty to disclose his involvement but continued to hide it from RailCorp throughout the whole period covered by the charge.  His Honour also found that the applicant's deception extended to concealing the fruits of his crime by placing some assets thereby acquired in his father-in-law's name.
50His Honour said (AB p22; ROS p6):
The offence of misconduct in public office is very serious - it involves a breach of public trust - and although courts do not too readily impose prison sentences, the grave criminality involved here requires a serious punishment.
51His Honour referred to the applicant's conduct as ""a deliberate and lengthy exercise of fraud"".
52As I have already said, his Honour referred favourably to the applicant's prior good character, but also said (AB p26; ROS p10):
He knew from the very beginning was he was doing.  He knew that it was fraudulent and he knew that it was misconduct in the office which he occupied.  
The sentencing judge referred to the evidence about the applicant's gambling, but did not regard it as ""a mitigation of these offences"".
53His Honour said (AB p26; ROS p10):
... the objective gravity of this matter is substantial.  Millions of dollars of public money have gone through what is in effect a ""bodgie"" company set up by this man, deliberately for the purpose of obtaining work to which he otherwise would not have been entitled.  I note by subtracting the amount which [his business partner] and he extracted, that the profitability of these contracts was enormous.  It is not for me to make any commercial assessment about these matters, but by definition if he was getting $1.3 million or more in cash and [his business partner] was getting the same, and it was something over four million [dollars] that went through the books for legitimate real work, the profitability was extraordinary.  It is precisely for this reason that government departments have processes for independent tendering, because those who seek to obtain government work which is valuable to them and valuable to the their employees must be at arms length from the contractor who pays.
54The sentencing judge indicated that apart from the plea and the factor of delay, his starting point would have been ""a penalty of six years imprisonment"". This was discounted to four years.  He did not find special circumstances and in passing sentence, as I have said, his Honour imposed a non-parole period of three years and an additional term of one year.
Submissions of the parties
55Mr. G. Porter of counsel, who appeared for the applicant sought to make good the ground of manifest excess by making the following points:
(a) by referring to the penalty as unlimited, rather at large, his Honour had adopted an erroneous approach;
(b) his Honour failed to refer to the point of reference provided by Crimes Act Part 4A offences, and adopted a starting point of six years, which placed the current offence close to the worst category, which it was not;
(c) by characterising the crime as one of ""fraud"" his Honour had mistaken the necessary elements of the offence;
(d)the sentencing judge's reference to ""breach of public trust"", in effect treated what was an element of the offence as an aggravating factor in contravention of the Sentencing Act, s21A(2);
(e)by referring to Precision as a ""bodgie"" company, and to its profitability as ""enormous"", and ""extraordinary"", his Honour must have inferred an aspect of gross overcharging or price gouging which was not established either by the guilty plea, or by the agreed facts;
(f)his Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the applicant's previous good character and his substantial attempt at reparation.
56Mr. N. Bruni, solicitor, who appeared for the Crown, emphasised the following matters:
(a) that the sentence needed to reflect criminality over a period of four years involving a total sum of $4.3 million. Even if no defalcation was involved, the period during which the criminality continued, and the very large sum involved, indicated a breach of trust committed by the applicant to a very high degree;
(b) the offence involved considerable planning and deliberation;
(c) the degree of deception extended to the representation that at the time Precision was proposed as a service provider, it in fact was incapable of performing the work because it then employed no qualified welders, and even if the applicant was not directly involved in each aspect of allocation of work to Precision, his position at RailCorp greatly facilitated it being approved for the work, and the allocation of subsequent work;
(d) the applicant's criminal involvement had the effect of qualifying Precision by the experience gained for appointment to the panel when it was re-established. This compounded the applicant's criminality;
(e) the applicant committed the crime purely for personal gain, and successfully so;
(g)his Honour gave appropriate weight to the applicant's subjective case.
Resolution
57It is not necessary in this case to descend into detail as to what is involved in the appellate process when the Court of Criminal Appeal is asked to determine that a sentence imposed is manifestly excessive, except to call to mind what was said by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wong v. The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]:
Reference is made in House [House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499] to two kinds of error. First, there are cases of specific error of principle.  Secondly, there is the residuary category of error which, in the field of sentencing appeals, is usually described as manifest excess or manifest inadequacy. In this second kind of case, appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons.
58In my judgment the applicant has not made good his challenge to the sentence passed in the District Court on this basis.  I should add that, with respect, there may have been some confusion on counsel's part as to what was involved in the ground advanced.  The argument put before the Court sought to identify specific errors exposed by the reasoning process which betrayed either error of principle, or misapprehension of fact.  As the statement of principle from Wong above demonstrates, this is not what is required.
59His Honour's reference to the maximum penalty being ""unlimited"" did not betray error of principle.  The statutory analogue is a point of reference only. As the long passage quoted at [10] above from, and the result in, R. v. Hokin make clear, the statutory analogue does not establish a kind of de facto maximum.  Indeed, in expressing the reasons of the Court, Gordon J at page 291 affirmed, by reference to earlier authority, ""that there was no limit in law to the term of imprisonment which might be imposed on a person convicted for a common law misdemeanour"" (emphasis added).  Rather, the statutory analogue, the point of reference, is applicable by a rule of practice only.  As I have already pointed out Mr. Hokin, after reduction on appeal, received a term of imprisonment that was 50 per cent in excess of the applicable statutory analogue.
60Nor did his Honour, by referring to the applicant's misconduct as ""fraud"", fall into error. It is clear that in context, his Honour employed that descriptor to distinguish the present case from that category of case where the offence is said to be constituted by non-feasance in the nature of a gross neglect of duty.  In Shum at 817 [84] Sir Anthony Mason NPJ gave the example of wilful and intentional neglect or failure to perform a duty to which a public official is subject by virtue of his office.  That is not this category of case. This case falls into that category referred to by Doyle CJ in Question of Law Reserved (No. 2 of 1996) as involving ""an element of corruption"".  Moreover, the statutory analogue is dealt with by the Crimes Act as a species of ""fraud"".
61There is no merit in the argument that his Honour ""double counted"" in some way by saying the offence involves ""a breach of public trust"". So it does.   As the Court of Appeal for England and Wales pointed out in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 2003) at [57,] the idea that an abuse of office involves a breach of the public's trust has been recognised as a rationale for the common law offence since Lord Mansfield CJ's day:  R. v. Bembridge (1783) 3 Dougl 327. In so far as the common law in Australia is concerned, however, as Redlich JA pointed out in Quach at 583 [44], a breach of trust is not ""part of the definition of the offence"", rather ""it serves to emphasise the degree of departure from the proper standard that must be established"". The sentencing judge was entitled, if not bound, to have regard to that factor.
62Moreover, and more generally, the recognition that ""white collar crime"" will often involve a breach of trust has long been recognised as a consideration relevant to the assessment of objective criminality giving the aspect of general deterrence particular relevance in sentencing for these offences:  R. v. Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 436; R. v. Mungomery [2004] NSWCCA 450; 151 A Crim R 376 at 384 [41].
63The sentencing judge's reference to the level of profitability of the enterprise should not be read as implying a material misapprehension of fact. His Honour was not suggesting that there must have been gross overcharging or price gouging. I accept this would have been an aggravating factor for proof by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. In fact his Honour expressly disavowed any ""commercial assessment"". On any view of it, Precision's business was highly lucrative. His Honour was making the entirely commonplace observation, in this area of discourse, that the amount of money involved is a highly relevant consideration in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.  Moreover, as he pointed out, it was indicative of the degree of abuse of office involved in the offending.  Given what appears to be the high level of profitability of government contracts in this field, it is essential that the public have complete confidence in the integrity of the processes for the allocation of government contracts on a fair and competitive basis. His Honour's comments show he was mindful of the need to consider the protection of the community as a purpose in fixing a proportionate sentence. The comments were also relevant to appropriate denunciation.  
64The arguments advanced on behalf of the Crown should be accepted.  As Hulme J said in Mungomery at 383 [40] - 384 [41]:
[40] In this regard authority makes it clear that the amount of money involved in premeditated deception is an important, and the period of time over which offences are committed a relevant, factor in determining the extent of criminality (citations omitted).
[41] The cases in this area also stress the importance of general deterrence. Organisations, be they business or government, cannot operate effectively without placing a good deal of trust in their employees. Opportunities for the abuse of that trust are legion and breaches are often difficult to detect. Commonly, offenders are able to continue their depredations for long periods. Often matters only come to light when the total amounts involved become too large to be overlooked. It seems to me an inevitable inference that there must be many cases where offending is never discovered - a factor also arguing for sentences which are substantial deterrents. 
65In my judgment the sentencing judge bore these considerations firmly in mind when passing the undoubtedly stern sentence justice required in all the circumstances. 
66Perhaps, it could be said that some consideration might have been given to the substantial reparation made in the case.  But, the materials put before his Honour in this regard may fairly be described as scant, and in this regard the applicant bore the onus. Still, I accept that there was no evidence of actual defalcation in this case, and the illicit profit was, as I have said, disgorged to a substantial extent. However, this consideration is of limited value in mitigation in cases of this type;  the absence of reparation ""is more a matter of aggravation"":  R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 at 448.
67As Gleeson CJ pointed out in R v El-Rashid (NSWCCA, unreported 7th April 1995; BC9504681), crimes like the present offending involving ""a serious breach of trust...are only able to be committed because of the previous good character of the person who has been placed in a position of trust"". It follows that previous good character is of less relevance as a mitigating circumstance here.
68The sentence passed was within the range available to the learned sentencing judge and I am not of the opinion that some other more lenient sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.
69The orders I propose are:
1. Grant leave to appeal;
 2. Appeal dismissed.
70BARR AJ:  I agree with Campbell J.

2761972,Pattalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 171,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offence and sentence
The applicant pleaded guilty to one offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. On 2 November 2012 the applicant was sentenced by Judge Berman SC to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months commencing 2 November 2012 and expiring 1 November 2013, with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 1 November 2014.

2The applicant seeks leave to appeal from this sentence on a single ground:

The sentence was manifestly excessive

Factual background

3The following facts are taken from the Agreed Statement of Facts which was before the primary judge.

4At around 3.25am on Saturday, 1 May 2010 the victim left a nightclub on Pitt Street, Sydney, and stood outside waiting for friends within the club to join him. At about that time the applicant and an unknown male walked out of the club. The applicant and the unknown male turned to face the victim, who was approximately four metres away from them. The applicant then punched the victim in the face with a closed fist. The punch struck the victim on the left side of his face, knocking him to the ground.

5While the victim was on the ground, the unknown male approached him and kicked him in the buttocks with his right foot. The applicant and the unknown male walked from the area leaving the victim lying motionless on the ground. A witness to the incident came to the assistance of the victim and alerted security personnel from the nightclub, who called for an ambulance and police.

6When the police arrived, the victim was attempting to stand but kept collapsing. His face was covered in blood and he was very distressed. An ambulance took the victim to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency Department. When interviewed by the police at approximately 4am, the victim was unable to recall any detail of the incident.

7As a result of the attack, the victim suffered generalised facial pain, a fracture of the left eye socket, a comminuted fracture of the left nasal bone and nasal septum and concussion. He later had to have his nose re-broken and reset. He also had some abrasions and bruising to the face.

8The actions of the applicant and the unknown male were captured on a CCTV system. When interviewed by the police, and in the Probation and Parole report, the applicant was not able to offer any explanation for his conduct. He said that he could not remember any details of the offence. 

Sentence proceedings

9His Honour accepted that it was a single forceful punch which caused the victim to fall to the ground. He noted that not only were the injuries significant, but the victim had not made a full recovery. He still had physical deformities and suffered the ""inevitable emotional consequences that flow from being the victim of apparently random violence"".

10In relation to the applicant's subjective case, the primary judge noted that he had been raised by his father, with whom he had a good relationship. He was quite a good rugby league player and was employed in that occupation until injury forced him to retire. At the time of the incident, he was working part-time with his sister, who ran a fitness centre. He was good at that job. He told the Probation and Parole officer that he did not consider that he had an alcohol problem, despite bouts of heavy drinking from time to time.

11His Honour observed that the ""most that can be said to explain why this offence occurred was that the offender was drunk at the time. That may have caused him to act out of character and may be a factor in assessing the prospects of the offender's rehabilitation but it does little to reduce the objective gravity of what the offender did"" (ROS 2.6).

12The primary judge was prepared to accept that the actions of the applicant on this night were out of character. His Honour did, however, note a previous conviction for common assault, which his Honour thought could not have been of a serious kind because the applicant received a s9 bond for it.

13Because the legal advisors for the applicant and the Crown could not agree as to the facts concerning the incident, the applicant only entered a plea of guilty after he was committed for trial. For that reason, the primary judge allowed a discount of 20 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. His Honour took into account that the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court.

14His Honour took into account that there had been some delay in bringing the sentence proceedings. His Honour did not know why it took so long for the applicant to be arrested.

15His Honour took into account that the applicant expressed some remorse and that there were prospects for his rehabilitation. Because there was no real explanation for the offence, his Honour found it difficult to assess how good those prospects for rehabilitation were. His Honour thought that the sentence which he was about to impose would operate as a significant personal deterrent against the applicant committing a similar offence.

16His Honour rejected the applicant's submission that a non-custodial sentence should be imposed. Although his Honour appreciated that imprisonment was very much a sentence of last resort, he was satisfied that no other sentence was appropriate. His Honour regarded general deterrence as being very important in this matter. His Honour considered that people were entitled to walk along the street without being injured in a significant way. His Honour noted that on occasions a single punch, such as the applicant inflicted on the victim, had led to death.

Appeal

17The applicant submitted that the primary judge failed to have proper regard to his age (23 at the time of the incident and 26 when sentenced). He submitted that the primary judge had impermissibly focused on the injury to the victim and on his personal revulsion to ""street violence"". The applicant submitted that his Honour had failed to take appropriate note of his modest criminal history, that he was facing a custodial sentence for the first time and that only a single blow was involved. The applicant submitted that when these matters and his subjective case were taken into account, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and a lesser sentence was warranted.

Consideration

18The primary judge was entitled to take into account the full extent of the injuries suffered by the victim. It was plainly open to conclude, as his Honour did, that those injuries were ""quite serious"". In sentencing the applicant on that basis, his Honour was careful not to sentence him as though he had committed the more serious offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, expressly applying the principle stated in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383. 

19His Honour took into account both general deterrence and specific deterrence as he was obliged to. The importance of general deterrence is obvious, as was conceded by the applicant. Specific deterrence was also important given that the applicant had a previous conviction for assault the detail of which he could not remember, and given that the applicant could not remember the detail of his offending behaviour on this occasion. The notation in the Probation and Parole report that the applicant did not consider that he had a drinking problem, despite bouts of heavy drinking, was relevant to this consideration.

20The sole ground of appeal in this matter is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. As was said in Vuni v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] (Hoeben J with whom Tobias JA and James J agreed):

""33 To establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325). This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge. (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [26] - [28]).""

21That principle was recently restated in Hayek v R [2010] NSWCCA 139 at [37] where McCallum J (with whom Simpson and Johnson JJ agreed) said:

""37 The principles to be applied in determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive are well known. ... the task is not for this Court to decide whether it would have exercised its discretion differently. The applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33], citing Dinsdale (2002) 202 CLR 321 at 325; endorsed in Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16] - [17].""

22The submissions of the applicant were not directed towards establishing that the sentence imposed by his Honour was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" but to persuading the Court to impose a lesser sentence. The Court was, in effect, invited to replace the sentencing discretion of the primary judge with its own. Even if this Court had been so persuaded, to do so would be contrary to principle and to the long line of authority to which reference has been made above. 

23Even if such an approach were open to this Court, no persuasive reason has been put forward as to why the Court would interfere with the sentence imposed by the primary judge. Over recent years, the incidence of such offences, particularly when associated with the excessive consumption of alcohol, have been all too frequent. Such offences are a cause for grave disquiet and the community is understandably angry and frustrated at their occurrence. Regrettably, it is now notorious (as his Honour recognised) that a single punch can not only cause catastrophic injuries but also death. For offences of this kind, the community has the rightful expectation that judicial officers will impose meaningful penalties.

24It follows that the applicant has failed to establish that the sentence imposed upon him by the primary judge was manifestly excessive. 

25I would refuse to grant leave to appeal in this matter.

26McCALLUM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

27SCHMIDT J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		24 July 2013",2013-07-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761973,Allen v R [2013] NSWCCA 173,"Judgment
1Hoeben CJ at CL:  I agree with McCallum J.
2In an application for leave to appeal based on a ground of manifest excess, it is not particularly helpful to make submissions based on a decision of this Court in another case, the facts of which appear to be similar.  As McCallum J has made clear in her analysis of the decision in Kean v R [2011] NSWCCA 136, the facts of that case were quite different to the facts in this case, albeit there appeared to be a superficial similarity.  As her Honour pointed out, a significant point of distinction was that two offences were involved in that case so that apart from anything else, the principal of totality rendered its comparison with this case of limited value.
3It needs to be remembered that sentencing involves the exercise of a broad discretion by the primary judge.  There is no right or wrong sentence.  There is a range of sentences which is appropriate for a particular offence or offences.  Provided a sentence is within that range, and it has not otherwise been established that the sentence is ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"", this Court should not interfere.  That would be the situation even if the facts in Kean had been identical to the facts in this case.""
4McCallum J:  Warren Allen seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to an offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence (stealing) in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to section 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The circumstance of aggravation was that he knew there were people inside the dwelling house. 
5The maximum penalty for the aggravated offence is 20 years imprisonment.  The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 5 years under s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1900.  When dealing with the applicant, the Court took into account a further offence on a Form 1 of being in possession of housebreaking implements contrary to s 114(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, as allowed under s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The offence on the Form 1 related to the applicant's possession of two screwdrivers and two torches at the time of the housebreaking offence.
6The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months, giving a total term of 3 years and 9 months.
7The present application was not brought within the time allowed under s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  The applicant was sentenced on 1 September 2011.  The notice of application for leave to appeal was not filed until 5 April 2013.  In my view, however, the delay is adequately explained in an affidavit affirmed by the applicant.  He believed he had taken the necessary steps to commence an appeal within four days after commencing to serve his sentence.  Unfortunately, a series of administrative errors within the prison system coupled with an unfounded reassurance which discouraged the applicant from making more persistent inquiries resulted in his not learning until August last year that no application had in fact been filed with the Court.  In the circumstances, the Crown did not oppose an extension of the time within which the application could be brought.  In my view, it is appropriate to make that order.  
8The circumstances of the offence are summarised in a statement of facts tendered at the proceedings on sentence.  The offence occurred at the home of a married couple in Lambton in the State of New South Wales.  At some time before midnight on 21 February 2011, the husband found the applicant at the front of the house trying to hide against the side of the house.  The husband said, ""What are you doing?""  The offender swore and left.  The husband then found that the flyscreen of the front bedroom window had been removed and that there were footprints on the bed.  The wife's handbag was missing.  The handbag contained about $170 in cash, a mobile phone and personal cards including a bankcard.  Police located the applicant with the assistance of a police dog.  At the time he was found by police, the applicant was carrying a black sports bag which had the wife's phone and bankcard in it, together with two screwdrivers and two torches (forming the basis for the offence on the Form 1).
9The applicant has an extremely lengthy criminal record for his age.  He was aged 22 years at the time sentence was passed.  His record includes over 50 housebreaking offences as a child.  The present offence represented his 10th conviction for a housebreaking offence as an adult.  There are many other convictions as well.  The applicant was on parole for an offence of breaking and entering with intent to steal at the time of the present offence.
10Following the commission of the present offence, the applicant's parole was revoked with effect from 22 February 2011.  The balance of his parole expired on 1 August 2011.  The sentencing judge fixed the sentence to commence after the expiration of that period.  The first date on which the applicant is eligible for release to parole is 1 November 2013.
11In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge noted that any offence of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing must be regarded as serious, having regard to the penalties provided.  His Honour accepted, however, that the objective seriousness of the present offence falls towards the lower end of the scale.  His Honour noted that there was no violence offered to any person, that no person was put in actual danger and that the offence appeared to have been by and large unplanned.
12The judge noted the applicant's persistence in committing offences of this type and the fact that he was on parole for a similar offence at the time of the present offence.
13The applicant gave evidence at the proceedings on sentence. The judge had regard to that evidence, noting that the applicant's parents had separated when he was young and that he had been shuttled between his mother and his father, which evidently interfered with his education.  The applicant left school at the start of year 8.  He gave evidence which the judge evidently accepted that he had made some efforts to teach himself to read and write whilst in juvenile justice centres and in jail.  He has spent only six months out of jail since his 18th birthday.  He had a brother who committed suicide whilst in custody.
14The judge noted that the applicant had explained his criminal history by reference to substance abuse problems (predominantly alcohol but also a range of drugs), which the applicant had been unsuccessful in defeating.
15The judge generally accepted the applicant's evidence and, in particular, described him as having some but not complete insight.  His Honour allowed a discount of 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, which was entered at the first available opportunity.
16The judge noted the aggravating factor of the applicant's having been on parole for a similar offence at the time of the present offence.  His Honour also noted the applicant's unenviable record, which his Honour held raised the issue of specific deterrence.  
17By way of mitigating factors, the judge had regard to the fact that the loss occasioned by the offence was not substantial and the evident absence of any significant planning.  His Honour accepted that the applicant's expression of remorse in respect of the offence was genuine.  For obvious reasons, however, his Honour was circumspect as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  Having regard to the applicant's young age and his plain need for intense supervision, the judge made a finding of special circumstances warranting a departure from the ratio of the non-parole period to the balance of term otherwise required under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
18The judge considered that, since the present offence was totally unrelated to the offence for which the applicant was on parole, the present sentence should commence at the expiration of that period.  In reaching that decision, his Honour stated that he had had regard to the principle of totality.  His Honour accepted that the Form 1 matter was serious but noted that it was an offence which went ""hand in hand"" with the principal offence.
19The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
20The applicant accepted that, in order to make out a ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive, it is necessary to persuade this Court that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325.  This Court has on many occasions emphasised the discipline that must be exercised by an appellate court in reaching a conclusion on that issue. It is not for this Court to substitute its own discretion for that properly exercised by a sentencing judge.
21The breadth of the discretion of the sentencing judge in dealing with housebreaking offences is highlighted by the guideline judgment of this Court in In the matter of the Attorney-General's Application [No 1] under s 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act; R v Ponfield & ors [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327.  As noted on behalf of the applicant, the Court in that case declined to issue a guideline expressed in quantitative terms by way of a starting point or sentencing range, instead confining itself to a statement of relevant sentencing considerations: at [43] per Grove J; Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreeing at [1] and [54] respectively.  Grove J stated that the Court's principal reason for declining to express a guideline in quantitative terms was the great diversity of circumstances in which the offence is committed.
22I accept, as submitted on behalf of the applicant, that the present offence was towards the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness.  The judge sentenced the applicant on that basis.  The applicant submitted that the only aggravating factor was the fact of his being on parole at the time of the offending.  He submitted that this was ""something which had impacted him already in the sense that not only did it serve to aggravate the offending but it also meant that he was to serve a period of imprisonment following the revocation of parole"".  That submission does no more than to state the facts and relevant principles correctly.  An offender who repeats his offending whilst on parole should not expect otherwise.
23The applicant sought to derive some assistance from the statistics published by the Judicial Commission.  I do not think a consideration of those statistics is compelling in the present case.  
24The applicant also sought to derive some support from the decision of this Court in Kean, which was put forward as being comparable with the present case.  One of the offences for which Mr Kean was sentenced was an offence contrary to s 112(2), the facts of which it may be accepted were similar to the facts of the present case.  The sentence for that offence was reduced on appeal from 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.  True comparison, however, is difficult.  
25The applicant's reliance on Kean was based in part on the contention that it was a case in which there was no patent error, only a conclusion that the starting point was manifestly excessive.  It is correct that all three members of the Court were satisfied that the sentences imposed for two of the offences including the s 112(2) offence were manifestly excessive: at [48] per Adams J; Campbell JA and R S Hulme J agreeing at [4] and [14] respectively.  
26However, two members of the Court also approached the matter as one in which a ground alleging patent error was made out in addition to the ground of manifest excess.  The error complained of in ground 1 was that the learned sentencing judge had erred ""in failing to have any or proper regard to the fact that [the two counts other than the s 112(2) offence] could have been dealt with in the Local Court and failed to have any or proper regard to the maximum penalty in such a case"".  
27All three members of the Court found that his Honour had overlooked that factor.  But Adams J concluded that, although the judge had erred in that respect, ""this did not prejudice the applicant"" (since the need to protect the community in light of the offender's lengthy record meant that the jurisdictional limit in the Local Court was inadequate).  His Honour would accordingly have dismissed ground 1.
28Campbell JA and R S Hulme J upheld ground 1: at [6] and [17] respectively.  Campbell JA said:
When there has been an error of principle by the trial judge in the course of sentencing, and I am unable to reach a positive conclusion that that error has not affected the sentence the judge imposed, the proper course, in my view, would be to uphold the appeal concerning ground 1. However, the only effect of my reaching that conclusion is that ground 1 and ground 2 each provide an independent reason for resentencing the applicant.   
29In any event, the significance of the success of the manifest excess ground is diluted in the present context by the fact that there were two sentences under consideration.  The sentence imposed on the s 112(2) offence was four years but there was also an offence of breaking, entering and stealing from commercial premises for which the starting point (before discounting for the plea of guilty) was imprisonment for six years and eight months.  The effective aggregate sentence was imprisonment for six years and six months commencing with a non-parole period of four years.
30The applicant's submissions have not persuaded me that the present sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust.  I would accept that the sentence was stern, particularly for a man so young.  Sternness alone is no warrant for supplanting the exercise of a sentencing judge's discretion with a more merciful approach.  I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed fell outside the permissible range.  That is particularly so having regard to the fact that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offence and the fact that it was well open to the sentencing judge to place considerable weight on the need for specific deterrence having regard to the applicant's criminal history.  
31The orders I propose are:
(1)That the time within which the notice of application for leave to appeal may be filed be extended to 10 April 2013;
(2)That leave to appeal be granted;
(3)That the appeal be dismissed.

32Schmidt J:  I agree with McCallum J and also with the additional remarks of Hoeben CJ at CL.

2761975,R v Cardwell [2013] NSWDC 150,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Discovery of a partner's sexual infidelity is something which is capable of generating a great deal of tension, but of course it is completely inappropriate and criminal to respond in a violent way. That is what Mr Cardwell did and that is why he must be sent to gaol.

2Adam Charles Cardwell was in a relationship with a woman by the name of Joanne Thornton. On 6 December last year they began to argue. Ms Thornton acknowledged some previous infidelity with a person named Michael but she did not identify him by giving the offender his last name. The offender did not take this well. He indicated that he wanted to meet Michael. He tried to ring Michael using Ms Thornton's mobile phone but the call rang out. 

3He then got Ms Thornton involved in an ongoing and obviously planned series of events designed to lure Mr Michael O'Farrell, the Michael in question, to a location where Mr Cardwell could assault him. He instructed Ms Thornton to send text messages indicating a willingness to have sex with Mr O'Farrell. Mr Cardwell himself sent similar text messages pretending to be Ms Thornton by using her phone. 

4The argument between Ms Thornton and the offender then escalated. It escalated to the point where Mr Cardwell began being violent towards Ms Thornton. He first slapped her in the face and elbowed her. He then forced her down to the ground. He held her by her neck, holding her on the ground while he was yelling at her. He was using his physical strength to control Ms Thornton. He pulled her by her hair to make her get up and slapped her again. She fell down onto the ground and the offender then kicked her a number of times while she was lying there helpless. Once more he pulled her by her hair and made her stand up and he pushed and struck her again, and once more she fell to the floor. Not content with all that had happened he kicked Ms Thornton again. 

5The offender was not finished; he grabbed hold of Ms Thornton when they were on the lounge. He held a serrated edged steak knife to her and threatened to harm her. 

6As a result of those acts of violence Ms Thornton, not surprisingly, suffered significant bruising to her arms, her chest, her ribs and around her eyes. When police attended the premises two days later they saw that she was in pain and having difficulty moving. She was treated at Royal North Shore Hospital. 

7Those acts of violence have led to the offender being charged with, and pleading guilty, to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of five years. Of course that offence can be dealt with summarily. As can the next offence, which I will describe. 

8Mr Cardwell was not finished; he then turned his attentions to Mr O'Farrell. He lured Mr O'Farrell to an address in Lane Cove by pretending to be Ms Thornton. Mr O'Farrell went there and when he knocked on the front door Ms Thornton answered, but it was not long before the true purpose of having brought Mr O'Farrell to that house became obvious. Mr Cardwell appeared at the door and punched Mr O'Farrell in the face two or three times. Mr O'Farrell fell to the ground but Mr Cardwell continued to punch Mr O'Farrell five or six times further. This caused his nose to bleed. The offender demanded Mr O'Farrell hand over his wallet, which he did, and the offender took three cards from him, no doubt intending to make it clear to Mr O'Farrell that he, Mr Cardwell, knew where Mr O'Farrell lived. 

9The offender briefly went back inside the premises but when he returned he had a pair of scissors. He began to question Mr O'Farrell about his sexual relationship with Ms Thornton and while doing that he pressed the scissors against Mr O'Farrell's throat causing a small laceration. He made a threat concerning the scissors at the same time. 

10The offender used other weapons as well, in particular a broomstick. He struck Mr O'Farrell to the extent that the broomstick broke when he raised his arm to protect himself. Though the broomstick was broken it was still capable of being used as a weapon and Mr Cardwell continued to use it in that manner, hitting Mr O'Farrell about fifteen times to his arms, his back and his face. He also thrust the scissors towards Mr O'Farrell but they did not connect. He went through Mr O'Farrell's backpack, and demanded Mr O'Farrell's mobile phone, which he then smashed. Mr O'Farrell went to Prince of Wales Hospital and it was that that brought the actions of the offender to the attention of police.

11As a result of the violence inflicted upon him Mr O'Farrell suffered mild to moderate bleeding to the retina of his left eye. He had a comminuted fracture to the floor of his right maxillary sinus, and undisplaced fracture of the lateral bony orbit and bruising to his left eyelid. He was sore and unwell for some time with concern being expressed as to his vision and of course he was in considerable pain for some time. One circumstance of the attack upon him is that there is a possibility of an increased lifetime risk that Mr O'Farrell will develop glaucoma in his left eye. Fortunately, at the moment, Mr O'Farrell's vision has recovered to his preinjury levels but there is a risk, as I have said, that things will turn bad in the years to come.

12Of course, the physical injuries are only part of the consequences for Mr O'Farrell. As he reports in the victim impact statement tendered by the Crown, he was, not surprisingly, scared and part of his apprehension related to Mr Cardwell's actions in taking identity cards from his wallet. Mr O'Farrell was scared that he would experience further violence at the hands of Mr Cardwell.

13For the actions which I have just described the offender is to be sentenced for an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm with the destruction of the mobile phone being taken into account on the Form 1. For the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm there is a maximum period of imprisonment of ten years with a standard non-parole period of four years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in formulating the appropriate sentence for that matter. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

14It is recognised that these were separate acts of violence committed on different victims on different days. It is also recognised that weapons were used and that the violence was sustained. This is far from a case where, having used violence, Mr Cardwell immediately stops what he is doing and expresses remorse for what he has done. Any tension which Mr Cardwell felt about the disclosure of infidelity must surely have reduced over time and so his actions in luring Mr O'Farrell to premises where Mr Cardwell clearly intended to attack him, violently, have to be seen in that light. 

15The offender is almost forty years of age and this is the first time that he has been convicted of any criminal offence. He was on bail at the time of his offending for matters which have yet to go to trial, so the evidence at the present stage is that these were his first offences. As well as that evidence there was evidence called from his younger brother, Joshua, who spoke about the offender's character in these terms; he said that

""he was no more violent than others were when he was growing up and whilst there may have been scuffles on occasion, there was nothing out of the ordinary."" 

16As well as evidence of the offender's character in that sense, there is also other positive evidence regarding his character to be found in the references tendered on his behalf. There are three references including one from his exwife and one from his exwife's mother. The references speak of a person who is hard working, kind to others and whose actions in assaulting both Ms Thornton and Mr O'Farrell appear to be completely out of character.

17He has been in custody since his arrest on 8 December. Because of the nature of the charges that have yet to go to trial the offender served his custody up until today in circumstances which are harsher than those of the general prison population, not significantly so, but measurably so. I have taken that into account. But after sentence, that is after today, it is expected that he will serve his sentence in the same conditions of custody as do apply in the general prison population with perhaps a relatively short period when he is appearing for trial on the matters that have yet to be determined.

18The offender has expressed his remorse to those who have visited him, his brother and his exwife in particular and he has also written a letter addressed to me in which he continued to express remorse and says that he wants to express apologies to those who he has hurt most. The best way of apologising to someone is of course to say something. It is one thing to write a letter to a Judge expressing sorrow to those who have been hurt but it is another thing to say it yourself. I will accept that the offender is remorseful, the evidence establishes that but there is a lot more that the offender could have done if he had wanted to to demonstrate at a deeper level his remorse for his violent actions.

19Because these offences are, as the evidence stands to date, isolated, I accept that the offender does have good prospects of rehabilitation. There is perhaps one qualification to that; the criminality that he has displayed is somewhat remarkable - clearly he was angry to the extent that he deliberately lured Mr O'Farrell to a place where he would be beaten and inflicted sustained violence upon him, having done something similar to Ms Thornton earlier. People of good character who are the sort of person described in the references do not usually act in that way.

20The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences that I will now announce are twentyfive per cent less than they would otherwise have been to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas. 

21For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of eighteen months to date from 8 December 2012, that is a fixed term because of the sentence I will now announce on the second offence. 

22For the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of four years. That is to date from 8 December 2013. The overall sentence is thus one consisting of a non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of five years. The earliest day on which the offender can be released to parole is 7 December 2015.

		22 August 2013",2013-07-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761989,R v Zheng [2013] NSWDC 151,"sENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Manufacturers of methylamphetamine face a number of difficulties in present day New South Wales. One of those concerns the supply of raw materials or, as they are sometimes known, precursors. Not too long ago one source of the precursor pseudoephedrine was cold and flu tablets sold in pharmacies, but changes in ingredients and changes in the regulation of the supply of such medication has meant that that source has dried up. That has placed more of a focus on the importation of such precursors. Pseudoephedrine, in particular, is a relatively common precursor which is now often sourced from overseas so that illegal drug manufacturers can use it to make methylamphetamine. 

2Lang Shuo Zheng stands for sentence today for his involvement in the importation of more than the large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, 27.58 kilograms in fact representing almost nine kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine. To put those quantities into context the large commercial quantity of that drug is five kilograms. 

3The method that Mr Zheng and others used was to source from China a medication with a name Contact NT. This is a medication which can be lawfully purchased in China, it contains a relatively high proportion of pseudoephedrine. The medication was then repackaged into what was described as craft eggs which were then sent to Australia, the package arriving in mid-December 2011. Once it arrived here the police got involved. They removed the medication and substituted it with an inert substance. The package was then delivered to Mr Zheng who, the evidence reveals, was the principal in the Australian end of the operation insofar as that required the receipt of the package, the unpackaging of the substance and the handing over of the substance to people who would manufacture methylamphetamine. 

4Mr Zheng now stands to be sentenced for a charge of attempting to possess for the purposes of supply 27.58 kilograms of pseudoephedrine being a large commercial quantity of that drug. Of course, this is an attempt because he did not actually possess any of the prohibited drug because of the involvement of the police before the package was delivered to Mr Zheng. He pleaded guilty to that charge at the first available opportunity. Other charges had been preferred against him but this one had not been. His plea came soon after that charge was laid, thus he is entitled to a discount on his sentence of twentyfive per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. 

5The Crown has tendered a statement of facts of some thirty-two pages. As is commonly the case in matters prosecuted by the Commonwealth there is a great deal of unnecessary detail in the statement of facts which tends to obscure rather than reveal what the offender actually did. It is possible to extract from the statement of agreed facts a summary of the offender's involvement in the way I have earlier described. 

6I am not going to sentence Mr Zheng on the basis that he was a principal in the overall operation. There is nothing to suggest that and there is evidence to suggest that he was not. But as I said earlier he was the principal in the Australian end of the operation which, of course, was a very important and indeed essential aspect of the aims of those involved in this criminal operation. 

7The offender is forty-six years of age and remarkably has no prior criminal history. I say 'remarkably' because not too many forty-six year olds would decide to get involved in such serious criminality. The offence is so serious that it carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of fifteen years. I have taken both the standard non-parole period and maximum penalty into account in determining the appropriate sentence, and my reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period in this case are to be found in these remarks on sentence. 

8Why would the offender get involved in such a serious offence, an offence that could see him going to gaol for the rest of his life after forty-six years of lawful behaviour? The answer is difficult to determine. The explanation given is that the offender was asked to do so by his younger brother who lives in China. But that is scarcely an adequate explanation. It would be a remarkable sense of family obligation which would lead a law abiding forty-six year old to start importing drugs which could be used to manufacture methylamphetamine. Perhaps another part of the explanation lies in the circumstance that what was imported is, as I mentioned earlier, available openly in China, that circumstance may have led Mr Zheng to believe that what he was doing was not quite as bad as truthfully it was. 

9There is nothing in Mr Zheng's background which would suggest that he was the sort of person to become involved in drug importation or drug manufacture. He was born in China, went to school there but came to Australia after he had become involved in demonstrations in China against those in power at the time. Once he came to Australia in 1989 he lived in Campsie, obtained work and studied English. He has worked in restaurants with one break ever since. He has children and is happily married. He is supported in Court by his family. He appears to be hardworking, (he is working in custody for example), and is a man who gave no hint that he would commit this most serious crime. 

10I mentioned that there was one break in Mr Zheng's employment. It appears that one of Mr Zheng's son suffers from depression to a significant extent. This affected his son's behaviour and Mr Zheng took time off work in order to care for his son. As a consequence of that Mr Zheng, himself, became depressed for a time. Fortunately, his son's condition has improved although I gather there are significant balance of depression still remaining. But when things got a bit better in 2011 Mr Zheng returned to work in restaurants and that is where he was working at the time of his arrest. 

11The seriousness of the offence is obvious. The standard non-parole period and the head sentence are enough to demonstrate that. On top of that Mr Zheng attempted to possess over five times the large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine and even if one looks at the pure amount of pseudoephedrine that in itself was over the large commercial quantity. So this was a large operation and had the drug been passed onto manufacturers a significant amount of methylamphetamine could have been produced and sold to drug users. It is fortunate that that did not occur. It is fortunate that police intervened and so when I assess the harm that Mr Zheng's conduct caused I will take into account that no drug was ever manufactured, let alone distributed.

12I have mentioned the sad condition of the offender's son. It appears that Mr Zheng does a lot for his son and that his son will suffer from Mr Zheng's incarceration. Unfortunately, results such as those are common place when fathers or mothers or aunts or uncles are sent to gaol. Although I will take that circumstance into account as part of the general mix of subjective factors it is not a matter where I am able to significantly mitigate the punishment which much be imposed upon Mr Zheng. 

13Mr Zheng will do his time in custody harder knowing that his misconduct has led to him not being available to care for his son and his other children and his wife. Also making Mr Zheng's time in custody harder will be his difficulties in English. Despite coming to Australia in 1989 and despite studying English he has been assisted in Court by an interpreter. 

14One thing I have not mentioned is that the evidence would suggest that Mr Zheng was to get a fairly low amount of money out of this, $7000, and there is no suggestion that he or his family were in financial strife at the time of the offence. That just adds further to the mystery as to why the offender would do what he did.

15The offender expressed his remorse in Court. He is no doubt sorry for what he has done especially as he sees the impact of his criminal activities on his family. I am satisfied that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and indeed the length of the sentence I am shortly to announce on Mr Zheng will add as a substantial personal deterrence to him ever doing something of this kind again.

16One of the most important matters in determining the appropriate sentence is, of course, that this was ongoing criminality. The Crown says that between 11 January and 18 January when Mr Zheng was arrested he was actively involved in receiving, unpackaging and handing over the pseudoephedrine as well as arranging for payments to people back in China. This is far from a case where a person has done one illegal act and immediately regrets it, on the contrary, Mr Zheng did many separate things all of which involved illegal behaviour as part of his attempt to obtain possession of a large quantity of pseudoephedrine so that it could be supplied. Necessarily, therefore, a significant sentence is required.

17I make a finding of special circumstances in Mr Zheng's favour. He continues to suffer from elements of depression and he will be assisted upon his release from custody by having an extended period of supervision on parole available to him. 

18Mr Zheng is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years to commence on 18 January 2012 together with a head sentence of eight years. The non-parole period will expire on 17 January 2017 which is the earliest day on which Mr Zheng can be released to parole.

		23 August 2013",2013-07-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761990,R v Jack [2013] NSWDC 171,"Judgment

1On 2 May 2013 a jury returned a verdict of guilty on the following five charges:

(1)Between about 1 July 2009 and 14 April 2010 at Peakhurst, the offender used a carriage service to access child pornography material (s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code (Commonwealth)).

(2) Between 15 April 2010 and about 26 January 2011 at Peakhurst, the offender used a carriage service to access child pornography material (s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code (Commonwealth)).

(3) Between about 18 January 2010 and 14 April 2010 at Peakhurst, the offender used a carriage service to make available child pornography material (s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code (Commonwealth)).

(4) Between 15 April 2010 and about 26 January 2011 at Peakhurst, the offender used a carriage service to make available child pornography material (s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code (Commonwealth)).

(5) On or about 25 January 2011 at Peakhurst, the accused possessed child abuse material (s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).

2The maximum available penalty in relation to each of the offences against s 474.19(1) of the Criminal Code is fifteen years' imprisonment. The maximum available penalty for the offence against s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is ten years' imprisonment.

3The offender has been in custody since the findings of guilt on 2 May 2013. Although the offender continues to maintain that he is not guilty of any offence, he admitted from the outset that the subject matter of the proceedings was child pornography or child abuse material within the meaning of the relevant legislation. The trial was benefited in a utilitarian sense as it spared the Court the unpleasant task of examining the material to determine whether it was satisfied that the material fell within the relevant definitions. I accept the submission that the offender is entitled to a small discount for the concessions.

4The facts are that, between mid 2009 and January 2011, the offender used his computer to possess and access child pornography and child abuse material obtained over the internet. Between January 2010 and January 2011 a number of his files were made available to others. When arrested in January 2011 he was found to be in possession of more than 23,000 files containing child abuse material. There were approximately 22,000 images and approximately 1,300 multimedia files. On 2 July 2009 the offender had downloaded from the internet the free version of a commercially available file-sharing program known as GigaTribe. This free program had limited features. Shortly after downloading the free program, the offender commenced paying a monthly subscription for a program which had a larger number of features. He paid a monthly subscription until the middle of 2010. At that stage, he paid an annual subscription for the more sophisticated version of GigaTribe. He used GigaTribe to make child pornography material available to others. At the date of his arrest, 591 of the 23,000-odd child pornography files in his possession had been made accessible to other users of Gigatribe. In September 2009 the offender purchased a software program called Folder Lock, which he used to encrypt and conceal folders on his computer hard drives. These folders contained child pornography material. That meant that other users of his computer would not see the material.

5The material in question has been analysed and classified into six categories. The first five categories follow those developed in the UK guideline judgment of Oliver & Ors [2002] EWCA Crim 2766. The sixth category is a category utilised in the child exploitation tracking system. Category 1 is images depicting erotic posing with no sexual activity. The offender was in possession of 18,520 Category 1 images and 332 Category 1 videos of children. The images focussed on genitalia and children dancing and undressing. The offender was in possession of 2,087 images and 696 videos of children performing sexual acts on themselves and each other, which fell into Category 2, being sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child. In relation to Category 3, nonpenetrative sexual activity between adults and children, the offender was in possession of 712 images and sixtyone videos that fell into this category. In relation to Category 4, penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, the offender was in possession of 559 images and 188 videos of children engaged in penetrative sexual intercourse or sexual activities with adults. In relation to Category 5, sadism or bestiality, the offender was in possession of thirtyseven images and thirty videos of children engaged in sadistic acts or bestiality. In relation to Category 6, animated or virtual images on videos, the offender was in possession of twelve images.

6In respect of the Commonwealth matters, the offences deal with child victims who are persons up to the age of eighteen years. The New South Wales offence deals with child victims up to the age of sixteen years. The ages of the children depicted in the material are from prepubescent up to approximately fourteen years of age. 

7As to the objective seriousness of the offences, the proper approach was discussed in the case of R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370. Among other things, it is relevant to have regard to the nature and content of the pornographic material (including the ages of the children depicted), the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed, the number of images possessed by the offender (focusing on the number of different children who were depicted and thereby victimised), the purpose for which the material was possessed and whether the offender did profit or intended to profit from the images. That is not a comprehensive statement of all matters relevant to objective seriousness, but it provides a useful guideline for the Court's consideration. In this case, the number of images and other items totalled about 23,000. There is no evidence as to the number of different children who were depicted and thereby victimised. Among the 23,000 items, there must have been very many children who were depicted and thereby victimised. There is no suggestion that the offender was to profit from the offences in a financial sense. However, in relation to the charges of making the material available, the profit was to participate in sharing arrangements with other likeminded people. Many offences involving the making available of material are characterised by such a motive. There was some evidence of the ages of the children depicted. I infer that the ages ranged from children who were prepubescent (although not infants) through to children of approximately fourteen years of age. In relation to the ages of the victims, this is not a borderline case, for example, involving children aged fifteen, sixteen or seventeen years. The children in question were almost exclusively male. The material had a firmly homosexual orientation. The possession of the material continued over a period of eighteen or nineteen months, from the middle of 2009 to early 2011. The offender was continuing to download images up to the time of his arrest in January 2011. Objectively, the offences were of substantial seriousness. However, I regret to say that they do not fall anywhere to being in the most serious category. 

8The Crown referred to the fact that the offender made up a false story that an acquaintance of his, Mr H, was responsible for the downloading of the images and that Mr H had made a genuine confession to the offender (which the offender had recorded on his mobile telephone). That material was inherently questionable. Mr H was called to give evidence and he gave very convincing evidence. The jury entirely rejected the suggestion that Mr H was responsible, a view with which I wholeheartedly agree. Although the Crown drew my attention to this aspect of the trial, the Crown did not contend that this conduct by the offender aggravates the seriousness of the offending conduct. I agree. I am not here to sentence the offender for perjury.

9The offender is thirtytwo years of age. He was about thirty years of age at the time of the offences. He had a very good upbringing. His parents provided him with strong support, and they continue to do so. He has a close relationship with his sister, who also continues to support him. He is an intelligent person. Mr Probets, a psychologist who provided a report on behalf of the offender, described the offender as ""a highly rational thinker"". He attained a high level of education. He holds the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education. He obtained a postgraduate diploma in theology. As well as studying theology at university, he studied English and History, and for some years was employed teaching Christian Studies and History. He had an excellent work history up to the time of his apprehension. He also had a long and strong involvement with the Anglican Church in capacities such as church warden and leader of youth groups. He was involved with youth groups from fifteen years of age. He taught Bible Studies, and he counselled children and other members of the congregation. Some members of the congregation, including younger adults who knew the offender when they were children, gave character evidence in the course of the trial. They said that the offender was a loving and caring person who had been very supportive and who displayed honesty and integrity in their dealings with him. There was no suggestion that the offender had attempted to behave inappropriately towards young people in the Church or other young people.

10Mr Heathcote correctly pointed out that, in relation to child pornography matters, it is not infrequently the case that offenders have not only accessed child pornography, but also, to some extent, acted out their inclinations by engaging in indecent behaviour towards young people. That is not the case for the offender. 

11By virtue of these convictions, the offender has lost his career as a teacher, and presumably he has lost his standing within the Church. He is considering reeducation in the areas of business and accounting, which seems to be a very sensible path to pursue, as it is unlikely to involve contact with young people, and it will engage the offender intellectually.

12The offender has tendered material in relation to medical problems from which he suffers. There was evidence from a treating endocrinologist and the offender. Since 1994, the offender has been treated as a diabetic. He has ongoing problems in relation to getting the correct balance of treatment and he has developed insulin resistance. In custody, the difficulties have been considerable. He has been held at the MRRC at Silverwater. There have been a number of difficulties. The first difficulty relates to the importance of receiving insulin prior to or at about the same time as meals, particularly in relation to the afternoon/evening meal. There has been little correlation between mealtime and insulin receipt. This problem has been exacerbated by lockdowns at the prison. At times, doses have been missed. They have often been late. The second difficulty relates to injections. The offender must attend the clinic for injections. There are problems in coordinating the injections and the meals since he has to be transported to and from the clinic. He would like to have needles available in his cell to treat himself as required. This is not permitted. Prisons simply cannot allow prisoners to have needles in their cells. It is most unlikely that the offender will be permitted to have ready access needles for personal injection of insulin wherever he is housed in the New South Wales corrective system. However, it may be likely that the other difficulties that he is experiencing will improve. For example, the problem of constant lockdowns at the MRRC is unlikely to occur once he is classified to a suitable alternative prison. He is very likely to have more ready access to a clinic. However, I accept that there will be a substantial impact on the offender in the sense that his diabetes treatment will not be optimal. 

13The Court received evidence that there are serious risks associated with the treatment of diabetics that is less than optimal. While the offender is in custody, there will be ongoing problems in relation to treatment for diabetes which may manifest themselves to a greater or lesser degree. Unfortunately, any prisoner who suffers from any physical or mental disability will almost inevitably have less access to medical treatment than a person who is in the community and who has the wherewithal to seek out their own treatment. These considerations are relevant to a determination of appropriate sentence.

14The role of the Court is to impose sentences of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances. In relation to the State offence, the Court may only impose a sentence of full-time imprisonment if that is the only appropriate sentence. Although those words are not used in the Commonwealth legislation, impliedly that is also the case in respect of Commonwealth matters. Under the Commonwealth legislation, the Court is required to take into account, among other relevant factors, the factors set out in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 in so far as they are relevant. In respect of the State offence, the Court is required to take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors that are set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in so far as relevant. 

15In relation to both State and Commonwealth matters, important sentencing objectives are general deterrence, punishment, denunciation, specific deterrence and rehabilitation. In relation to offences of this type, general deterrence is a very important consideration. Such offences are prevalent. They are committed relatively anonymously. Most people have ready access to the internet and can access it in the privacy of their own homes. Commission of offences such as these is relatively difficult to detect. Indeed, vast State and Commonwealth resources are devoted to the detection of such offences.

16Offences of this type are not victimless crimes. Offenders often talk themselves into thinking that their crimes are victimless but that is very far from the truth. The children whose images are depicted are powerless young people who are forced into sexualised behaviour because they are impoverished or under the control of exploitative adults. Offenders who engage in this sort of activity are victimising many powerless children. The children are compromised and corrupted. They have to live with the fact that their images may be available to strangers for decades and that they will never be able to control the dissemination of the objectionable images. One cannot know the personal circumstances of the victims, but one can infer that they must be desperate. 

17Under s 16A(2)(f) of the Crimes Act, the Court is to consider, where relevant, the degree of the offender's contrition. In this case, there is no contrition. The offender continues to maintain his innocence. He has demonstrated no remorse. 

18Section 16A(2)(m) refers to the need for the Court to consider the character, antecedents, age and physical and mental condition of the offender. As far as his character is concerned, the offender has no prior convictions. There is abundant evidence that the offender appears to be a person of excellent character. As far as his friends, acquaintances and family are concerned, he is a person of impeccable character. Unfortunately, as is the case with many offenders who commit offences of this type, the offender has a secret character, which was not and still is not apparent to his friends, acquaintances and family. Because ""anonymous"" offences of this type are not infrequently committed by persons of otherwise apparent good character, the Court may attach lesser weight to good character.

19A very important factor is the prospects of rehabilitation, or the prospects of reoffending. In his report, Mr Probets makes a number of statements, which I have some difficulty in reconciling. On page seven, he states that the offender:

""Is highly unlikely to re-offend due to both his character and the impact of the serious situation that he is now in. Also there was no indication in the interview assessment or psychometric assessments of any psychological or psychiatric disorder that is likely to result in future offending.""


The author goes on the state on page eight that:

""It would be very useful for James Jack to undertake a treatment program for sexual offenders within the prison system.""


Mr Probets opines that the offender is likely to be very co-operative if he undertakes such a program. My difficulty is that the offender has been convicted by the jury on the basis of compelling evidence of engaging in child pornography offences over a period of approximately eighteen months. The reasons for his engagement in those offences are unknown. However, Mr Probets asserts that he is highly unlikely to re-offend. I would have thought that if the reasons for offending cannot be ascertained, then they cannot be addressed and the risk of reoffending remains very open. Further, I question why Mr Probets asserts that a treatment program would be ""very useful"" in connection with someone whom he simultaneously asserts is highly unlikely to re-offend. The bottom line may be that Mr Probets thinks that, as the offender is intelligent, he will realise that the commission of any further offences will result in imprisonment and that that will be a sufficient specific deterrent.

20There is a high level of correlation between the matters to which the Court must have regard to under s 16A and those to which it must have regard under s 21A. It would be pedantic to go through s 21A chapter and verse. I have had regard to relevant s 21 matters and to the appropriate overall sentence having regard to the principle of totality. 

21In respect of offences one and two and offences three and four, those offences were prosecuted as pairs because in April 2010 there was a legislative change in respect of one element of the offences. In relation to this case, the change was not material. But for that legislative change, there would have been three offences before the Court, not five.

22The offender is convicted of each matter. I impose the following sentences. In relation to count one in the indictment, I intend to impose a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months from 2 May 2013 to 1 May 2014. For count two, I intend to impose a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months from 2 November 2013 to 1 May 2015. For count three, I intend to impose an eighteen-month sentence of imprisonment from 2 May 2014 to 1 November 2015. In relation to this and the subsequent sentences, I intend that the offender should be released after serving two years, on 1 May 2015. In relation to offence four, the last of the Commonwealth matters, I intend to impose a term of twenty-one months from 2 November 2014 to 1 August 2015. I intend that the offender be released on 1 May 2015. In respect of the State matter, I intend to impose a concurrent sentence of twenty-one months from 2 May 2014 to 1 August 2016, with a non-parole period expiring on 1 May 2015. The effective sentence will be a non-parole period of two years and a balance of term of one year and three months. The total sentence will be three years and three months. 

23I am aware that, in respect of Commonwealth matters, the usual although not fixed ratio between the head sentence and the nonparole period is about sixty to sixty-seven per cent. However, Hili v R [2010] HCA 4 says that that matter is in the judge's discretion. I am aware that under the State legislation, the non-parole period is prima facie seventy-five per cent of the total term. In respect of the State matter, I find special circumstances, being the offender's first time in prison and the totality of the sentences. 

24For offence three, the sentence is from 2 May 2014 to 1 November 2015. For offence four, the sentence is from 2 November 2014 to 1 August 2016. For matters three and four, I fix a non- parole period to expire on 1 May 2015. 

25For the State matter, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period from 2 November 2014 to 1 May 2015 and a balance of term of one year and three months. The sentence will expire on 1 August 2016. He is eligible for release to parole on 1 May 2015.

26The effective sentence is three years and three months, in effect. After the expiry of two years, on 1 May 2015, the offender is eligible for release to parole.

		10 September 2013",2013-07-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761994,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Cottrell [2013] NSWLC 23,"Judgment
Introduction
1The matter has previously been fixed for a summary hearing. The accused is a serving New South Wales Police Officer who is charged with bribery contrary to s 200 of the Police Act 1990. The offence is an indictable offence and carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 200 penalty units ($22,000). Section 207(2) of the Police Act 1990 further provides that if the defendant and prosecutor consent and the court thinks it appropriate to do so the court may hear and determine the matter. If the matter is dealt with in the Local Court the maximum penalty is 50 penalty units ($5,500) or 2 years imprisonment or both. 

2The Director in proof of the offence relies upon oral admissions made by the accused to a fellow police officer in a conversation between them while both were on duty. The accused has objected to the admissibility of those admissions because they were ""made in the course of official questioning"" by an ""investigating official"" within the meaning of s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and there is no reasonable excuse why they were not electronically recorded. If the court holds that there has not been a breach of s 281 then the accused wishes to be further heard as to whether the admissions should be excluded under ss 139 and 90 of the Evidence Act 1995.

3A voir dire has been held (s 142 Evidence Act 1995) before me and Constable Vrahas called to give evidence of the alleged admissions made to him by the accused. The accused denies the admissions but the present issue for consideration is whether evidence relating to those admissions is excluded by s 281(2).

The admissions
4Both the accused and Constable Vrahas were stationed at Hurstville Police Station. In late 2011 the NSW Police Professional Standards Command began investigating a complaint about a possible inappropriate relationship between police officers attached to the Hurstville Local Area Command and tow truck operators who were being given information in advance about motor vehicle accidents in the Command area.

5Constable Vrahas was called and his statement of 2 February 2012 tendered into evidence on the voir dire (Exhibit VD1). Constable Vrahas says that he had formed a relationship with two tow truck drivers he knew as ""Charlie"" and ""Fred"" which included socialising by meeting for coffee from time to time. He also knew them from their attendance at motor vehicle accidents and ""Fred"" also did some motor vehicle panel work for him. On 26 January 2012 Constable Vrahas attended ""Fred's"" panel beating business in Peakhurst to drop off some car parts to be painted. While he was there ""Charlie"" came over and informed him that a Sergeant from Professional Standards had approached him wanting to talk about ""receiving messages regarding accidents from Police and who I knew in the Police"" (at paragraph 6). In his statement Constable Vrahas says he said to ""Charlie"" ""If its professional standards, you need to be honest with them. If you have had dealings with Police you need to tell them, but they would already know. If it's about me referring you to my missus for advice, you need to tell them about it"" (at paragraph 6).

6The basis of why he told ""Charlie"" he had to tell Professional Standards is not in evidence but even at this stage Constable Vrahas's state of mind is that there had to be honest dealings with Professional Standards. 

7Constable Vrahas then continues in his statement to give the following evidence. It is crucial for the resolution of the s 281 issue to set it out at length, not only for its content but its temporal context as to whether what began as an informal conversation with the accused, remains that or whether, as the accused submits, it escalates into ""official questioning"". At paragraphs 7-9 he recalls the following conversation with the accused:
7. On Friday night the 27 January 2012 I was rostered on duty 6pm to 6am on Hurstville 15. I was rostered on 15 with Constable David COTTRELL. I have known Dave since I started at Hurstville. We had become friends being on the same team for the past year. About 7:30pm just after a job we were driving round Hurstville and said to David, ""Dave, something is bothering me, can I talk to you about it"" 
He said ""yeah what up""
I pulled over at BP Mortdale and we got out of the car and I said,
""Charlie the tow truck driver was approached by Professional Standards and they were asking him about what Police Officers he knows. They also wanted to know if he had been receiving text messages from any Police. I'm really fucked because I have been texting Charlie outside of work and meeting up for coffee. They are going to think that I have been giving Charlie information about accidents"".

8. It was about then I noticed Dave go silent and very pale in the face. I went on to say to Dave, ""Have you ever text Charlie outside of work or am I the only idiot to do it. Surly they can get my phone records to show that I haven't been texting him accidents.""
Eventually Dave said, ""I've sent him messages, what's wrong with that?""
I said, ""Yeah, but no accidents?""
Dave said, ""Yeah, I've been messaging him where accidents are.""
I said, ""Surely you can't be that fucking dumb. Are you kidding me, your telling him where the accidents are?""
He said something similar to ""Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that""
I started getting angry with him and said, ""Mate they are there before us at the accidents, why would you be sending them messages where the accidents are?""He said, ""Well that's the thing, they are there to assist us anyway so what's the issue.""

9. We got back into the car and I said again, ""Mate are you for real, your really messaging the towies where the accidents are or are you just saying it to make me feel better?""
Dave got out his mobile phone. I'm not sure what make or model it was. He proceeded to show me a series of texts he had sent. I saw that there were addresses in the message field and in the address field was something like ""tow truck"" or ""towing truck"". One of the messages read something like, ""Westfield Carpark level 3 acco"".
I don't remember the other wording of the messages however they were similar and just short and brief including an address.
I said, ""Why would you even keep those message on your phone?"" I don't remember what he said. 
I said something like, ""They are going to think its me""1
He said, ""Well that's fine, you've got nothing to worry about""
I said, ""Do you think they are dumb, do you think they can't check your phone, why would you do such a stupid thing. Does any one else from work know about this""
He said, ""No. Do you know when Charlie is going to speak with these people again?""
I said, ""Next week some time, but I'm not getting involved in this any more.""
Dave said something like, ""If Charlie gets there first, I get something out of it. He then told me straight out that he received money.""
He told me he would meet up with them and get a spotters fee. He said that he had got over a thousand dollars. 
I said, ""Is the job really worth getting money on the side"".
I said, ""Does anyone else know about this and how would you get the money?""
He said, ""I would go to a Smash repair shop on Boundary Road Peakhurst where St George City Towing work out of and pick it up from them.""
I said, ""Your telling me you go straight there in uniform and take the money from them?
He said something like, ""I go around the back and get it""I said, ""What about the people you work with, did they know?""
He said, ""No they didn't"" or words to that effect.
By this time I was saying I don't want to know about this.

Section 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986
8Section 281 provides:
281 Admissions by suspects
(1) This section applies to an admission: 
(a) that was made by an accused person who, at the time when the admission was made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and
(b) that was made in the course of official questioning, and
(c) that relates to an indictable offence, other than an indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person.
(2) Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless: 
(a) there is available to the court: 
(i) a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or
(ii) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in subparagraph (i) could not be made, a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission, being an interview about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or
(b) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made.
(3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995) do not prevent a tape recording from being admitted and used in proceedings before the court as mentioned in subsection (2).
(4) In this section: 
investigating official means: 
(a) a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior), or
(b) a person appointed by or under an Act (other than a person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior) whose functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences prescribed by the regulations.
official questioning means questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence.
reasonable excuse includes: 
(a) a mechanical failure, or
(b) the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning electronically recorded, or
(c) the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned.
tape recording includes: 
(a) audio recording, or
(b) video recording, or
(c) a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously recorded audio recording.

The parties' arguments
9The Director submits that by taking into account the circumstances and context of the conversation it cannot be said Constable Vrahas was an ""investigating official"" nor were the admissions made ""in the course of official questioning"". The conversation arose out of Constable Vrahas's concerns for himself following what he had been told by ""Charlie"" and was concerned that because of his texting ""Charlie"", Professional Standards would think he was the one giving inside information to tow truck drivers about accidents. The conversation it is submitted was no more than a spontaneous informal discussion where Constable Vrahas was looking for advice from the accused because they were ""mates"" (T25.25) or ""work friends"" (T30.40). The showing by the accused of the messages on his phone that followed was purely spontaneous by the accused. Once the accused had showed him the phone messages with some further discussion about them, he said to the accused in response to a question about when he was next to see ""Charlie"", ""Next week some time, but I'm not getting involved in this anymore."" It is at this point that the accused then goes on to volunteer the admission that he was getting paid money (that is a bribe) for a ""spotters fee"" of ""over a thousand dollars."" In re-examination Constable Vrahas said that during the conversation he did suspect the accused had committed an offence but he did not suspect it to be a ""serious indictable offence"" 2 (T34.31-35.1), nor did he believe in his own mind that he was investigating the accused (T33.5-20). The reason he says he had that belief was that the NSW Police Code of Conduct and Ethics prohibits a police officer from investigating a friend or relative because it creates a conflict of interest and that is also why he did not administer a caution once he the accused became in his mind a suspect (T32-33).

10The Director relies upon the decisions in R v Naa [2009] NSWSC 851 at [76] and Bryant v R [2011] NSWCCA 26 at [148] (where it was held the admissions were not in response to questioning ""in connection with the investigation...of the commission of an offence""; R v Robinson [2003] NSWCCA 188 (where it was held the admissions ""were volunteered by the appellant rather than as a result of question put to him"" at [99]; R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 where it was held ""the appellant was not a suspect and further that at that time, he could not reasonably have been suspected of having committed an offence"" at [47]; not only for their relevant statements of principles in interpreting s 281 but also as dealing with analogous factual circumstances. 

11The Director has made no submissions on the application of the ""reasonable excuse"" provisions in s 281(2)(a) (ii) and (2)(b).

12The accused takes issue with the Director's narrow approach and the reliance on the subjective state of mind of Constable Vrahas. The crux of the accused's submission is, that as the conversation escalated into the ambit of s 281, Constable Vrahas did not appreciate the significant change in circumstances and the strict obligations imposed upon him by s 281 once he came within its ambit. The accused submits that from a consideration of the authorities, the conduct of Constable Vrahas was the very type of evidence that the Parliament sought to prohibit and that in this case there was a clear and blatant failure. From the time Constable Vrahas observed the accused's demeanour change to that, from his experience, to be consistent with the demeanour of a suspect trying to hide something, there was a line that either could or could not be crossed. As Constable Vrahas was alerted to the Professional Standards investigation, observed the change in demeanour of the accused and heard the subsequent alleged admission by the accused that he had been texting tow truck drivers, it is submitted that Constable Vrahas knew at that point what he had just been told was the very conduct that Professional Standards were investigating and by its nature he knew it was serious. It is at that point that Constable Vrahas should have terminated the conversation and thereafter discharged his obligations by immediately reporting the matter to a superior officer. However, by continuing the conversation he transformed the informal nature of the conversation into ""official questioning"" and into the ambit of s 281.

The relevant legal principles
13The interpretation of the words ""official questioning"" and ""in the course of official questioning"" in s 281, its former provisions as well as similar if not identical interstate provisions, has been the subject of considerable judicial review and were comprehensively referred to by Howie J in R v Naa and Bryant v R. 

14The following principles are relevant:
a)The section only operates upon objection: R v Reid [1999] NSWCCA 258.

b)Once the strict requirements of admissibility under s 281 are not satisfied the evidence is inadmissible: Schiavini v R [1999] NSWCCA 165 at [24].

c)The general purpose of the provision is to provide a reliable and objective means of resolving disputes about the conduct and substance of police interviews, deterring police malpractice and the making of false or unfair allegations against police: R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426 per Wood CJ at CL at 21-23; Nicholls v The Queen [2005] HCA 1; (2005) 219 CLR 196 at 207 [8]; Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12; (2004) 218 CLR 216 at 225-232 [22]-[40]; Carr v The State of Western Australia [2007] HCA 47 at [57]-[58]. In Carr Gleeson CJ said at [7] that the proper approach in construing legislative provisions of this kind is, ""The question then is not: what was the purpose or object underlying the legislation? The question is: how far does the legislation go in pursuit of that purpose or object?""

d)The terms of s 281 are similar to the provisions of the Tasmanian legislation considered by the majority of the High Court in Kelly v The Queen and the majority's decision should be followed: Bryant at [147].

e)The court is required to make an objective assessment of the circumstances and questioning by a police officer may still amount to official questioning regardless of the belief of the police officer: R v Sharp [2003] NSWSC 1117 at [21]. 

f)While the subjective purpose of a police officer engaging with a suspect might not be decisive as to whether the officer is involved in ""official questioning"" it may still be relevant: R v Naa at [79] (although Howie J did not elaborate further). 

g)A misconception by a police officer about when the section applies and what was required in order to comply with it cannot give rise to a reasonable excuse: R v Sharp at [13].

h)In R v Sharp Howie J made the following pertinent observations about the policy behind s 281 and it is instructive to quote these observations at length:

15 ""Official questioning"", for the purposes of s 281, means ""questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence"". I acknowledge once more that the policy behind the section should impact upon how the words of the provision are interpreted or applied. I am also conscious of the apparent width of the term as defined in the section. 

16 Further, I appreciate that there is to some degree an interrelationship between ""official questioning"" and ""reasonable excuse"". The wider the interpretation given to ""official questioning"", and, thus, the more extensive the obligation on police to electronically record conversations with suspects, the more likely it is that a reasonable excuse might be found for not recording a particular conversation in which an admission occurs. But the term ""official questioning"" must, in my view, have some limit and the conversation under consideration must be reasonably capable of being construed as questioning by a police officer. 

17 The policy behind the legislation is, as I have stated, obvious. It is an attempt to limit the opportunities both for a police officer to fabricate the making of an admission by a suspect, and for an accused person to challenge evidence of the making of an admission at a trial of a criminal offence. However, Parliament could have gone further in that endeavour, had it wished to do so. It could have required that any admission, allegedly made by a suspect, be inadmissible unless electronically recorded. If the legislation had been to that effect, it would have been irrelevant whether the admission occurred in questioning or otherwise. But it did not do so, and there is nothing in the Second Reading Speech to indicate that its purpose was other than to regulate police questioning. It is, in my view, inappropriate for the courts to interpret the legislation to bring about that result, however desirable it may be. There can be no doubt about the meaning of the word ""questioning"" and there is no occasion to give it any other meaning than it generally possesses.

18 There are clearly occasions where it will be necessary for a police officer to ask a suspect or other person a question but where there may be some doubt, to my mind at least, whether the questioning falls within the scope of the provision. One such occasion may be when the suspect is being processed by the custody officer under Part 10A of the Crimes Act. Yet questioning of the accused by the officer in accordance with the Part may literally fall within the meaning of ""official questioning"" and hence the section might operate to exclude any admission made at that time. An admission which is made during that process and which is not recorded might be admitted into evidence because there would be a reasonable excuse for failing to record the admission because it was unexpected and unresponsive to the question asked. 

19 But it seems to me that, because the legislation does not require that all admissions be electronically recorded, police should be able to determine with some degree of certainty what is and what is not ""official questioning"" for the purposes of the section and thus know when it is that they should takes steps to have a conversation electronically recorded to preserve any admission made by the suspect. However, where a police officer engages a suspect in conversation on any matter touching the investigation of an offence without recording the conversation, the officer takes a real risk that a court will find it to be official questioning regardless of the belief of the officer on that subject. As with Detective Hall in the present matter, if the police officer ought to have known that he or she was engaged in official questioning at the time an admission is made, a reasonable excuse for a failure to record an admission will not arise simply because the police officer might not have realised that the conversation was ""official questioning"" for the purpose of the section. 

20 I hesitate to attempt to give any more meaning to the words of the section that arise from the definitions contained in it and the policy behind the legislation. But the word used is ""questioning"" and it seems to me that it at least implies that the police officer is attempting to elicit from the person a response that the officer foresaw might provide information relevant to the investigation of the commission of an offence or possible offence, or be to the person's prejudice in that regard. I would be prepared to find in an appropriate case that statements made by the officer to the suspect might amount to ""questioning"" even though there may be no question asked. However, the mere fact that an admission occurs in response to a question or statement made by a police officer cannot retroactively convert the conversation into ""official questioning"" if it did not fall within the definition at the time the admission was made. 

21 I wish to emphasise that, in my opinion, the court is required to make an objective assessment of the circumstances surrounding the making of the alleged admission in determining both whether it was made during official questioning and whether there is a reasonable excuse in failing to electronically record it. If my view of official questioning is correct, it would follow that, if the police officer did not foresee that a response might be given to the statement or question made to the suspect but ought to have done so, the conversation would amount to ""official questioning"". To that extent the conduct of the police officer is subject to the court's review so far as the admissibility of any admission allegedly made by the accused is concerned.

22 Nothing that I have said in this judgment should be taken as a green light for police to ignore the provision or return to the type of practices that caused Parliament to enact it. The legislature might find that a point in time has been reached when it is opportune to reconsider the provision and further limit the opportunities for disputes to arise about admissions, as occurred before me. This is particularly so given the advance of technology for recording the human voice since the section was enacted. 

23 In respect of the conversation between the accused and Detective Bennett, the portion of the conversation to which objection is taken must be viewed in the context of what went before it and s 281 must operate in a realistic and commonsense way. It was not inappropriate, in my opinion, for Detective Bennett to speak to the accused at the scene in order to see how she was and to attempt to alleviate her concerns when she expressed her fears. I do not believe that he intended by anything he said, to elicit an admission from her or to obtain information beneficial to their investigation of the murder. Nor should the officer have reasonably foreseen that an admission might be made as a result of what he said to the accused.

24 I acknowledge that the intention of the police officer cannot take a conversation outside the scope of the provision if otherwise it falls within the meaning of ""official questioning"". But in this case, I am satisfied that the intention of the officer was not to question the accused at all but rather to allay her fears. I accept his evidence that the admission made by the accused was, so far as he was concerned, unresponsive to the statement made by him that occasioned it.

In R v Naa Howie J adopted these observations and said that while his decision is R v Sharp was before the High Court had reason to consider similar provisions in other jurisdictions, what the High Court did say did not affect what he had said (at [48]). 

i)The words ""in the course of'' do not require that there be a causal connection between the admission and the official questioning but the admissions must arise during ""the course of official questioning"": Kelly v the Queen at [45], and at [52] where the majority said:

The expression ""in the course of official questioning"" in s 8 of the Act marks out a period of time running from when questioning commenced to when it ceased. It renders s 8(2)(a) of the Act relatively narrow in the sense that it does not provide that video-recording is a condition for admissibility of all confessions made by persons who are suspected or ought reasonably to have been suspected of having committed a crime: video-recording is only a condition for admissibility of those made ""in the course of official questioning"". It renders s 8(2)(a) of the Act relatively broad in the sense that it does provide that video-recording is a condition for admissibility of confessions made ""in the course of official questioning"", without any limitation turning on whether the maker of the confession is in custody or under arrest. The requirement that confessions be video-recorded extends to confessions made anywhere so long as they are made ""in the course of official questioning"" - whether in police stations, in police cars, at the scene of a crime, or during informal encounters. The difficulty of video-recording confessions in particular circumstances is met by ss 8(2)(b)-(d) and (3)(a)-(d) of the Act. But whether the expression ""in the course of official questioning"" is viewed as making s 8(2)(a) narrow or broad, it stipulates a relatively clear criterion, suitable for application by police officers, whose usual procedures are formal and methodical.
In R v Naa Howie J said in this context at [77]: 
Although, as James J noted, the words ""in connection with an investigation"" are of wide import, in effect they confine or focus the scope of the questioning between a police officer and a suspect. Without these words ""official questioning"" would arise whenever a police officer is questioning a person who is or, ought reasonably to have been, suspected of committing an offence whatever be the content or circumstances of the questioning. As I pointed out in Sharp, that is not what Parliament sought to achieve by the provisions. There may be formal or informal police procedures before or after arrest that do not fall within the ambit of the section because they are not in connection with an investigation...

j)A question only falls into the ambit of s 281 where the police officer has reason to suspect the person of committing a crime: R v Villa at [44]-[53]; R v Taouk [2005] NSWCCA 155; R v Naa at [69]-[70].

k)In Carr v The State of Western Australia Gummow, Heydon and Crennan JJ (with Gleeson CJ agreeing but with additional reasons on other grounds) in considering the relevant Western Australia provision said of the use of the word ""interview"" at [47]-51] (footnotes omitted):

The meaning of ""interview"" in Ch LXA
47. Beyond the clarification that ""interview"" means an ""interview with a suspect by ... a member of the Police Force"", the Criminal Code does not otherwise define the word ""interview"". The Court was taken to a number of dictionary definitions, none of which provided a clear resolution to the present case. The appellant contended that ""interview"" connoted a ""formal, unhurried interrogation procedure directed to the investigation of crime"", as opposed to a chat, informal banter, or talk carried out in an atmosphere of informality. In part, this proffered definition was derived from dicta in the judgment of Wright J in R v McKenzie. In that case certain admissions were ruled inadmissible because they were not recorded by videotape, not for the absence of an ""interview"". 

48. The appellant submitted that a mere conversation would not suffice to constitute an ""interview"". To this end, the appellant pointed to the absence of any definition such as that found in s 74C of the Summary Offences Act 1953 (SA), in which ""interview"" is defined to include: 
""(a) a conversation; or 
(b) part of a conversation; or 
(c) a series of conversations"". 
This comparison of the South Australian and Western Australian provisions is of doubtful utility. The South Australian provisions were inserted in 1995 by s 5 of the Statutes Amendment (Recording of Interviews) Act 1995 (SA), well after the enactment in 1992 of the relevant Western Australian provisions. The most that could be said is that the South Australian provision might tend to highlight an ambiguity in the Western Australian one, but it does nothing to resolve that ambiguity one way or the other. The inclusion of conversations in the South Australian definition says nothing about whether they are to be excluded from the Western Australian provision, which is silent on the matter.

49.The appellant also contended that the ""formality"" of an interview required a ""meeting of minds"" about the nature, context and purpose of the discussion. However, that phrase is more likely to mislead than assist. The absence of a ""meeting of minds"" might indicate that the appellant's admissions were involuntary, or that they were elicited by unfair deception. Such cases can and should be dealt with under the common law exclusionary rules. They are not matters which touch upon the definition of ""interview"". 

50.Even if it be accepted that the term ""interview"" connotes a degree of formality, it is not apparent where that line is to be drawn. The conversation between the appellant and the police officers in the present case was no mere informal chit-chat: the police officers fell in with the appellant's style of speech, but they structured the relevant part of the conversation as a patient and deliberate sequence of questions and answers designed to elicit admissions. However, there is much force in the observation of Ormiston J in R v Raso that: 
""it would be difficult to identify that form of questioning which constitutes an 'interview' and that which constitutes some less formal kind of questioning in circumstances where the questions are being administered by the police"". 
Raso concerned the meaning of s 23V(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which at that time included the phrase ""interviewed as a suspect"". That legislation concerned the tape recording of such interviews, and Ormiston J considered it:
""artificial, and possibly conducive to the abuses which the legislation is trying to avert, to draw distinctions between questioning which takes place on a relatively casual basis and questioning which results from some formal or organised interview"". 

51.The same is true of the present case. Contrary to the appellant's submissions, neither logic nor the text of Ch LXA justifies the conclusion that ""formality"" requires that the suspect appreciate that the conversation was being recorded and that its contents could be used as evidence against him. Rather, in an appropriate case these matters may attract the common law exclusionary rules relating to involuntariness, unfairness or public policy.

Determination
15The idiom ""Crossing the Rubicon"" is apt in the circumstances of this matter, namely whether Constable Vrahas, after having allegedly been told by the accused of his texting tow truck drivers, had reached the s 281 Rubicon of ""questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence"". If that were the case and he then continued to question the accused then the s 281 ""die is cast"".3

16The following oral evidence is critical to the determination of this issue. Constable Vrahas acknowledged the change in demeanour in cross-examination as follows (at T23.10-20).

Q. Yes, certainly. I'm just referring to the part in your statement where you said that Dave went silent and he went very pale. They are observations that you made of him?
A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. I'm just saying they may or may not be factors that you would take into account with a suspect that perhaps that suspect may have something to hide. Can I put it that briefly?
A. Yes, that's correct.

Later in cross-examination he gave the following evidence (T24.5-26.27):
Q. You got angry with him and you said to him, ""Mate, they're there before us at accidents. Why would you be sending him text messages?"" You see whilst this conversation started off in an informal way, if I can put it that way, an informal way between a couple of mates, the content of the conversation started to change in a way that appeared to implicate the accused, didn't it?
...
Q. In a way that appeared to implicate the accused.
A. Yes.

Q. And no doubt this came as somewhat of a surprise to you?
A. Yes.

Q. After you started getting this information, and the texts were the subject of further discussions, we see from your statement - and I will read it to you - ""Dave got out his mobile phone,"" and you don't know the make or model, and he started to show you a series of texts. You saw addresses in the messages and something like ""towing"" or ""tow truck."" I think, in short, what you have seen was then physical evidence in relation to what Dave had told you he had been doing?
A. That's correct.

Q. So we've got a gradually, as it were, escalating - that may not be the right word, but we have got this informal conversation between mates. You knew Dave pretty well, didn't you?
A. Yes.

Q. A pretty robust individual, isn't he?
A. Yes.

Q. So you have the cue with him going silent and going pale. We have the various steps I've taken you to and then the citing of the physical evidence that confirms two things. Number one, it confirmed the answers that he had given to you. Correct?
A. Yes.

Q. Number two, it confirmed that he was in possession of evidence that could well pertain to the inquiry that Professional Standards was undertaking?
A. Yes.

Q. It would appear that when you had got those admissions, for want of a better word - you have seen the evidence - that you were in a position where the normal responsibilities that we have spoken about of a police officer investigating and the normal obligations to caution et cetera, came into play, didn't they? Some of those ordinary street tactics or street things that you would do. It would appear that you have gone from your conversation with a mate to something more sinister?
A. That's correct.

Q. If we move down the conversation. You kept asking him questions in an ongoing basis, didn't you?

HIS HONOUR: In a?

DAVIDSON
Q. An ongoing basis--
A. Yes.

Q. -- because Dave was being quite cooperative with you and he was answering all of these questions as you put them to him, wasn't he?
A. Yes.

Q. And you are gathering, question by question by question, what is amounting to evidence of his involvement in something that was interesting Professional Standards?
A. That's correct.

Q. Let me suggest - and please feel free to look to your statement - that when you get to the point where you say - and you know that I'm reading from page 4 of your statement - ""'Do you know when Charlie is going to speak with these people, Professional Standards?' I said, 'Next week some time, but I'm not getting involved in this anymore.'"" Obviously from the question and answer process with Constable Cottrell it was starting to emerge that he may well have been involved in something illegal or sinister?
A. That's correct.

In further cross-examination Constable Vrahas agreed that at this point he did not give the accused a caution (T26.39) nor did he as the conversation continued with the more damning alleged admissions made to more ongoing questions (T27.23). Constable Vrahas also agreed that while he had the opportunity to do so he took no immediate steps to notify a more senior officer of the alleged admissions so the accused could be given the opportunity of adopting them (T28.5-27). In re-examination Constable Vrahas said (at T34.30-35.25):

Q. You were asked a question about evidence that had been given yesterday by the Professional Standards officer and obviously you weren't here for that. At the time when you were speaking to David Cottrell did you suspect that there had been an offence committed?
A. (No verbal reply)

HIS HONOUR: I'm sorry, the answer was?

PATERSON: He's contemplating his answer, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You are contemplating. I thought I heard something said.

PATERSON: There was a pregnant pause, your Honour.

A. Yes.

Q. Did you suspect that it was a serious indictable offence?
A. No.

PATERSON: Your Honour, I will just check that this has been--

Q. You said in evidence that you didn't immediately report what had happened?
A. No.

Q. Can you say when you did report it?
A. That night.

Q. Who did you speak to?
A. Your Honour, that was to Leading Senior Constable Dibb.

HIS HONOUR
Q. Leading Senior Constable?
A. Leading Senior Constable Dibb, that night.

PATERSON
Q. Why did you go and speak to Leading Senior Constable Dibb?
A. I believed from the information that I had received from Constable Cottrell that a known offence had been committed and I went to a senior officer because I didn't know exactly what to do.

17The court accepts that the conversation did commence as an informal conversation about the Professional Standards investigation and Constable Vrahas's own concerns for himself and continued as such to the point when the accused's own connection with the investigation began to emerge and was not ""questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence"". However, the court accepts the accused's submission that at a certain point the questioning by Constable Vrahas moved from a conversation between work mates or friends into ""questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence"". That point, the court accepts, was as the accused objects.

18Constable Vrahas accepts that by then the accused was a suspect and while the conversation remained informal an objective assessment of the circumstances thereafter, is that the admissions that followed were no longer incidental, unsolicited or unresponsive to the ongoing questions by Constable Vrahas. By continuing to elicit from the accused a response that he foresaw might provide information relevant to the investigation of the commission of an offence or possible offence the s 281 line was crossed: R v Sharp at [20]. In those circumstances the factual analogies in R v Naa; Bryant v R; R v Robinson and R v Villa are not apposite. It would be artificial to say that on an objective assessment of the circumstances as set out in the evidence above, the continued questioning did not become ""questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence"". By the time Constable Vrahas had observed the change in demeanour of the accused, heard the subsequent alleged admission that he had been texting tow truck drivers and knowing of its serious nature because it was the very conduct that Professional Standards were investigating, the accused was by then implicated and, it follows, a suspect (T24.45-25.7). 

19The Director's submission that Constable Vrahas was not an ""investigating official"" is not accepted. Constable Vrahas was a police officer and he meets the statutory definition and that is all that is required in that regard: Bryant v R at [147]. 

20That Constable Vrahas did not believe the accused to have committed an a ""serious indictable offence"" (T34.31-35.1) is not the issue, but rather the issue is whether the investigation ""relates to"" a relevant indictable offence which it did in this matter: R v Rowe [2001] NSWCCA 1. Whilst Constable Vrahas did not in his own mind believe that he was investigating the accused (T33.5-20) that may be relevant as to whether he was intentionally undertaking ""official questioning"". However, that is not the test as questioning by a police officer may still amount to official questioning regardless of the belief of the police officer: R v Sharp [2003] NSWSC 1117 at [21].

21That the conversation was between work mates or friends is a circumstance the court needs to take into account. However, the individual characteristics of the questioner (other than needing to be an investigating official) and the suspect are not material for the application of s 281 although individual characteristics may be relevant for other exclusionary grounds. For instance, would the application of s 281 in these very circumstances be any different if the conversation had been with ""Fred"" or ""Charlie"". The answer to that should be no.

22The court also accepts the accused's submission that the Director cannot rely upon the ""conflict of interest"" argument. Constable Vrahas had created that very issue once the accused became implicated and he should have desisted from asking further questions and reported the matter to his superior officer. However, at his peril, he continued to ask questions and crossed the line into ""questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence"".

23The Director has not made any submission that in the event s 281 did apply then there was a ""reasonable excuse"" for not recording the conversation under s 281(2)(a)(ii) and (2)(b). The accused has submitted that it proceeds on the basis there is a concession by the Director that there is no ""reasonable excuse"" and the Director has not replied to that submission. The accused submits that there was ample opportunity when they got back to the police station that night for Constable Vrahas to take steps for the accused to be electronically interviewed and the alleged admissions put to him. Constable Vrahas acknowledged that he had an opportunity to report the matter to a senior officer so steps could be taken to electronically interview the accused but nothing was done (T28.5-33). While Constable Vrahas's evidence is that he did report the alleged admissions to Leading Senior Constable Dibb that night (T35.15) there is no evidence from Leading Senior Constable Dibb as to whether he took any steps to electronically interview the accused. Subject to confirming with the Director that he is not relying on a ""reasonable excuse"" for failing to electronically interview the accused the court accepts the accused's submission there is none. It follows that the evidence of Constable Vrahas after the words ""I said something like, 'They are going to think it's me'"" will be inadmissible.

2762012,R (Cth) v Wang; R (Cth) v Lin [2013] NSWDC 167,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Each of Hung Pin Wang and Chun Chou Lin stands for sentence as a consequence of having pleaded guilty to a charge that on 10 November 2012 at Mascot in this State he did import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, and that the quantity imported was a marketable quantity.  That is an offence contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 of the Commonwealth of Australia.  The two offenders are not co-offenders but committed the same type of crime at the same time and the same place and their backgrounds are similar.  The offence which they committed is a very serious offence.  That is represented by the fact that the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty-five years and/or a fine of $550,000.  
2At about 7am on Saturday 10 November 2012 the offenders arrived at Sydney International Airport terminal on Virgin Atlantic flight VS200 from Hong Kong.  During that flight the two offenders were seated next to each other in economy class.  Each offender answered ""no"" to a question on the Incoming Passenger Card to the effect that they were not bringing into this country any prohibited items such as, inter alia, illicit drugs.  Each of the offenders stated that he intended to stay at the Novotel Hotel when he arrived in Sydney.  Each offender was selected by the Customs Service for routine baggage examination.  At about 7.50am both offenders were detained for the purpose of a frisk search pursuant to s 219A of the Customs Act 1901.  Both offenders were asked to remove their shoes but they refused to comply.  A Justice of the Peace was then called to attend. 
3The Justice of the Peace had a conversation with the offender Wang with the assistance of an interpreter in the Mandarin language.  Wang then consented to removing his shoes.  A short time later, customs officers conducted a search under the inner sole of each of Wang's shoes and that search revealed two clear plastic satchels each containing a white crystalline substance.  A short time later the Justice of the Peace, again with the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter, spoke to Lin, who consented to the searching of his shoes.  Again, the search revealed under the inner soles of each shoe two clear plastic satchels each containing a white crystalline substance.  The offenders were then formally cautioned with the assistance of the interpreter.  At 12.52pm Wang was arrested by the Federal Police and his rights were explained to him.  At about 1.13pm the offender Lin was arrested and had his rights explained to him.
4The crystalline substances contained in the two plastic bags removed from the shoes of each offender were analysed and weighed.  The crystalline substance was, in each case, methamphetamine.  The pure weight of the methamphetamine imported by Wang was 577.39 grams.  The total weight of the methamphetamine imported by the offender Lin was 579.69 grams.
5It is to be noted that the range of offences for the importation of methamphetamine is that the importation of less than 250 grams is a ""trafficable quantity"", for the importation of which the maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment.  A ""marketable quantity"" is between 250 grams and 750 grams, for which the maximum penalty is twenty-five years imprisonment together with the fine that I have already mentioned.  For more than 750 grams the appellation given to the quantity is a ""commercial quantity"" and the maximum penalty for importation of more than 750 grams is life imprisonment.
6Each of the offenders agreed to be interviewed by the police.  It was suggested to Wang that he had imported a border-controlled drug, namely methamphetamine.  In response to that the offender said words to this effect:
""There is another name in China, we call it ice.  I'm not sure because I'm doing this for money, I don't really care.""
When it was suggested to Lin that he had imported a border-controlled drug into Australia he replied:
""I want to know what is the quantity here which is about if you import for personal use to use it, for personal use.""
He then said that he did not have anything further to say to the interviewing police about the allegation that they had put to him other than that he thought that he was ""really too greedy"".  He later admitted that he knew that what he was importing was something that was prohibited and that it was ""drugs"". 7The motive put forward by the offender Wang was importation for financial gain.  He said words to this effect:
""They told me that I could come here to and then I can earn more than fifty thousand Hong Kong dollars"".
He then said that another person had given him HK$10,000 to pay for his fare to Australia.   8In light of those admissions the Crown has very properly submitted that both offenders admitted in their records of interview that they imported the drugs for financial gain.  The offenders were paid the equivalent of $1000 prior to travelling to Australia and were to receive the remainder of the promised money, which appears to be either HK$40,000 or HK$50,000, when they returned to Hong Kong.  HK$50,000 was, at the time of the importation now in question, the equivalent of $6,210.  The offenders agreed to participate in this drug importation for financial gain in the thousands of dollars but not in the tens of thousands of dollars.
9In Wong v R (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [64] the High Court of Australia identified significant issues in sentencing for drug importation to include, firstly, the amount of the drug, secondly, the offender's knowledge about what was being imported, thirdly, the offender's role in the importation, and fourthly, the reward which the offender hoped to gain from participating in the importation.  In the same paragraph their Honours said this:
""In general, however, the larger the importation, the higher the offender's level of participation, the greater the offender's knowledge, the greater the reward the offender hoped to receive, the heavier the punishment that would ordinarily be exacted.""
10Much of the evidence before me and most of the submissions relate to the role of each of the offenders in the importation of the methamphetamine here in question.  Suffice to say that I accept that the offender Lin was purely a drug courier.  He became involved in the importation through the offender Wang.  The offender Wang knew that the prohibited drug being imported was methamphetamine, which is known in the vernacular in Mandarin and in English as ""ice"", but the offender Lin was not aware of the exact nature of the prohibited drug.
11In the DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, McClellan CJ at CL commenced to say at [255]:
""255.  Where it is capable of being discerned, the role played by an offender in a criminal enterprise, in particular one involving the importation of narcotics, is of great importance when assessing the objective criminality of the offence...
256.  ... However, whether the offender is characterised as a ""courier"" or ""principal"" must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did: Olbrich (at [19]) ... A ""mere"" or ""bare"" courier may be recruited to bring in border controlled drugs on the promise of a modest reward, commonly though not invariably a monetary sum.  A mere courier, although being the importer and critical to the importation, is incidental to the entire enterprise and acts at the instigation and direction of others.  He or she will normally have had his or her travel plans, including flights and accommodation, arranged or at least funded by superiors.  The mere courier will have had little, if any, input into the travel plans and no input into the planning of the offence......
258.  In many cases, a person described as a courier may have responsibilities in the enterprise that go beyond simply transporting drugs for a modest fee at the direction of others.  Although described as couriers, they play a role above that of a mere courier and should be sentenced accordingly.  It was for this reason that the High Court in Olbrich was concerned to emphasise that the label should not be allowed to obscure the reality.  In Horvorka, the offender's role extended beyond simply smuggling the drugs into Australia; he was required to extract the cocaine from the polymer.  The sentencing judge in that case found that the offender ""should be regarded as somewhat more than a mere courier"" (at 16).  In Diefenbach, the offender, one of four couriers, assumed an organisational role within the group of couriers...
259.  In the present case, the respondent had responsibilities beyond those which would be attributed to a mere courier.  He was required to make his own travel and accommodation arrangements and importantly (upon further instructions) arrange for delivery of the drugs in Sydney.  The respondent was clearly aware of the contents of the bottles and bag which he was carrying.  He took many independent steps, including arranging travel plans and booking hotel reservations, to ensure the importation went ahead.  Significantly, he was charged with the responsibility of delivering the drugs to their intended recipient...""
12In March 2012 Wang was living in a house in the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong province in the People's Republic of China.  That province was until recently known in the English language as Canton province.  He was stabbed by a neighbour resulting in an injury to his left hand and or left forearm.  The stabbing was a result of a dispute between neighbours about noise.  According to Wang's affidavit sworn on 22 July 2013, his ""hand was sliced two thirds of the way through"".  As a result of that injury Wang required two different surgical procedures.  The first surgical procedure cost the equivalent of $2,000.  Wang was then impecunious and needed to borrow money for that surgery from his mother.  A second surgical procedure was needed to repair bones and tendons in Wang's left hand.  He had no money to pay for that surgery, which again cost the equivalent of $2,000.  He borrowed money to pay for that surgery from an associate of his who was called either ""Big Brother Ye"" or ""Boss Ye"".  That surgery was performed in May 2012.  A medical certificate indicates that the diagnosis upon discharge was of a fracture to the left distal ulna indicating problems at the left wrist.  In his affidavit Wang said this:
""17.  After the second surgery Big Brother Ye told me I had to repay the debt.  He said he could put me in contact with someone who had a job for me.  This job would allow me to repay the debt, it would also give me enough money to cover some food and living expenses for my family.  As I was struggling financially at the time I felt I had no choice but to accept.  
18.  Big Brother Ye provided my contact details to the man who organised everything.  I do not know his name.  He contacted me and told me the job would involve carrying some items overseas.  I didn't turn my mind to what those items would be initially and agreed to take the job.
19.  A few days later I met this man at a restaurant to talk more about the details.  I asked what the items would be.  He refused to tell me and said 'You will take what you are given'.  At this point I became hesitant.  I had suspicions about the items I was to carry but was not sure exactly what those items would be.  
20.  About ten days later I met with this man again and was given the shoes containing the drugs.  This was the first time I was told that the items I would carry to Australia were illegal drugs.  I told the man that I no longer wished to be involved.  He said words to the effect of 'Too bad.  I have already purchased the plane ticket.  If you refuse to go you will have to pay for the plane ticket.'
21.  I felt no choice but to go ahead with the job.  My debt was now double.  I was told that if I did not repay the debt 'there will be consequences.'  The man said 'we know where you live and where your children live.  Harm will come to your family'.  I was very concerned that my family would be harmed if I did not proceed with the job.""
13According to the record of interview given by Wang to the police immediately after his arrest, he met with the ""organiser"" in the city of Shenzhen where the drugs were secreted in his shoes.   He also said that Big Brother Ye gave him the name of the organiser a few days after his initial discussion about this business proposal with Big Brother Ye.  In the record of interview he also said that the ""organiser"" gave him HK$1,500 to purchase the flight tickets to Australia.  It is clear from the evidence that, although Wang and Lin eventually went to a travel agent to obtain their flight tickets and details relating to other travel, the money was provided by the ""organiser"" and that either the ""organiser"" or someone acting as a member of his enterprise waited outside the travel agency whilst Wang and Lin purchased their airline tickets.  It is also stated in the interview given by Wang to the police that the purchasing of the flight tickets was before the travel to Shenzhen to have the drugs secreted in the shoes of each of the two offenders.  It is clear from what Wang told the police at the interview that he gave shortly after his arrest, and from the evidence put before me, that Wang and Lin were living together in Zhuhai in 2012 and that Wang told Lin of what he proposed to do to obtain money and that Lin agreed to participate in the enterprise.  Wang told the police that both he and Lin were to be paid the same amount of money which is usually described as HK$40,000 but at times has been referred to as HK$50,000.  
14It is clear that Wang introduced Lin to this activity of importing drugs.  Despite much ducking and weaving, learned counsel for Wang, Ms Cook, could not avoid the proposition that Wang in essence recruited Lin to participate in importing the methylamphetamine into Australia.  It may well be, and I accept, that Lin was a willing participant but had Wang not told Lin of what he, Wang, intended to do, Lin would not have become involved in the importation of the methylamphetamine.  Furthermore, one must accept as the necessary corollary of what was admitted by Wang that he must have introduced Lin to either the ""organiser"" and/or Big Brother Ye.  As I said earlier, I accept wholly the proposition that Lin was nothing more than a courier, but Wang's role was somewhat greater in that he recruited Lin to act in an enterprise that was being conducted either by Big Brother Ye or by the person I have identified as ""the organiser"" or by both.  The criminality of Wang, therefore, in my view is greater than that of Lin.  Furthermore, as the offenders are not co-offenders, parity principles are not strictly relevant, although the nature of each offending is similar, albeit not the same.  
15Each offender comes before this Court without any evidence of any criminal record; certainly neither offender has any criminal record in Australia.  Each of the offenders was born in Taiwan but there is no evidence from there that either offender has a criminal record.  Each of the offenders moved to mainland China to pursue their business activities but there is no evidence from the People's Republic that either offender has a criminal record there.   There is no evidence that either of the offenders has a criminal record in Hong Kong.  However, the significance of prior good character is attenuated in cases involving the importation of prohibited substances.  A person who has a prior criminal record would make a very poor drug courier because his activities may be suspected and he might be refused an entry permit into Australia.  Having no criminal record is often a prerequisite for those carrying drugs illegally.  
16Neither offender is the user of drugs.  Neither offender was drawn into drug importation by reason of his own addiction and the need to obtain money to satisfy his own addiction.  
17However, each of the offenders had been unsuccessful in business.  Each of them tells me that that was a result of the global financial crisis.  Whether that is so or not is largely irrelevant.  The fact is that each man had been unsuccessful in business, had accumulated debts and was in a parlous position and needed to make money.  Hence each agreed to be a courier of drugs into Australia.  However, many, many people run up debts.  The running up of debt is hardly a factor which could be seen in any way to mitigate the deliberate importation of prohibited drugs.
18Drug trafficking is a very lucrative business.  Millions, if not billions, of dollars are earned through illicit drug trafficking.  Because of the significance of illicit drug trafficking, the Courts must be very strict in enforcing the policy of general deterrence.  The fact that significant amounts of money may be made only encourages illicit drug trafficking.  The end result of illicit drug trafficking is the ruination of lives, in particular the lives of many young people, as this Court has witnessed over many, many years.  Illicit drugs destroy lives and therefore the Courts must do their best to ensure that anyone who is tempted to engage in drug trafficking to obtain a financial reward must be deterred from so doing by reason of there being very heavy penalties imposed.  As long ago as 24 June 1998, Barr J said in the Court of Criminal Appeal in the matter of Botero that:
""To make substantial amounts of money from trading in drugs for the purpose of payment of personal and family debts is no less criminal than to make the same amounts for pure profit.""
19I turn now to consider the personal circumstances of each offender.  Wang was born on 6 September 1975.  He is thirty-seven years old.  He married in 2002 and has two children; a daughter aged eight and a son aged five.  As I have earlier mentioned, he was born in Taiwan.  He was the eldest of three brothers.  He commenced school at the age of seven but left school at the age of fourteen in order to work with his mother in the clothing industry.  
20He completed compulsory military service in Taiwan and then moved to mainland China in 1990 to find work.  He found such work in a family run business making clothes.  He opened his own small family business making clothes in 2003.  However, he had to close that business in 2009 and was unable to find employment after that.  He told me in his affidavit that he had not had a job since 2009.  The evidence before me discloses that there is no form of unemployment relief in the People's Republic of China.
21In his affidavit, the offender Wang said this:
""Since being in custody my wife has had to go to work full-time.  She lives at the factory she works at.  She works approximately twenty-eight days each month and only has two/three days off per month.  As a result my daughter has been sent to Taiwan to stay with my family and my son is being cared for by a nanny.  I understand that my children are not coping very well and are very sad.""
However, it transpired from the offender's oral evidence that, antecedent to his travelling to Australia, his wife was living at a factory in which she was working full-time and that the offender's two children were living with an aunt and that the offender himself was living with the other offender, Lin. 22An issue that arises is whether a threat was made to the offender that harm might come to his family.  Such a threat was never stated by Wang when he was interviewed by the police.  Indeed statements made by Wang to the police indicate a lack of such fear.  For example, the offender told the police that he had Big Brother Ye's telephone number and that the number of the ""organiser"" was stored in his mobile phone.  In other words, Wang was prepared to tell the police of the telephone numbers of Ye and ""the organiser"", meaning that he must not have been particularly fearful of them.
23Furthermore, what the offender said in his affidavit about the circumstances of his wife and his children after his arrest is misleading in that that appears to have been the position prior to his arrest.  I therefore am not persuaded that I should accept the offender Wang's evidence that he was under any threat from either Big Brother Ye or the organiser.  I accept that he became involved in drug importation for the motive of financial gain and that he effectively recruited Lin into the planning of some other offender.
24Wang told me, and I accept entirely, that upon his release from custody he intends to return to mainland China to be reunited with his wife and children and to find employment in order to support his wife and children.
25Since his arrest the offender has been earning approximately $30 per week by working in the prison system.  He has been of good behaviour in custody.  But I also accept the assertion that the entire experience of being arrested and imprisoned he has found ""incredibly distressful"".  I accept that it will be difficult for him being held in an Australian prison where he was unaware of the customs not only of this country, but also of the correctional system, and where his understanding of the English language is severely limited.
26I accept that it is unlikely that the offender will commit any further offence in Australia.  In fact, it would be extremely unlikely, if not impossible, because it is highly likely that on his release from custody the offender will be deported from this country and is hardly likely to be re-admitted under present immigration regulations.  However, given the offender's background and his responsibilities, his lack of prior offending and the deterrent effect of serving a custodial sentence in Australia, I believe the offender will learn a lesson and not engage in criminal activity in any place outside Australia.  I accept that there are good prospects of rehabilitation.
27I turn now to the offender Lin.  Lin was born on 4 July 1978.  He is currently thirty-five years old.  He married in May 2012.  He gave evidence last Thursday that since he was arrested he has been advised that his wife is pregnant, and his wife is due to be delivered of their first child this week.  The offender was raised by his grandmother.  That appears to be as a result of his parents' divorcing.  Whether he was raised by his paternal or maternal grandmother the evidence does not disclose.  He has one brother but he has had no contact with that brother since his teenage years.
28The offender went to mainland China to study to be a chef.  I understand that those studies were lengthy and took approximately nine years.  He opened his own restaurant in March 2010 in Tianjin.  However, that business failed during the global financial crisis and he closed it down in 2012.  He then had a job travelling between Maccau and the People's Republic of China selling various goods.  He then went to Guangdong Province and was working casually as a concreter.  However, when his restaurant closed he was burdened with debt and it appears that his work as a casual concreter was insufficient to enable him to discharge his debt:  hence he entered into the drug trafficking arrangement.  Since he was arrested, the offender has been working as a cleaner in prison and has been studying English.  
29The remarks which I have made on the question of rehabilitation concerning Wang are equally applicable to Lin.  He is hardly likely to commit any further crime in this country and I am confident that that, assured of what will happen if he offends again in some other jurisdiction, would deter him from again committing a crime.  The offender clearly wants to leave the prison system as soon as possible to return to China to meet for the first time the child that is due to be born this week.
30I turn now in respect of each offender to the checklist provided by s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth.  I have already discussed the nature and circumstances of the offence.  There are no other offences to be taken into account.  There is no evidence of any course of conduct by either offender which consists in a series of criminal activities or criminal acts.  I have sought to consider the personal circumstances of the offenders but I am also required to consider the personal circumstances of any victim of the crime.  There of course is no such direct victim, although there might have been had the drugs been imported without being detected and then been disseminated into the community.  Necessarily there is no injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence but there could have been.  
31I am required to take into account the degree to which each offender has shown contrition for the offence by either taking action to make reparation or in any other manner.  Contrition of course is shown by the plea of guilty.  Contrition is also shown by the frank admissions made after arrest by each offender to the police and each of the offenders has expressed in his evidence contrition and remorse.  There is nothing that is provided for in s 16A(2) par (fa) which I need to take into account.  
32Again, I repeat that each offender has pleaded guilty and I will take that plea of guilty into account.  It is conceded that each offender pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and I intend to provide to each offender a discount of twenty five percent of the sentence otherwise to be properly passed upon him for that early plea of guilty.  Again, I have already taken into account the cooperation each offender gave to the police when each of the offenders agreed to be interviewed after their arrest.  I already pointed out that I must give effect to general deterrence in any sentence to be passed for drug importation.
33I have already adverted to the prospects of rehabilitation.  The final matter provided for in s 16A(2) is the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on the offender's family or dependants, but the authorities make it clear that that is only in exceptional circumstances and here there is no such exceptional circumstance.  Wang was not supporting his wife nor his children at the time he committed these offences.  Whether Lin's wife was working prior to the offender's being arrested I do not know.  The offender is concerned, and I accept that he is genuinely concerned, about how his wife will support herself at the time of her confinement, which is imminent and immediately after that confinement to care for her newborn child.  As did Mr Wang, Mr Lin points out that there is no unemployment relief available in China and the inference to be drawn from Mr Lin's evidence is that at least he is unaware of any supporting mother's benefit or the like.  It is unclear as to whether there is any extended family that could assist Lin's wife at this time.  Lin's grandmother died in 2009.  It may be that his wife will need to look to her extended family for support until the offender can be released from custody.
34Much time was spent considering comparable cases, judicial statistics and leading authorities as to what sentence should be passed.  For example, Ms Cook points out that statistics available from the Judicial Commission tell me that the median head sentence for offences of this nature is five years imprisonment and the median non-parole period is three years imprisonment.  The eighty-percentile range for head sentences is between eight years and three years and the eightieth percentile range of non-parole periods is between six years and one year.  Ms Cook took me to other passages of the DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa where the Chief Judge at Common Law commenced to discuss the range of sentences involved at [216].  
35In my view the present cases fall within what his Honour described as the ""second group"" of cases commencing at [220], rather than the ""third group"" of cases commencing at [223], which is the category that Ms Cook submitted I ought consider her client.  The third category were ""mere couriers"".  They generally expected a financial reward, either relief of debt or a financial reward to be measured in thousands of dollars, or entered a plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity.  Many of them had adverse personal circumstances including drug use and dependency, which is here not the case, and also familial or relationship problems, which, again, is here not the case.  However, in those cases the quantities of narcotics involved in the offences tend to lie at the more conservative end of the marketable threshold.  Here each of the amount of drugs imported was in the midrange of the marketable quantity and not towards the bottom of the range.  
36In the case of Wang, I have determined that the appropriate starting point is a period of imprisonment of nine years.  I reduce that by twenty five percent for the plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity.  If my mathematics be correct, which is always problematical, that gives me a head sentence of six years and nine months.  I fix a non-parole period of four years and six months.  
37In the case of Lin, I commence the sentencing process with a head sentence of eight years.  I reduce that by twenty five percent on account of the offender's plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity.  That gives me a head sentence of six years' imprisonment.  I fix a non-parole period of four years.  Now, four years and six months from 10 November 12 is 9 May 17, is that right?
VANDERVEEN:  That was my calculation. 
HIS HONOUR:  No one wants any further reasons, do they?
VANDERVEEN:  No, your Honour.
38HIS HONOUR:  Hung Pin Wang, on the charge that on 10 November 2012 at Mascot in this State you did import a substance, the substance being a border-controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, and the quantity being a marketable quantity, you are convicted.  I sentence you to imprisonment for six years and nine months, commencing on 10 November 2012.  I fix a non-parole period of four years and six months, commencing on 10 November 2012 and expiring on 9 May 2017.
39Chun Chou Lin, on the charge that on 10 November 2012 at Mascot in this State you did import a substance, the substance being a border-controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, and the quantity imported being a marketable quantity, you are convicted.  I sentence you to imprisonment for six years, commencing on 10 November 2012.  I fix a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 10 November 2012 and expiring on 9 November 2016.
Now, Ms Croft, Mr Payton's client, Mr Wang, asked me to recommend that he is to be deported to the PRC, rather than Taiwan.  Does your client want a similar recommendation?
CROFT:  Your Honour, if I could just seek instructions on that point?
HIS HONOUR:  Certainly.
CROFT:  Thank you, your Honour, he's asked that an order be made that he be deported to the People's Republic of China.
HIS HONOUR:  I recommend to the custodial and immigration authorities that if it be determined that upon their release to parole the offenders be deported, they be deported not to Taiwan but to the People's Republic of China.  Any other order's sought?
VANDERVEEN:  No, your Honour.
CROFT:  No.
HIS HONOUR:  Do you need a drug destruction order?
VANDERVEEN:  No we don't, your Honour.

		09 September 2013",2013-07-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762016,New South Wales Crime Commission v Cassar (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1011,"Judgment

1The proceedings before the Court have a complicated history. For present purposes, it is sufficient to refer to a series of interlocutory judgments relating to the admissibility of evidence and the reopening of matters to allow for the filing of further affidavits. The New South Wales Crime Commission (hereinafter, ""the Commission"" or ""the Applicant"") moved on notice filed on 21 July 2010 for orders under s 31A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (hereinafter, ""CARA"") against the first defendant in the proceedings, Charles Michael Cassar (hereinafter also referred to as ""the Respondent"").

2Orders under s 31A of CARA relate to an interest in property that has not been disclosed, in circumstances where the interest was required to be disclosed, by a defendant to such proceedings in the following terms:

""31A Assets forfeiture orders after interests in property not disclosed
(1) This section applies if:

(a) an application for an assets forfeiture order or proceeds assessment order or unexplained wealth order is made, and

(b) evidence or a warranty or other representation was given or made in proceedings for the order, or examination proceedings under this Act, by a person against whom the order is made (the defendant) as to the defendant's interests in property.

(2) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for an order forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown a specified interest in property of the defendant at the time the evidence, warranty or representation was given or made that was not disclosed in the evidence, warranty or representation.

(3) The Supreme Court must make the order if the Court finds it more probable than not that the interest in property was an interest of the defendant at the time the evidence, warranty or representation was given or made.""

3The earlier interlocutory judgments dealt with the capacity of the Commission to prove the existence of property in which the Respondent had or has an interest and the manner in which such proof could be effected: see, inter alia, New South Wales Crime Commission v Cassar [2012] NSWSC 1170. Other judgments also dealt with the admissibility of a letter (Exhibit S1) from which the Commission seeks to draw an inference, which letter was part of the process whereby the Commission and Mr Cassar negotiated earlier consent orders.

4The jurisdictional precondition to the operation of s 31A of CARA is relevantly a warranty that was said to be given by Mr Cassar as part of consent orders issued by the Court on 21 April 2008. Other than the alleged warranty, the remainder of the consent orders are presently irrelevant. The alleged warranty is paragraph 3 of the consent order and was noted by the Court as part of those consent orders. The warranty was in the following terms:

""THE COURT NOTES:

...

3. The First Defendant warrants to the Plaintiff that the First Defendant's only interests in property as at the date of the signing of these orders are the First Defendant's interests in the seized cash (together with any interest earned thereon), and the property specified in Schedule Two hereto ('the Seven Hills property') and Schedule Three hereto ('the Holden motor vehicle').""

5Because of the delay in the final hearing of the matter, the issue relating to the admissibility of documents purporting to prove the existence of the Respondent's interests in property in Swiss banks is no longer extant. Exhibit A in the proceedings is a certificate under the hand of the Acting Assistant Secretary, International Crime Cooperation Central Authority, International Crime Cooperation Division, Attorney General's Department of the Australian Government, being a certification under subsection 26(1) of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 (Cth) of material obtained as a result of a request made by or on behalf of the Attorney General. It has been admitted without objection and proves an interest in property held in Swiss bank accounts, being property beyond the property described in Schedules Two and Three of the consent orders of 21 April 2008 and therefore property interests beyond that purportedly warranted by Mr Cassar in the note recited above.

6There are two issues in the proceedings: first, whether a warranty of the kind to which s 31A refers can be given by a solicitor or agent on behalf of a defendant or, in other words, whether such a warranty is required to be given personally by a defendant.

7Secondly, whether such a warranty was authorised by the Respondent and, if not, whether ostensible authority is sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of s 31A of CARA.

8I am satisfied, on the material before the Court, that it is more probable than not, if the warranty were given, that the Respondent held interests in property beyond that described in the warranty.

Issue 1: Requirement for personal and direct warranty

9By his written submissions of 16 May 2013 and his oral submissions of 17 May 2013, counsel for the Respondent relied upon earlier submissions filed on behalf of the Respondent, particularly paragraphs 1 to 10 thereof.

10Those submissions agitate the proposition that the warranty must be from the person against whom the orders are to be made and not from some other person on that person's behalf. The argument is based upon the terms of the Act itself and the requirement to have clear and express words in order to give rise to the kind of ""draconian orders"" for which s 31A of CARA provides.

11Essentially, as is emphasised in the additional submissions of 16 May 2013, the submission is that the terms of s 31A(1)(b) of CARA should be interpreted strictly and literally, to the effect that a warranty or other representation must be given directly and personally by the Respondent.

12I make no criticism of counsel for the Respondent, or indeed for the Commission, but during the course of submissions, on inquiry from the Court, the provisions of s 55 of CARA were examined. Section 55 is in the following terms:

""55 Conduct of directors, employees or agents

(1) If it is necessary, for the purposes of this Act, to establish the state of mind of a body corporate in respect of conduct engaged in, or taken by subsection (2) to have been engaged in, by the body corporate, it is sufficient to show that a director, employee or agent of the body corporate (being a director, employee or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority) had that state of mind.

(2) Any conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate: 

(a) by a director, employee or agent of the body corporate within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority, or

(b) by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of a director, employee or agent of the body corporate, if the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the director, employee or agent,

is to be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been engaged in by the body corporate.

(3) If it is necessary, for the purposes of this Act, to establish the state of mind of a person in relation to conduct taken by subsection (4) to have been engaged in by the person, it is sufficient to show that an employee or agent of the person (being an employee or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority) had that state of mind.

(4) Conduct engaged in on behalf of a person other than a body corporate: 

(a) by an employee or agent of the person within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority, or

(b) by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of an employee or agent of the first-mentioned person, where the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the employee or agent,

is to be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been engaged in by the first-mentioned person.

(5) A reference in this section to the state of mind of a person includes a reference to the knowledge, intention, opinion, belief or purpose of the person and the person's reasons for the person's knowledge, intention, opinion, belief or purpose.""

13The provisions of subsection 55(4) expressly relate, amongst other things, to conduct engaged in by a solicitor on behalf of Mr Cassar, within the scope of his actual or apparent authority. For the purposes, amongst other things, of s 31A of CARA, such conduct is taken to have been engaged in by the first-mentioned person. In other words, subsection 55(4) of CARA allows a solicitor to give a warranty (assuming, for this purpose, actual or apparent authority) as to the ownership of property, the giving of which is taken to have been engaged in by the first defendant, the client to the solicitor.

14In this case, the solicitor acting for the Respondent executed the consent orders containing the warranty upon which the Commission relies. Subject to the existence of actual or apparent authority to give that warranty, the solicitor was entitled to give that warranty and, to the extent that the solicitor had actual or apparent authority, that warranty is taken to be a warranty given by the Respondent.

15In my view, s 55(4) of CARA provides a total answer to the submission that the terms of s 31A of CARA should be strictly interpreted to disentitle a solicitor from giving a warranty on behalf of her or his client.

16I accept that a warranty needs to be clearly and expressly stated in order to give rise to orders under s 31A of CARA. In this case, the warranty clearly and expressly warrants that no other property is held save for the property described in Schedules Two and Three to the consent orders in which the warranty is contained.

17I also consider that the terms of the warranty are clear and express. The consent orders are signed by Mr Goold, solicitor, on behalf the Respondent and expressly state that ""The First Defendant consents to the terms of order above"". The order is otherwise (i.e. on its first page) headed Consent Order and thereunder there are, leaving aside the formal parts, four paragraphs in which the Court notes certain aspects and a further seven paragraphs in which the Court orders certain conduct, or the restraining of certain conduct. In my view, the phrase ""terms of order above"" refers to the entirety of the consent orders, including the noted paragraphs. That reference is clear and express.

18As earlier stated, Mr Goold was the solicitor acting for Mr Cassar. As such, he had authority, as an agent, to sign consent orders. Mr Goold was an agent of Mr Cassar, but it does not follow that the terms of the arrangement between Mr Cassar and Mr Goold were such that Mr Goold possessed actual or apparent authority to provide the warranty.

The Second Issue: Actual or Apparent Authority

The evidence

19The issue of authority is a contentious one. 

20The authority that is required is not a general authority. Actual authority in this regard is not conferred by an authority to state the interests in property of the client. Nor would an expression of opinion by a client relating to the interests in property of the client be sufficient to allow a solicitor to warrant in terms necessary to satisfy the jurisdictional precondition in s 31A of CARA.

21Thus, if all that had occurred, was that a solicitor had been informed by her or his client that the client owned certain property and no more, that statement of the client would not be sufficient to grant actual authority to the solicitor to execute a warranty, or warrant, in terms sufficient to satisfy s 31A of CARA.

22In this case the Commission relies upon the terms of the letter from Mr Goold (Exhibit S1) to allow the Court to draw an inference that Mr Goold had instructions as to the property that was available for confiscation. I have no doubt, on the material before the Court, that Mr Cassar told Mr Goold of his property interests in terms not dissimilar to that which is repeated in Exhibit S1. 

23In order for Mr Goold to warrant in terms that would satisfy the provisions of s 31A of CARA, Mr Goold would have to have actual or apparent authority to issue a warranty of the kind sought. The provision of information to him as to interests in land is not authority for the signing of a warranty that would give rise to the kind of orders, or satisfy the provisions of, s 31A of CARA. However, there is other evidence.

24In his affidavit of 20 October 2011, Piet Baird attests to a number of meetings between Mr Cassar and Mr Baird. He also attests to a discussion between Mr Cassar and Mr Baird concerning the consent orders that are impugned or relied upon in these proceedings. 

25Mr Baird refers to the fact that Mr Cassar told him he did not sign the orders and that his solicitor, Mr Goold, had no authority to sign the consent orders which included the warranty. They also had a conversation relating to the Swiss bank account records, the effect of which was that Mr Cassar admitted that the moneys were ""my account"" and asserted that the moneys were ""a family trust"".

26Mr Baird also attests to a conversation with Mr Goold on 4 August 2010. The terms of that conversation bear reciting:

""He [Mr Goold] said: 'What's going on?'

I said: 'Same old, same old. He's playing the usual game.'

He said: 'What? Saying I didn't have instructions to sign the consent orders?'

I said: 'Yes.'

He said: 'That's rubbish. I'll go in and see him.'""

27Further evidence has been adduced (affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark of 17 May 2013) in which Mr Spark recites part of the terms of the Goold letter (Exhibit S1) and annexes a copy of the records of the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services disclosing all visitors received by Mr Cassar whilst in custody between 21 December 2007 and 26 May 2008. Those records disclose that Mr Goold, the solicitor in question, visited Mr Cassar on 4 February 2008, 17 February 2008, 26 February 2008, 7 March 2008, 16 March 2008, 31 March 2008, 10 April 2008 and 23 April 2008. The Court proceedings before the Registrar, in which the consent orders in question issued, were on 21 April 2008.

28Against the foregoing is the affidavit of Mr Cassar in which he attests to the fact that he had been provided with some legal papers whilst in prison. He had instructed Mr Goold as his solicitor and was, thereafter, in regular contact with him. In the course of the affidavit Mr Cassar says:

""Goold did not ask me any questions about my assets. I did not give him any instructions to sign any consent orders nor make any warranty as to my assets.""

29Mr Cassar also attests that 7 April 2008, when he met Mr Baird at the premises of the Commission, was the first occasion that Mr Cassar had seen the consent orders and the terms of the alleged warranty.

30Neither Mr Spark nor Mr Baird was cross-examined. Nor was Mr Cassar. Mr Goold was not called to give evidence.

31I accept that a conversation occurred between Mr Baird and Mr Goold to the effect of that recounted in Mr Baird's affidavit. I do not accept that Mr Cassar did not give Mr Goold instructions as to the state of his interests in property, whether or not those instructions were given in answer to questions from Mr Goold.

32As earlier stated, if Mr Cassar were to have given instructions as to the state of his property interests and confined to that aspect, such instructions would not, on their face, be sufficient to grant actual authority to Mr Goold to give the warranty in the consent orders.

33I am also satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Cassar saw the terms of the consent order ultimately signed by Mr Goold and issued by the Court. Such an inference is inevitable from acceptance of the description by Mr Goold in the conversation with Mr Baird that it was ""rubbish"" that Mr Cassar did not give instructions to sign the consent orders. I also draw the inference from the foregoing that Mr Goold had actual authority to sign the consent orders.

Consideration

34I have concluded above, and reiterate, that s 55(4) of CARA is a total answer to the proposition that a warranty, representation or evidence must be given personally by the defendant in order for it to form the basis of orders under s 31A of CARA. An agent with actual authority, and express authority, to give a warranty of the kind here given could do so and bind a defendant in the way s 31A of CARA requires. Different issues arise in relation to ostensible or apparent authority, notwithstanding the provisions of s 55 of CARA.

35Ordinarily, for orders, of a kind to which s 31A of CARA relates, to be made on the basis of a breach of a warranty, that warranty would have to have been given expressly, by the defendant. The terms of s 55(4) of CARA require conduct of an agent with the apparent authority of the defendant to be taken, for the purposes of CARA, to have been engaged in by the defendant.

36The effect of s 31A of CARA, on initial examination, is draconian (as earlier stated). Nevertheless, the consent orders issued on 21 April 2008 were, substantially, an order varying previously made restraining orders. Those previously made restraining orders were issued under s 10 of CARA. They related to the property of the defendant. 

37The orders of 21 April 2008 varied that restraint in a way that benefited Mr Cassar and allowed him to deal with his motor vehicle. They also allowed for the payment of legal expenses out of moneys seized. Further, the orders of 21 April 2008 forfeited the remaining property, being the property that went beyond that allowed for legal expenses and the motor vehicle.

38The context of the consent orders issued on 21 April 2008 is such that if the Commission were aware of the amounts of money contained in the Swiss bank accounts, the orders would have provided for the forfeiture of the Swiss bank accounts (or there would have been argument in relation to same). 

39The provisions of s 22 of CARA, under which the forfeiture order issued, require the Court, on being satisfied that a defendant has interest in property of the kind described in subsection 22(1A), to make a forfeiture order. In other words, there are complementary aspects to both s 22 and s 31A.

40The interests in property of a defendant to an application under CARA are forfeited, once the Court is satisfied that the defendant holds interests in property and the person is suspected of having been engaged in a serious crime related activity. There can be no doubt, in these proceedings, that there is a reasonable suspicion that the Respondent was engaged in serious crime related activity.

41As a consequence, leaving aside the discretion available to the Court under s 10 and s 12 of CARA (each of which was utilised), the Court would, having been satisfied of the jurisdictional requirements, make an order that the assets of the Respondent be confiscated. It issued such an order on 21 April 2008.

42In the order of 21 April 2008, those assets were confined to the disclosed property to which reference has already been made. Because of the warranty, no other order was sought or obtained and the proceedings were otherwise dismissed.

43As a consequence of the foregoing, the warranty, provided in paragraph 3 of the Consent Orders, is an essential, or expedient, means of identifying the property that will be the subject of an assets forfeiture order. It is, in those circumstances, an aspect of the settlement of the proceedings for which a legal representative has apparent or ostensible authority. It is not a subject matter which is extraneous or collateral to the subject matter of the proceedings.

44Further, the effect of the warranty is to do no more than to confine the terms of the assets forfeiture order. In those circumstances, the effect of orders under s 31A of CARA is not draconian. It completes the assets forfeiture that would otherwise have been effected were the totality of the property interests of the Respondent disclosed in the first place.

45For the foregoing reasons, together with the express terms of s 55(4) of CARA, there is no good reason to read down the terms of s 55 and apparent authority is sufficient for the purposes of making or giving a warranty that will give rise to orders under s 31A of CARA.

46Further, Mr Goold had apparent authority to give the warranty that provides the jurisdictional foundation for the orders under s 31A of CARA, and otherwise there was no reason to refuse the application.

47For the foregoing reasons, and notwithstanding the express denial by Mr Cassar, the orders sought by the Commission in its motion are granted.

48The Court makes the following orders:

(1)An order pursuant to s 31A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown the interests in property of Charles Michael Cassar (also known as Charlie Cassar and Carmel Cassar), the First Defendant and Respondent to the motion, being:

(a)Funds in UBS Bank, Zurich, Switzerland account number 0206-388418 in the name of Carmel Cassar;

(b)Funds in UBS Bank, Zurich, Switzerland account number 0206-00890925 in the name of Golden Jumami Foundation.

(2)The Respondent shall pay the Applicant's costs of and incidental to the motion, as agreed or assessed.

(3)Liberty is granted to the Applicant and the Respondent to apply on 3 days' notice.

2762029,Singh v R [2013] NSWCCA 186,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 21 December 2009, with four other men, the appellant was charged, pursuant to s 111(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, with entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of special aggravation. Such an offence exposed him to a penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The offence was allegedly committed on 13 December 2009.

2Thereafter, discussions took place between the appellant's legal representatives and legal representatives of the Crown, as a result of which the appellant agreed to enter a plea of guilty to a lesser offence, under s 111(2), of entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation (not special aggravation). The Crown accepted that plea. Such an offence exposed the appellant to a penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 two further charges were laid against the appellant, of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Crimes Act, s 59), and common assault (Crimes Act, s 61). The appellant also agreed to plead guilty to each of these charges.

3Notwithstanding the agreement of the Crown to accept the plea to the charge under s 111(2), by mistake he was committed to the District Court for sentence for the more serious s 111(3) offence.

4Sentencing proceedings took place in the District Court in Sydney on 25 August 2011. On each count, the appellant was formally convicted and sentenced. The sentencing judge selected the sentence on the basis that the maximum penalty applicable to the offence to which the appellant pleaded guilty was imprisonment for 20 years. He sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of 9 months. 

5The appellant does not speak English. He was at all times represented by counsel. An interpreter was present. The charge was not read in court, the appellant's counsel merely indicating that the appellant entered (or adhered to) the plea of guilty. Nobody noticed that the plea was entered to the more serious charge, contrary to the agreement between the appellant, through his legal representative, and the Crown.

6The appellant now appeals against the convictions. The Crown accepts that a miscarriage of justice has taken place, and that the plea to the s 111(3) charge entered does not reflect a true acknowledgement on the part of the appellant of his guilt of the specially aggravated offence. That conviction must be set aside. This Court has no power to substitute a conviction for the lesser offence. The matter must be remitted to the District Court.

7The convictions on the remaining two counts do not suffer from the same defect, but, the Crown accepts, correctly, are tainted by the error that infected the principal conviction. Those convictions, too, must be set aside and the charges remitted to the District Court for sentence in accordance with the agreement between the appellant and the Crown. 

8I propose the following orders:

(i) Grant leave to appeal;

(ii) Appeal against conviction on each count upheld;

(iii) Each conviction quashed;

(iv) Each count remitted to the District Court to be dealt with according to law.

9PRICE J: I agree with Simpson J.

10R A HULME J: I agree with Simpson J.

		21 August 2013",2013-08-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762031,Smith v R [2013] NSWCCA 182,"Judgment

1LATHAM J : The appeal against the conviction and sentence of Adam Benjamin Smith with respect to a charge of robbery with wounding was heard by this Court on 24 April 2013. The Court determined that the appeal against conviction ought be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered. Those orders were pronounced on that day. These are the reasons for that decision.

2The appellant was tried before Knox SC DCJ in November 2011 on a charge pursuant to s 96 of the Crimes Act 1900, alleging that he robbed and wounded a taxi driver on 1 October 1998. The appellant was not arrested and charged until 5 January 2011. The Crown case against him was circumstantial, but for alleged admissions made by the appellant in the presence of a neighbour, Ms Bohnert, and during a telephone conversation on 15 December 2010, and the evidence of an alleged co-offender (Williams).

3The grounds of appeal take issue with the admission into evidence of one of the alleged admissions (Ground 1 : the telephone intercept of 15 December 2010), the directions given by the trial judge in relation to that alleged admission (Ground 2) and the directions relating to the evidence of Williams (Ground 3). 

The Evidence at Trial

The Circumstances of the Robbery

4On 1 October 1998, Raymond McMahon, a taxi driver, accepted a request for a fare at the corner of Kaylaur Street in Princes Highway at Albion Park at about 9 pm. He arrived at that corner shortly thereafter and saw two males waiting for the taxi.

5Mr McMahon described the first male as having a fair complexion, blonde hair, about 6 foot tall, thin build and about 19 to 20 years of age. He was wearing a dark or navy baseball cap which appeared to be faded. He thought that he had a ponytail protruding from the back of the cap. His face was described as ""a pointy nose and thin jaw"" with quite sharp features. He was also wearing a pale or light blue or grey sloppy joe or a T-shirt, with grey trousers or jeans. He appeared to have an Australian accent and appeared to be sober. This man did most of the talking during the trip. 

6The other male had a darker complexion and was possibly part aboriginal. He had a stocky build between 5'6"" and 5'8"" tall. He appeared to be about 19 to 20 years old. He had dark short hair and a round face. He was dressed in a black T-shirt and black jeans. He was wearing runners which were dark with white highlights. He was sitting in the gutter when the taxi pulled up. The male with the blonde hair got into the front passenger seat while the dark man staggered as he got to his feet and entered the rear of the taxi. He was holding a bottle or something similar in his hand although Mr McMahon did not see him with it inside the taxi. The darker male sat behind the male passenger in the front. Mr McMahon said to the passenger in the back ""Are you going to be sick?"" to which he replied ""No I'm just a bit drunk.""

7The men asked to be taken to Shellharbour. When Mr McMahon asked for the address the male in the front said ""Near the Workers Club"". Mr McMahon drove along Princes Highway toward Shellharbour. During a conversation, the man in the back said something like ""I drive a truck and its non-air-conditioned, you sit in the comfort of an air-conditioned taxi all day."" The blonde male in the front seat said that he lived in Albion Park and that his name was ""Fife"". The blonde male said that he was related to a man with a trucking business but that he did not drive trucks. He said that he worked in a factory. Mr McMahon gave evidence that he was familiar with a trucking business in the name of ""Fife"" and that a man involved in such a business lived directly behind him, but he did not know him personally.

8During the discussion the male in the back seat moved over so that he was sitting directly behind Mr McMahon. The male then swung his right arm over Mr McMahon's right shoulder and hit Mr McMahon with his forearm across the bridge of his nose. The man's arm then slid down and Mr McMahon felt something sharp like the blade of a knife being held across his throat. At this point Mr McMahon had stopped the taxi and activated the alarm under the brake pedal. 

9The man in the front seat said ""Get out and leave the keys and the money"" to which Mr McMahon replied ""I can't, your mate's got a hold of me"". At that time the male in the front seat produced a knife and said ""I'm not joking"". The male in the back seat let go of Mr McMahon. Mr McMahon turned the engine off and took the keys out. The blonde man in the front seat then lunged at him with a knife. The knife struck Mr McMahon on the left side of the chest just under and to the left of his nipple. The male pulled the knife back and lunged at Mr McMahon again, this time stabbing him in the left upper arm. The man kept screaming ""I'm not joking, I'm not joking.""

10Mr McMahon got out of the taxi with the keys and started to run back towards Pioneer Drive. He was chased by the male from the back seat. Mr McMahon eventually threw the keys at him. The male picked the keys up from the ground, and ran back to the taxi, while Mr McMahon managed to flag down a car driven by a woman with a male passenger. As Mr McMahon was speaking to the woman, the two males in the taxi did a U-turn and drove back towards him. The car swerved at Mr McMahon causing him to flatten himself up against the side of the woman's vehicle. Mr McMahon said the car missed him by about eight inches and that it appeared to swerve intentionally towards him.

11Mr McMahon was taken to Shellharbour Hospital where he was treated for the knife wounds. The blade of the knife was still embedded in his left upper arm. The taxi was later found in a partly burnt out condition.

12On 14 October 1998 Mr McMahon was shown two sets of photographs each containing 22 pictures of males, none of which included the appellant or Williams. Mr McMahon said that he knew a few of the people in the photographs by sight. He told police that one of the photographs (number 12) was the face of the guy wearing the hat who stabbed him in the taxi. That was a photo of a Timothy Barlow, who was arrested and charged within hours of the offence, on the basis that he and another male (Brian Nasen) fitted the description provided to police by Mr McMahon. 

13In May 1999, the proceedings against Timothy Barlow were terminated. He died of a heroin overdose on 29 April 2006.

The Re-Opening of the Investigation

14On 7 August 2009, Mr McMahon's son, Constable McMahon, was called to a dispute at the Albion Park Hotel, concerning a male who was yelling and swearing in the courtesy bus. That male identified himself to Const McMahon as Warrick Williams. He told Const McMahon that he knew who he was, that he was sorry about what happened to Const McMahon's father in the taxi, and that the appellant was the man in the front seat who had stabbed his father. Among other things, Williams said that they were going to ""Shelly's"" that night and that Williams did not think that they were going to rob the driver, take the taxi, or ""burn it out"". 

15Williams agreed to speak to the police, but said that he wanted ""it on paper"" that he would not go to gaol. On 17 September 2009, Const McMahon spoke to the then Officer in Charge of the investigation.

16On 20 April 2010, Mr McMahon was shown further photographs, including a photograph of the appellant taken in the late 1990s, and a photograph of the alleged co-offender, Williams. However, Mr McMahon was unable to make any positive identification.

The Appellant's Alibi

17The appellant was employed in a business called ""Clymax Glass"" from 16 August 1996 until 29 March 2000. The business was adjacent to ""Fyffe"" transport company, which shared a rear yard with Clymax Glass. 

18In late 1997 or early 1998, the appellant moved into a flat which was above the office of the business. The keys to all vehicles operated by the business were kept in the office which was locked at the end of each day. The appellant's employer was aware that the appellant had a friend by the name of Warwick who regularly visited the appellant from about the middle of 1998.

19On 5 October 1998, the appellant told his employer that he had taken a work vehicle for a joy ride in the evening of 1 October 1998 and had damaged the vehicle in the course of the drive. The appellant told his employer that he was influenced by alcohol at the time. The appellant appeared upset over the incident and was prepared to pay damages.

20As a result of this incident the appellant's employer decided that he could no longer live in the unit above the office. The appellant was required to sign a ""notice of serious misconduct"". That document was dated 5 October 1998 and became Exhibit 1 in the trial. It referred to the joyriding incident as having occurred on 1 October 1998.

21Mr Williams recalled an occasion when he went ""joyriding"" with the appellant in a vehicle the appellant took from his work. He said they returned the car in a damaged condition. However, Mr Williams also claimed that there were many occasions that such ""joyrides"" took place. He agreed that there could not have been a joyride on the night of the robbery.

Alleged Admission by the Appellant

22A neighbour of the appellant's mother, Ms Bohnert, became aware that police were reopening an investigation into the robbery of a taxi driver in the late 1990s through conversations with the appellant's mother. She was aware that the police wish to speak to the appellant. On one occasion when Ms Bohnert visited the house, the appellant was yelling things to his mother such as ""you might as well go and hand me in now and tell them I've done it"". He also said ""tell them that I am guilty and you might as well tell them where I am"". The appellant was yelling very loudly and everyone was telling him to settle down.

23On another occasion, Ms Bohnert heard the appellant say something like ""if I get dragged into this I will be saying that Warwick's dragging me in as a revenge between mates. We had a friendship and it broke up because my partner slept with Warwick and Warwick fathered a child to her"". Ms Bohnert sent a text message to the appellant telling him that she was going to go to the police. The appellant replied that she had been making false allegations towards him as a result of what she had read in the paper.

24These alleged conversations could only have occurred between October 2010 and January 2011. Ms Bohnert later had a falling out with the appellant's mother and with the appellant with respect to the appellant's acquisition of a motorcycle belonging to her boyfriend and the appellant's mother's non-payment of money owed to her.

25On about 3 March 2011, Ms Bohnert sent a number of text messages to the appellant's mothers phone, saying that she would ""destroy the lot of you"" if she did not receive the money owed to her and the return of the motorcycle. Ms Bohnert sent a further message to the appellant's mother saying ""you have till 5 pm today to have all the money here that you owe Kim or she is having you charged. The solicitor asked what kind of scum expect to not pay for their kids Christmas gifts. He is going to make a fool of you lot"". A further text message to the appellant's mother stated that the appellant's mother would not only end up with ""massive legal fees. I'm giving a statement to the detectives about taxi driver [sic] and the solicitor is fully aware of everything. I will destroy the lot of you."" Ms Bohnert first went to the police on 9 March 2011. 

The Evidence of the Co-Offender

26Mr Williams gave evidence of his friendship with the appellant and the circumstances of the robbery. At the time he gave evidence in the trial he was serving a sentence of four years and eight months, including a non-parole period of three years and five months for an aggravated robbery with wounding offence. When he was sentenced on 8 June 2011 he received a discount for his undertaking to give evidence against the appellant.

27Mr Williams had been at school with the appellant and they remained good friends throughout 1998. Mr Williams described the appellant in 1998 as taller than himself, with light-coloured hair which was shaved and he sometimes had a ""rats tail"".

28On the day of the robbery, Mr Williams finished work at 2:30 pm and went to the Oaks Hotel at Albion Park Rail where he began drinking. The appellant arrived at the hotel sometime after 5 pm. According to Mr Williams, the appellant asked if he wanted to get some drugs. Mr Williams replied that he could not afford it but the appellant said he knew a way to get some money. They discussed robbing a taxi driver, left the hotel, went to McDonald's and got something to eat. Mr Williams could not recall speaking to anyone at McDonald's. They went to a phone box down the road and called a taxi, which arrived about 45 minutes later.

29A former school associate of the appellant's and Warwick Williams saw Warwick Williams together with another person, whom he did not recognise at the time, on 1 October 1998 between 8 and 8:30 pm at Albion Park Rail. his person spoke to police on 2 October 1998 and told them that he recognised Warwick Williams and that, whilst he knew the other person, he could not put a name to the face. The following day he realised that that person was the appellant, after he had asked around and been told the appellant's name. He described the appellant in 1998 as having blonde short hair, of medium build and about 5'10"" tall. He agreed that the appellant was not wearing a baseball cap at the time. He described Mr Williams as half aboriginal, with a slightly stockier build.

30Mr Williams said that when the taxi arrived he had just finished being sick and that he was moderately intoxicated. Mr Williams got into the back of the taxi behind the driver and the appellant got into the front seat.

31Mr Williams gave evidence of a conversation in the taxi, although he could not recall the details. Mr Williams told the driver to go to Shellharbour Workers Club but before they got there, he placed the driver in headlock and told him to pull over. He said that he leant forward and put his right arm around the driver's neck so that his forearm was against his neck in a firm hold. Mr Williams said he did not have anything in his hand.

32When the driver pulled over, Mr Williams let go and the appellant said ""give us all your money"". The appellant stabbed the driver in a backhand motion, holding the knife so that the blade was coming from underneath the base of the wrist. Mr Williams saw the appellant stab the taxi driver about 4 or 5 times in the driver's shoulder. The driver said to take the money and tried to get out of the car. Mr Williams followed him to get the keys. The driver threw the keys at Mr Williams, who picked them up, got back into the taxi, started the engine and turned the car around in the direction from which they came.

33Mr Williams saw the driver flag down another car. Mr Williams said that he had to swerve to miss the driver because he was standing in the middle of the road. They drove back towards Albion Park Rail and dumped the taxi in a paddock. The appellant set fire to the taxi. According to Mr Williams, the appellant did not leave the taxi from the time he got into the front seat until the time he left the taxi at the paddock. After dumping the taxi, Mr Williams went home, packed some clothes and drove to his father's farm at Coonabarabran. He said that he saw the appellant a couple of weeks later and they discussed the robbery.

34Mr Williams later became aware that the taxi driver had a son who was a police officer. He spoke to Robert McMahon outside the Albion Park Hotel in about August 2009. He was unaware at that time that the case had been re-opened. 

35Mr Williams was arrested on 19 May 2010, although he knew that he was a person of interest prior to that date. He volunteered to give an interview to the police in March 2011. He was 100% certain that the man who was with him on the night was the appellant. The appellant was no longer a good friend of Mr Williams, owing to a falling out over a relationship that Mr Williams had with the appellant's former partner. He had had nothing to do with the appellant since August 2004 and they were hostile towards each other.

36There were various aspects of his evidence that were not included in his statement to police. He said that he had read ""bits and pieces"" of the brief. He denied that he was falsely implicating the appellant in the robbery in order to retain the benefit of his reduced sentence.

The Intercepted Conversations of 19 May and 15 December 2010

37Shortly after 2pm on 18 May 2010, during a call from the appellant's partner to the appellant, the appellant's partner informed him that she had received a call from the police, requesting that the appellant speak to them about a taxi and something that happened 12 years ago. The appellant said he didn't know ""what you're on about"". The transcript of this conversation was part of MFI 10. 

38The next morning, the appellant told another female during a phone conversation that he would have to ring the police, but ""they've got nothing"". The appellant said ""Why would I run, I've .. done nothing wrong"".

39On 20 May 2010, the appellant voluntarily attended the police station and agreed to be interviewed. He denied any part in the robbery. He knew that Williams had implicated him in the robbery but he said that he was being set up by Williams who was carrying out a vendetta against him. The appellant was not charged.

40On 15 December 2010, during a phone conversation between the appellant and a female (with whom the appellant was apparently discussing the prospect of leaving his then partner), the appellant said :-

As I said like you, you do know she, she's got a lot of shit over me, and I'm not, I'm not lying when I say that like even my mum says the same shit as you're saying but it's easier said than done when, and I do feel bad too because like, I, you know, I've loved her for years but end of the day if we don't get along 90% of the time, it's like it's hard living here, you know what I mean, it's hard having ... the shit hanging over me head where she can just ring me up and make me do 10 years gaol and she can, she's got the evidence, like she's got it all and I shouldn't even be saying this ... on the phone because probably bugged that's why I got this number cause the other phone's off and shit like that you know?

...........................................................................
Yeah, for other reasons or whatnot, but yeah, if they're listening, fuck off.

...............................................................................
It is hard for me cause I think fuck, what can, what can she do? But she can do a lot and I'm thinking, well .............


41The appellant was arrested and charged with the robbery on 5 January 2011.

The Grounds of Appeal

42The first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the conversation of 15 December 2010, because it was not relevant, there was a material error underlying its admission (namely, that the conversation was assumed to have been on 18 May 2010), the appellant's statements were ""intractably neutral"" and there was error in the assessment of the prejudicial effect of the evidence.

43The second ground of appeal assumes that the evidence was properly admitted. Given that I have concluded that ground one ought succeed, it is unnecessary to deal further with ground two. Similarly, there is no utility in addressing ground three.

44Returning to ground one, it is necessary to briefly refer to the evidence on the voir dire and to the trial judge's reasons for the admission of the evidence over objection. 

45At the beginning of the third day of the trial, in anticipation of all the telephone intercepts being played to the jury that day, the appellant's counsel indicated an objection to one of the intercepted conversations. It was identified to the trial judge by reference to a portion of a transcript that the Crown handed up to the trial judge. The appellant's counsel referred to a passage commencing with the final paragraph of p 14 of a 28 page document that became MFI 13 in the trial. That passage corresponds to what is set out at [40] above. Pages 14 and 15 of the document do not bear the date of the intercept. At no time during the discussion between the trial judge and counsel was the trial judge made aware that this transcript related to a conversation on 15 December 2010.

46The Crown indicated it proposed to rely, in particular, upon the italicised passage in the excerpt as consciousness of guilt evidence. The appellant's counsel submitted that the inference that the appellant was referring to the subject robbery as ""the shit hanging over [his] head ... [worth] 10 years gaol"" could not be logically drawn because there was nothing in the conversation that linked such illegality to an offence committed in 1998. On that basis, the appellant's counsel maintained that the evidence was not relevant, or if it was, of limited probative value.

47Furthermore, submitted the appellant, the reference to the appellant's phone probably being bugged ""for other reasons"" suggested the commission of another offence or offences by the appellant and thereby introduced a significant degree of prejudice that could not be cured by directions. It also necessarily weakened any inference that the appellant was referring to the 1998 robbery.

48The Crown argued that the relevant link between the ""shit hanging over [the appellant's] head"" and the 1998 robbery was the reference to the appellant's partner having ""a lot of shit over me"", in combination with the evidence of the phone call from the appellant's partner in the afternoon of 18 May, wherein the appellant's partner informed him that the police wished to speak to him about something that occurred 12 years ago.

49Putting to one side the lapse of seven months between these conversations, there was no evidence in the trial that the appellant's partner knew the details of what occurred 12 years ago, involving a taxi, much less that she knew the appellant played a role in an offence committed at that time. 

50The trial judge ruled in favour of the admission of the evidence and immediately gave reasons. At the commencement of that judgment, his Honour referred to the objection to ""an intercepted telephone conversation said to have taken place on 18 May 2010."" This was a material error, since his Honour appears to have been under the impression that there was a temporal nexus between the appellant's conversation with his partner on 18 May (MFI 10) and the conversation to which objection was taken. Given the Crown's reliance upon the combination of those two conversations to ground the inference of guilt, it is likely that his Honour attributed probative value to the conversation of 15 December that was unwarranted in the circumstances.

51Indeed, the trial judge ruled that the evidence had ""significant probative value"", taken together with ""other matters on which the Crown relies."" Those matters remained unspecified in the judgment.

52The appellant's submissions on this ground are compelling. When the terms of the conversation of 15 December are properly analysed, there is an insufficient basis upon which a tribunal of fact could conclude that the only possible offence potentially carrying 10 years gaol is the robbery committed in 1998. The appellant does not say anything that suggests criminality of that type, namely a robbery on a taxi driver, or of that age. To the contrary, the appellant suggests that the police have ""other reasons"" to intercept his conversations.

53I agree with the appellant that the danger of unfair prejudice was squarely raised by the suggestion that the appellant was engaged in activities that prompted the use of covert investigative techniques against him. The trial judge did not adequately deal with this issue. His Honour effectively dismissed the reference to reasons for the bugging of the appellant's phone as ""a relatively jocular .... comment"" and concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Had the real probative value of the evidence been appreciated, it could not have outweighed the risk that the jury would use the evidence in a manner that was unconnected to the issues in the trial. 

54Whilst his Honour gave the jury in the summing up a general direction on the drawing of inferences, the direction was not linked to the necessity of drawing the inference for which the Crown contended from the conversation of 15 December, before the conversation could be used by them towards proof of the Crown case. There was no direction in the summing up, or at the time the jury heard the relevant evidence, cautioning the jury against drawing such an inference merely on the basis that the conversation suggested the appellant was generally a person of bad character. The summing up did not refer to the terms of any of the intercepted telephone conversations or attempt to explain to the jury their contribution to proof of the Crown case.

55In my view, this is not an appropriate case in which to apply the proviso. There were obvious credibility problems with both the evidence of the alleged co-offender Williams and with the evidence of Ms Bohnert. Even assuming that the jury disregarded the animosity between the appellant's family and Ms Bohnert, the conversations that she overheard were equally capable of a construction inconsistent with guilt. The appellant's anger was directed at his mother's persistent comments about the ongoing police investigation. As his counsel at trial submitted to the jury, the appellant may well have been making sarcastic remarks to his mother well short of admitting any involvement in the offence. It was also true that Williams had a motive, other than the advantage of a discount on sentence, to falsely accuse the appellant.

56Against this evidence, there was independent evidence establishing that the appellant was joyriding in his employer's vehicle on the night of the offence. Whilst this evidence was not completely inconsistent with the commission of a robbery on the taxi driver after 9pm, it was inconsistent with the evidence of Williams. 

57Similarly, not only was there no identification of the appellant, but there was a positive identification by the victim of an altogether different assailant at a time more proximate to the offence.

58In summary, absent the treatment of the conversation of 15 December 2010 as an admission by the appellant, the evidence against the appellant was not so compelling that it would have inevitably resulted in the appellant's conviction. The appellant lost a real chance of an acquittal by the wrongful admission of the conversation of 15 December 2010.

		05 August 2013",2013-08-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762036,R v Elkassir [2013] NSWCCA 181,"Judgment
1EMMETT JA:  This Crown appeal relates to the sentence imposed on the respondent following a plea of guilty to a charge of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death.  The respondent was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for three years, with a non-parole period of 12 months.  I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the proposed reasons of R A Hulme J, in which his Honour concludes that, notwithstanding the manifest inadequacy of the non-parole period, the Crown appeal should be dismissed.  
2On the evening in question, the respondent and three friends were at a poker tournament at a hotel in Condell Park.  The respondent and one of his friends left in the respondent's car.  The other two left in a second car.  Shortly after leaving the hotel car park, the two cars drew together.  The respondent attempted to incite the driver of the other car to a race.  The other driver declined.  The respondent then followed the other car for a short distance until just before the crest of a hill.  As he approached the crest of the hill, the respondent passed the other car, at a speed of around 110 or 115km per hour, in a zone where the limit was 60km per hour.  As the respondent's car reached the crest of the hill, he lost control and his car went onto the near side footpath and collided with a bus shelter and a wooden utility pole.  As a result of the impact, the respondent sustained quite severe injuries and his passenger suffered fatal injuries.
3In assessing moral culpability on the part of the respondent, the sentencing judge took into account the fact that there was an element of competitive driving or showing off in the respondent's conduct that led to the fatal collision.  The respondent accepted that, at the time of the collision, he was driving at a speed that was more than 50km per hour in excess of the applicable speed limit.  That, of course, is the basis upon which he was charged with aggravated dangerous driving, because the car was being driven at a speed that exceeded the speed limit by more than 45km per hour.
4The sentencing judge said, in considering the aggravating factors relevant to the respondent's moral culpability, that ""the manner of the offender's driving is more towards the latter end of the continuum, bearing in mind the length of the journey, the degree of speed involved and the element of competitive driving or showing off"".  However, the speed at which the respondent was driving at the relevant time was already an element of the offence with which he was charged.  To that extent, the sentencing judge's approach appears to involve double counting.  It may also be accepted that the length of the journey, which in this case was very short, was of little significance.  
5The other aggravating factor referred to by the sentencing judge was ""the element of competitive driving or showing off"".  R A Hulme J finds this also to be of little significance, like the length of the journey, and that it was based upon the respondent speeding away when his challenge to a race was turned down and so adds little to the speed aspect.    
6I consider that the conduct of the respondent, in following the other car and then overtaking it after his invitation to race was refused, was an aggravating factor distinct from the speed at which the respondent was driving and that it increased the moral culpability of the respondent.  Subject to that comment, I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J.  I agree with the order proposed by his Honour.
7R A HULME J:  The Crown has appealed pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of a sentence imposed upon Mohammed Elkassir (the respondent) in the District Court at Sydney on 14 December 2012.
8The respondent was sentenced by her Honour Judge Flannery for an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 12 months.  He was also disqualified from driving for a period of 2 years.  The sentence was specified to commence on the day of imposition.  Accordingly the respondent is to be released upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 13 December 2013.
9The charge was that the respondent drove a car at a speed dangerous to other persons when it was involved in an impact which caused the death of Mohammed Yatim.  The reason why the aggravated form of the offence was charged was that the car was being driven at a speed that exceeded the speed limit by more than 45km/h.  The offence is contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 14 years.
Facts
10There were agreed facts tendered before the learned sentencing judge.  They were to the following effect.
11On the evening of 13 April 2011 the respondent and the deceased were together at a poker tournament at a hotel at Condell Park.  They left the hotel at about 9pm and entered the respondent's car, a Honda coupe.  Two of their friends also left the hotel at the same time and entered a separate car, a Honda Accord sedan.
12Both cars were driven out of the hotel car park and travelled together a short distance before turning into Marion Street.  When negotiating a two-lane roundabout at the intersection of Marion Street the respondent's car drew along side the other car.  Through an open window the respondent attempted to verbally incite the driver of the other car into a ""street-race"" but this was declined.  After leaving the roundabout the respondent positioned his car behind the Honda Accord until just before the crest of a hill near Saltash Avenue.  Upon approaching that crest the respondent passed the Honda Accord in the number two lane at a speed estimated by a witness to be around 100km/h, the prevailing speed limit being 60km/h.
13As the respondent crested the hill he lost control and the car commenced to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction.  It then went onto the nearside footpath, collided with a bus shelter and then with a wooden utility pole.  The agreed facts described the car as being ""effectively wrapped ... around that pole"".
14As a result of the impact the respondent sustained what was said to be ""a moderate injury"" whilst Mr Yatim suffered a fatal injury.  (The respondent in fact sustained multiple injuries and they were more than ""moderate"" in severity.  I will provide some detail shortly.)
15A blood sample was taken from the respondent at hospital which was subsequently analysed for alcohol and drugs with a negative result.
16There was nothing about the environment that could have had any causal influence upon the collision.  The weather was fine; it was dark but there was ample street lighting; traffic conditions were light; and no pedestrians or animals had entered the roadway to cause the respondent to swerve or take evasive action.
17A forensic crash analysis determined that the respondent had been travelling at a speed between 110 km/h and 115 km/h at the time of losing control; so, 50 km/h to 55 km/h in excess of the speed limit.  It was also determined that the loss of control was initiated by the respondent lifting off the accelerator too harshly at a critical phase of his vehicle's cornering motion due to his inexperience in driving at high speeds.
18The respondent was interviewed by police on 9 June 2011.  He said that his only recollection of the evening was attending the hotel with his friends and then later waking up in hospital.
Subjective circumstances
19The judge's sentencing remarks included a summary of the evidence as to the respondent's personal circumstances.  No issue was taken on the appeal as to the accuracy of anything there described.  I draw from it the following.
20The respondent was 18 years of age at the time of the offence and 20 when he stood for sentence.  He lived with his parents and siblings in the Bankstown area.  He had a close and supportive relationship with his family.  He was brought up in a positive environment except for some disruption in his final year of high school when his parents experienced marital difficulties.  He missed some schooling and failed to complete his Higher School Certificate.  
21The respondent had been employed for about two years as a sales consultant in a business managed by his father.  The general manager of the business gave evidence. He knew the family well and had a lot of contact with the respondent in the previous two years in the work environment.  He said that he had noticed ""a big difference"" in the respondent since the accident.  Previously he was enthusiastic, industrious and worked long hours.  Subsequently he had difficulty even attending work as he was so weighed down with feelings of guilt because of his responsibility for causing the death of his best friend.
22The judge referred to the respondent having sustained serious injuries in the accident.  These comprised multiple rib fractures and fractures of the sternum, the lumbar vertebrae at L3, the lower end of both ulna and radius, the thoracic vertebrae at T5-6, T7-8 and T9-10.  There was also traumatic pneumothorax, capsule tears of the spleen and traumatic subcutaneous emphysema.  He spent ten days in hospital and underwent an open reduction of the fracture of the distal radius with internal fixation.  
23The respondent had become extremely depressed with ""a very difficult and prolonged grieving process with survivor guilt and thoughts of death or suicide"".  He attempted self-harm and had been hospitalised once.  He had trouble sleeping and concentrating.  He reported feelings of hopelessness and had lost interest in things.
24He had been seeing Dr John Roberts, psychiatrist, since November 2011.  Dr Roberts' initial view was that the respondent was suffering from grief compounded by post-traumatic stress disorder.  He prescribed medication but the respondent had been reluctant to take it.  Dr Roberts suggested that the respondent undergo an MRI and a cerebral perfusion study.  The results indicated a degree of intra cranial haemorrhage and scarring of the brain.  
25It was Dr Roberts' view that this damage contributed to the overall picture of a psychiatric condition characterised by considerable levels of depression, anxiety and guilt in relation to the accident and the death of his friend.  Dr Roberts believed that the respondent's failure to comply with the taking of medication was prompted by a desire by the respondent to ""self-punish"" as part of an overall response to guilt.  His ultimate diagnoses were ""Post-traumatic stress disorder, Cognitive disorder not otherwise specified and as [a] portion of the Post-traumatic stress disorder, Major depression"".  It was his view that with optimal treatment and the passage of time, a degree of remission would be anticipated but that the symptoms would never completely abate.  
26The judge also referred briefly to a psychological report written by Dr Wendy Roberts.  Dr Roberts conducted a number of tests and concluded that there was evidence of two areas of cognitive deficit together with some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and emotional disturbance.  It was her impression that the respondent was genuinely distressed about the death of his friend.  
27The judge also had a report of another psychologist, Ms Pamela Costantini.  Her conclusions were consistent with those set out in the other reports.  Ms Costantini was of the view that the respondent would benefit from psychological treatment in addition to psychiatric intervention.  
Some findings of the sentencing judge
28The judge observed that the respondent had no criminal history but also said that ""he does have a traffic record that does not particularly assist him"".  From the ages of 17 to 20 the respondent had incurred six traffic infringements, two of them for speeding, and he had experienced the suspension of his provisional driver's licence three times.  In my view the judge was somewhat generous in her regard to the traffic record but the Crown takes no issue with it.
29Her Honour referred to the respondent having pleaded guilty a number of months before the matter was to proceed to trial.  She assessed the utilitarian value of the plea as warranting a reduction of sentence of 20 per cent.  
30With reference to s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), her Honour found as mitigating features that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity (I observe that most s 52A offences are not); that the respondent did not have any record of previous convictions (her Honour added that this was less relevant in a case of this type); that he was a person of good character (with a similar observation as to reduced relevance); and that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation if he started to take the medication prescribed for him and follow recommended treatment plans.  Her Honour also found that the respondent was remorseful.  
31Her Honour said the following about the respondent's youth which is the subject of the first ground of appeal:
His youth is also obviously an extremely significant matter in this sentencing exercise.  It is accepted that in sentencing young offenders the emphasis should be on their rehabilitation and that general deterrence is not of the same significance it would be but for an offender's youth, although the emphasis on rehabilitation cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment or stand in the way of the need to protect society.
Assessment of sentence
32The judge observed that the maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment and that there was no doubt that this was ""a very serious offence"".  She also observed that the authorities had made clear that the real substance of the offence was not just the dangerous driving but its association with the taking of a human life.  She then remarked that it was necessary to identify the degree of moral culpability involved.
33Her Honour noted the Crown submission that the speed and an element of competitive driving or showing off, notwithstanding the absence of other aggravating factors listed in the guideline judgment in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 (""Whyte""), warranted a conclusion that the respondent's moral culpability was at a ""high degree"".  The Crown Prosecutor who appeared in the court below had referred to the ""element of competitive driving or showing off"" as arising from the reference in the agreed facts to the respondent having initially challenged his friends to indulge in a race and, when that was declined, having accelerated away at high speed.
34Before referring to her Honour's findings in relation to that submission it is worth setting out what was said by Spigelman CJ in Whyte:
[204] A frequently recurring case of an offence under s52A has the following characteristics. 
(i) Young offender.(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.(iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person. (iv) The victim is a stranger. (v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates. (vi) Genuine remorse. (vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.
...
[216] I had earlier set out [in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209] a list of aggravating factors which had been established in the authorities as follows: 
(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted.(ii) Number of people put at risk.(iii) Degree of speed.(iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse.(v) Erratic driving.(vi) Competitive driving or showing off.(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk.(viii) Ignoring of warnings.(ix) Escaping police pursuit.
[217] Further consideration of the authorities would cause me to amend this list by changing (v) to read ""erratic or aggressive driving"" and adding: 
(x) Degree of sleep deprivation. (xi) Failing to stop.
...
[229] The guideline for offences against s52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 
Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.
[230] In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate. 
[231] In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s52A, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment. 
[232] The guideline is, to reiterate, a ""guide"" or a ""check"". The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors required to be taken into account by s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
35Her Honour's conclusion based on Whyte was as follows:
Having regard to the list of aggravating factors set out in the guideline judgment of Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 said to be relevant to the moral culpability of the offender, I consider that the manner of the offender's driving is more towards the latter end of the continuum, bearing in mind the length of the journey, the degree of speed involved and the element of competitive driving or showing off that was present.
36Later in her sentencing remarks her Honour referred to a submission made on the respondent's behalf that the sentence should be of such a length that it could either be suspended or ordered to be served by way of intensive correction order.  It may be observed that the principal point of contention between the parties seems to have been whether the respondent should serve a full-time custodial sentence, or whether, notwithstanding imprisonment was called for, some alternative to full-time incarceration was appropriate.  After referring to some other matters, her Honour returned to Whyte and said:
In the guideline judgment in Whyte it was held that in typical cases a custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of culpability as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement.  
It also said in that case that where the offender's culpability is high, a full time head sentence of less than three years would generally not be appropriate.
That sentence contains a built-in discount for a guilty plea of limited utilitarian value.
For the aggravated version of the offence, which this one is, an appropriate increment is required.
The present case has some characteristics of the type of case recognised in Whyte as a typical case frequently recurring for an offence of this kind.  Those characteristics are that the offender is a young man of good character, with no prior criminal convictions, there was the death of a single person and there is genuine remorse.
What takes this out of the typical case is that the victim was a very close friend of the offender, there was a plea of guilty worth something more than limited utilitarian value and the offender suffered significant injuries in the collision.
I have found that on the continuum between momentary inattention or misjudgement at one end and an abandonment of responsibility or high moral culpability at the other end, the offender's driving is towards the higher end of the continuum.
That finding requires that I impose a sentence of longer than two years custody and so I am unable to deal with the matter by way of a suspended sentence or an Intensive Correction Order.
37Finally her Honour found that there were special circumstances justifying the imposition of a non-parole period that was less than the usual three quarters of the total term of the sentence.  These were, ""hardship of the offender's custody because of his psychiatric state, the fact that it is his first time in custody and by reason of his need for an extended period of parole supervision"".
Grounds of appeal
38The Crown relied upon the following grounds:
Ground 1:  Her Honour erred in the manner in which she dealt with the issues of the respondent's youth and general and specific deterrence.
Ground 2:  Her Honour erred in the variation made to the statutory ratio as a result of the finding of special circumstances.
Ground 3:  The sentence is manifestly inadequate.
Ground 1 - error in respect of youth and deterrence
39It was submitted for the Crown that aside from the mention of general deterrence in the extract from the sentencing remarks set out earlier (at [31]), her Honour did not mention the significance of general and specific deterrence for this type of offence.  It was also submitted that her Honour's approach to the respondent's youth was contrary to established principles of sentencing for this offence.  It was contended that these errors affected the assessment of the total term as well as the non-parole period, but particularly the latter.
40Issue was taken by senior counsel for the respondent as to the correctness with which the ""principle"" the Crown was relying upon was expressed in the written submissions.  The Court need not concern itself with that debate.  Suffice it to say that there has been discussion about it in a number of decisions and a relatively recent example is to be found in the judgment of Johnson J, with whom Spigelman CJ and McClellan CJ at CL agreed, in SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; (2009) 198 A Crim R 219.  That was a case involving two counts of aggravated dangerous driving (exceeding the speed limit by more than 45 km/h) occasioning death committed by a 17-year-old man.
41Johnson J referred (at [147]-[150]) to Director of Public Prosecutions v Neethling [2009] VSCA 116; 52 MVR 422.  There, the Court (Maxwell P,  Vincent JA and Hargrave AJA) said (at [53]-[55]) that the long accepted general rule that rehabilitation should be the primary, if not the principal, concern in sentencing a young offender must sometimes give way to other sentencing considerations. The case at hand, one of dangerous driving causing death by an 18-year-old offender, was considered to be such a case.  Their Honours explained (at [55]):
It is precisely because of the tendency of young drivers to drive dangerously that general deterrence must be regarded as of great importance, and youth must be given relatively less weight.
42Johnson J adopted those observations (at [150]) and added (at [151]):
The fact that young men (in particular) may have such perceptions [of being ""bullet proof""] is a significant reason for general deterrence to be a prominent factor in cases such as these.
43Mr Game SC contended on a number of bases that the sentencing judge had given appropriate emphasis to general deterrence.  Her Honour was influenced by the guideline judgment of Whyte which included a ""young offender"" as one of the features of the ""frequently recurring case"".  The suggestion by Spigelman CJ that where there is a high level of culpability in such a case a custodial sentence of less than three years would not generally be appropriate by itself factored in the appropriate level of general deterrence.
44It was also contended for the respondent that there were reasons to ameliorate the need for both general and specific deterrence in this case.  The respondent had experienced a deep sense of guilt and grief and there were ""significant behavioural/psychiatric sequelae thereto"".  His self punishment reduced the need for specific deterrence and he was a less suitable vehicle for general deterrence: DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177].
45Finally, it was contended that the passage from the remarks on sentence to which the Crown had drawn attention did not support its proposition in any event.  Her Honour had referred to ""the primary purpose of punishment"" and the ""need to protect society"" not being deflected by an emphasis upon rehabilitation.  
46In my view the statement by her Honour which was quoted earlier (at [31]) is not, with respect, entirely clear.  Given the similarity of the wordage, it may be that her Honour was drawing from R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97].  That was a case involving serious sexual assaults in which it was held that the prominence usually given to the youth of an offender had to give way to principles of primary importance:  general deterrence and public denunciation.  R v AEM is part of a line of cases that stand for the proposition that the importance of the youth of an offender in the assessment of sentence diminishes where the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might by committing an offence that involves violence or is of considerable gravity: KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [25] per McClellan CJ at CL.  The importance of general deterrence in driving offences of the present type stems from different bases as I have noted above.  But the practical effect is the same: the need for rehabilitation of the offender is diminished by the need to protect society.
47It must be borne in mind that her Honour sentenced and announced her reasons ex tempore.  There are many statements to be found in judgments of this Court as to the care with which one must consider sentencing remarks delivered in this fashion, an example of which is R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189 at [29]-[33] per Beazley JA, Kirby and Johnson JJ.  It is pertinent to quote the pithy observation of Spigelman CJ in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [48] to which their Honours referred:
The conditions under which District Court judges give such reasons are not such as to permit their remarks to be parsed and analysed.
48I am not prepared to conclude that the sentencing judge misapplied any principle about the importance of general deterrence in dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm offences committed by young offenders as the Crown contends.  Whether sufficient emphasis was given to both general and specific deterrence, based upon both the objective and subjective facts of the case, is a matter that can be left for assessment under Ground 3.
49I would not uphold Ground 1.
Ground 2 - error in reduction of non-parole period
Ground 3 - manifest inadequacy
50These grounds are related and, as they were dealt with in the submissions together, it seems appropriate that I do likewise.
51The Crown accepted that it was open to her Honour to find that there were special circumstances for reducing the term of the non-parole period.  However, it was contended that the respondent's subjective case did not warrant a reduction to 33 per cent of the total term.  This, the Crown argued, suggested that her Honour had placed ""undue weight"" on the subjective case, including his youth. 
52In responding to the ""undue weight"" submission, Mr Game reminded the Court of the statement by Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [111]:
Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge.  The circumstances in which matters of 'weight' will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.
53Counsel for the Crown referred to statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales which indicate that where there has been a plea of guilty and the offender is aged 18-20 years, the shortest sentences imposed in the 7 years to September 2012 have been 3 years and the shortest non-parole periods have been 18 months.  There are only 8 cases in this database.  The Crown, correctly with respect, acknowledged that this was of ""limited usefulness"".  I find the statistics to be of very little assistance indeed.
54The Crown also placed some reliance on three cases in this Court: R v Ryan [2003] NSWCCA 202; R v Howcher [2004] NSWCCA 179 and Whyte itself.   The cases are few in number and are distinguishable in a variety of ways.  For example, Ryan was a case of considerably greater objective seriousness.  The offender in Howcher was on a bond, he was unlicensed and had never held a licence, and his driving on the occasion in question was not an isolated aberration.  Whyte involved sentencing for a different offence (s 52A(4)) with a different maximum penalty (11 years).
55In relation to the Whyte guideline, the Crown accepted, as the judge did, that there were a number of factors in this case that distinguished it from the ""frequently recurring case"" described by Spigelman CJ.  But it was submitted that the head sentence imposed was the minimum suggested in the guideline that was applicable to the basic offence in s 52A(1) and ""there is no apparent increment for the aggravated offence in respect of which the respondent was sentenced"".  That submission seems to assume that the distinguishing factors were of no significance.  In my view they were.
56Mr Game made reference to the various favourable aspects of the respondent's subjective case which he described as ""very strong"".  It was submitted that aside from those matters, the psychiatric evidence indicated that the respondent was suffering a form of punishment and would do so ""over a substantial and potentially indefinite continuum"".  This was said to be significant as well in ""how time in custody is likely to be served, particularly with an offender ... who has a desire to 'self punish'"".
57Counsel for the respondent also sought to align the circumstances of self-punishment in this case to that in R v Dhanhoa [2000] NSWCCA 257, a case said to involve similar culpability but also a psychiatric condition and self-punishment.  It was submitted that the approach taken there should be adopted here. 
Consideration
58The starting point for determination of ground 2 is to have regard to the common law principles that guide the setting of a non-parole period.  They have been identified by the High Court of Australia, principally in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623, Deakin v The Queen (1984) 58 ALJR 367, and Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525.  After reference to Power and Bugmy, Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [65] described the setting of a non-parole period as involving a:
need to ensure that the time an offender must spend in prison reflects all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender - including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence. (Emphasis added)
59Alongside those principles is the statutory constraint provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of there needing to be ""special circumstances"" for setting the non-parole period at a level, in effect, at less than three quarters of the total term of the sentence.  The correct approach to dealing with that constraint was authoritatively set out in the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson and later in R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172. 
60The written submissions for the respondent included reference to the statement of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [57] that ""the non-parole period is imposed because justice requires that the offender serve that period in custody"".  On its own, the precise meaning of that statement is not readily apparent.  It does become apparent, however, when regard is had to the fact that the Court cited as authority for it both Power and Bugmy.  I do not understand what was said in Muldrock as in any way qualifying the expression of the principle by Spigelman CJ quoted above.
61Before dealing with the adequacy of the non-parole period I will state my conclusions as to the submissions that concerned both it and the total term of the sentence.
62As to Mr Game's reliance upon R v Dhanhoa, supra, I readily accept that the respondent's self punishment was ""remarkably similar"" to the offender in that case.  But the written submissions went on (at [61]) to assert that ""the culpability of the respondent in this case was comparable to that in Dhanhoa"".  The offender in Dhanhoa committed an offence against s 52A(1) for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.  The respondent in the present case committed an offence against s 52A(2) with the higher maximum penalty earlier noted.  Their respective culpabilities for their offences cannot be equated.
63R v Dhanhoa was a case involving an offender who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and ongoing depression following the commission of an offence of dangerous driving occasioning death.  The sentencing judge accepted a counsellor's statement that ""he has been enduring punishment for this incident for the last two and a half years"".  It was contended by the Crown in an appeal against the asserted inadequacy of the sentence that ""undue weight"" had been given to this aspect of the case.  The Court was divided as to the result (Priestley JA and Foster AJA favoured dismissal of the appeal with Sperling J dissenting).  There was no disagreement, however, as to the relevance to sentence of the effect upon the offender of the death of the victim. In R v Koosmen [2004] NSWCCA 359, Smart AJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Hislop J agreed, said (at [32]):
Dhanhoa is authority for the proposition that the effect of the death in the accident on the offender and self punishment (the self inflicted sense of shame and guilt) were often highly relevant factors, that the weight to be given to these depended on the circumstances and that different judges may give different weight to those factors.  Where the facts reveal gross moral culpability judges should be wary of attaching too much weight to considerations of self punishment.  Genuine remorse and self punishment do not compensate for or balance out gross moral culpability.
64It was not contended by the Crown that the sentencing judge was not entitled to have regard to the significant and enduring deleterious effect the consequences of the respondent's offence had had upon him.  The complaint was confined to the judge having placed ""disproportionate"" or ""undue"" weight upon the respondent's subjective case in determining the overall sentence and the non-parole period.
65Whether the overall sentence is manifestly inadequate can be assessed by reference to the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament and to the guideline in Whyte.  
66The learned judge found that the case has some of the characteristics of the typical case identified in Whyte:  young offender, of good character, with no prior convictions, death to a single person and genuine remorse.  But distinguishing aspects were that there was the death of the respondent's close friend rather than a stranger, the significant injuries sustained by the respondent, and the plea of guilty having more than limited utilitarian value.  Although the judge did not say so, these factors would militate in favour of a more benign approach to sentencing.
67The judge assessed the respondent's moral culpability as being ""towards the higher end of the continuum"".  I take that to mean that while she did not think his moral culpability was high, it was not far below that level.  The Crown did not challenge that assessment and neither did the respondent in written submissions.  However, upon the hearing of the appeal Mr Game submitted that the judge's approach had contained an element of double counting.
68To put that submission in context it is worth reiterating that the assessment of moral culpability by the judge involved taking into account three findings.  Two of them were ""the length of the journey"" and ""the element of competitive driving or showing off"".  Those two matters, to my mind, were of marginal significance.  The length of the journey was only about a kilometre to the scene of the collision.  How far the intended journey was going to be is not apparent. Competitive driving or showing off was based upon him speeding away when his challenge to a race was turned down.  It adds little to the speed aspect.
69The most significant aspect underpinning the finding as to moral culpability was clearly the degree of speed.  The respondent accepted that it was between 50 and 55 km/h in excess of the applicable speed limit.  But that is the reason why the offence was charged in its aggravated form and exposed the respondent to the higher maximum penalty. The degree of speed was above the threshold to render the respondent liable to the aggravated form of the offence, but not substantially so. 
70The judge noted the rider to the guideline for the typical case described in Whyte where moral culpability is high (""less than three years ... would not generally be appropriate"") that:
In the aggravated version of each offence under s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required.
71The judge did not say anything to suggest that she regarded what was said in Whyte as being in any sense binding or prescriptive.  She appears to have applied it in precisely the way Spigelman CJ intended, at [232]:
The guideline is, to reiterate, a ""guide"" or a ""check"".  The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion ...
72Nevertheless, it appears to me that having taken into account the degree of speed in the assessment of the respondent's moral culpability, her Honour also factored in an additional ""increment"" that, in effect, took into account the same thing.
73The starting point before reduction by 20 per cent for the respondent's plea of guilty must have been 3 years 9 months.  That is significantly more than the minimum 3 year sentence indicated in the Whyte guideline for the basic offence against s 52A(1) for a case involving a plea of limited utilitarian value.  Further, the present case had other features distinguishing it from the ""typical case"" that were favourable to the respondent.  Then there was the additional element of self punishment.   74It may be expected that most offenders in relation to s 52A offences would experience significant remorse.  In Duncan v R [2012] NSWCCA 78 at [25], a bad case of motor manslaughter and dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, Basten JA said that the absence of such a response might indicate the person would have ""such gross insensitivity as to be, in effect, mentally unhinged"".  But the response in the present case went considerably beyond remorse and extended to the respondent having an enduring psychiatric condition.
75The sentence of 3 years was lenient and I would characterise it as at the bottom of the range legitimately open to be imposed in the exercise of her Honour's discretion.  It was not, in my view, manifestly inadequate. 
76I am persuaded, however, that the non-parole period of 12 months was manifestly inadequate.  Even with regard to the deleterious psychiatric and psychological consequences the respondent had encountered, 12 months fails to adequately reflect the objective gravity of the offence, particularly that it involved the unlawful taking of a human life as a consequence of the highly irresponsible and reprehensible conduct of driving a motor vehicle at almost twice the speed limit in a suburban street.
Whether the Court should intervene and re-sentence
77The Court has a residual discretion as to intervention.  The majority observed in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [1]:
The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (Crown appeals) under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is to ""lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"". ... The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient.  That discretion is sometimes called the ""residual discretion"". 
78Their Honours later (at [36]) described this primary purpose of laying down principles as ""a limiting purpose"" and said:
It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges.  It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.
79The prospective creation of disparity with an unchallenged sentence imposed on a co-offender was said to be one reason for the exercise of the residual discretion.  Other reasons were also identified (at [43]):
Other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed.  They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation.  They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion.  The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.
80There is a particularly compelling reason why the discretion to decline to intervene should be exercised in this case and it concerns the concluding words in the above quote, ""justice to the individual"".  An affidavit by the respondent's solicitor was read at the hearing of the appeal.  To that affidavit was annexed a report by Ms Ann-Marie De Santa Brigida, psychologist.  Ms De Santa Brigida was provided with a body of material which included the reports that were before the sentencing judge.  She assessed the respondent on three occasions in May 2013 over a period of five hours.  A number of psychometric tests were administered.
81The respondent claimed to Ms De Santa Brigida that he was unable to access medication (Amoxil) in custody. The Crown took issue with this and, pursuant to leave granted at the hearing, subsequently provided evidence in the form of an email from the Director of Clinical and Corporate Governance at Justice Health to the effect that the respondent had been administered his medication since he came into custody.
82But the more significant aspect of Ms De Santa Brigida's initial report was not the subject of any contradiction.  The respondent's mental condition has deteriorated since he was sentenced. Testing revealed that there had been an increase in the levels of depression, anxiety and stress to the point where they are each described as being ""extremely severe"". 
83It is to be recalled that in the report by Dr John Roberts it was indicated that ""with optimal treatment and the passage of time"" there would be remission of the respondent's symptoms but not completely.  The additional material now available indicates not just that this anticipated remission has not yet occurred; but that the severity of symptoms has worsened.
84I should record that a further report by Ms De Santa Brigida was provided on behalf of the respondent in response to the material filed by the Crown after the hearing.  It contests aspects about the respondent receiving his medication and raises issues beyond the scope of the leave that was granted to file further material.  It is unnecessary to refer to the detail as none of it conflicts with what I have said in the immediately preceding paragraphs.
85My conclusion is that, notwithstanding the manifest inadequacy of the non-parole period, doing justice in this particular case requires that the Crown appeal be dismissed.
Order
86I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
87R S HULME AJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and with his Honour's reasons.

2762045,Tuvunivono v R [2013] NSWCCA 176,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: The applicant sought leave to appeal with respect to sentences imposed upon him for 10 offences of armed robbery or attempted armed robbery to which he had pleaded guilty. Fourteen further offences, including 11 of armed robbery and one attempted armed robbery, were included on a Form 1, to be taken into account in sentencing for the first count.

2The background circumstances, the sentences and the grounds of appeal are all fully set out in the judgment of Price J and need not be repeated. I agree with Price J that there should be a grant of leave to appeal in respect of each sentence and agree, with one exception, with his reasons for rejecting each ground.

3The exception is ground 3. That ground asserted that the individual sentences were manifestly excessive, the primary focus being upon the fact that on each sentence (other than for count 1) the trial judge had imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of four years (for each of counts 7, 8 and 10), four years and six months (for each of counts 4, 5, 6 and 9) and five years (on counts 2 and 3). On count 1 the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years and four months, with an additional term of four years.

4There was a degree of accumulation in respect of each sentence. Thus, the second and third four year terms were each accumulated by one month on the previous term; the four year and six month terms were each accumulated by two months on the previous sentence; the five year terms were each accumulated by three months on the previous sentence and the final sentence on count 1 was accumulated by four months on the previous sentence. In the result, the final sentence commenced one year and eight months after the commencement of the first sentence imposed. The final sentence having a non-parole period of six years and four months, the total period of mandatory custody was eight years. The balance of parole on the final sentence was four years, giving a total sentence of 12 years imprisonment. As argued, ground 3 was primarily directed to the length and accumulation of the fixed term sentences.

5The judgement on sentence referred explicitly to the guidelines for sentencing for offences of armed robbery having certain common characteristics in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. In that case, Spigelman CJ (with the concurrence of Wood CJ at CL, Newman and Simpson JJ) held that ""sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term"": at [165]. After dealing with other authorities and the need for a degree of accumulation, the trial judge stated (judgment, p 24):

""Each of the robberies, as well as the attempted robberies, come within the Henry factors in terms of that guideline judgment. Each would warrant the imposition of a sentence of the range suggested in that decision.""

6It is not possible to read that statement as referring to some of the offences, but not others: such an approach would require identification of which offences the trial judge was referring to, but no basis for such an exercise is revealed by the reasons.

7It does not follow that the sentence on each offence was to fall within the range suggested in Henry; given the significant number of serious offences contained in the Form 1, it was inevitable that a greater sentence would be imposed in respect of count 1. Nevertheless, the offence in count 1 was clearly one of the offences which, taken in isolation, was held to fall within the Henry guidelines.

8Further support for that conclusion derives from the fact that each of the nine fixed terms fell within the range identified in Henry, namely four years to five years. The error, if there were one, lay in equating a fixed term with a full term of imprisonment. 

9The trial judge was not imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Procedure Act""). Nor was he sentencing for offences carrying a standard non-parole period. Accordingly, it was open to him to decline to set a non-parole period: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 45(1). In a case involving the imposition of numerous sentences with elements of accumulation, that course is entirely appropriate. Nevertheless, subject to any question of totality, it is necessary to impose sentences which are appropriate to each offence: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. It is also a fundamental principle of sentencing that the non-parole period is the minimum period of imprisonment which the offender must serve for the specific offence: Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 628. Because there is no power to release a prisoner during a fixed term, the fixed term should also be understood to be the minimum period which the sentencing judge deems appropriate in the circumstances of the specific offence. Finally, it is necessary that any period of accumulation be fixed by reference to the non-parole period of the sentence or the term of the sentence where there is no non-parole period: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 55(2) and (4).

10As explained in Lipchin v R [2013] NSWCCA 77 by Hidden J (Bathurst CJ and Button J agreeing) a fixed term sentence is usually to be equated with a non-parole period: at [16]; Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [56] (R A Hulme J); R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346 at [161] (Handley JA, James and Howie JJ). Once it is understood that an appropriate sentence must be imposed for each offence, it is clear that the fixed term must equate with an appropriate minimum period of imprisonment. Were it otherwise, and each of the other convictions were set aside on appeal, the offender would serve in custody more than the minimum term appropriate to that offence.

11In the present case, the sentencing judge had expressly (and correctly) identified the range for sentencing to be that prescribed by Henry. He imposed sentences within that range: they were, in accordance with the language of Henry, to be treated as full terms of imprisonment. If they were to be treated as equivalent to non-parole periods, the full terms (absent special circumstances, which were not found) would have ranged from five years four months to six years eight months, being a range commencing just beyond the Henry range, but extending well beyond it. It is improbable that the trial judge intended such sentences, absent any indication that he was sentencing within such a range. 

12It follows that each of the sentences imposed on counts 2-10 was manifestly excessive and the applicant should be resentenced accordingly. For each sentence of four years imprisonment, a non-parole period of three years would have been appropriate and a fixed term should be imposed of that duration. In respect of each sentence of four years six months, an appropriate non-parole period is three years four months and a fixed term of that duration should be imposed. In respect of the sentences of five years imprisonment, the appropriate fixed term is three years and nine months.

13There remains a question as to whether the periods of accumulation should be varied. The difficulty facing the applicant is that each period of accumulation was a very small proportion of the sentence imposed. Even in respect of the five year sentence imposed on count 2, the period of accumulation with respect to count 1 was only four months, or less than 7% of the fixed term. After reduction of the relevant fixed term, it is still less than 9%. The percentages in respect of other sentences are even smaller. Further, looked at in absolute terms, notionally increasing the period of mandatory custody by four months for an armed robbery carrying a full term of five years is not by any means excessive. Nor is the period of one year and eight months imprisonment referable to nine separate offences of armed robbery or attempted armed robbery manifestly excessive, taking into account the principle of totality.

14Accordingly, although it is appropriate to resentence the applicant to appropriate fixed terms of imprisonment, the overall result does not reduce the eight year period which he must serve in custody before becoming eligible for parole.

15There should be a grant of leave to appeal, the appeal should be upheld with respect to counts 2-10 and the applicant should be resentenced as indicated. However, as this is a minority view, there is no need to set out the precise terms of the proposed sentences. Each, in any event, commences on the date fixed for that offence by the trial judge.

16PRICE J: Maxwell Tuvunivono (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by Knox DCJ (the judge) in the District Court at Sydney on 8 April 2010. He also seeks leave to appeal out of time. 

17The applicant pleaded guilty before the judge to seven counts on an indictment being counts 1 to 6 and count 9. Counts 1, 3 to 6 were offences of robbery, armed with an offensive weapon (armed robbery) whereas count 2 was an offence of attempted armed robbery. 

18Pleas of guilty had earlier been entered in the Local Court by the applicant to counts 7, 8 and 10 on the indictment. Counts 7 and 8 were offences of armed robbery and count 10 was an offence of attempted armed robbery. The offensive weapon in each count, with the exception of count 9, was a knife. 

19All of the offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty were contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900 (and s 344A(1) in the case of an attempt) and are punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 

20The applicant asked the judge to take into account on sentence 14 offences that had been included on a Form 1. Eleven of these were offences of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act and one an attempted armed robbery. There was also on the Form 1 an offence of stealing, contrary to s 94 Crimes Act and an offence of providing false information contrary to s 24 Pawnbroker and Second-hand Dealers Act 1996. 

21The offences on the Form 1 were taken into account by the judge in the sentence imposed for count 1. 

22During his sentencing remarks, the judge stated that because of the relatively complicated sentencing exercise, it was appropriate to categorise the offences into four different categories in descending order. His Honour said (ROS at 24-25):

Category D offences, for which there was a plea and to which there is a twenty percent discount to be applied includes counts 10, 8 and 7. The appropriate period of accumulation for these offences is one month's imprisonment. 

Category C offences, for which there was a plea at a later date, include counts 9, 6, 5 and 4. A ten percent discount is applicable to these offences and the appropriate period of accumulation is two months. 

Category B offences refer to the offences committed while the offender was on parole and to which there was a later plea, namely counts 3 and 2. A ten per cent discount is appropriate to these offences and the appropriate period of accumulation is three months. 
...
Count 1 is a unique count constituting the Category A offence. The offender was on parole when this offence was committed and there was a late plea in relation to this count. There are also the Form 1 matters to be attached to this count. A period of four months' accumulation is appropriate on this count. 

23The division of the offences into four categories by his Honour indicated the percentage of the discount for a plea of guilty and the extent of accumulation for an offence for which the applicant was to be sentenced. 

24The judge sentenced the applicant as follows: 

Category D offences 

Count 10: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 20 March 2008 and expiring on 19 March 2012;

Count 8: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 20 April 2008 and expiring on 19 April 2012;

Count 7: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 20 May 2008 and expiring on 19 May 2012;



Category C offences 

Count 9: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 20 July 2008 and expiring on19 January 2013;

Count 6: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 20 September 2008 and expiring on 19 March 2013;

Count 5: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 20 November 2008 and expiring on 19 May 2013;

Count 4: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 20 January 2009 and expiring on 19 July 2013;

Category B offences 

Count 3: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing on 20 April 2009 and expiring on 19 April 2014;

Count 2: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing on 20 July 2009 and expiring on 19 July 2014;

Category A offence 
(Including offences on Form 1).

Count 1: Sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years and 4 months commencing on 20 November 2009, with an additional term of 4 years to date from 19 March 2016 and to expire on 18 March 2020.

25The total effective sentence imposed by the judge was 12 years imprisonment comprising of a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 20 March 2008 and expiring on 19 March 2016 with a balance of term of 4 years commencing on 19 March 2016 and expiring on 18 March 2020.

The application for an extension of time 

26The applicant was sentenced on 8 April 2010. On 2 August 2010, he filed a notice of intention to appeal. On 5 August 2010, the court received a request for an extension of time, which was granted by the registrar for six months and expired on 2 February 2011. 

27An application for extension of time for notice of intention to appeal was received by the court on 26 July 2012. The registrar refused the application as the time to appeal had expired some 18 months previously. 

28The Crown opposes the extension of time being granted. The Crown says that the delay of 18 months is significant and has not been adequately explained. 

29The only explanation for the delay is provided by the applicant's affidavit. According to the applicant, he received a letter about the appeal from whom he thought was Legal Aid NSW some time after the extension of time was granted. He understood that they were agreeing to represent him. 

30The applicant was transferred to the mid North Coast Correctional Centre in about February 2011. He attempted to contact Legal Aid through the Welfare Officer and with her assistance made some telephone calls about his appeal. The applicant stated that he was unable to speak to a solicitor despite leaving messages that he would call back at a certain time. The Welfare officer went on leave for 8 months but resumed helping him in July 2012. He received some correspondence from Legal Aid NSW that they would consider his application in September 2012. By a letter dated 13 March 2013 the applicant was advised that he was granted legal aid for his appeal against sentence. 

31I am satisfied that the applicant always intended to appeal his sentence but had difficulties contacting Legal Aid as he was in custody. The appeal raises matters of substance and the applicant faces a lengthy term of imprisonment for serious offences. 

32In these circumstances, I conclude that the extension of time should be granted and it is appropriate for this court to consider the appeal on its merits. 

The Grounds of Appeal 

33The notice of appeal identifies three grounds: 

1. The learned sentencing judge erred not allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the guilty pleas for counts 7, 8 and 10 (ie the Category D offences).

2. The learned sentencing judge erred in that seeking to achieve an overall two-thirds ratio between the total non-parole period and the total 'head' sentence, his Honour erroneously extended the additional term of count 1 rather than reducing the non-parole period for that count. 

3. The individual sentences imposed were otherwise manifestly excessive. 

Facts 

34A statement of agreed facts consisting of ten pages was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. I shall set out the facts as succinctly as possible. 

Count 1: On 24 January 2008 at Brighton Le Sands, the applicant whilst armed with a knife robbed a clothing store of $650 in cash. He pointed the knife at the sales assistant and threatened to hurt her if she did not hand over the money. 

Count 2: On 1 February 2008 at Surry Hills, the applicant whilst armed with a knife attempted to rob a laundry. He moved the knife towards the laundry assistant a number of times and unsuccessfully rummaged around drawers in the laundrette. 

Count 3: On 3 February 2008 at Ramsgate, the applicant whilst armed with a knife robbed a chemist's shop of $440. The applicant had shown the sales assistant the knife and said, ""I don't want to hurt you lady.""

Count 4: On15 February 2008 at Gymea, the applicant whilst armed with a knife robbed a video store of $1,000. The applicant had shown the sales assistant the knife and said, ""I'm serious, I'll stab you! Don't be a hero."" 

Count 5: On 20 February 2008 at Penshurst, the applicant whilst armed with a knife robbed a video store of about $550. The applicant had shown the knife to the sales assistant and said: ""Take it easy just give me the money."" 

Count 6: On 25 February 2008 at Enmore, the applicant whilst armed with a knife robbed a video store of $150. The applicant had pointed the knife at a sales assistant and threatened to stab him in the stomach.

Count 7: On 29 February 2008, the applicant whilst armed with a knife robbed a Newtown video store of approximately $400. During the robbery, the applicant hit the sales assistant who suffered a 4 - 5 centimetre cut to his right forearm and a half a centimetre cut to his left hand. He had shown the knife to the sales assistant and had threatened to kill him if he did not hurry up handing over the money. 

Count 8: On 10 March 2008, the applicant whilst armed with a knife robbed a Darlinghurst hotel of about $1,400. The applicant had placed something sharp into the bar assistant's lower back, saying, ""I don't want to hurt you, just give me the money."" The bar assistant saw that the applicant had a black flick knife in his right hand. 

Count 9: On 11 March 2008, the applicant robbed a hotel in Annandale of $4,000 whilst armed with an offensive weapon. The applicant appeared to be holding something in his fist which was covered by his jacket. The applicant said to the bar attendant ""I don't want to hurt you, just give me all your money."" He also told the bar attendant to lie on the floor. 

Count 10: On 20 March 2008, the applicant whilst armed with a knife attempted to rob the Caringbah Inn Hotel. The applicant pushed the knife into the pokie attendant's right side near her hip and told her to open the drawers and give him the money. The applicant opened a drawer inside the booth but there was nothing inside. The pokie attendant ran to another part of the hotel. The applicant was apprehended inside the hotel by staff and patrons. 

35Form 1: Matters 1 to 2 and 4 to 12 on the Form 1 are offences of armed robbery from Sydney stores, the applicant being armed with a knife. Matter 3 is an offence of attempted armed robbery. The offences occurred between 24 January 2008 and 2 March 2008. The amounts of cash that were stolen varied between $250 and $1,500. 

36In referring to the statement of agreed facts, the judge said (ROS at 6): 

""The [applicant] was engaged in a series of armed robberies and attempted robberies over a period of three months, being...January to March ...2008. Usually a knife or other offensive instrument was used to threaten the respective victims. Those robbed were in isolated circumstances. Relatively little money was obtained from each of the robberies."" 



Personal Circumstances 

37During the proceedings on sentence, Elizabeth Tuvunivono, the applicant's sister, gave evidence. A report from Dr Emma Collins, a psychologist was tendered as were letters from the applicant's mother, his girlfriend and Nathan Jones who was employed by the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health. A drug and alcohol report was also before the judge. 

38The judge noted that the applicant's sister ""confirmed the atmosphere of family violence within which the offender was brought up; his effective abandonment by both his parents at a young age and the fact that he was effectively forced to live on the streets from about the age of twelve or thirteen"" (ROS at 7). 

39When referring to the applicant's drug usage, the judge said (ROS at 11): 

""It seems also in relation to his drug abuse that [the applicant] commenced abusing drugs at the age of thirteen or fourteen and also alcohol on a heavy basis at about the same age. His drug abuse has escalated to smoking heroin as well as intra-nasal cocaine use and experimentation with ecstasy and benzodiazepines."" 

40The judge observed that the applicant had been able to conceal his drug habit from his sister and girlfriend. He remarked that the psychologist's report noted that the applicant related his offending to his drug-seeking behaviour. The judge found that the applicant's motivation was to obtain money for drugs. 

41The applicant's prior criminal record as an adult includes convictions for stealing from the person (1999), committing an indictable offence whilst armed (2001), maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm (2001) and robbery in company (2002). For the offence of robbery in company, the applicant was sentenced in the District Court to a term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months. His record as a young person includes offences of robbery in company (1998) and armed robbery (1998). 

42His Honour noted that the applicant had ""a substantial record of prior convictions"", including convictions for robbery (ROS at 13). As the parole period for this offence did not expire until 8 February 2008, the armed robberies being counts 1 to 3 were committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. The judge found that the commission of these offences whilst on conditional liberty was an aggravating factor. 

Some further findings by the judge 

43His Honour considered the guideline judgment for offences of armed robbery in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and noted that most of the factors in the guideline were present, namely (ROS at 15): 

""(a) A young offender with no or little criminal history. Here the offender was born in 1981 and at the time of the offences would have been aged about twenty-seven. However, he does have a criminal history. 

(b) A weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 

(c) Limited degree of planning, which I am prepared to infer to some extent.

(d) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. 

(e) Victims in a vulnerable position such as shopkeepers. 

(f) Small amount taken. 

(g) A plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.""

44The judge observed that the offences ""indicate a degree of preparation; the [applicant] being armed with a knife or other related offensive instrument which he concealed when he entered each of the premises"" (ROS at 21). He noted that the offences included threats of violence which induced fear in his victims, most of whom were in isolated situations. His Honour found as a mitigating factor that the applicant was remorseful but observed that the remorse was limited by the fact that it came in the ""face of the sentencing proceedings"" and there had been no attempt at restitution. His Honour had ""difficulty finding any real prospects of rehabilitation given the [applicant's] prior record, the sentencing options extended to him, the limited attempts at any kind of long-term drug treatment and his time in prison"" (ROS at 14). 

45A finding of special circumstances was made by the judge being the applicant's background and age and the need for increased time on parole so that his drug treatment could be monitored. 

Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred not allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the guilty pleas for counts 7, 8 and 10 (ie the Category D offences)

46The applicant submits that in raising for the first time in the remarks on sentence a discount other than 25 per cent for the Category D offences, a procedural unfairness arose. The applicant referred to the judge's remarks during the sentencing proceedings that indicated that he would give a 25 per cent discount for the Category D offences, but when sentencing the applicant a 20 per cent discount was applied. 

47In discussions with counsel on 16 November 2009, the judge said in relation to the Category D offences (at T16/11/09 T2 L30-34): 

""...to use the court time we've got we then might use some time considering what the situation would be with the discount to the plea. In other words one would expect that it would be a 25% discount for the three where's he's indicated the plea at committal."" 

48In further discussions with counsel, the judge stated (at T16/11/09 T22 L23-24):

""Plea of guilty. Again tentatively, it seems to me to be 25% on the first three and maybe ten to 15 on the last lot."" 

49In the proceedings on sentence on 11 February 2010, his Honour said to the Crown (at T11/2/10 T5 L31-32): 

""...but it just seems to me that the Local Court ones should probably be the subject of the full discount."" 

50His Honour's reference to the ""full discount"" was plainly to the top of the range of 10-25 per cent for the discount for a plea of guilty: R v Thomson; R Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 

51It was reasonable from his Honour's remarks for the applicant's counsel to assume that the judge would apply a 25 per cent discount to the Category D offences. However, when sentencing the applicant on 8 April 2010, the judge said (ROS at 12): 

""...there will be a greater discounts (sic) of twenty per cent on what would otherwise have been an appropriate head sentence. That is relevant to counts 7, 8 and 10. These findings are based on the utilitarian value of the plea, the savings to court and police resources and, particularly, that the victims did not have to give evidence and relive the events of the robberies. There is think a degree of leniency extended to the [applicant] by these discounts, in the sense that they reflect remorse, given that the [applicant] had to meet a strong Crown case."" 

52There undoubtedly would have been a denial of procedural fairness if the judge had not given the applicant's counsel an opportunity to address on the departure from the percentage discounts indicated before sentence was passed: Fairbairn v R [2006] NSWCCA 337; (2006) 165 A Crim R 434 at [37]; Trujilo-Mesa v R [2010] NSWCCA 201. However, the judge did give counsel such an opportunity after he delivered part of his sentencing remarks which included the 20 per cent discount for the Category D offences. Before taking a short adjournment, the following exchange took place between his Honour and counsel (ROS 19-20): 

""In terms, then, of my overall consideration of the matter, given the time I will take the morning tea adjournment now to give everyone the chance to consider those matters, and then I will come back and go through the consideration and I anticipate that will take me about half an hour. Anything thus far Mr Crown?

MCCARTHY: The question of the utility of the plea of guilty -I wasn't sure if your Honour was taking into account in assessing the value of that utility the strength of the Crown case.

HIS HONOUR: No, I said it was limited by a strong Crown case.

MCCARTHY: I think the question of the strength of the Crown case could be relevant to the issue of remorse but not to utility. It's not a factor that is to be taken into account in relation to--

HIS HONOUR: That's right. I will amend that because I think that's right as a matter of law to make it clear. I said there was a degree of leniency extended to the offender - page 9 - by these discounts, in terms that they reflect remorse given that the offender had to meet a strong Crown case.

MCCARTHY: Thank you and just one other thing, my instructing solicitor pointed out that your Honour might have said he pleaded guilty in the Local Court in January 2010 and it was January 2009.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Thank you. Anything thus far Mr Williams?

WILLIAMS: No thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I will give you the chance, subject to the Corrective Services -if you can leave him for about 5 minutes - we will take the morning tea adjournment and I will come back when everyone has had a break.""

53After the adjournment, the judge asked Mr Williams (the applicant's counsel) whether there was anything arising, to which Mr Williams responded ""No your Honour"" (ROS at 20). 

54When his Honour re-commenced his sentencing remarks, he outlined the sentences he intended to impose but then adjourned before passing sentence to enable the applicant's counsel to explain the sentence to the applicant and ""to see whether there's any issues"" (ROS at 32). After the short adjournment, the judge asked both the Crown and Mr Williams if they had ""anything on that?"" to which both responded ""No thank you"" (ROS at 33). 

55Mr Williams had represented the applicant during the sentencing proceedings. His Honour gave both counsel an opportunity to make submissions before sentence was passed. It was open to Mr Williams to raise with the judge the departure from the discount that had been indicated. 

56In this court, Mr McLachlan, the applicant's counsel, argued that it was inappropriate to raise such a matter when the judge was delivering his sentencing remarks. This submission has no substance as the judge invited submissions and counsel should have been sufficiently robust to bring to the judge's attention (as the Crown did) any matters about which there was a concern. I am not persuaded that the applicant has been denied procedural fairness. 

57Another argument advanced for the applicant is that the judge had taken into account irrelevant factors in determining the utilitarian value of the pleas for the Category D offences. 

58In the passage quoted at [51] above, the judge said he took into account that the victims did not have to give evidence and re-live the events and that the discounts reflected remorse, given that the applicant had to meet a strong Crown case. His Honour's approach was erroneous as the utilitarian discount for a guilty plea does not take into account saving witnesses from giving evidence, the strength of the Crown case or remorse: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1. 

59The Crown, however, took the opportunity to point out to the judge that he was in error, which his Honour accepted. The applicant, however, submits that neither the reasons for sentence were corrected nor the value of the utility of the discounts re-visited. 

60It is well established that the range of discount referred to in R v Thompson; R v Houlton is a guideline that creates no presumption or entitlement to a particular discount. The amount of the discount is a matter for a judge's discretion. As Wood CJ at CL said in R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 113 at [12] - [13]: 

""In my view, it is proper for the utilitarian value of a plea to be assessed in the continuum of the justice system, from the time of charging to disposition, and in the light of the fact that the amount of the discount is a discretionary matter, there being no entitlement, or presumption, that an offender should receive any particular amount by way of a discount in any particular factual situation: R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 per Howie J at para 28. 

Any other approach would involve an unduly rigid approach to the discretion which is involved, and would fail to pay regard to the fact that considerable savings in time, expense and inconvenience to investigators, the DPP, witnesses and the Court, will occur if pleas are offered, for example, at the first mention. Where that does not occur, considerable time, expense and inconvenience can be occasioned at the Local Court stage, in the assembly of evidence, in mentions, in conducting a committal, in applications for stays, appeals and the like, before the matter reaches the District Court or Supreme Court. It would be unrealistic to ignore those circumstances when assessing the utilitarian value of a plea, and it would be artificial to assume, without more, that a plea entered in the Local Court should inevitably attract the maximum discount.""

61In the present case, it appears that the pleas for the Category D offences were entered at the committal proceedings. A discount of 20 per cent was well within the proper exercise of his Honour's discretion and no error has been demonstrated. 

62I would dismiss Ground 1 of the appeal. 

Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in that seeking to achieve an overall two-thirds ratio between the total non-parole period and the total 'head' sentence, his Honour erroneously extended the additional term on Count 1 rather than reducing the non-parole period for that count. 

63The applicant contends that with the head sentence for ""Henry type"" offences falling within the 4-5 year range and count 1 attracting a 10 per cent discount for the guilty plea, a 10 year 4 months 'head' sentence could only have been arrived at as a consequence of his Honour erroneously extending the additional term to achieve a desired overall ratio of two-thirds between the total non-parole period and the total 'head' sentence. Whilst accepting that the court was required to take into account the Form 1 matters, the applicant submits that count 1 was already accumulated to the largest degree and was otherwise held to warrant the imposition of a sentence of the range suggested in Henry. The court's attention was drawn to his Honour's statement that (ROS at 24): 

""Each of the robberies, as well as the attempted robberies, come within the Henry factors in terms of that guideline judgment. Each would warrant the imposition of a sentence of the range suggested in that decision.""

64I do not think that these remarks were intended by the judge to cover all of the offences. His Honour subsequently referred to count 1 as ""unique"" (ROS at 25). He noted that the applicant was on parole when the offence was committed and there were the Form 1 matters attached to this count. 

65The guideline judgment in Henry, which is to be used as a 'check' or a 'guide' provides that a sentence for an offence of armed robbery falling within the seven characteristics identified in the guideline should generally be between four and five years full term. The first characteristic in the Henry guideline is a ""young offender with no or little criminal history."" The applicant's prior record includes offences of robbery in company and armed robbery. As the judge said, the applicant had a substantial record of prior convictions. An aggravating factor is that the applicant at the time of the armed robbery was on parole for the offence of robbery in company. He abused his conditional liberty by robbing the Brighton Le Sands clothing store whilst armed with a knife. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28; R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. These matters justified a sentence above the sentencing range identified in Henry. 

66There were 14 offences on the Form 1, 11 of which were offences of armed robbery and one was an attempted armed robbery. The criminality involved in the Form 1 offences emphasised the additional need for personal deterrence and retribution for the armed robbery for which the applicant was being sentenced and the judge was entitled to substantially increase the penalty for count 1: Re Attorney General's Application  under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [23]. 

67An offence contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act is punishable by 20 years imprisonment. The sentence imposed for count 1 including the offences on the Form 1 was 10 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 4 months. In my view, the sentence was within an appropriate range. His Honour adjusted the statutory ratio in accordance with his finding of special circumstances. The judge did not erroneously extend the additional term of count 1. 

68I would dismiss Ground 2 of the appeal. 

Ground 3: The individual sentences imposed were otherwise manifestly 
excessive.

69The applicant's initial submission was that each individual sentence was manifestly excessive. This argument was founded on the contention that the fixed terms of imprisonment imposed by the judge were in effect non-parole periods and exceeded the sentencing range in the Henry guideline. Particular reference was made to the Category C offences for which fixed terms of 4 years 6 months had been imposed which suggested a notional 'head' sentence for each offence of 6 years. 

70I am not persuaded that the judge equated the fixed terms of imprisonment that he imposed with non-parole periods. His Honour was conscious of the Henry guideline and the fixed terms of between 4 and 5 years for all the offences other than count 1 fell within the guideline range. In my opinion, the fixed terms imposed by the judge were intended to be 'head' sentences and none of them were manifestly excessive. 

71In any event, I am of the view that even if the judge had intended the fixed terms to be non-parole periods, the sentences would not have been beyond an appropriate range. To use the applicant's example of the Category C offences, a 'head' sentence of 6 years would not have been manifestly excessive as the repeated commission of armed robberies by the applicant required that substantial weight be given to personal deterrence and protection of society: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. 

72The degree of accumulation between the sentences was not challenged which was not surprising as it was generous to the applicant. As a result of accumulation and concurrence, the effective non-parole period for count 1 was 1 year 8 months. During oral submissions, Mr McLachlan accepted that a reduction in the overall sentence was dependent upon a successful challenge to the sentence imposed on count 1. 

73I have previously stated that the sentence for count 1 was within an appropriate range of sentence. It is not manifestly excessive, nor is the overall sentence. 

74I would dismiss Ground 3 of the appeal. 

Orders:

75I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed. 

76CAMPBELL J: I agree with Price J.

		05 August 2013",2013-08-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762048,Finnigan v R [2013] NSWCCA 177,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Campbell J.
2CAMPBELL J: In R. v. Lovell [2012] QCA 43 Chesterman JA (at [30]) defined a Ponzi scheme in the following terms:
... a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to investors from their own money or money paid into the scheme by subsequent investors rather than from any actual profit earned from money invested. The scheme entices new investors by offering returns legitimate investments cannot, returns that were both abnormally high and consistent. The perpetuation of the returns that a Ponzi scheme advertises and pays requires an ever increasing flow of money from subsequent investors to keep the scheme going.
(See also Fasciale v. The Queen [2010] VSCA 337; 207 A Crim. R 488 at 498[52] per Weinberg JA.)
3In one sense, as submitted by learned counsel for the Crown, a Ponzi scheme consists of ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"".  But there must be an endless, serial recruitment of Peters, each of whom, if he or she knew the truth, could hope for no better than to take a turn as Paul because the ""entitlements"" of previous investors must be paid out with the receipts obtained from the new. There is no investment.
4The ongoing promotion of a Ponzi scheme neatly fits with the concept of engagement upon ""one multi-faceted course of criminal conduct"":  Attorney-General v. Tichy (1982) 30 SASR 84 at 92 - 3 per Wells J; Johnson v. The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at 618 [4] - [5] per Gleeson CJ. The promotion of a Ponzi scheme also is aptly described as ""multiple counts of systematic and serious fraud"": Hoy v. The Queen [2012] VSCA 49 at [25] per Nettle JA; or as ""an on going fraudulent course of conduct"", and ""a single fraudulent enterprise"": Hoy at [17] per Redlich JA.
5I have referred to these matters at the outset because they have particular relevance to the disposition of the current application for leave to appeal against sentence brought under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
6The applicant was the promoter of a Ponzi scheme who was charged with nine counts of knowingly engaging in dishonest conduct in relation to financial services contrary to s.1041G Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
7Section 1041G is in the following terms:
A person must not, in the course of carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction, engage in dishonest conduct in relation to a financial product or financial service.
By s.1311(1) non compliance with this provision is an offence. At the relevant time it carried a maximum penalty for an individual of imprisonment for five years:  s.1311, and Sch. 3 item 310 Corporations Act.  Penalties have been stiffened since then.  By amendment made by Act No. 131 of 2010, the maximum penalty for an individual is now imprisonment for ten years.  
8The nine individual offences with which the applicant was charged occurred between January 2003 and April 2007, involving a total of $1.96 million in actual financial losses suffered by his investor victims.  
9The nine counts had eight victims, all of whom were individuals who fell into that category sometimes described as ""mum and dad investors"".  A plea of guilty was entered upon arraignment in the District Court, which followed a fully contested committal. The sentencing judge allowed a ten per cent discount for the relatively late plea. There is no complaint about this allowance.  His Honour passed the following individual sentences:
Count 1 - Sentenced to 5 years imprisonment but reduced by 10% for guilty plea to 4 years 6 months imprisonment to commence on 16.12.2011 and to expire on 21.7.2016.
Count 2 - Sentenced to 3 years 7 months imprisonment to commence on 16.12.2012 and to expire on 21.7.2016.
Count 3 - Sentenced to 3 years 7 months imprisonment to commence on 16.12.2013 and to expire on 21.7.2017.
Count 4 - Sentenced to 3 years 7 months imprisonment to commence on 16.12.2014 and to expire on 21.7.2018
Count 5 - Sentenced to 3 years 7 months imprisonment to commence on 16.12.2015 and to expire on 21.7.2019.
Count 6 - Sentenced to 3 years 7 months imprisonment to commence on 16.12.2016 and to expire on 21.7.2020.
Counts 7-9 - Sentenced to 4 years imprisonment, to be served concurrently to commence on 16.12.2017 and to expire on 15.12.2021.
Effectively the sentence amounts to a head sentence of ten years with a six-year non-parole period (See s.19AB Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (""Crimes Act"")). The applicant is eligible for release on parole after 15 December 2017. 
Background facts
10The circumstances of the offending were the subject of evidence at the sentencing hearing.  The following summary is taken from the Crown submissions in this Court:
(a)the conduct occurred between January 2003 and April 2007;
(b)the applicant attracted potential investors by befriending them, wining and dining them, gaining their trust and promising high rates of return;
(c)his conduct comprised the making of representations designed to induce potential investors to invest their money with the applicant and his companies on the promise of large returns. Those representations included:
(i)representations that the applicant had expertise as a financial planner and investment advisor; (ii)representations about the applicant's  personal wealth  and  the financial   success   of  Financial Partners Pty Ltd and other  companies controlled by the applicant; (iii)representations about the ability to return 15%  per annum on investment funds by investing in property, shares, derivatives and other financial products;(iv)representations to the effect that the applicant could personally guarantee the sum invested; (v)representations to the effect that there was no risk involved in the investment; and (vi)representations to the effect that the investor would receive a monthly interest payment on their investment equivalent to 15% per annum;
(d)each of these representations was false and known by the applicant to be false at the times he made those representations to the investors;
(e)the conduct involved the creation and use of documents which he provided to investors, which intentionally gave the misleading appearance that their funds would be securely invested;
(f)the applicant did not invest these moneys on behalf of the investors in accordance with his representations, but rather used the moneys to fund interest payments to other investors, capital repayments to other investors, various businesses operated by him and to meet the applicant's personal expenses;
(g)the total amount of investor capital the subject of the counts in the indictment so treated by the applicant totalled $1,960,000 most of which was never recovered by the investors.
The circumstances of the offences were set out in greater particularity in the agreed statement of facts tendered before the learned sentencing judge [AB 82 -134]. The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings but did not take issue with the contents of the agreed statement of facts [AB 10.35].
11I have adopted the summary relating to each count from the submissions filed on behalf of the applicant as well as the summary provided by counsel for the applicant of his client's subjective circumstances. 
The applicant was a director of two companies, Financial Partners Pty Ltd ('FP') and Venture Capital Management Pty Ltd ('VCM'). He and an associate conducted seminars providing investment advice. Neither the applicant nor his companies held an Australian Financial Services Licence. The applicant defrauded a number of investors in a 'Ponzi' scheme. The circumstances of each offence are summarised below.
Count 1
Manuela Matt met the applicant in 2003. The applicant claimed he was a financial advisor. He said he had a large company with offices across Australia and he made investors large sums of money without risk. He told Mrs Matt the return from her superannuation fund was poor. Mrs Matt entered into an investment security contract with FP relating to an investment of $200,000 promising a return of 15% per annum and stated to be underwritten. The applicant wrote on the document that it was personally guaranteed. Mrs Matt paid $200,030 into FP's account. The funds were dispersed in payments to other investors, staff, accountancy services and rent, the applicant's credit card account and withdrawn in cash.
The applicant offered to become Mrs Matt's business partner in a cosmetic medicine clinic. The applicant rented and fitted out premises for the business. Mrs Matt managed the business and the applicant managed its cash flow and paid its bills. Mrs Matt received a number of interest payments. When they ceased, the applicant claimed he had put the money back into their business. Ultimately, Mrs Matt demanded to know where her money was and the applicant told her it was gone.
Count 2 Mrs Matt referred Fiona Russell to the applicant to discuss her financial affairs. Mrs Russell ran a catering business and cared for her husband who had suffered a stroke. The applicant claimed he was an expert in property management and shares and said he had a high success rate in venture capital projects. He persuaded her to take out a loan for investment purposes. Mrs Russell entered into an investment security contract with FP relating to an investment of $500,000, promising a return of at least 15% per annum. $495,580.98 was paid into FP's account. Mrs Russell received a number of interest payments. The funds were largely dispersed in payments to other investors, staff, rent, solicitors, a business of Mrs Matt, and the applicant's credit card account. Mrs Russell noticed the interest payments were late and demanded the return of her money or she would complain to ASIC. The applicant offered to repay the money in instalments but did not.
Count 3
Mrs Matt referred Heide McConkey to the applicant in mid-2004 for advice regarding investment of an inheritance. The applicant claimed he was licensed and experienced in financial planning. He said his company's investments included a biotechnology project that he claimed was underwritten. Mrs McConkey transferred $230,000 into VCM's account. The applicant gave her a receipt for shares. The funds were dispersed in payments to other investors, employees, equipment for the applicant and Mrs Matt's business, and the applicant's credit card account. The applicant also drew a number of cheques for the purchase of a property at the request of another investor who had demanded the return of his money.
Count 4
Mrs Matt referred Per Hassell, Mrs McConkey's partner, to the applicant in mid-2004 for superannuation advice. The applicant claimed he was experienced in investment planning. He promised Mr Hassell a return of 15% on his superannuation. Mr Hassel signed a superannuation fund trust deed. $120,000 was paid into FP's account. The funds were dispersed in payments to other investors, staff, rent, an accounting service, a business of Mrs Matt, and the applicant's credit card account. Mr Hassel paid further contributions totalling $27,200. Mr Hassel asked the applicant what he did with the last payment and the applicant said he put it ""in biotech"". Mr Hassel's money was not repaid.
Counts 5 & 6
Mrs Russell referred Phillipe Perez to the applicant. Mr Perez operated a business providing staff for corporate functions and was going through divorce proceedings. The applicant claimed he was an experienced investment advisor. Mr Perez entered into an investment security contract with FP relating to an investment of $100,000, promising a return of at least 15% per annum. $100,000 was paid into FP's account. Mr Perez received a number of interest payments. $60,000 of the funds was dispersed in payments to other investors, staff, rent, legal services, and the applicant's credit card account. The applicant persuaded Mr Perez to refinance a mortgage and invest further money in a biotech company and derivatives. Mr Perez entered into an investment security contract with VCM relating to an investment of $100,000, with interest of at least 20% payable annually and any excess to be split with VCM. $188,799.30 was transferred into VCM's account. The applicant gave Mr Perez a receipt and a certificate for shares in the biotech company. Mr Perez received some monthly interest payments. The funds were dispersed in payments to other investors, employees, FP, rent, legal services, a business of Mrs Matt, the applicant's credit card account and withdrawn in cash. When interest payments ceased, Mr Perez corresponded with the applicant. Mr Perez received payments of $10,000 from FP, and $56,000 and $100,534.24 from VCM, before a further cheque was dishonoured.
Count 7
Mrs Matt introduced Dee Bone to the applicant in 2003. Mrs Bone worked in the cosmetic industry. The applicant claimed he was a venture capitalist. He promised Mrs Bone and her husband risk-free property investment he personally guaranteed. They refinanced their home with the applicant acting as their mortgage manager. Mrs Bone and her husband entered into an investment security contract with FP relating to an investment of $200,000 with interest of at least 15% per annum. Sums of $200,000 and $44,000 were paid into VCM's account. The funds were dispersed in payments to other investors, staff, rent, equipment for the applicant and Mrs Matt's business, and the applicant's credit card account. Mrs Bone received payments of $20,000 from FP and $10,000 from VCM but no further payments.
Count 8
Signa Furber met the applicant and Mrs Matt at a cosmetic industry conference. The applicant claimed he was a venture capitalist. Mrs Furber entered into an investment security contract with VCM relating to an investment of $200,000 with interest of at least 15% per annum. $200,000 was paid into VCM's account. The funds were dispersed in payments to other investors, staff, rent, an office fit-out, legal services, equipment for the applicant and Mrs Matt's business, and the applicant's credit card account. Mrs Furber became nervous about her investment. The applicant said he would personally guarantee the funds and gave her a backdated investment security contract. Mrs Furber received a number of interest payments. A monthly payment was not made and she demanded the applicant return her funds. The applicant said he could not return her funds as other investors had demanded that their funds be returned.
Count 9
Mrs Bone introduced Jacqueline Schell and Brendan Mullard to the applicant in early 2006. Mrs Schell and Mr Mullard were partners in holiday property management and import-export businesses, and were setting up a new business. The applicant said he was a venture capitalist with access to services they would need in setting up their new business. He persuaded them to refinance their mortgage and said he was a licensed mortgage 'originator'. Ms Schell and Mr Mullard entered into an investment security contract with VCM relating to an investment of $250,000 with interest of at least 15% payable annually. $250,000 was paid into VCM's account. The funds were dispersed in payments to other investors, staff, FP, the applicant and Mrs Matt's business, and the applicant's credit card account. The applicant said $50,000 had been invested in the biotech company. Mrs Schell demanded their funds be returned but the applicant said he could not as a property transaction had not settled. Their money was not repaid.

The applicant's subjective circumstances
12The applicant was 49 years of age at the time of sentence. He had no record of previous convictions and was of prior good character. As he did not give evidence the information regarding his background derived from a pre-sentence report.
13The applicant and his family migrated from the United Kingdom and settled in Western Australia when the applicant was about six years of age. The applicant's father died in 1985. His mother returned to the United Kingdom but died in 2006. The applicant was estranged from an elder brother who resided in Perth. He is single.
14The applicant left school at the age of fifteen years. He commenced but did not complete university studies in commerce. However, he attained a diploma in financial services in 2005. After leaving school, the applicant started a cleaning company, then at nineteen years of age bought a fish and chip shop. He had since worked in the fishing, farming and hospitality industries. At 23 years of age, he found employment with a commodities broker. Between 1988 and 1991, he was employed with a bank and rose to the position of manager. The applicant was then a company director for fourteen years. In 1996, the company merged with a NSW mortgage broking business and he moved to Sydney. However, the company was liquidated in 2007 and the applicant filed for bankruptcy.
15The applicant had been employed with a hire car business for the four years prior to sentence. He had resided in rented accommodation since his arrival in Sydney and was living in a backpacker's lodge at the time of sentence.
16The judge did not accept that the applicant was remorseful and rejected the probation and parole officer's assessment that he presented a low risk of re-offending. The judge considered rather that the applicant posed a high risk of re-offending.
Reasons for sentence
17The sentencing judge set out in greater detail the facts summarised above. Appropriately, in my view, his Honour described the contents of the victim impact statements provided in each case as ""very sad documents"". His Honour found (AB 48):
All of them are statements from people who have lost everything as a result of these false claims and the operation of this scheme. All of them believed this man, all of them regarded him in some way as a friend whom they could trust, and because they felt they could trust him they gave him money on his say so as to what he would do with it.
18His Honour expressed his conclusions in the following terms (AB p50-53) The reference to Mr Madoff is a reference to United States v. Madoff, No. 09 Cr. 213 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2009):
The plain fact of the matter is that this scheme, just as with Mr Madoff's much bigger scheme, is a big sham. At no stage did he invest in anything, and at no stage did he intend to invest in anything. His only intention was to deceive people into giving him money by making false representations of wealth and success. It is easy, as I have said, nowadays, these years afterwards, to look back and say how would anyone be taken in by this. The plain fact is that people like the current offender have great skill, charm and ability to persuade, and people who are normally businesslike, calm and considered in their approach are taken in. Any of the current investors who feel bad about it should realise, and they can if they want to, look up what Mr Madoff did in New York and realise the sorts of people who were taken in by Mr Madoff. People who had put in millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, believing they were going to get a magnificent return and these were people of considerable wealth and ability.
Ponzi schemes must be actively discouraged by the courts and those who engage in them can expect to receive harsh sentences. This man must be sentenced for what he did. He was not a trustee for anybody, he did not breach trust in the normal sense. He betrayed friendship, he made false claims, he caused financial ruin and enormous hardship. His victims are human beings and in many ways false representations like this to ordinary citizens are far worse than false representations of this type made to large companies that also happens from time to time. I am aware myself of two individuals who managed to persuade very large companies to make over very large cheques to them on false representations, I am talking of tens of millions of dollars. So these sorts of people can operate anywhere and at any level.
He has to be dealt with for what he did and not for what anybody else did. But an element of the sentence has to be the protection of the community. On occasions that requires a longer sentence than would be imposed otherwise. I think it is called for in this case because I see not the slightest evidence that he has any appreciation of the damage and destruction he has caused or any concern about what has happened to anybody.
There of course must always be some hope of rehabilitation. But as I have said before, I do not accept the report of the Probation and Parole Office because I think it is based on their acceptance of false representations made by him. Ultimately I have come to a conclusion that I should impose on him a sentence that may be seen to be one of the toughest sentences ever imposed and that is a sentence of ten years imprisonment with a six-year non-parole period. I am imposing that because general deterrence requires that people be discouraged actively from engaging in these schemes. Individual deterrence requires that he be prevented from engaging in these schemes for a considerable period. The protection of the community requires that he not be able to do it for a considerable period. The possibility of rehabilitation must always be there but I think it is very low down on the list. Anybody who engages in conduct of this type has a lot of work to do to rehabilitate himself and rehabilitation in my opinion only comes if he does something effective to repay the people whose money he took and misused.
The principle of totality requires that I must look at sentences that are imposed and ensure that in an overall sense no sentence is too large. It requires that I must combine some of the sentences to ensure that that occurs, otherwise I would be putting him there for too long. In America that principle does not apply and you can put people away for as long as you like. But we do not impose in this country 100-year sentences or 150 year sentences. It is absurd.
He has to be given the opportunity of rehabilitation. As a white-collar offender the very distinct probability is that at an early time he will be transferred to a minimum security institution and indeed I am going to recommend that that be done and to be classified as soon as possible with a view to being moved to a such an institution. Ultimately depending on how he behaves himself he can be given weekend leave and even leave during the week to work. That depends on him, I have no say in classifications and I am certainly not recommending that anything be done other than that he be classified as soon as possible. I direct that these sentencing remarks be sent to the Director of Classifications of the Department of Corrective Services so that that department can move to deal with his classification as soon as possible.
The individual sentences that I impose are as follows. Count 1, I have decided I should impose a maximum sentence for the offence committed against Mrs Matt of five years, but reduce it by ten per cent to four years and six months because of his plea of guilty. I impose the harsher sentence for that one only because he used her as an unwilling or an unwitting accomplice. He used her to recruit others. She did not know anything about what he wasup to, and I think that should be recognised. For the other sentences in the main they will be three years and seven months or thereabouts. For Counts 7, 8 and 9 they will be a straight four years. As will be seen that is done to ensure that in an overall sense a greater sentence is not imposed than it should be imposed. So count 1 will go from 16 December 2011 to 15 June 2016. Count 2 will go from 16 December 2012 to 21 July 2016. Count 3 will go from 16 December 2013 to 21 July 2017. Count 4 will go from 16 December 2014 to 21 July 2018. Count 5 will go from 16 December 2015 to 21 July 2019. Count 6 will go from 16 December 2016 to 21 July 2020. Count 7, 8 and 9 will all go from 16 December 2017 to 15 December 2021, they will be concurrent with each other. There will be a non-parole period of six years, that will go from 16 December 2011 to December 2017. He will be eligible for parole on that day.
Grounds of appeal
19The applicant advances three grounds of appeal as follows:
(1)The judge mistook the facts;
(2)The judge erred in failing to determine a proportionate sentence in respect of each count;
(3)The sentences are unreasonable and/or plainly unjust. 
The submissions of the parties
20Counsel on each side of the record argued his case with a great deal of skill and persuasion.
21Mr. T. Gartelmann of counsel, who appeared for the applicant, argued that the sentencing judge mistook important facts relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending.  Consequently, counsel argued, he overstated this most significant consideration. A particular example of this related to Counts 5 and 6. The victim was Mr. Perez.  It was said his Honour made two particular errors.  First, he found that Mr. Perez had invested $500,000, rather than $300,000.  Secondly the judge found that the whole of that money had been lost, when in fact the applicant had caused some payments to be made to Mr. Perez as a return on his ""investment"". Payments received by Mr. Perez totalled about $166,500. It was submitted that the error was material because the amount of money involved in a case of premeditated deception is an important factor in determining the extent of criminality:  R. v. Mungomery [2004] NSWCCA 450; 151 A Crim R 376 at 384 [41]; R. v. Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 436.  Section 16A(2) Crimes Act requires a court to take into account such matters as are relevant and known to the court, including any loss suffered by the victim. It was submitted that overstating the loss, as his Honour did, meant that the sentencing discretion in the case of Counts 5 and 6 must have miscarried, and the error must have infected the whole process.
22The second ground of appeal was founded on contravention of the principle discussed in Pearce v. The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 624 [45]; Johnson at 624 [26]. Counsel argued that it was clear that his Honour had adopted an initial ""global approach"" from which he had reasoned back to an assortment of sentences which was an impermissible ""top-down-approach"". Moreover there was no discernible consistency of approach, suggesting individual sentences were adjusted to justify the result. Such an approach offends Pearce:  R. v. Swadling [2004] NSWCCA 421 [57]; Yeonata v. R. [2012] NSWCCA 211 at [51].
23Ground 3 raised manifest excess. Mr. Gartelmann pointed out that four of the individual sentences imposed were for terms of four years or more.  This was close to the statutory maximum five years reserved ""for the worst type of case falling within"" the section:  Ibbs v. The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 451 - 2.
24As the amount involved and the period over which the deception was practised were key indicators of the objective seriousness of the offending, morally culpable as these cases were, it could not be said that they fell into the worst type of case, even accepting that the circumstance that the victim of each offence was an individual who suffered personal hardship as a consequence of the offending may be an aggravating circumstance.  Counsel referred to Braun v. The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 269; 190 A Crim R 497 at 512 [75], and 513 [81].
25Learned counsel for the Crown accepted that the sentencing judge may have overstated the amount ""invested"" by Mr. Perez. However, it was submitted that his Honour was not wrong in concluding that the amount actually ""invested"", being $300,000, was virtually a total loss. This argument was fleshed out by reference to a schedule, MFI 1 handed up without objection, which summarised the evidence in relation to Counts 5 and 6, including the amounts paid to Mr. Perez out of the funds of other ""investors"".  The total loss was said to be $289,715.76. But more importantly, submitted counsel, in the case of a Ponzi scheme, the precise calculation of the scale of the fraud was less significant than the brazen and calculated continuing course of conduct involved in the ongoing criminal enterprise:  Fasciale at 498 [53]; Hoy at [17] - [20] and at [25].
26In relation to Ground 2, the Crown submitted that the applicant's invitation to the Court to focus upon the precise calculation of the loss suffered by each ""investor"" was ""apt to give rise to error"" of the type identified in Wong v. The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 611 [74] - 612 [76].  Instead, s.16A (2) Crimes Act requires the instinctive synthesis approach which calls for consideration of all the facts, matters and circumstances relevant to fixing the appropriate sentence for the offence, and the offender. There was no Pearce error because his Honour did fix appropriate sentences for each individual offence. Fixing concurrent four year terms for each of Counts 7, 8 and 9 was an acceptable approach to reflect the consideration of totality which his Honour expressly referred to at the foot of AB 51. 
27The Crown submitted that the overall effective sentence was not manifestly excessive.  The present case was an example of ""serious white collar crime"" requiring ""condign sentences"": Pantano v R (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330. In a case like the present where the individual counts were instances of an ongoing fraudulent course of conduct or a criminal enterprise, a ""broad-brush"" approach to the fixing of sentences was permissible: Day v. The Queen [2011] VSCA 243 at [17] - [18].
Resolution
28I would reject Mr. Gartelmann's first ground by reference to the judgment of Redlich JA in Hoy v. The Queen [2012] VSCA 49 [17] - [20]:
[17] When a sentencing judge is required to impose terms of imprisonment on a large number of counts, it has often been recognised that the sentencing judge may, within limits, adopt a ""broad-brush"" approach to the fixing of sentence. For example, such an approach may be appropriate where there was an ongoing fraudulent course of conduct, a single fraudulent or common enterprise or where the criminal behaviour on counts was of a similar and repetitive nature. 
[18] There is much authority to the effect that sentences imposed in such circumstances need only be roughly proportional to the gravity of the offences and the amount taken. This is not the first time that it has been necessary to state that structural objections to the sentences imposed in such cases is to be discouraged unless they reveal error in the instinctive synthesis. Where a judge is entitled to adopt a broad-brush approach, disconformity between sentences on particular counts will not usually provide a sufficient basis to impugn the instinctive synthesis.
[19] In circumstances such as the present, the sentencing judge was not required to give the same level of attention to each of the sentencing considerations which bear upon the fixing of each individual sentence. Counts 31 and 37 were not committed in isolation. They were a necessary part of the applicant's scheme used to prop up the facade of Chartwell's prosperity. There was a detailed deception of the Commonwealth Bank involving the creation of false documents which entirely misrepresented the company's financial circumstances. The monies obtained from the CBA enabled the applicant to pursue individual investor victims and avoid calls being made on earlier investments.
[20] While the effect of the crime upon an individual victim is a relevant sentencing consideration, it has never been said, nor do I think it correct to imply, that the sentence imposed for an offence against an institution should necessarily be less than a sentence to be imposed against an individual where the value of the theft is of the same order. As Gleeson CJ stated in Machtas, general deterrence is an important consideration in relation to activities which cause a serious financial loss to banks. His Honour rejected the submission that a matter to be taken into account was that the loss was to a large financial corporation. His Honour thought the better view was that it was the absence of an aggravating circumstance that there was no victim who was caused personal hardship. There are of course direct consequences for the institution and potential indirect consequences for many individuals where major fraud is committed against institutions. The need to deter those who would seek to commit such fraud remains a primary consideration.

29In the same case at [25] Nettle JA said: Punctilious identification of distinguishing features as between offences doubtless has a role to play in some sentencing exercises. But, in cases like this, involving multiple counts of systematic and serious fraud, its utility tends to be limited.
 See also Day v. The Queen at [24].
30In R. v. Machtas (1992) 62 A Crim R 179 at 182, Gleeson CJ (with whom Handley JA and Badgery-Parker J agreed) said:
It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that a matter to be taken into account in her favour is that the victim of the loss was a large financial corporation. I reject that submission. It may be more accurate to say that it is not an aggravating circumstance of the present offences that the victim was some individual who suffered great personal hardship as a result of them.
The learned sentencing judge, by implication, adopted this approach:  AB 36 - 37.
31The authorities Mr. Gartelmann referred to indicate that the amount involved, and the period over which the deception was practised, are important markers of objective seriousness. And, of course, the applicant ""was entitled to have the relevant factual matters carefully and accurately considered by the [sentencing] court"":  Johnson at 625 [32].  However, his Honour did not mis-state the total amount involved in this fraud of $1.96 million.  And like Weinburg JA in Fasciale I consider that it ""matters little"" whether a victim was robbed of $300,000 or $500,000 in the overall scheme of things. On any view, retribution, protection of the community, deterrence, both general and personal, factors to which the judge made express reference, all required condign punishment in this case.  
32I accept the force of the argument on behalf of the Crown that any undue focus upon the precise calculation of the loss suffered by each ""investor"" itself ran a risk of error of the type identified in Wong, which as I understand it, is singling out one factor as decisive, as opposed to the due consideration of all relevant facts, matters and circumstances. In my judgment, the consideration that the effect on each victim was ruinous, in the circumstances of this case was a more compelling consideration, among many, than the precise calculation of the amount involved.
33In my judgment, Mr. Gartelmann has made good his second ground. I take it to be firmly established that when sentencing for multiple offences, the approach described in Pearce at 624 [45] must be followed.  McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said that the sentencing judge must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then go on to consider the other questions (my emphasis). Moreover, at [46] their Honours emphasised the importance of applying ""proper principle"" throughout. The need to faithfully adhere to this sequence has been frequently emphasised by this Court including in Swaddling and Yeonata to which we were referred by Mr. Gartelmann (see [22] above). As Smart AJ pointed out in Swaddling at [50], Pearce was reiterated by Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Johnson at 624 [26].  What their Honours said there may be taken as supporting some degree of flexibility in the application of Pearce.  However, whilst acknowledging that, their Honours emphasised that it is ""undesirable ... to have regard only to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender"" (emphasis in the original). It may be argued that ""undesirable"" is not an imperative word. However, it is clear from the decisions of this Court to which I have referred that the adoption of a ""global approach"", which may be acceptable in some States (e.g. see Lovell), has been regarded as impermissible in New South Wales, leaving s.53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to one side.
34Swaddling  acknowledged an available flexibility when sentencing for multiple offences.  And I would understand that to be the thrust of the approach of Redlich and Nettle JJA in Hoy.  But as Swaddling makes clear, this flexibility does not extend to first fixing the total effective sentence, then working backwards from there to structure a series of sentences to justify the result first pronounced.  In my view, such an approach directly contradicts Pearce, an option not available to this Court or a primary sentencing court.  
35The decision in Pearce itself explains why the proper order must be adhered to. One reason is the need to avoid double punishment. That cannot be achieved unless each individual offence is addressed separately.  There may be no single correct answer to a sentencing conundrum, but a single sentence is required to be imposed in accordance with ""proper principle"".  Unless the Pearce approach is followed, the subsequent questions of ""cumulation or concurrence, as well ... as questions of totality"" will result in orders ""made on an imperfect foundation"".  Separate consideration of the appropriate sentence on each count ensures consistency and avoids ""artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders"".  It also avoids distortion of ""general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences"".  
36Consideration of the whole passage in Johnson at 624 [26] justifies some degree of flexibility, but only at the first stage of fixing the appropriate sentence for each individual offence. Neither the approach in Hoy or the approach in Tichy, favoured as the latter was by Gleeson CJ in Johnson, justifies starting with the total effective head sentence and, from there, adopting a ""top-down"" reasoning process. 
37For my part, I have reservations about his Honour's statement that he had come to a conclusion that he ""should impose [on the applicant] a sentence that may be seen to be one of the toughest sentences ever imposed"".  It is one thing to recognise that offences of this type call for condign punishment.  That consideration brings considerations of retribution and general deterrence sharply into focus.  But it is quite another to set out to impose the sentence that falls into the ""toughest"" category.  To my mind, this is an irrelevant consideration.  The process of instinctive synthesis may well produce a heavy sentence in a case like the present.  This consideration, however, is a very good reason for adhering to the proper sequence mandated by Pearce.  Starting with a conclusion, as the plurality said in Pearce, ""is likely to mask error"".
38As I have accepted Mr. Gartelmann's argument in relation to Ground 2, it is unnecessary to go on to consider Ground 3 and the question of manifest excess.  The detection of specific error is inimicable to the manifest excess ground:  Wong v. The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58].  Further consideration of Ground 3 is therefore superfluous.
Re-sentencing
39As the applicant has succeeded on Ground 2, it is necessary to consider the statutory question posed by s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act, namely, whether I am of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law.  This can only be determined by sentencing the applicant in accordance with the proper principles established by Pearce.
40In re-sentencing, I think it appropriate to adopt that flexibility discussed by Wells JA in Tichy, and Smart AJ in Swaddling. I find, by reference to the nine individual counts, that the applicant ""was truly engaged upon one multi-faceted course of criminal conduct"". The sentences imposed must properly reflect that consideration. Moreover, and along the same lines, I think it appropriate to adopt the limited ""broad-brush"" approach discussed in Hoy.  As Nettle JA explained in Hoy at [23] this permits me to take into account the similarity of offending, and the level of stress, inconvenience and financial loss suffered by the various victims without the need for ""punctilious identification of distinguishing features as between offences"".
41In approaching each sentence, I will bear in mind the ruinous financial affect of the applicant's offending on each of his victims.  That they are individuals who have suffered significant personal hardship because of the offending is, I find, a significant aggravating factor in the applicant's offending: s.16A(2)(d)(e).
42I accept, as the sentencing judge did, that this type of white-collar crime calls for condign punishment to further the general purposes of sentencing including exacting retribution, general deterrence, individual deterrence and, significantly, the protection of the community. So far as there is scope for rehabilitation, especially in the interest of the community, the opportunity for supervised release should be provided.
43Previous good character is a factor of less relevance in white-collar fraud. The appearance of respectability is exploited in such cases. And the engagement in an extended criminal enterprise, once exposed, diminishes the credit which good character might otherwise bestow.
44In adopting the ""broad-brush"" approach, I propose to deal with Count 1 separately because I substantially agree with the sentencing judge that the sentence in respect of the offence against Mrs. Matt should be harsher than the others because of the additional factor of the applicant using her ""as an unwilling or an unwitting accomplice ... to recruit others"".  As Mr. Gartelmann conceded in argument, the moral culpability of the offender is high in respect of all offences, but especially in respect of Count 1.
45I have also borne in mind, in respect of all matters, the ten per cent allowance his Honour made for the, albeit, late plea: s.16A(2)(g).
46I also bear in mind that the maximum sentence for each count is imprisonment for five years. I do not quite agree with the sentencing judge's assessment that Count 1 fell into ""the worse possible case"":  Markarian v. The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 372 [31], but I find that it is close to that category. In my judgment a term of imprisonment of four years, bearing in mind the discount, commencing on 16th December 2011, should be imposed for that offence.  
47I propose to deal the remaining eight counts by applying Thicy and Hoy.  In my judgment this is appropriate because the applicant's offending is an ongoing fraudulent course of conduct, and although the monetary amount involved in each case differs somewhat, the criminal behaviour embraced in each individual offence is ""strikingly similar"":  Day at [24].  For this reason, and to preserve some relativity with Count 1, I propose a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months in respect of each of Counts 2 to 9.  
48I turn then to consider questions of cumulation, concurrency and the totality of criminality. Thicy, on one view, would permit me to run all these sentences concurrently.  However, in my view such an approach would not properly reflect the criminality of each matter, nor recognise the losses, financial and emotional, suffered by each victim.  The application of the principles discussed in Pearce in my view calls for a significant degree of partial accumulation.  I propose to group Counts 2 to 4 concurrently, and to accumulate those sentences on the sentence for Count 1, commencing them on 16th of December 2013.  I will also run the sentences for Counts 5 to 7 concurrently, but partially accumulating them on the sentences for Counts 2 to 4, commencing this group of sentences on the 16th December 2015. The sentences for counts 8 and 9 will also be served concurrently, and partially accumulated to commence on 16th June 2017.
49The last of the sentences I have proposed would expire on 15th December 2020, a total effective term of imprisonment of 9 years. In accordance with s.19AB Crimes Act, I would fix a single non-parole period. Maintaining the relativities fixed by the sentencing judge to take account of the applicant's subjective case, including the possibility, such as it may be, of rehabilitation, suggests a non-parole period of nearly 5 years and 5 months, which I would round up. 
50It may be said, with some force, that re-sentencing the applicant in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraphs amounts to ""tinkering"", a process which this Court firmly eschews. Such a conclusion would support leaving the sentence as is, error of principle notwithstanding. I have anxiously considered this, and concluded that the better view is that the error of fundamental principle should be corrected, and the applicant accorded whatever reduction in imprisonment flows from being sentenced according to law. In so saying I remain conscious that sentencing a given offender for a particular offence is not a process calculated to produce a single correct result: minds may reasonably differ. Nonetheless only one sentence may be imposed. And it must be imposed by the application of ""proper principle"": Pearce at 624[46].
51It follows from this that I am of the opinion that a lesser sentence than that passed by the sentencing judge is warranted in law.
52The orders I propose are:
(1)Grant leave to appeal;
(2)Appeal allowed;
(3)Quash the sentences passed on the applicant in the District Court and instead sentence the applicant as follows:
(a)In respect of Count 1, a term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 16th December 2011 and expiring on 15th December 2015;
(b)    In respect of each of Counts 2, 3 and 4, a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 16th December 2013 and expiring on 15th June 2017;
(c)In respect of each of Counts 5, 6, and 7, a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 16th December 2015 and expiring on 15th June 2019;
(d)In respect of each of Counts 8, and 9, a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 16th June 2017 and expiring on 15th December 2020;
(e)Pursuant to s.19AB Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), I fix a single non-parole period of 5 years and 5 months commencing on 16th December 2011 and expiring on 15th May 2017. The applicant will be eligible for release after 15th May 2017.

2762053,R v Ravindran (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1055,"ex tempore JUDGMENT 
1In a careful, well-prepared and thoughtful submission, Mr Russell and Mr Randle of counsel who appear for the accused have submitted that this is an appropriate case for me, in a judge alone trial, to remind myself of the judgment of Chief Justice King in The Queen v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161 and exercise my undoubted power to terminate the trial now and bring in a decision that the accused is not guilty of the crime of murder with which he is charged.
2In Prasad at page 163 Chief Justice King said the following: 
Where there is evidence which, if accepted, is capable in law of proving the charge, a direction to bring in a verdict of not guilty would be, in my view, a usurpation of the rights and the function of the jury. I think that there is a clear distinction for this purpose between a trial before a magistrate or other court which is the judge of both law and facts and a trial by judge and jury. I have no doubt that a tribunal which is the judge of both law and fact may dismiss a charge at any time after the close of the case for the prosecution, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which the defendant could lawfully be convicted, if that tribunal considers that the evidence is so lacking in weight and reliability that no reasonable tribunal could safely convict on it. This power is analogous to the power of the jury, as judges of the facts, to bring in a verdict of not guilty at any time after the close of the prosecution's case.

3In a case where there is a trial before a judge and jury, counsel sometimes ask for a direction to the jury in accordance with that dictum of Chief Justice King, usually referred to as a ""Prasad direction"".
4It has also been observed in cases of authority that the occasions for giving such a direction are likely to arise infrequently, and that if the giving of the direction requires a deal of elaboration on the part of the trial judge, probably such an occasion has not arisen. 
5The present case certainly has some unusual features. The case for the Crown is that the accused murdered his father by striking him very forcibly with a baseball bat and by strangling him using a length of rope as a ligature.
6The case is necessarily put in that complex way because the expert evidence before me is that the injuries suffered by the deceased, which led to his death, cannot be explained by a single mechanism of infliction.
7Moreover, the accused has given an account of what happened to his father on the day his father died, especially to persons associated with the Ambulance Service, which has become, inevitably perhaps, a focus of the evidence led before me, as the issues in this trial have been fought out between the parties. That account - and I summarise it but briefly - is that he came upon his father hanging from a bolt in a beam in the ceiling of his father's bedroom, and believed him to have committed suicide by hanging.  He lifted his father's body down from a make-shift platform, or scaffold, which, implicitly in this account, his father had erected for the purpose of facilitating his own demise, laying him on the bed. He was so overcome by passion, I use the word neutrally, because his father had abandoned him in this way, that he took a baseball bat and struck his father at least twice, but perhaps more than twice, to and about his head. At the time he inflicted these blows he believed his father was dead.
8Without going into the matter in great detail, there is now a great deal of common ground amongst the experts who have given evidence either orally or in report form before me. A previously apparent issue between the two forensic pathologists has disappeared because of an exchange of reports between the parties in the weeks leading up to the trial.
9But it is now apparent to me, and this forms a significant part of the foundation for the application, that the experts agree that a large proportion of the injuries that led to the death of the deceased, at least as a possibility, could have been inflicted as a result of him attempting to hang himself, consistently with the account given by the accused to the ambulance officers.
10There are other aspects of the expert evidence which are relevant to the determination of the question whether, in this case, the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the murder of his father, which, if I reject the present application, I will need to carefully consider when the time comes for making a final decision.
11However, Mr Russell and Mr Randle say that the significance of the common ground between the forensic pathologists is that the Crown cannot prove what they have referred to as an indispensable intermediate fact to make good the Crown circumstantial case beyond reasonable doubt.  That indispensable intermediate fact is, according to the careful argument of counsel, the exclusion of the consideration, even as a possibility, that the deceased attempted to hang himself.  The real significance of that fact, as I understand the argument put to me at this stage, is that the Crown cannot exclude that at the time the blows were struck, which may have contributed to the death of the deceased, the accused believed that the deceased was already dead.
12As far as the elements of murder are concerned, there is no real issue in the case, as I understand the evidence so far, that the accused voluntarily did an act that caused, in the sense that it significantly contributed to, the death of the deceased, and that that act was the act of striking him about the throat with a baseball bat.
13What is very much in issue is whether at the time of the commission of that act the accused intended to kill, or to cause really serious physical injury to, the deceased. 
14On the basis of the way the case has been opened, and fought, no question of recklessness arises in this particular case. The indispensable intermediate fact that needs to be proved is the exclusion of an attempt at suicide if the Crown is to prove the necessary intent.
15There are, as I have said, a number of other issues. Consistently with authority counsel for the accused accept that there is no occasion for me to direct myself to acquit the accused for a want of evidence on the part of the Crown. Counsel accept there is a legal sufficiency of evidence to support a verdict. The real issue is whether the proofs put forward by the Crown are so lacking in weight and reliability that no reasonable tribunal could safely convict on it.
16Whilst acknowledging the force of the submission, I am not satisfied that the Crown case is so lacking in weight and reliability that a conviction could not reasonably be made on the basis of it.
17In expressing this view, I am, of course, exercising no judgment whatsoever, one way or the other, about the critical issue of whether the Crown has actually proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of murder.
18It seems to me, however, that the complexity of the matter is such that I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate case for me to make a decision on a more or less summary basis.
19My mind remains entirely open on the question whether the Crown has discharged the stringent and heavy onus of proof that rests upon it in a serious criminal charge.  I am simply unpersuaded that the Crown evidence is so lacking in weight and reliability that no reasonable tribunal could safely convict on it. 
20For those reasons, having been reminded of my right as the tribunal of fact to terminate the case now by way of acquittal, I decline to accede to the application that I should do so.

		06 August 2013",2013-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762083,Stewart v R [2013] NSWCCA 185,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentences passed on him in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge Garling on 13 April 2012.

2The applicant pleaded guilty to seven counts on an indictment. He asked the court to take into account four additional offences on a Form 1 when dealing with him for the third count.

3After sentencing the applicant at the conclusion of a careful explanation of all the facts, matters and circumstances which his Honour considered bore upon fixing the appropriate sentences for the offences and this offender, the sentencing judge said:

""You have been sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of sixteen years with a non-parole period of ten years.""

4In fact, his Honour was mistaken as to the effect of the sentences he had imposed. As became apparent from the Crown's particulars of trial filed on 6 May 2013, two days before the hearing of the appeal, the total effective sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge was not imprisonment for 16 years but imprisonment for 14 years and 6 months commencing on 24 November 2010 and expiring on 23 May 2025, with a non-parole period of 10 years expiring on 23 November 2020. 

5A co-offender (the principal co-offender) who pleaded guilty to the same counts as the applicant was sentenced to a total effective term of imprisonment of 15 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. A second co-offender who pleaded guilty to four of the counts, but whose criminality was of a much lesser order, was sentenced by a different judge. This sentence was not the subject of submissions by the applicant and may be put aside. 

The grounds of appeal

6When the ramifications of the error in the learned sentencing judge's sentencing order became apparent at the hearing of the application, the grounds of appeal were amended, with leave, there being no objection by the Crown. The grounds ultimately pressed are in the following terms:

""Ground 1A: The applicant is entitled to relief because he did not receive parity in relation to the non-parole period as between himself and the co-offender.

Ground 3A: The non-parole period is crushing upon the offender, who is for the first time in gaol.""

The offences

7The offences related to two home invasions and other criminal conduct committed by the applicant in the course of those home invasions. The first home invasion occurred between 11 pm on 5 November 2010 and 2 am 6 November 2010. This was the subject of the first count on the indictment. Counts 2 to 7 arose out of a second home invasion, which occurred between 11 pm on 15 November 2010 and 3 am on 16 November 2010, as did the four Form 1 offences. The objective seriousness of each offence was of a high order. As the learned sentencing judge recognised, by the structure he adopted involving accumulation and concurrence of various sentences, the six counts arising out of the second home invasion contained common elements. The care his Honour took in devising this structure was directed to the avoidance of double punishment for the common elements: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 623 [40].

8The counts and the respective sentences imposed were as follows:

Count 1: Aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, Crimes Act 1900, s 112(2). Maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period: 5 years imprisonment.

Sentence: Imprisonment for 6 years and 3 months commencing on 24.11.10 and concluding on 23.2.17, with a non-parole period of 4 years concluding on 23.11.14.

Count 2: Specially aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, Crimes Act 1900, s 112(3). Maximum penalty: 25 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period: 7 years imprisonment.

Sentence: Imprisonment for 9 years commencing on 24.11.11 and concluding on 23.11.20, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months concluding 23.5.17.

Counts 3 & 4: Aggravated sexual assault in company, Crimes Act 1900, s 61JA. Maximum penalty: life imprisonment; standard non-parole period: 15 years imprisonment. 

Form 1: Aggravated indecent assault x 4, Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(1). Appurtenant to count 3. Maximum penalty: 7 years imprisonment.

Sentence (Form 1 taken into account on count 3): On each, imprisonment for 12 years commencing 24.5.13 and concluding 23.5.25, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months concluding on 23.11.20.

Count 5: Specially aggravated kidnapping, Crimes Act 1900, s 86(3). Maximum penalty: 25 years imprisonment.

Sentence: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years commencing 24.11.10 and concluding 23.11.14.

Counts 6 & 7: Aggravated kidnapping, Crimes Act 1900, s 86(2). Maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment.

Sentence: On each, imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years commencing on 24.11.10 and concluding 23.11.13. 

Total effective sentence: Imprisonment for 14 years and 6 months commencing on 24.11.10 and concluding on 23.5.25, with a non-parole period of 10 years concluding on 23.11.20, on which date he is eligible to be released to parole.

9The structure of the sentences may be represented diagrammatically as follows:
 

 

Summary of facts

10The male occupier of the home invaded was a drug dealer who grew cannabis hydroponically for the purpose of supply on the retail market. The applicant and the principal co-offender were armed with a metallic baseball bat and a jemmy bar respectively. They roused the occupier from sleep by banging at the back door. They wore dark clothing and sought to hide their appearance with motorcycle helmets.

11The offenders removed a screen door and ordered the occupier to open the back door threatening to knock it in with their weapons. The occupier obeyed the order. When the offenders entered the home, the applicant knocked the occupier to the ground by striking him on the head with the baseball bat. Both offenders kicked, punched and, with their weapons, struck the victim demanding money, goods and drugs. The applicant stood guard over the victim while the co-offender ransacked the house. The applicant threatened to tie the victim up and cut off his finger. The offenders also threatened to sexually assault him if he did not disclose the location of the money and drugs. Whilst attempting to extract this information, the applicant armed himself with a hunting knife pushing the victim against a wall with the knife to his face, which lacerated his cheek. 

12In their ransacking search, the offenders came across a second occupant, a female, hiding behind the cupboard in her bedroom. She was not harmed on this occasion. Both occupants were detained in the bedroom. The telephone lines were cut. The offenders decamped with $15,000 in cash, the hunting knife and some other personal property. 

13The male victim did not report the incident to the police or seek medical attention for fear of exposure of his criminal enterprise.

14The applicant and principal co-offender returned to the same premises on 15 November 2010 having co-opted the third offender to assist them. This time the applicant was armed with a sawn-off shotgun and the principal co-offender with a baseball bat. The male and female who were the subject of the earlier offences were at the premises as was another woman who was visiting. Once again the offenders sought to disguise themselves with motorcycle helmets.

15Upon arrival at the premises the three offenders forced their way in by ripping the front screen-door completely off its hinges. The applicant knocked the male to the ground with the butt of the shotgun and forced the barrel into his mouth demanding money and valuables. He was punched and kicked, and bound with duct tape and repeatedly threatened that his fingers would be cut off. The male and the two women were held hostage in the dining room and again the house was ransacked. The applicant and the principal offender threatened the women with sexual violence.

16An antique shotgun was located on the premises. One of the co-offenders loaded the shotgun with a cartridge from the sawn-off shotgun, and pointed it at the male whilst making further demands for valuables. 

17The applicant indecently assaulted one of the women by pulling her underwear between her buttocks and cutting her blouse open with a knife. These are the first two offences on the Form 1. Later the other woman was indecently assaulted when her breasts and crotch were grabbed on the outside of her clothing. These are the third and fourth offences on the Form 1.

18Meanwhile, the principal co-offender was in the kitchen threatening the male occupant. It appears that the applicant joined the principal co-offender, as the sentencing judge next recorded that the offenders held a knife against the male victim's fingers and threatened to cut them off. One of his fingers was dislocated. 

19One of the offenders said the male victim's fingers would not be cut off if the woman who was visiting the premises agreed to perform sexual acts. She agreed. Non-consensual oral and penile penetration were then committed by the applicant and the principal co-offender. These acts comprised the third and fourth counts respectively on the indictment. The third offender did not participate in these offences and sought to protect the woman from the other two offenders. After the sexual assaults, the applicant stabbed the male victim in the right arm.

20The offenders decamped with a crossbow, the antique shotgun, $200 in cash and a purse.

21The sexual assaults were reported to the police by the woman who was visiting the premises. From her complaint, police learned of the home invasion and attended the premises, obtaining an account from the male victim of both home invasions and an admission of his own criminal activity.

22The police identified the principal co-offender and arrested him on 20 November 2010. Apparently he did not inform on the applicant or the third co-offender but provided information and assistance to the police about unrelated matters.

23The applicant surrendered to police on 24 November 2010 and made full admissions.

24In her victim impact statement, the sexual assault victim who complained to the police spoke of the severe emotional effects she suffered as a result of what happened to her. All of her major personal relationships, with her mother, her daughter and her new partner were, and are, severely disrupted.

Applicant's personal circumstances

25The applicant was aged 24 years and 11 months at the time of the offending. He and his long time partner have three children. Two other children were stillborn.

26The applicant had an extremely disadvantaged upbringing. He had a violent father who had a significant criminal history. The applicant's mother left the relationship when the applicant was about 11 years of age. After that, the applicant mainly lived with his father, but sometimes with other relatives.

27The applicant left school during Year 7. Although his employment history was somewhat sporadic, evidence from persons with whom he had been employed indicated that he was a hard working, conscientious and reliable employee when in work.

28The applicant had a criminal record, although the trial judge considered it was not significant, being mostly 'destroy or damage property' offences. His previous offending had not attracted a term of imprisonment. At the time of this offending, the applicant was abusing alcohol and cannabis, but he was unaccustomed to the ""ice"" the principal co-offender had supplied to him prior to the second home invasion. At his age, voluntary intoxication does not mitigate his offending, but may help explain it: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at 382 [178] per Spigelman CJ, at 396 [265] per Wood CJ at CL, at 409 [331] per Hulme J, and at 413 [348]-[349] per Simpson J.

29His Honour found that the applicant had shown remorse, and had apologised to his victims. However, as his Honour noted, the evidence from a psychologist was that the applicant had a moderate to high risk of re-offending.

30His Honour also noted that the applicant had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. His Honour referred to the applicant's early plea of guilty and allowed a 25 per cent discount for the plea. His Honour found special circumstances on the basis of his need for rehabilitation and the consideration that this would be his first time in gaol.

31The principal co-offender was also allowed a 25 per cent discount for the plea and an additional 15 per cent for his assistance to police. 

The sentencing judge's consideration of the parity issue

32In sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge stated, at 11:

""The offenders must be punished in such a way that they realise that they cannot act in this way but, more importantly, that others in the community realise that if they act in this way they will be sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. Each of the offences is very serious. One only needs to look at the maximum sentence laid down by Parliament for each of these offences.""

33His Honour then stated, at 13:

""I have to assess the part played by each of the offenders and the difference, particularly in subjective matters. The two offenders acted jointly and each is responsible for what happened. When I looked at the facts and the various actions, each of them acted in a very cruel way, each of them, on various occasions, carried out acts the subject of the offences, each of them had, in my view, a similar degree of criminality. When I read what went on, I concluded that there was not a lot of difference between what they did. The sexual assault by [the main co-offender] would be usually defined at a higher category than the sexual assault by [the applicant], but they were both involved in each.""

The applicant does not challenge these findings.

34At 13-14, his Honour further remarked:

""... when I turned to the subjective matters, then if I was just sentencing on those alone, without the fifteen per cent discount [afforded the principal co-offender for assistance], I would have given [the principal co-offender] a higher sentence, significantly because of his previous offence, the fact that it is aggravated by him committing this offence whilst on parole, and his significantly different criminal antecedents which bring with it the fact he had served [a] gaol term before. [The applicant] had not. 

In formulating these sentences I have had to have regard to the principle of totality. They are most difficult sentences to formulate keeping that principle in mind. In addition, I have to look at the parity question between the two offenders and attempt to sentence in accordance with that principle. The end result is that some of the non-parole periods are different to those which I may have imposed had I been sentencing for a single offence but, in the end, I believe I have achieved who I set out to do, that is, to sentence to an overall head sentence and non-parole period which I believe is appropriate in each case.""

In effect, his Honour indicated that the difference in the effective sentences to be imposed was to be attributed to the additional discount afforded the main co-offender for his assistance to authorities. 

Submissions on appeal

35The grounds of appeal raised two short points. First, Mr P Segal of counsel, who appeared for the applicant, submitted that notwithstanding the care taken in structuring the sentences, the disparity between the effective non-parole periods for the applicant and the principal co-offender was not explained by the 15 per cent discount afforded to the principal co-offender. 

36He submitted that the principal co-offender's criminal antecedents and the fact that he had committed the various offences whilst on parole justified a finding that the objective seriousness of his offending was aggravated in a way that the applicant's was not. It was submitted that, at best, when regard was had to the applicant's criminal antecedents, which, as mentioned, the sentencing judge found were not significant, the discount for assistance operated to produce some relative parity. This was reflected in the total effective sentences of 15 years for the principal co-offender, and 14 years and 6 months for the applicant (absent the error identified in [4] above). That parity was, however, lost in fixing the effective non-parole period for each offender, because the non-parole period was wrongly set against a total sentence of 16 years and not the correctly calculated sentence of 14 years 6 months, resulting in the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance. Counsel submitted that, if anything, the applicant's stronger subjective case might have been expected to attract additional leniency in fixing the non-parole period.

37The second matter was that raised in Ground 3A. Mr Segal argued that ten years in jail was ""too long"" and the sentence was ""crushing"". The submission, in substance, was that the sentence was manifestly excessive and, accordingly, ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". 

38The Crown accepted that the error in the pronouncement of the sentencing order made it necessary for this court to re-sentence the applicant. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that the judge's sentencing remarks and the structure of the sentences imposed strongly suggested that his Honour intended to alter the statutory proportion between the effective non-parole period and the total effective sentence in a roughly even way as between the applicant and the principal co-offender: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 44(2). 

39In the case of the principal co-offender, the relationship between the effective non-parole period and the balance of term was 60 per cent, and in the case of the applicant, but with the error, approximately 62.5 per cent. This was reflective of his Honour's statement ""there will be a difference in sentences, mainly because of the percentage I have to deduct from [the main co-offender's] sentence"". The Crown submitted that this statement explained why the principal co-offender received a slightly more favourable outcome in terms of the statutory proportion. The Crown accepted that the non-parole period for the applicant ought to be 62.5 per cent of the true total effective sentence of 14 years and 6 months. The Crown contended that a minimum effective term of 9 years approximated that arithmetical outcome.

40In relation to the second ground, the Crown argued the sentence was not crushing. The Crown submitted that the need for a necessary proportion between crime and punishment demanded a relatively long period of imprisonment, notwithstanding the applicant's subjective case. 

Consideration

41Given the summary of the offending conduct, it could not be gainsaid that the objective seriousness of the offending of each of the applicant and the principal co-offender called for stern and condign punishment regardless of their subjective circumstances. To put it another way, the necessity for ""reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime"", whatever the strength of the subjective case of the offenders, required stern punishment: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 556; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.

42In view of the concession made by the Crown, it is necessary that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be allowed (at least in part) and that this Court proceed to re-sentence the applicant, so as to take account of the sentencing judge's mathematical error. The question remains, however, whether the applicant has made out any of his grounds of appeal and, if so, what effect, if any, that will have on the sentence that ought to be imposed.

43Ground 1A was directed to the parity principle. The parity principle is an aspect of equal justice: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 472 [28]; 474 [31]; 476 [33] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. In Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610 Gibbs CJ said:

""The reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.""

44In Green and Quinn, the plurality, having cited this passage, added:

""The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise."" (Citations omitted).

45The parity principle is one of the pillars underpinning sentencing law: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 128 [18]. These pillars support the whole sentencing task. To put it another way, the principles permeate the whole process. As the Court put it in Muldrock, at 128 [17]:

""It ... remains, essential to recognise, however, that the fixing of a non-parole period is but one part of the larger task of passing an appropriate sentence upon the particular offender. Fixing the appropriate non-parole period is not to be treated as if it were the necessary starting point or the only important end-point in framing a sentence ..."" 

46The non-parole period represents the minimum period which the sentencing court adjudges that justice requires an offender to spend in gaol for his or her other offending. But, subject, importantly, to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 44, the length of the non-parole period may be fixed by reference to subjective factors of a kind that may justify disparity between sentences imposed upon offenders who committed the same offence. Nonetheless, all other things being equal, disparity in the non-parole period, or indeed, in the relationship between the non-parole period and the total effective term, may give rise to the requisite justifiable sense of grievance, such as to call for appellate intervention. General sentencing principles guide all relevant steps in the sentencing process: R v Hampton (1998) 44 NSWLR 729 at 732. 

47Reading the sentencing judge's reasons as a whole, it appears that in general terms his Honour intended to treat the applicant and the principal co-offender more or less equally, notwithstanding the language highlighted by the Crown as suggesting reasons for a slightly lower sentence for the principal co-offender. His Honour was well aware, and stressed, that the applicant's subjective case in the ordinary course entitled him to somewhat more leniency than the principal co-offender. What made a difference to this assessment was the additional discount to which the principal co-offender was entitled for his assistance. Reading the reasons as a whole, it appears that this factor, not present in the applicant's case, brought the sentence imposed upon the principal co-offender into parity with the sentence imposed upon the applicant.

48For that reason, the Court has concluded that his Honour did not intend to differentiate between the applicant and the principal co-offender so as to fix a total non-parole period that was 60 per cent of the total effective sentence in the case of the principal co-offender and 62.5 per cent of the total effective sentence in the case of the applicant. Rather, we consider that his Honour intended that each of them was to have the opportunity of spending 6 years on parole. This explains the non-parole period of 9 years fixed against a total sentence of 15 years in the case of the main co-offender, and the 10 year non-parole period fixed against a total of 16 years pronounced in the case of the applicant. To work on the basis of a 2.5 per cent difference imbues the exercise with an artificial air of precision which should be eschewed. We would add that the finding of special circumstances in the case of the principal co-offender was, in the Court's view, a most favourable one. However, there is no appeal against that finding so that the Court is obliged to act upon the sentence that was imposed. That sentence was not one which could be characterised as so inadequate so as not to be an appropriate comparator for the purposes of these principles: see Green and Quinn especially at [33]. 

49Accordingly, the applicant has established error in respect of this ground of appeal, although the error is essentially a function of his Honour's mathematical error. 

Ground 3A

50In support of Ground 3A, Mr Segal referred to R v Rossi (1988) 142 LSJS 451. In that case, King CJ referred to a very long head sentence of almost 30 years as being ""so long indeed ... to be properly characterised as a crushing head sentence"". His Honour explained the relevant principle in the following terms:

""There is a principle of sentencing known as the principle of totality, which enables a court to mitigate what strict justice would otherwise indicate, where the total effect of the sentences merited by the individual crimes become so crushing as to call for the merciful intervention of the court by way of reducing the total effect."" (Citation omitted)

51The Court is not persuaded that the individual sentences or the total effective sentence are manifestly excessive. 

52The sentences imposed are certainly stern, but not so stern as to merit the description ""crushing"". The sentence imposed is the product of an instinctive synthesis, by which is meant, as McHugh J explained in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 378:

""[T]he judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case."" 

His Honour's approach was unanimously approved and applied by the High Court in Muldrock at [26].

Re-sentencing the applicant

53By way of correction of his Honour's mistake, the 6 year period for parole should remain intact. It follows from this that the same finding as to special circumstances should be made as was made by the sentencing judge. Six years is a long time on parole and the period of effective parole supervision will be 3 years: see the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008, cl 228. But doubtless the sentencing judge had in mind, given the relative youth of each of the offenders, to enhance his prospects of rehabilitation, that he should be given an opportunity of demonstrating his capacity to be of good behaviour over that extended period. The Court considers there is merit in that approach in the applicant's case, as an ongoing incentive in his personal rehabilitation. 

54Accordingly, the Court proposes to re-sentence the applicant so that he first becomes eligible for parole after a period of 8 years and 6 months, leaving the total effective sentence actually fixed, but not pronounced, at 14 years and 6 months. This can best be achieved by reducing the non-parole period for the concurrent sentences for counts 3 and 4 from 7 years and 6 months to 6 years. To be clear, the head sentence will remain one of 12 years.

55This approach leaves the overall structure of his Honour's approach intact. In particular, the degree of accumulation and concurrency between the sentences for counts 3 and 4 and count 2 remains. The overlap is still one of 4 years, in accordance with the sentencing judge's structure. As stated above, at [7], this takes account of the need to avoid double punishment for the common elements of these respective counts. Bearing in mind the principle of totality there remains a minimum, additional period of 2 years which must be served in prison for counts 3 and 4. 

56Whilst the question of whether the applicant will be granted parole after the expiration of the non-parole period is one for the executive branch of government, one should not overlook the consideration that it is not a foregone conclusion. At the same time, if the applicant is granted parole when first eligible, any serious breach of parole (in particular, offences of violence) would likely see the parole order revoked with the consequence that he will be at risk of being returned to gaol to serve the balance of his term. For the reasons stated at [53], it will be salutary for the applicant to face that reality for a period as long as six years.

57The Court makes the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted;

2. Appeal allowed in part;

3. Confirm the sentences imposed in the District Court in respect of count 1, count 2, count 5, count 6 and count 7;

4. Quash the sentences imposed for counts 3 and 4 and instead sentence the applicant, taking into account the Form 1 offences on count 3, to a non-parole period of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 24 May 2013 and expiring on 23 May 2019, with a balance of term of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 24 May 2019 and expiring on 23 May 2025; the earliest date for release on parole being 24 May 2019.

2762087,Office of State Revenue v El Kazzi (No. 1) [2013] NSWLC 18,"Judgment

Background
1The accused (""the applicant"") is charged with offences arising out of alleged false statements relating to an application for the First Home Owners Grant and related stamp duty exemption and also to false statements to officers of the Office of State Revenue (""OSR"") during an investigation into her grant and stamp duty exemption. Additionally, there are offences relating to the failure to comply with conditions of the grant and stamp duty exemption. 

2On 28 June 2012 the OSR commenced these proceedings by the issue of ten Court Attendance notices (""the CANs""). The applicant has entered a plea of not guilty but seeks a permanent stay of the proceedings on a number of grounds and objects to the form of the CANs on the grounds of duplicity.

The Charges 
3The applicant is charged with the following: 
(1)Making a statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage, knowing it to be false or misleading in a material particular: s 178BB(1) Crimes Act 1900 - committed on 23 September 2008.
(2)Making a statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage, knowing it to be false or misleading in a material particular: s 178BB(1) Crimes Act 1900 - committed on 15 February 2010.
(3)Willfully and corruptly making and subscribing a statutory declaration knowing it to be untrue in a material particular and deriving a material benefit as a consequence: s 25A Oaths Act 1900 - committed on 15 February 2010.
(4)Making a statement in writing to a tax officer for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 knowing it to be false or misleading in a material particular: s 55(a) Taxation Administration Act 1996 - committed on or about 15 February 2010.
(5)Making a statement in writing to an authorised officer for the purposes of the First Home Owners Grant Act 2000 knowing it to be false or misleading in a material particular: s 44(1)(a) First Home Owners Grant Act 2000 - committed on or about 15 February 2010.
(6)Dishonestly making a statement false or misleading in a material particular intending to obtain a financial advantage: s 192G(b) Crimes Act 1900 - committed 27 April 2010.
(7)Making a statement in writing to an authorised officer for the purposes of the First Home Owners Grant Act 2000 knowing it to be false or misleading in a material particular: s 44(1)(a) First Home Owners Grant Act 2000 - committed between 27 April 2010 and 12 May 2010.
(8)Making a statement in writing to a tax officer for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 knowing it to be false or misleading in a material particular: s 55(a) Taxation Administration Act 1996 - committed between 27 April 2010 and 12 May 2010.
(9)Failing to comply with a condition of exemption from duty under the First Home Owners Grant Scheme and failing to give written notice or repay the duty within 14 days: s 76A(4) First Home Owners Grant Act 2000 - committed on 30 October 2009.
(10)Failing to comply with a condition of the First Home Owners Grant and failing to give written notice or repay the grant within 14 days: s 20(4) First Home Owners Grant Act 2000 - committed on 30 October 2009.

Agreed Facts for the Stay Application
4The parties provided agreed facts for the purpose of legal argument on the stay application. 

5Briefly put, the applicant entered into an agreement to purchase for $350,000 the purchase of a three-bedroom unit at an address in Liverpool, in respect of which she signed applications for financial concessions available under the First Home Owner Grant Act 2000 (the FHOG Act) to persons acquiring their first home. Those concessions require as a condition of eligibility that an applicant live in the property for at least a continuous period of six months within twelve months of the date of purchase. 

6The applicant made applications for (i) an exemption or concession from the payment of stamp duty that would otherwise have been payable, and (ii) the payment of a one-off $7,000 First Home Owners Grant. Both were approved by the Office of State Revenue. The applicant received an exemption from stamp duty to the value of $11,242 and was paid a $7,000 grant. 

7At the time of the applicant's purchase, the property was subject to a rental tenancy, which ended about four months later. Shortly thereafter the applicant entered into a rental agreement with another tenant.

8Following the 12-month residency period, the OSR wrote to notify the applicant of its investigation into whether she had met the eligibility requirements for the grant and duty exemption. The applicant completed a statutory declaration indicating she had occupied the property for eight months within the residency period. She later wrote to the OSR to indicate she and her husband had lived in the property for six months, but had spent about four nights per week at her parents' home for various reasons, and had rented out two of the three bedrooms of the property to assist servicing her mortgage. 

9The OSR determined to reverse its decision to pay the applicant the grant and allow the duty exemption, and issued notices of assessment requiring the payment of the grant and duty amounts plus penalties amounting to 60 percent of each, to a total of $29,186. The applicant paid those amounts. She subsequently lodged an objection to the OSR's decision, but then withdrew it and sold the property. 

The accused's grounds
10The applicant relies upon the following grounds:
Ground One: The proceedings involve ""vexing"" the applicant twice for the same purported offending behaviour and in doing so breach the principles enunciated in Pearce. 
Ground Two: the FHOG Act does not contemplate that proceedings for contraventions against the Act will be brought under the Crimes Act. The laying of charges under the NSW Crimes Act, is therefore beyond power of the informant and beyond the legislative intention of the Act. 
Ground Three: prosecutorial abuse at the investigation phase of the proceedings is such that the Court would stay the proceedings. 
Ground Four: The charges are in breach of Prosecutorial discretion to lay charges that are not in breach of Pearce. The charges are in breach of the strict ""double jeopardy"" principle of Pearce. 
Ground 5: The charges further undermine the principles in Pearce which places a responsibility on a prosecutor to fairly frame charges. This principle was considered recently in the VCA decision of Joud where the Court upheld a permanents stay of proceedings on the basis of substantial overlap of charges and the Prosecutor's decision to lay the charges in the manner that he did.

11The accused also submits that CANs 1 and 4 -10 are void for duplicity. The Court will separately publish its decision on the duplicity issue.

Relevant principles for the grant of a permanent stay
12Relevantly, the principles governing the stay of proceedings broadly are:
(a)The Local Court has power to stay proceedings by necessary implication as it is required to enable the Court to effectively exercise its jurisdiction: see Pelechowski v The Registrar; Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19 at [50]-[51]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Shirvanian (1998) 44 NSWLR 129 at 134-137.

(b)The justification for a stay is to prevent the court process being employed in a manner inconsistent with the recognised purpose of the administration of criminal proceedings and so constituting an abuse of process: per Mason CJ in Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 30.

(c)A stay will only be granted in an extreme case and the fundamental defect which warrants a stay must be such that there is nothing a trial judge can do to relieve against its unfair consequences: The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605. Both Jago and Glennon were more recently followed in R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42 at [110]. In Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 the High Court accepted that, before making an order staying proceedings, the correctness of the earlier Court of Appeal's statement that a court ""would only be so satisfied in an exceptional or extreme case"" at [22].

(d)The purpose of such a power is not only to prevent a relevant unfairness to a party but also that the continuation of the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people: Walton v Gardiner at 393 following Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1992) AC 529 at 536. See also the comments of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27; (2006) 225 CLR 256 at [7]-[8], where their Honours, after noting the circumstances in which proceedings will constitute an abuse of process are not exhaustively defined, referred to the two fundamental policy considerations affecting abuse of process in criminal proceedings: firstly ""the public interest in the administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring that its processes are used fairly by State citizen alike"", and secondly the failure by the court to so function ""will lead to an erosion of public confidence by reason of concern that the court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice.""

(e)The exercise of the power extends to all of the practices and procedures of the courts (see Walton v Gardiner at [23]) 

(f)The principle of ""double jeopardy"" can have a wider application than autrefois acquit or autrefois convict and applies at various stages of the criminal justice process: prosecution, conviction and punishment: Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [9]; Gummow J at [64] and [68]; Kirby J at [91] and [119-120]; Director-General of the Department of Land and Water Conservation v Greentree & Anor [2003] NSWCCA 31 at [94], [109]; and even applies to proceedings before a Tribunal when considering penalty: Hagipantelis v Legal Services Commissioner [2010] NSWCA 79 at [47]-[48].

(g)Where the offences are different and although arising out of the same event or series of events there can be no double jeopardy: Pearce at [31]; Greentree at [109]. In Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58, the Court of Criminal Appeal on a sentence appeal, having said that if a permanent stay had been sought before the sentencing judge it could not have been refused, said at [17] that while ""a person can by the one act commit two offences"" and ""where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences"", it was ""oppressive"" to charge the applicant with two offences where they did not involve separate acts of criminality that warranted separate charges and penalties, but rather one offence was encompassed within the other. 

(h)There may be cases in which the repeated prosecution of an offender in circumstances where that offender has no plea in bar available would be an abuse of process: Pearce at [29-31] following Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251. 

(i)The decision about what charges should be laid is for the prosecution: Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501; Pearce at [30] where McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said:

Ordinarily, prosecuting authorities will seek to ensure that all offences that are to be charged as arising out of one event or series of events are preferred and dealt with at the one time. Nothing we say should be understood as detracting from that practice or from the equally important proposition that prosecuting authorities should not multiply charges unnecessarily.

(j)The decisions of a prosecutor are ordinarily exempt from a court's superintendence and it is not for a court to substitute its general sense of ""fairness"", and special circumstances are required before the court exercises its power such as ""if oppression of, or prejudice to, an accused person can be demonstrated, the provision of a stay of proceedings upon the offending indictment, or count of the indictment, is warranted"": Pearce per Kirby J at [117]. More recently the High Court in Elias v The Queen; Issa v The Queen [2013] HCA 31 again re-affirmed this principle at [34-35].

(k)There need not be oppressive conduct or any moral delinquency on the part of a party, rather what is decisive is the objective effect of the continuation of the proceedings: Batistatos at [69-70].

(l)Concerning the issue of ""double punishment"", McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce said at [36-37] (footnotes omitted):

36. First, in creating offences, legislatures must necessarily proscribe conduct by reference to particular elements. A complex act by an accused may contain all the elements of more than one offence. 
37. Secondly, it follows that to punish the whole of the accused's criminal conduct, there will be cases where more than one offence must be charged and punishment exacted for each.

(m)In Island Marine Limited v Filipowski [2006] HCA 30, Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ said of the application of the principle of double jeopardy in summary prosecutions (and this Court would add, indictable offences dealt with summarily) at [43]-[45] (footnotes omitted):

43.... As the criminal law has become more complex, and as the number of offences that may be dealt with summarily has increased, questions of double jeopardy have taken on greater significance. When criminal offences were relatively few and distinct, a single course of conduct would constitute but one offence. With the proliferation of overlapping and related statutory offences, a single allegedly criminal transaction will often yield numerous offences. 
44.That it is the values of double jeopardy that inform the rules about double prosecutions is most easily demonstrated by reference to summary prosecutions. First, a conviction in a court of summary jurisdiction does not invoke doctrines of merger by which there is the substitution of a new liability. The principles that are to be applied in considering cases of successive prosecutions in a court of summary jurisdiction are developed by analogy with the principles that govern the availability of pleas in bar in a court of record. They draw upon the values encompassed in the expression double jeopardy. 
45. Secondly, and no less importantly, a conviction or acquittal in a court of summary jurisdiction will be explained and supported by reasons. The bases on which a court of summary jurisdiction has acquitted or convicted of a charge are thus ascertainable. That is not always so when there has been trial by jury.

13Neither party has brought to the Court's attention nor is the Court aware of any authority on the material issue in these proceedings, namely whether the power to stay, extends to where there has been an exercise of an administrative power by a member of the Executive to impose a non-curial penalty and then subsequently commence criminal proceedings relating to at least part of that conduct. 

14In Walton v Gardiner Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said that ""there is plainly an analogy between the concept of abuse of process in relation to criminal proceedings and the concept of abuse of the Tribunal's process in relation to disciplinary proceedings"": at [26]. 

15An analogous situation arose in R v Adler [2004] NSWSC 108, where the accused sought a permanent stay because of an abuse of process on the grounds of double jeopardy. There was no dispute that the accused had already been punished by way of pecuniary penalty orders made in civil proceedings commenced by ASIC in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court and that the criminal conduct alleged in the criminal proceedings formed part of the conduct for which he was punished in the civil proceedings (at [109]). Justice James also accepted that the pecuniary penalty order made in the civil proceedings was penal in nature (at [110]). His Honour went on to determine at [111] that:
Because the elements of the criminal offences are in all cases different from the elements of the causes of action in the civil proceedings, no plea in bar is available to Mr Adler in the criminal proceedings. However, even though no plea in bar is available, the court still has power to grant a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground that they constitute an abuse of process. The power to grant a stay is a broad power and there is no closed list of categories of abuse of process.

16Justice James accepted the Crown's submissions that in that case the criminal offences were, because of their different elements, ""not merely different, but different in important respects, from all of the causes of action in the civil proceedings"", and served a different purpose to the civil causes of action insofar as: 
113 ... the purpose of the civil causes of action being to enforce the obligations of a director or an officer of a company or a person in a position to become involved in a contravention by a company of a civil penalty provision and to provide remedies for wrongs done against the company or its shareholders; whereas the purpose of the criminal offences is to protect the integrity of the market in shares in a company and to punish wrongs done to potential purchasers of shares in the company. 

17His Honour went on to say: 
115 In my opinion, assuming as against the Crown that the previous civil proceedings can be assimilated to criminal proceedings and the contraventions found in the civil proceedings can be regarded as ""offences,"" the Crown is entitled to rely on what McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in para 31 of their joint judgment in Pearce, that because ""the offences are different (and different in important respects) the laying of both charges could not be said to be vexatious or oppressive or for some improper or ulterior purpose."" 

See further his Honour's discussion at [116]-[127].

18In Joud & Ors v The Queen [2011] VSCA 158, Neave JA with Ashley and Weinberg JJ A agreeing succinctly summarised the principles and said at [88]-[91] (footnotes omitted):
""Conclusion on double jeopardy
88 The basis for the concept of double jeopardy has been discussed in a number of authorities. It can be summarised as follows: 
(a) Because the State's resources and power are greater than those of individuals, there is a danger that the power to prosecute may be used as an instrument of oppression. 
(b) There is a public interest in finally resolving disputes and a corresponding need to limit the scope for conflicting court decisions.
(c) The consequences of a criminal conviction are very serious and individuals should be protected from repeated or multiple prosecution and trial. (This is often expressed in the maxim that individuals ought not be twice vexed for one and the same cause.) 
(d) Orders and other solemn acts of the courts must be treated as incontrovertibly correct. 
(e) A cause of action is changed by judgment recovered in court into a matter of record, which is of a higher nature. 
(f) In Carroll, Gleeson CJ and Hayne JJ said that the principles which underpin the double jeopardy principle must be balanced against the desirability of prosecuting and justly punishing offenders for their criminal conduct. 
89 Australian courts have tended to take a relatively narrow view of circumstances in which criminal proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process, arising out of double jeopardy. In Pearce, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said that the statutory multiplication of offences means that a single course of conduct may give rise to different offences attracting different maximum penalties and that 'it follows that to punish the whole of the accused's criminal conduct, there will be cases where more than one offence must be charged and punishment exacted for each'. 
90 Their Honours observed that it may be desirable for a person to be charged with multiple offences, arising out of the same facts, because the principle in R v De Simoni prevents a person convicted of a lesser offence from being punished for conduct amounting to aggravation, which would have justified their conviction for a more serious offence. As I have said, counsel for the Crown submitted that it was appropriate to charge the applicants with conspiracy because the maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment. 
91 Despite the recognition in Pearce and Carroll that there is a power to stay proceedings to avoid the type of double jeopardy which may arise when a person is convicted of several offences arising out of the same facts, that power has been exercised very sparingly.""

Grounds One: ""vexing"" the applicant twice
Ground Four: breach of prosecutorial discretion to lay charges not in breach of Pearce 
Ground Five: prosecutorial responsibility to fairly frame charges 
19As these the submissions on these grounds are inextricably intertwined because of fact or principle it is appropriate to deal with them together. The applicant's primary submission is that ""No one should be vexed twice if it be proved to the court that it is for one and the same cause"": Pearce per Kirby J at [89] (but see the translated footnote [116]), and in doing so the court should adopt a broad approach: Joud at [112] and [141]. 

20The applicant submits she is now twice vexed by the current proceedings because the decision of the OSR in laying the ten CANs exposes her to double jeopardy in circumstances where she has already suffered a penalty for her offending behaviour, namely the imposition of $10,944 in penalties. Now, some four years later, to be submitted to criminal proceedings for the same dishonest behaviour for which she has already been punished amounts to an abuse of process. The double jeopardy, the applicant argues, arises from the investigation under s 34 of the FHOG Act by the OSR, and subsequent determination under s 45(2) by the Chief Commissioner that she had acted with ""dishonesty"". The Chief Commissioner then imposed a penalty equivalent to 60 percent of the dishonestly obtained grant of $7,000 ($4,200) and stamp duty exemption of $11,242 ($6,744). Those penalties were in addition to the requirement the repay the grant and pay the stamp duty. It is not submitted that the requirement to repay the grant or pay the stamp duty is a penalty or that she is being twice vexed on that account. It should be noted and the applicant in her submissions has made no reference to ss 26 and 27 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996, which are the relevant provision for the imposition of the stamp duty penalty. These provisions are discussed below.

21The crux of the applicant's twice vexed submission is that the finding by the Chief Commissioner that she acted ""dishonestly"" (s 45(2)) is given statutory effect by a certificate under s 4 (2) and is binding on the court as an incontrovertible fact that she acted ""dishonestly"". The applicant submits that the s 48(2) certificate has statutory force in court proceedings, such that it assumes elements of finality, similar to a curial decision, or at the very least, a finding of fact of dishonesty and punishment that the Court cannot exclude, reject or seek to go behind when dealing with proceedings for offences against the FHOG Act. Section 45 of the FHOG Act provides:
45 Power to require repayment and impose penalty 
(1) The Chief Commissioner may, by written notice, require an applicant (or former applicant) for a first home owner grant to repay an amount paid on the application if: 
(a) the amount was paid in error, or 
(b) the Chief Commissioner reverses the decision under which the amount was paid for any other reason. 
(2) If, as a result of an applicant's dishonesty, an amount is paid by way of a first home owner grant, the Chief Commissioner may, by the notice in which repayment is required or a separate notice, impose a penalty not exceeding the amount the applicant is required to repay.
...
48 Evidence 
(1) A certificate signed by the Chief Commissioner stating that a first home owner grant was paid to a person named in the certificate on a specified date is admissible in legal proceedings as evidence of the payment.
(2) A copy of a notice issued by the Chief Commissioner imposing a penalty under this Act is admissible in legal proceedings as evidence of the imposition of the penalty.
(3) A copy of a notice issued by the Chief Commissioner requiring the payment or repayment of a specified amount is admissible in legal proceedings as evidence: 
(a) that the requirement was made, and 
(b) that the amount specified in the notice was outstanding at the date of the notice. 

22If the interpretation of s 48(2) is to the effect of the applicant's submission that the court is bound to accept the Chief Commissioner's finding of ""dishonesty"" in determining the relevant charged offences then potentially a constitutional issue arises under s 75B of the Judiciary Act 1901 (Cth) to the extent it offends Chapter III of the Constitution: South Australia v Totani [2010] HCA 39; (2010) 242 CLR 1. The court need not decide that issue as the OSR has given an undertaking that it will not tender the s 48(2) certificate in the hearing on whether the charged offences are proved, although it reserves the right to tender that certificate (and properly so to the applicant's benefit) in any sentence proceedings. Without needing to determine the issue of the effect of the s 48(2) certificate it may well be argued that, as a matter of statutory construction, all the s 48(2) certificate does is to make admissible in any proceedings (for example civil proceedings to recover the penalties as a ""debt due to the Crown"" (s 46(1)(b), (5)) the fact, and no more, that it is ""evidence of the imposition of a penalty"" but not the finding of conduct; c.f. R v Adler at [124]. For the reasons that follow, the court finds that ""dishonesty"" is not an element of conduct that needs to be proved for the s178BB offences.

23While the applicant has made no reference to the nature of the stamp duty penalty, the court will proceed on the basis that she relies upon a similar double jeopardy argument for the Commissioner's decision to impose a penalty for the stamp duty as a finding was made that her conduct "" was caused wholly or partly by the intentional disregard"" (s 27(2)), given that the penalty was fixed at 60 percent. Sections 26 and 27 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 provide:
26 Penalty tax in respect of certain tax defaults 
(1) If a tax default occurs, the taxpayer is liable to pay penalty tax in addition to the amount of tax unpaid.
(2) Penalty tax imposed under this Division is in addition to interest.
(3) Penalty tax is not payable in respect of a tax default that consists of a failure to pay: 
(a) interest under Division 1, or 
(b) penalty tax previously imposed under this Division. 
27 Amount of penalty tax 
(1) The amount of penalty tax payable in respect of a tax default is 25% of the amount of tax unpaid, subject to this Division.
(2) The Chief Commissioner may increase the amount of penalty tax payable in respect of a tax default to 75% of the amount of tax unpaid if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the tax default was caused wholly or partly by the intentional disregard by the taxpayer (or a person acting on behalf of the taxpayer) of a taxation law.
(3) The Chief Commissioner may determine that no penalty tax is payable in respect of a tax default if the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that: 
(a) the taxpayer (or a person acting on behalf of the taxpayer) took reasonable care to comply with the taxation law, or 
(b) the tax default occurred solely because of circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control (or if a person acted on behalf of the taxpayer, because of circumstances beyond either the person's or the taxpayer's control) but not amounting to financial incapacity. 

24The applicant submits, which the OSR accepts, that the decision of the Chief Commissioner to impose the penalties was ""penal in nature"": c.f. R v Adler at [10]; Philpot v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue (RD) [2008] NSWADT 176; Calcaro v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue [2004] NSWADT 158. However, the OSR submits that the appropriate characteristic in each case is that the imposition of the penalties was civil in nature and the fact that the penalties have been imposed is properly to be taken into account at the sentencing stage. The court accepts the applicant's submission that the imposition of the penalties is still relevant as the recent trend of authority is not to make a formal distinction between a civil or criminal penalty. Rather, the focus is on the purpose of the penalty, including punishment for the offending conduct and while civil penalties are protective in nature they can include elements of retribution, deterrence, reformation, mitigation, contrition and the protection of the public in determining the relevant civil penalty: see Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 49; 216 CLR 161 per Hayne J at [114] and [119]; Kirby J at [64] and [67]; Rich v Australian Securities and investments Commission [2004] HCA 42; 220 CLR 129 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [21]-[22], [35] and [37]; McHugh J at [41], [51]-[52], and [56].

The critical issue in this matter is whether the current proceedings expose the applicant to being twice vexed for the same dishonest behaviour in the true sense of double jeopardy at the prosecution stage. If the applicant is not twice vexed it does not dispose of the applicant's contention that she is being twice punished within the meaning of the Pearce principles, or that the proceedings are otherwise an abuse of process because of oppression or the conduct of the prosecutor: c.f. R v Adler at [125] and [127] (although the Court notes that the FHOG Act does not contain an equivalent provision to s 1317 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)).

25The applicant submits the court should have regard to the following matters which she says would have been considerations before the Executive in assessing the punishment extracted by the s 45(2) penalties and to now be the subjected to criminal proceedings for the same amounts to an abuse of process because she is being twice vexed within the meaning of Pearce:
(a) A young woman of 21 years age subject to a lengthy investigation by the OSR. This investigation included being subjected to numerous telephone calls about her affairs, questions asked of her of a private manner. 

(b)She was subject to the requirement to produce documents at the request of authorized officers on pain of punishment

(c)After a lengthy investigation, the Commissioner made a finding pursuant to s 45(2) of the FHOG Act that she had obtained her grant dishonestly.

(d)This finding is authorized by law and is in effect a declaration of dishonesty by the State against the applicant and is given statutory force and admissibility in court proceedings. 

(e)It manifests itself against the appellant as she made no application to have the finding reviewed and so the finding remains unchallenged.

(f)The finding was within power and expressly permitted to be made pursuant to the extraordinary power granted to the Commissioner.

(g)The finding contains at its heart that she obtained her grant dishonestly and was not entitled to it. This is the same gravamen of the dishonesty offences preferred by the OSR.

(h)The Commissioner, having considered that dishonesty was involved imposed a penalty which was up to 60% of the value of the grant.

(i)This amount was paid by the applicant.

(j)The applicant also paid back the FHOG.

(k)The penalty was by way of a fine and not by way of a tax. 

(l)The Commissioner was provided with wide discretion to impose a penalty taking into account matters that are typical to punishing offenders in NSW.

(m)The principles that the Commissioner had regard to when punishing the offender included the level of culpability, deterrence, the deliberateness of her actions, her prior character.

(n)These are all principles of punishment and considerations that are found in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

(o)The characterization of the penalty as civil/fine, is a mere formality and is not determinative of the true character of the penalty imposed.

(p)The applicant has in effect being found guilty of a dishonest offence, declared dishonest and punished applying the ordinary sentencing principles that this court would be well familiar with.

(q)The process of authorized investigation through to a declaration of dishonesty has been mandated by Parliament as the way that offenders under this legislation are to be dealt with.

(r)She has been punished for the same offending behaviour that is encompassed in the CANs. [emphasis added]

(s)The breadth of the offending behaviour, described as ""dishonesty obtaining the benefit"" is broad enough to cover most of the CAN's that are before the Court in relation to the offences against the FHOG Act. 

(t)Subject to a finding by the executive of dishonest conduct that led to the granting of a FHOG in circumstances where she was not entitled to that grant as a result of the investigation.

(u)To subject her to the further prosecution, costs, stress, harassment and vexing for the same conduct for which she has been punished, is an abuse of process and exposes her to double jeopardy."" [emphasis added]

26The prosecutor responds that it is entitled to frame its charges as it sees fit so long as there are elements of each charge that, while overlapping, are different in each case, and any prejudice is to be dealt with at the sentencing stage consistent with the Pearce principles. The prosecutor further submits that the applicant's reliance upon Joud is misplaced to the extent she seeks to circumvent the Pearce principles by suggesting this court should adopt a broad approach. 

27In Joud the accused, who had earlier been convicted of substantive terrorism offences, were then tried for conspiracy to do acts in preparation of terrorist acts. The trial judge refused an application for a permanent stay but on appeal the Victorian Court of Appeal, while not itself re-determining the stay application but remitting it back to the trial judge, held that the trial judge had erred because he gave too much weight to the proposed reduction in the evidence the Crown proposed to call at the conspiracy trial and did not adequately consider the other matters which had to be taken into account (at [143]). The Court of Appeal identified those other matters as delay, oppressive conditions of incarceration, pre-trial publicity and the effect of prosecution choices relating to the indictment, and together with the decision to separately try the accused meant that the proceedings ought to be stayed as an abuse (at [140]-[141]). 

28However, the Court of Appeal accepted that, standing alone, the trial judge was correct in rejecting the stay application on the basis that the appellant's were subject to double jeopardy (at [107] and [110]-[113]). The Court of Appeal, while distinguishing Pearce because in that case there was but a single trial, nevertheless accepted at [107], per Neave JA with Ashley and Weinberg JJ agreeing, that ""Pearce is authority for the principle that a prosecution will not be stayed simply because an offender has been charged with more than one offence arising out of the same conduct"", and the prosecutor submits that is the very case before this court. The Court of Appeal then went on to consider the issue of oppression, and the prosecutor submits that none of the other matters the Court of Appeal identified (at [134]) exist in this matter. 

Determination - Grounds One, Four and Five
29One difficulty with the applicant's submissions on the double jeopardy ground is that at times the distinction between double jeopardy at the prosecution stage is blurred with double jeopardy or double punishment at the sentencing stage. That is the very distinction the High Court essentially determined in Pearce at [29]-[31]. Further, the broad approach which the applicant submits should be taken in this matter is not borne out in Joud as the Court of Appeal expressly rejected such an approach where Neave JA said at [110]:
110 Unconstrained by authority, I might have held that the applicants had been subjected to double jeopardy because the Haines attempt was simply one of a number of transactions of the kind which resulted in the applicants' convictions in Benbrika 1. However, this Court is bound by the High Court decisions cited above. As in Pearce, any overlap in the offending could be dealt with at the sentencing stage if the applicants are convicted of conspiracy. 

30To the extent the applicant in her submissions relies upon what McHugh J said in R v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; 213 CLR 635 (at [130]-[131]) that ""They do not protect the accused against prosecutorial harassment in many cases that, in substance but not in form, offend the double jeopardy principle"", those words are of limited relevance to the circumstances of this case. There is no issue of controverting a prior curial acquittal or conviction or for that matter a prior curial ruling as was the case in Rogers. In Joud, the Court of Appeal similarly disposed of those decisions at [99] and at [103] respectively, and then continued at [106] to say of their application:
106 The above cases suggest that the double jeopardy principle covers much the same ground as the pleas of autrefois acquit and convict, although it may apply in circumstances such as those which arose in Carroll and Rogers, where a plea in bar is not available, but the proposed trial would controvert a jury verdict or a judge's ruling in a previous trial.

31The applicant's complaint that she is now being twice punished by the criminal proceedings for the ""same offending behaviour"" or ""for the same conduct"" to use her words is not accepted within the Pearce principle of double jeopardy at the prosecution stage. While there may be significant similarities between the conduct forming the basis of the Commissioner's decision to impose the penalties because of the applicant's ""dishonesty"" and the offences charged, there are material differences and they are not subsumed into the Commissioner's finding: c.f. Greentree at [109]. Those differences are:
(a)Sections 45(2) and 27(2), while they are penalty provisions, are not offence provisions: R v Adler at [113]-[114]; 

(b)The Commissioner's decision is not a curial one imposing a civil or criminal penalty;

(c)The Commissioner's finding of ""dishonesty"" is not a curial one in the sense of Carroll and Rogers that it is solemn and incontrovertibly correct: Pearce per Gummow J at [53]; Joud at [88];

(d)The Court is not bound by the Commissioner's finding of ""dishonesty"" as the s 48(2) certificate is not relied upon by the prosecutor in proof of the offences, even if it that is the effect of s 48(2) which is doubted. The decision of the Commissioner is otherwise not binding on the Court;

(e)The Court is not bound by Commissioner's decision to impose a penalty for the stamp duty because her conduct ""was caused wholly or partly by the intentional disregard"" (s 27(2));

(f)While s 45(2) of the FHOG Act requires the Commissioner to be satisfied of the applicant's ""dishonesty"", s 178BB of the Crimes Act does not contain an element of ""dishonesty"": Elias v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2012] NSWCA 302 at [44] per Blanch J with Beazley and Basten JA agreeing. It follows that there can be no double jeopardy on this basis standing alone for CAN Sequences 1 and 6;

(g)While the s 192G offence requires proof the applicant acted ""dishonestly"" identical to s 45(2), the prosecutor must in addition prove that the dishonest statement was ""false or misleading in a material particular with the intention of:..."". It follows that s 192G requires proof of elements beyond a simple requirement under s 45(2) and there can be no double jeopardy on this basis standing alone for CAN Sequence 8. In any event this sequence relates to additional conduct by the applicant after the imposition of the penalties on 20 April 2010 and was not evidence before the Commissioner when he imposed the penalties: c.f. Joud at [107] see below;

(h)Section 76A(2) of the Duties Act 1997 makes it a condition that if approval for stamp duty exemption is given with a residence requirement then the applicant must notify the Commissioner within 14 days of the end of the residence period that the applicant has not complied with that requirement and pay the exempted duty. Section 76A(4) makes it an offence not to comply with that condition. Proof of s 76A(2) does not require that the applicant's conduct ""was caused wholly or partly by the intentional disregard"" (s 27(2)), only the failure to give notice and pay the stamp duty if certain conditions applied. It follows that there can be no double jeopardy on this basis standing alone for CAN Sequence 2;

(i)Section 20(4) of the FHOG Act makes it an offence for failing to give notice and repay the grant within 14 days after failing to comply with the residence requirement condition on the advance payment of the grant. It is in similar terms to the s 76A(2) offence but applies to the grant while the former applies to the stamp duty exemption. Again, similar to s 178BB there is no element of ""dishonesty"" and the offence is failing to comply with a condition and no more. It follows that there can be no double jeopardy on this basis standing alone for CAN Sequence 3;

(j)Section 55(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 makes it an offence to make a statement to a tax officer knowing that it is false or misleading in a material particular. Again there is no element of ""dishonesty"" required as proof of an element. It follows that there can be no double jeopardy on this basis standing alone for CAN Sequences 4 and 10. Further Sequence 10 relates to additional conduct by the applicant after the imposition of the penalties on 20 April 2010 and was not evidence before the Commissioner when he imposed the penalties: c.f. Joud at [107];

(k)Section 44(1)(a) of the FHOG Act makes it an offence to make a statement to an authorised officer that it is false or misleading in a material particular. Again there is no element of ""dishonesty"" required as proof of an element. It follows that there can be no double jeopardy on this basis standing alone for CAN Sequences 5 and 9. Further CAN Sequence 9 relates to additional conduct by the applicant after the imposition of the penalties on 20 April 2010 and was not evidence before the Commissioner when he imposed the penalties: c.f. Joud at [107];

(l)Section 25A of the Oaths Act 1900 makes it an offence for a person to give a declaration wilfully and corruptly knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular, and who derives or attempts to derive a material benefit as a consequence of the untrue particular. Again there is no element of ""dishonesty"" required as proof of an element. It follows that there can be no double jeopardy on this basis standing alone for CAN Sequence 7.

32On the evidence set out in the Agreed Facts the Court accepts the prosecutor's submissions as to the differences outlined in the CAN particulars referred to above and they need not be repeated. While the offences charged are overlapping (and in some cases different altogether as they relate to conduct after the imposition of the penalties) they are discrete in whole or part from the Commissioner's finding of ""dishonesty"" in the strict sense of double jeopardy at the prosecution stage: Pearce at [31]. The applicant's submission that the conduct in CAN Sequences 1, 3, 6 and 7 is wholly ""subsumed"" to use her words into the Commissioner's finding of ""dishonesty"" is not borne out from an analysis of the offence provisions.

33The issue then is whether the criminal proceedings are otherwise oppressive. To the extent that the applicant may now be subjected to criminal sanctions and a regime of higher penalties for her conduct, does not diminish the integrity of the criminal proceedings and respect by the Court for the integrity of its own process. Rather, in the absence of serious and improper conduct or oppression by the prosecutor (and which the court could not alleviate by directions, rulings on the admissibility of evidence or matters on sentence such as extra-curial punishment) it would be a very exceptional case that a court would stay a criminal prosecution in these circumstances. Other than for the mere fact of the overlapping nature of the charges (including CAN Sequences 4 and 6 with each other) with the Commissioner's finding the applicant has not put forward evidence of oppression or improper conduct in the relevant sense: R v Adler at [115]-[118]. The decision of the prosecutor to lay the charges it has is entirely a matter for it to cover the whole of the applicant's conduct and subsequent criminality on sentence and it is not for the Court to superimpose it's own notion of fairness: Elias v R; Issa v R at [34]-[35]; R v Adler at [122].

34 On no account could the Commissioner be said to be independent (in the relevant sense in not having an interest in the decision) nor is the decision made in an open court with reasons given for the decision to the public: c.f. Island Maritime Limited v Filipowski at [45] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. The suggestion that the non-independent Executive decision of the Commissioner is curial in nature and binds this Court flies against the very nature of the functions, status, integrity and ultimately the authority of an independent judiciary. The Commissioner's decision is not of the nature that it is akin to ""A ""conviction"" of an ""offence"" and the imposition of a ""penalty"" in a public court necessarily involves the opprobrium which typically attaches to the imposition by a court of a sanction for breach of a statutory provision"" per Kirby J in Jack Brabham Holdings Pty Ltd v Button (1998) 94 FLR 278. Or, as McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in Pearce in a different but nevertheless apposite context in adopting the words of Sir John Barry in his lecture ""The Courts and Criminal Punishments"" at [39], the criminal law:
must be administered publicly in such a fashion that its activities can be understood by ordinary citizens and regarded by them as conforming with the community's generally accepted standards of what is fair and just. Thus it is a fundamental requirement of a sound legal system that it should reflect and correspond with the sensible ideas about right and wrong of the society it controls, and this requirement has an important influence on the way in which the judges discharge the function of imposing punishments upon persons convicted of crime.

35While the Commissioner may well have taken into account similar and relevant sentencing factors to those undertaken by a court does not convert the decision into a curial one such that the courts are bound to accept the decision as being incontrovertible so that, at least, the principle of double jeopardy applies at the prosecution stage. 

36That is not to say that there may not be circumstances where a permanent stay is appropriate because the conduct of the Executive is such that after having exercised its Executive powers it seeks to engage the court process for an improper purpose or, because the proceedings are otherwise oppressive. However, the circumstances of this matter do not justify such a finding let alone whether there should be a permanent stay. That there may be delay of a desultory nature but not of extraordinary length together with the inevitable prejudice because the applicant is a defendant in criminal proceedings is not sufficient: Island Maritime Limited v Filipowski at [31]-[32] Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ; and also in the absence bona fides at [97] Kirby J. That the applicant is now subject to more serious penalties well beyond the nature and extent of the penalties imposed by the Commissioner is a relevant circumstance going not only to the issue of double jeopardy but also as to whether there then should be a stay. In Joud the Court of Appeal said at [107]:
In my opinion, it was not an error for the judge to refuse to stay the trial as an abuse of process, arising out of double jeopardy. Pearce is authority for the principle that a prosecution will not be stayed simply because an offender has been charged with more than one offence arising out of the same conduct. In that case, the High Court held that there was no abuse of process, even though a core element in each offence was the infliction of the same injury on the same victim and the maximum term of imprisonment for both offences was the same. The argument for the application of double jeopardy is weaker in this case because the Haines evidence was not relied upon in Benbrika 1 and the maximum term of imprisonment for conspiracy is greater than the maximum penalty for the offences of which the applicants have already been convicted. The higher maximum penalty supports the view that the conspiracy involves more serious criminal conduct than the other offences."" [emphasis added]

37The words emphasised above by the court are apposite in this matter, particularly as the conduct charged is broader than the single issue of ""dishonesty"" and the potential penalties far greater. To the extent that many of the offences of which the applicant now stands charged relate to conduct which is not the same and/or is conduct after the imposition of the penalties on 20 April 2010, the applicant's submission founded on double jeopardy alone must fail. To the extent that some of the conduct for which the applicant has already been penalised is similar to the conduct encapsulated in some of the charges the court can and should deal with that circumstance only when that conduct has been determined should the offences be proven and at the sentencing stage: Hagipantelis at [48]; Greentree at [109]; Joud at [110]. Many of the factors, which the applicant has identified above, are matters to be properly taken into account as mitigating factors on sentence if that occasion were to arise. 

38The Court accepts the prosecutor's submission that until there has been a determination of the offences by way of a hearing or pleas of guilty the Court is not in a position to determine the double punishment issue. The prosecutor in its submissions recognises that the applicant ought not to be punished twice for the same conduct and that on sentence the payment of the penalties imposed by the Commissioner will be relevant. In that context the courts have shown that any issue of double punishment (without there being any issue of improper conduct or oppression) can be dealt with in a principled but pragmatic way, comfortably with the purposes of criminal punishment and the Courts' integrity without bringing the administration of criminal justice into disrepute: Pearce at [49]; R v Connell [2013] NSWCCA 155 at [36]-[40]; Redfern v R [2012] NSWCCA 178 at [17]. However, there may be occasions where a stay is appropriate given the observations made by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Nahlous. The court need not determine that issue for the present, for it could only arise at the sentencing stage, as it is not satisfied there is double jeopardy at the prosecution stage. 

39Further, the court will need to take into account the issue of any extra-curial punishment. A court may, and should consider when imposing a sentence, that an offender has already suffered or may suffer some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence, quite apart from any punishment imposed by the court: R v Einfeld [2009] NSWSC 119 at [154-162] (public humiliation and vilification); R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 (campaign of abuse, harassment and serious threats to person and property); R v Daetz (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 (private persons extracting retribution or revenge); Christodoulou v R [2008] NSWCCA 102 (self-injection of acid bound up with the offence); Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (Guideline Judgment on High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Offences) [2004] NSWCCA 303 (effect of licence disqualification). There are other instances of courts taking into account extra-curial punishment. What weight is to be given to any extra-curial punishment is a factor for the Court to consider on the particular facts and circumstances of a matter before it.

40The court is not satisfied the applicant has made out these grounds as justifying a permanent stay.

Ground Two: the FHOG Act does not contemplate that proceedings for contraventions against the Act will be brought under the Crimes Act
41The applicant's submission is that by necessary implication the FHOG Act is a self contained Act that provides for offences against the Act to be exclusively dealt with under the offence provisions in the Act. The applicant argues that the fact the Act provides a means of reviewing a finding of dishonesty when made, is suggestive of a mechanism whereby the Administrative Review Tribunal can review a finding of dishonesty. This tends to suggest that the Act in a self-contained manner circumscribes the means by which a finding of dishonesty can be made and the penalty imposed and reviewed. Consequently, it is indicative of a self-contained code. The immediate response to that submission is that the FHOG Act also provides for offences against the Act are to be dealt with summarily before either the Local Court or before the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction: s 49. The decision to prosecute is not one that can be reviewed under s 25 of the FHOG Act. 

42The applicant then submits that because the FHOG Act circumscribes the types of investigations and powers that an authorised officer can carry out under ss 35 and 36 of the Act, then it must follow that any offence resulting from those investigations can only be dealt with under the FHOG Act to the exclusion of the Crimes Act 1900. The applicant submits that to the extent the FHOG Act provides for summary offences only, it evinces an intention that all offences against the Act must be dealt with summarily. The consequence is that the FHOG Act contemplates that the Crimes Act 1990 charges cannot be laid. As the proceedings have not been brought under the FHOG Act they are an abuse of process.

Determination
43The court does not accept that the FHOG Act is in effect a code and excludes the operation of the Crimes Act 1900 or the Oaths Act 1900 for the following reasons:
(a)There are no express words excluding the operation of the Crimes Act 1900 or the Oaths Act 1900;

(b)That the Parliament has subsequently created a particular offence does not impliedly repeal a more general offence in an earlier Act relating to the same conduct: Goodwin v Phillips (1908) 7 CLR 1 per Griffith CJ at 7; Saraswati v R (1999) 172 CLR 1 per Gaudron J at [17]. 

(c)There is no inconsistency or repugnancy to the extent that the FHOG Act cannot stand with either the Crimes Act 1900 or the Oaths Act 1900. As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom (2006) HCA 50 at [48]: 
The doctrine requires that actual contrariety be clearly apparent and that the later of the two provisions be not capable of sensible operation if the earlier provision still stands. 

(d)In R v Chalak [1983] NSWLR 282 the Court of Criminal Appeal held that a power to deal with an offence summarily did not displace a provision providing for an indictable offence for the same conduct. The issue was whether ss 138 and 139 of the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth) impliedly repealed s 298 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Section 298 of the Crimes Act 1914 dealt with indictable offences and provided for a maximum penalty of two years. There was no time limit within which prosecutions might be instituted and there was no requirement for ministerial consent under s 298. The Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944 (Cth) provided only for summary proceedings. The penalties were limited to a maximum of a $50 fine or three months imprisonment, ministerial consent was required, and the proceedings were required to be brought within three years. There was also some modification in detail in the Social Services Act 1947 (Cth). Street CJ with Moffit P and Yeldham J agreeing said at 285 that enacting the statutory offences in the later Acts ""the legislature intended to create a parallel system of summary justice to be invoked in circumstances not justifying the more solemn procedure of trial on indictment. The summary nature of the penal scheme enshrined within ss. 49 and 50, and in ss. 738 and 139 of the current statute, in my view, can readily stand together with the general indictable offence constituted under s. 298."" Similarly, in Davis v Taylor (1996) 148 ALR 245, it was held that the enactment of civil penalties did not displace existing criminal offences for the same conduct; see also Australian Oil Refining Pty Ltd v Cooper (1987) 11 NSWLR 277 per Hunt, Finlay and Allen JJ.

(e)Similar observations may be made about the legislative provisions in this matter that they can stand side by side as alternative ways of prosecuting;

(f)Section 178BB was repealed in 2009 and replaced by s 192G which is after the commencement of the FHOG Act, but the Parliament did not exempt from the application of s 192G the FHOG Act. As the Parliament is taken to be aware of the FHOG Act it must follow that s 192G was meant to operate side by side with the FHOG Act;

(g)The prosecutor in his capacity as an officer of the OSR has the right along with that of any other person to bring a prosecution under the Crimes Act 1900 (save for limited exemptions not presently relevant) or the Oaths Act 1900: s 14 Criminal Procedure Act 1986; 

(h)That s 45(2) (and s 27(2) of the Taxation Administration Act 1996) provide for monetary penalties only speaks against the FHOG Act being a code in circumstances where gross fraud may involve large sums of public money which the community would expect to be prosecuted on indictment with the appropriate penalties under the Crimes Act 1900 or Oaths Act 1900.That there is no provision in the FHOG Act for indictable offences informs against it being a code;

(i)The applicant's submission that the investigative powers are limited to taxation offences says nothing about the decision of the prosecutor (or for that matter say a police officer) to lay those charges that it thinks are most appropriate.

44The court is not satisfied the applicant has made this ground out as justifying a permanent stay.

Ground Three: prosecutorial abuse at the investigation phase of the proceedings is such that the Court would stay the proceedings
45The applicant submits that these proceedings involve the use of evidence obtained by the use of investigative powers under the FHOG Act, Taxation Administration Act 1996 and the Duties Act 1997, which are clearly not intended for prosecutions under the Crimes Act 1900. The evidence that has been obtained has been in the main, beyond the express powers of the legislative provisions, which circumscribe the correct use of that power. This has demonstrated an unfairness and pre-prosecutorial abuse of powers to bring the proceedings before the court, particularly the use of the evidence improperly or unlawfully obtained from the applicant in the compulsory interview under s 72(1)(b) of the Taxation Administration Act 1996, which she submits is not admissible in the Oaths Act 1900, Crimes Act 1900 and FHOG Act as they were not for the purpose of a taxation law under s 71 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996. Further, if that evidence is inadmissible then those offences are doomed to fail and the court has the power to stay the proceedings for those offences as an abuse of process: c.f. Rogers.

46The prosecutor responds that the investigators have legitimately investigated the Taxation Administration Act 1996 and FHOG Act offences, and there is no evidence to the contrary. In the absence of evidence that the laying of the Crimes Act charges had been used in an improper way, for example to circumvent time limits, there is no basis for a permanent stay: see for example Saraswati. The subsequent decision by the prosecutor to lay charges under the Crimes Act after the investigation was a matter entirely for the prosecutor and is not a basis upon which the court could find an abuse of process at the investigation stage. The OSR officers had the power to carry out the investigations and issue the notices for interview, information or documents at that time and the applicant does not assert that the investigator's powers were not properly founded in the Taxation Administration Act 1996, Duties Act 1997 or the FHOG Act (in respect of all three Acts charges have been also laid). The prosecutor further submits that there is no suggestion (much less evidence) put forward by the applicant that the investigation was carried out solely for the purpose of gathering further evidence to commence a prosecution under the Crimes Act 1900, Oaths Act 1900 or for that matter the charges under the Duties Act 1997, FHOG Act and the Taxation Administration Act 1996. Finally, the prosecutor submits that whether evidence is ultimately ruled inadmissible is not a matter relevant to this ground. 

Determination
47The court notes that even if there is evidence that has been unlawfully or improperly obtained by the prosecutor that generally does not justify a permanent stay. The following observations in Lee, Do Young v Regina; Lee, Seong Won v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [35]- [37] are apposite although there the context was whether there had been a miscarriage of justice:
35 In addition, there are cases involving improper or unlawful conduct by the authorities investigating crime. However, misconduct of this kind is usually dealt with by excluding evidence, such as an induced confession, the proceeds of an unlawful search, or the product of entrapment. These examples resonate in the present case. First, inducing a confession by threats or trickery does not directly render the subsequent trial unfair. Secondly, in rejecting a defence of entrapment, in Ridgeway v The Queen [1995] HCA 66; 184 CLR 19, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ noted that even a direction or order of a superior officer in the government would not provide a defence to a criminal charge: at 29-30, referring to A v Hayden [No 2] [1984] HCA 67; 156 CLR 532. However, their Honours referred to the discretionary power to exclude unlawfully obtained evidence at 31-32:
""More importantly, the considerations of 'high public policy' which justify the existence of the discretion to exclude particular evidence in the case where it has been unlawfully obtained are likewise applicable to support the recognition of a more general discretion to exclude any evidence of guilt in the case where the actual commission of the offence was procured by unlawful conduct on the part of law enforcement officers for the purpose of obtaining a conviction. In both categories of case, circumstances can arise in which the need to discourage unlawful conduct on the part of law enforcement officers and to preserve the integrity of the administration of criminal justice outweighs the public interest in the conviction of those guilty of crime.""
36 As explained by Barwick CJ in The Queen v Ireland [1970] HCA 21; 126 CLR 321 at 334-335, ""the discretion to exclude evidence on public policy grounds extended to evidence obtained by 'unfair' as well as 'unlawful' conduct on the part of law enforcement officers: Ridgeway at 36"".
37There remained an issue in Ridgeway as to whether the proceedings should have been permanently stayed. The majority held that they should, not on the basis of an abuse of process, but because, without the evidence of possession of heroin, procured by law enforcement officers, the prosecution was doomed to fail. With respect to the question of abuse, both Brennan J (at 46) and Toohey J (at 61) referred to what they had said on that topic in Jago. Both they and Gaudron J (who considered the proceedings to be an abuse) and McHugh J (who would have countenanced a stay in circumstances where the prosecution would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute - at 92) accepted that a stay would be appropriate at least where proceedings were commenced for an improper purpose or were not capable of being the subject of a fair trial: at 46 (Brennan J) and 61 (Toohey J).

48Similarily, in R v Seller; R v McCarthy the accused were granted a permanent stay by the trial judge because the Australian Crime Commission had disseminated transcripts to the (Cth) DPP of compulsory examinations before they were charged. On appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial judge was in error, primarily because the trial judge had not considered whether any prejudice had in fact occurred. That there may have been a contravention of s 25A(9) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 does not automatically justify a stay. Bathurst CJ with McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing said at [110]: 
As I have stated, the fact that dissemination took place in contravention of a direction or in circumstances where a direction should have been given, does not automatically entitle the accused to a stay. The principles on which a permanent stay is granted are set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in CB supra and it is unnecessary to repeat them. I would merely add what was said by Mason CJ in Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 30, where the Chief Justice indicated his agreement with Richardson J in Moevao v Department of Labour (1980) 1 NZLR 464 at 482 that the justification for a stay is to prevent the court process being employed in a manner inconsistent with the recognised purpose of the administration of criminal justice and so constituting an abuse of process. Further, a stay will only be granted in an extreme case and the fundamental defect which warrants a stay must be such that there is nothing a trial judge can do to relieve against its unfair consequences: The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605.

49In the absence of evidence that the investigation was carried out solely for the purpose of gathering further evidence to commence a prosecution under the Crimes Act 1900, Oaths Act 1900 or for that matter the charges under the Duties Act 1997, FHOG Act and the Taxation Administration Act 1996 the applicant has not made out a basis for a stay. Any breach of the investigative powers and the nature of that breach would need to be identified in evidence so the court could then determine its admissibility, including the exercise of any discretion. 

50The court is not satisfied the applicant has made this ground out as justifying a permanent stay.

2762088,NSW Crime Commission v White [2013] NSWSC 1090,"Judgment

1By summons filed on 12 August 2013, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property; an order pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Act that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of all of the defendant's interests in the property specified in Schedule One to the summons; and an assets forfeiture order pursuant to s 22 of the Act.

2The orders sought in the summons, apart from the assets forfeiture order referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 12 August 2013.

3In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:

(1)Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 12 August 2013; and

(2)Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and an assets forfeiture order pursuant to UCPR 1.26 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).

4Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:

""10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1) Application for orderThe Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

...

(3) The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4) Notice to affected person of applicationDespite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5) Determination of applicationsThe Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a) in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i) the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities...

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based ...

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.""

5The plaintiff's application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). I considered the documents relied upon in support of the application in chambers.

6The plaintiff's application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 12 August 2013. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being the murder of Saaid Peter Zaiter on 16 December 2008 contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. This is a serious criminal offence within the meaning of s 6(2)(d) of the Act because it involves homicide.

7Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] - [17] of his affidavit. The deponent has annexed his correspondence with Detective Sergeant Virginia Gorman to which is attached the sentencing judgment in respect of the defendant following his conviction for murder after a trial by jury (R v White [2012] NSWSC 1573) in which the relevant facts relating to the commission of the offence are set out. A document prepared by Detective Sergeant Gorman which sets out facts relating to the commission of the offence and the property set out in Schedule One of the summons (the White report) is also attached. Mr Spark deposed that the facts set out in the sentencing judgement and the White report are, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true. 

8Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to inquiries he caused to be made as to the ownership of a BMW motor vehicle formerly registered in Victoria in the name of Riz Nominees Pty Limited, the ownership of which he suspected had been transferred to the defendant. He also attached witness statements relating to the purchase of property at Heathcote and Kamarooka in Victoria by the defendant and relevant documents relating to these transactions.

9Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.

10In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark's affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects. 

11I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark's affidavit that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. There can be no doubt that the defendant murdered Mr Zaiter since he was convicted after trial by jury. In determining whether there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion either that the defendant has acquired serious crime derived property because of the activity or the interest is serious crime derived property, I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104. The Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) said, at [14]:

""Suspicion, as Lord Devlin said in Hussien v Chong Fook Kam (1970) AC 942, at p 948, 'in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking: ""I suspect but I cannot prove.''' The facts which can reasonably ground a suspicion may be quite insufficient reasonably to ground a belief, yet some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown. In Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees [1966] HCA 21; (1966) 115 CLR 266, a question was raised as to whether a payee had reason to suspect that the payer, a debtor, 'was unable to pay (its) debts as they became due' as that phrase was used in s.95(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 (Cth). Kitto J. said (at p 303):

'A suspicion that something exists is more than a mere idle wondering whether it exists or not; it is a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust, amounting to ""a slight opinion, but without sufficient evidence"", as Chambers's Dictionary expresses it. Consequently, a reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence. The notion which ""reason to suspect"" expresses in sub-s.(4) is, I think, of something which in all the circumstances would create in the mind of a reasonable person in the position of the payee an actual apprehension or fear that the situation of the payer is in actual fact that which the sub-section describes - a mistrust of the payer's ability to pay his debts as they become due and of the effect which acceptance of the payment would have as between the payee and the other creditors.'""

12I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark's evidence. Although it may be more difficult for the defendant to dispose of assets while he is in custody than were he at liberty, I accept Mr Spark's evidence as to the speed with which cash and motor vehicles can be disposed of which have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it. 

13Since the defendant is in custody in New South Wales he is domiciled in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).

14The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant's property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, an assets forfeiture order pursuant to s 22 of the Act. The plaintiff states that it intends to rely on the evidence obtained in the course of an examination of the defendant and statement of affairs provided pursuant to s 12 of the Act in support of its application for the assets forfeiture order.

15In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.

16I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages. 

17On the basis of that undertaking, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff which are as follows:

1.Pursuant to section 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (the Act) no person (other than any registered mortgagee dealing with its right to do so under the registered mortgage) is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with all of the interest in property (within the meaning of ""interest in property"" as defined in section 7 of the Act) of Rodney Boyd White, including in the property specified in Schedule One hereto.

2.Pursuant to section 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act Rodney Boyd White shall be examined on oath before a Registrar of the Court concerning his affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest.

3.Leave is granted to the Plaintiff to obtain from the Registry dates for the examination ordered in Order 2 above.

4.Pursuant to section 10B(2) of the Act the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian shall take control of all the interests of Rodney Boyd White in the property specified in Schedule One hereto.

5.Pursuant to section 12(1)(c1) of the Act Rodney Boyd White shall furnish to the Plaintiff, within twenty one (21) days after service of a sealed copy of these orders on Rodney Boyd White, a statement verified by oath of Rodney Boyd White setting out the particulars sought in Schedule Two hereto.

6.Liberty is granted to the Plaintiff and Rodney Boyd White to apply on three (3) days' notice.

7.The costs of obtaining these orders shall be costs in the cause.

8.Pursuant to Rule 36.4(1)(a) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 these orders are to take effect as of the date hereof.

		13 August 2013",2013-08-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762093,R v Grogan & Slacke (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 1191,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The Crown alleges that the accused Jason Grogan assaulted Mr Alan Henry in his home at Gloucester on 10 January 2012 and stole property from him.  It also alleges that the accused Natasha Slacke did things after the event in an endeavour to cover up the alleged crime and help Mr Grogan to avoid being brought to justice.
2Mr Henry died a little over 3 months later. There is evidence that his death was a direct result of the injuries he sustained in the alleged assault.
3There were no eyewitnesses to the incident in Mr Henry's home.  The Crown case is heavily dependent upon a body of circumstantial evidence.
4This judgment arises from an objection to evidence of what Mr Henry said to his former wife and to his daughter while he was in hospital after the alleged attack on 10 January 2012.  Mr Henry had sustained serious head injuries.  He was initially taken by ambulance to a local hospital but soon transferred to the intensive care unit at Westmead.  He remained in intensive care until 3 February 2012 when he was transferred to the high dependency ward.  On 20 March 2012, he was transferred to Auburn hospital where he remained for about a week and a half until a place in a nursing home at Erina became available.  Tragically, he died on 19 April 2012.
5It is anticipated that Mr Henry's former wife, Ms Delma Henry, will give evidence that on an occasion when she visited Mr Henry at Westmead, he said to her ""That Jason is a dangerous man"".  He said something to the same effect on a different occasion when she visited him at the nursing home in Erina.
6Mr Henry's daughter, Ms Susan Henry, is also expected to give evidence that on 15 February 2012, when she was visiting him at Westmead in the high dependency unit, they had the following conversation, as set out in her statement of 20 April 2012:
He said, ""I been bashed to the shit house""
I said, ""Do you know who did it?""
He said, ""Jason did it, he's a very dangerous man.  I think I'll have to press charges"".
I said, ""Dad, Jason's already in Gaol.""
He said, ""Did say Jason why he did it?""
I said, ""Not that I know of."" 
7Mr Henry said similar things on other occasions.  Ms Susan Henry said in her evidence on the voir dire that this occurred about three times at Westmead, once at Auburn, and two or three times at Erina.
8The Crown's seeks admission of this evidence pursuant to s 65(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  Counsel for each of the accused argue that the evidence is not admissible pursuant to that provision; alternatively that the evidence should be excluded on the basis of its probative value being outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice: s 137. 
9Persuasive arguments as to the s 65 point were presented by the Crown Prosecutor and by Mr Smith, counsel for the accused Grogan.  Mr Watson, counsel for the accused Slacke, was content to adopt the submissions of Mr Smith.
10Section 65 is, relevantly, in the following terms:
65  Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available(1)   This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.(2)   The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation: (a)  was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or(b)  was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or(c)  was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable,
11My attention was invited to a number of authorities dealing with the construction of s 65(2)(b) and (c) such as Williams v The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490; Harris v The Queen [2005] NSWCCA 432; (2005) 158 A Crim R 454; and R v Kuzmanovic [2005] NSWSC 771.  They do not all speak with one voice; that is, the proper construction of the provisions is not well settled.  This is especially perplexing in the novel fact situation before me.  The statements objected to were made some five weeks after the occurrence of the facts asserted, but Mr Henry was, for the most part of that period, in an insensible state and unable to communicate.  I have spent significant time reviewing those authorities but arrived at a point where I considered it more appropriate to determine the second aspect of the objection.  If that was to be resolved in favour of the accused, it would render otiose determination of the first aspect.
12The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence was highly probative.  During the course of submissions I raised a question about the prejudicial nature of the evidence that Mr Henry referred to the accused Grogan as ""a very dangerous man"".  What he meant by that statement is not at all clear. Whether it was a conclusion Mr Henry had come to from only the events of 10 January 2012, or from Mr Grogan's previous conduct, or a combination of the two, is not apparent.  That evidence has minimal, if any, probative value in respect of the facts anticipated to be in issue and I am satisfied that there would be a significant risk of the jury misusing it to the prejudice of both accused.  The Crown Prosecutor conceded that he would not lead that part of the evidence of Ms Delma Henry and Ms Susan Henry.
13That leaves the evidence of Mr Henry saying that he had been ""bashed"" by ""Jason"".  I accept the Crown Prosecutor's submission that in the context of the other evidence in the case, largely circumstantial as it is, the evidence has significant probative value.  But there is also a danger of it being misused.  
14I see no problem at all with those parts of the statements of Mr Henry that could be regarded as a claim that it was the accused Grogan who was his assailant, subject to something I will say later.  But the reference to being ""bashed"" is problematic.
15""Bash"" is an emotive term and minds may differ as to the level of violence it connotes.  What level of violence Mr Henry intended to convey by his use of the term is unknown and impossible to know.
16Assuming the jury accept that Mr Henry was assaulted by the accused Grogan, a critical fact in issue in the case of each accused will be the level of violence involved in that assault and the intention Mr Grogan had at the time.  Did he inflict grievous bodily harm?  And more pertinently in the case of the charge of murder he faces, and the charge of being an accessory after the fact to the infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to do so faced by the accused Slacke, did the accused Grogan intend a level of violence that would cause Mr Henry really serious injury?
17Hearing evidence that the victim of the assault claimed that he was ""bashed"" would almost inevitably lead the jury to conclude that the level of violence was considerable and that the level of harm intended was also considerable (even without the extension ""to the shithouse"").  They might draw support for those conclusions from the nature and severity of the injuries Mr Henry sustained.  But, from what I understand of the case, there remains a possibility that Mr Henry sustained some injury, or injuries, by coming into contact with one or more hard surfaces in the vicinity of where the Crown asserts he was assaulted.  
18The accused Slacke told the police that Mr Henry had suffered a fall.  Whilst I understand that the Crown has evidence that might persuade the jury that the injuries could not have been caused by a fall alone, it might be the case where the jury will be required to consider whether a single punch, or a few punches, resulted in injuries that were sustained both directly and indirectly.  But hearing that Mr Henry claimed to have been ""bashed"", without any elaboration of what he meant by the term, could well divert the jury from an assessment of how the injuries were sustained and, in relation to those that were directly caused, with what intention they were inflicted.
19I have considered whether directions to the jury could serve to ensure that the jury would not give the evidence more weight than it deserves.  But what weight does it deserve if one avoids a process of reasoning that ""bash"" means an assault of considerable violence with an intention to cause considerable harm?
20In my view the evidence of Mr Henry saying that he had been bashed must be excluded.
21I have also considered whether the Crown should be permitted to lead evidence confined to Mr Henry saying, ""Jason did it"" in response to Ms Susan Henry asking, ""Do you know who did it?""  However, I have come to the view that taking that simple statement out of the context of the conversation as a whole would simply beg the question, what ""it"" was. It is the first statement made by Mr Henry, ""I been bashed to the shit house"" that gives meaning to ""it"".
22The whole of the conversation between Ms Susan Henry and Mr Alan Henry on 15 February 2012, and any subsequent conversations with her or others in which he made similar assertions, are excluded.

		28 August 2013",2013-08-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762100,Director of Public Prosecutions v Osborn [2013] NSWLC 22,"Judgment

1The Accused Marc Osborn has been charged with 3 offences pursuant to s 91K of the Crimes Act 1900. These are offences relating to filming a person engaged in a private act without their consent. The prosecution and defence agreed on most facts; they were tendered and marked as Exhibit 1. The agreed facts are that on 26 August 2012 the accused purchased on eBay an analogue clock which contained a concealed audio/visual recording device. The device was fitted with a motion detector, which enabled the camera to begin recording when it detected movement. The accused installed the device in his bedroom on a piece of furniture, which gave the camera a view of the bed. The accused installed the device for the purpose of filming himself engaged in sexual acts with women without their knowledge or consent. The defendant used the device on three occasions, being 5 September 2012, 7 September 2012 and 5 October 2012, to film himself engaging in sexual acts with 3 different women (the complainants). The women did not know they were being filmed and did not consent to being filmed; the defendant knew this. After the filming of the sex acts the defendant downloaded the films to his laptop (Exhibit 4). He then filmed parts of the footage on his Apple iPhone. 

2There were statements tendered into evidence from the three complainants. The defendant met each of them on Internet dating sites. He would then commence messaging them either on mobile phone or on Internet chat sites. He told each of them that he was a police officer. LP said she felt safer knowing that he was a police officer. AR said she felt better meeting him for the first time knowing that he was a police officer. AR said they sent pictures of each other naked backwards and forwards and she told him not to show anyone. She said he replied something similar to 'I'm not that sort of person' and promised to keep the pictures confidential. 

3A number of statements were tendered in evidence, which were not disputed in regard to the use of the footage on the iPhone. The defendant was a Senior Constable working at Gladesville Police Station. He also was the principal occupier of a home in the Gladesville area where he lived. He rented out rooms in his house to other police officers who lived outside Sydney but needed somewhere to stay while working as police officers at Gladesville Police Station. There were statements from each of these people (4 male police officers who worked at Gladesville Police Station) that they knew of the concealed clock camera and were told by the defendant that he used the device to film himself having sex with women. He showed each of these people film footage from his iPhone of him having sex with women on more than one occasion. There was also evidence of him showing other police officers at Gladesville Police Station film footage of him having sex with women. One police officer, John Jeffries (not one of the housemates), said he was shown 3 different videos of him having sex and saw some a number of times. He described the defendant showing him these videos in the company of other work mates. There was one where he said the woman was making extreme orgasmic sounds that the defendant would play without prompting for a laugh. He said the defendant had sent him a video of himself having sex with a woman. He said that when the defendant would talk about meeting up with a woman for sexual activities, he, Jeffries would say ""videos?"" in reference to videos that the defendant had shown him and they would laugh. Inspector Trundle said in his statement (Exhibit 2 tab 19) about the defendant, 

""9. Osborn was known and it was general conversation that he was entertaining several ladies and I had heard him using code words for women. I heard Osborn refer to women as ""events"" and the number of times with each woman as ""incidents"".

""10. It was common knowledge around the police station that he was 'rooting his ass off.' I had heard that Osborn said 'I'll have a break at 50'.

""Osborn started showing video's to other police. I personally never saw one but the topic of conversation around the station was 'have you seen Osborn's latest video.' ""

4Section 91K provides:
Filming a person engaged in private act
(1) General offence
A person who, for the purpose of obtaining, or enabling another person to obtain, sexual arousal or sexual gratification, films another person who is engaged in a private act:
(a) without the consent of the person being filmed to being filmed for that purpose, and
(b) knowing that the person being filmed does not consent to being filmed for that purpose,
is guilty of an offence.

5There is no dispute that: 
(a)The defendant filmed each of the complainants engaged in a private act being sexual acts
(b)This was without the consent of each of the complainants.
(c)The defendant knew that the complainants did not consent.
The only issue is whether the filming was for sexual arousal or sexual gratification of the defendant or anyone else. 

6The defendant gave evidence. He said that he had purchased the clock on eBay for the purpose of filming himself having sex. His marriage had ended in March 2012. He said he was the second oldest in his team at Gladesville Police Station and most of the officers in his team were in their mid 20s. He was renting rooms of his premises to other officers and they were all talking about what they had been doing on their days off, bragging about women. He was 41 years old and was trying to compete with the younger guys. He said he thought that they didn't believe him when he talked about having sex with women and dating. He gained this view from the occasional look or shrug he got. He said he filmed himself having sex with women to prove, ""the old man's still got it"" and to show his work mates the films. He agreed that he knew that the women did not know about the filming or consent to it. He said at the time he wasn't thinking about the women's feelings, his issue was proving himself. He acknowledged in hindsight he could see it was stupid both morally and ethically. He said he didn't make the films for sexual arousal or sexual gratification. He denied getting excited from knowing he was being filmed or from the fact that the woman didn't know she was being filmed. He admitted that he had viewed pornography on the Internet but said he had not made the films to watch later for sexual arousal or to make his own pornography. He denied getting sexual satisfaction from showing the films to mates. He agreed that some of the officers he'd shown had told him things such as they didn't want to see his private parts but he hadn't thought they were embarrassed or didn't want to see the films.

7He had downloaded the film from the camera to his laptop and then filmed parts of the films on his iPhone. It was the iPhone images that he was showing his mates. Both the film from the laptop, which showed the whole sexual encounter, and the films from the iPhone were in evidence. The films on the iPhone show part of the sexual encounter. The films on the iPhone are shorter and show actual sexual intercourse, are very explicit in regard to different sorts of sexual acts and appear to be close up images of the sexual acts. The defendant was asked as to why he chose these particular parts of the longer films to film on his iPhone and show his friends. He said he'd chosen one because of the noise being made by the woman and agreed that he chosen others to show full-blown sexual activities. Also on his phone were some still images of him having sex with the women, which came from the film. These were explicit images of the sexual act. The defendant said he couldn't recall selecting images to photograph and save separately.

8The issue for the court is, what was the defendant's motivation for making the film and showing it to his mates? There is no direct evidence of the motivation other than what the defendant told the court, so the Court must look to all of the circumstances of the defendant's behaviour and come to the conclusion that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn is the defendant made films for the purpose of sexual arousal or sexual gratification. One inference that can be drawn is that the purpose of making the films was to watch them for the purposes of sexual arousal. They are explicit and pornographic and that is the common use of pornography. In times before digital cameras and iPhones when going to the trouble of making and distributing a film was much more difficult there would have been little argument that only inference that could reasonably be drawn was that it was made for a pornographic or sexual arousal purpose. In this day and age it is acknowledged that the making of a film is much easier so with it expands the possibility of purpose. There is no direct evidence of sexual arousal and that is denied by the defendant. The issue seems to be whether what the defendant was doing in both making the films and then showing them to others was for the purpose of sexual gratification and what amounts to sexual gratification. The legislation in using two different definitions acknowledges that sexual arousal is different from sexual gratification.

9I will first go to the plausibility of the defendant's account that he took the films to show his work mates that he was having sex. The films on the iPhone are graphic and show more than just him having sex. They show the defendant in different sexual positions, performing a variety of sexual acts and of him bringing a woman to orgasm. They are extremely explicit. There are images on the laptop, which show the defendant having a sexual encounter, which are less explicit; these were not the ones he filmed on his phone and showed his workmates. There is also evidence from his housemates that they were aware of the defendant's entertaining woman as they were required to text him and tell him when they were going to be home so as not to cramp his style. The inference from the films on his iPhone that he took from the films captured on the secret clock camera are that his purpose was more than just that he wanted his work mates to know he was having sex. 

10The films on the iPhone are short excerpts from the downloaded images showing the most explicit and adventurous parts of the sexual encounters. I do not think it is unreasonable to say that the defendant appears in the images as a competent, adventurous and virile lover who is able to satisfy a woman. The only reason I say this is because it clearly shows what he wanted to portray about himself and thus what his motivation was. He was portraying himself as a sexually adventurous and virile male in these films. The fact that the films show him in this way with a number of women adds to the strength of this being his intention. His motivation in making the films was not just to show his mates he was having sex with women but also to show him as a competent and virile sexual performer. There was in evidence a film from his iPhone, which was tendered as tendency evidence (Exhibit 10) where he can be seen having sex and he winks at the camera. The question is does him showing images of himself in this light provide him with sexual gratification?

11There was no evidence before the court of the psychological motivation for a person behaving as the defendant did so I propose to look at the meaning of the words ""sexual gratification"" as given in the dictionary, what limited case law there is, the second reading speech when the legislation was enacted in an attempt to obtain the legislative intention and apply common sense.

12The Macquarie Dictionary defines ""gratify"" as: 
1. to give pleasure to (persons) by satisfying desires or humouring inclinations or feelings.
2. to satisfy; indulge; humour: to gratify desires; to gratify appetites

""Gratification"" as: 
1. the state of being gratified; great satisfaction
2. something that gratifies; sources of pleasure and satisfaction.
3. the act of gratifying

""Sexual"" as:
1. of or relating to sex: the sexual organs
2. arising from the fact or condition of biological sex: a sexual stereotype
3. having sex or sexual organs, reproducing by processes involving both sexes, as animals or plants
4. sex drive or having the ability to arouse strong sexual interest.

13These definitions require ""sexual gratification"" to be the satisfying of desire which relates to one or more of the following: sex, the sexual organs, a condition of biological sex, having sex or sexual organs, sex drive or having the ability to arouse strong sexual interest. 

14I have been directed to only one Australian case where ""sexual gratification"" was considered and I have been unable to find any others which are of assistance. In R v DR [2010] ACTSC 152, a case in the Supreme Court of the ACT, an element of the offence of using a child for production of child pornography required that the photography be substantially for the sexual arousal or sexual gratification of someone other than a child. The accused was the child's father who had filmed her in the bathroom and he argued that his purpose was voyeuristic only. Justice Mathews rejected this argument and in doing so referred to the nature of the films themselves, which focused on the genital region.

15I have been directed to the second reading speech for section 91K, which was introduced in 2008. The speech says nothing about what the parliament intended ""sexual gratification"" to include but the Attorney General did refer to the purpose of the legislation.

""The bill further creates a new offence of filming a person's private parts, which criminalises the filming of a person's private parts in circumstances when he or she can reasonably expect not to be filmed. This captures such behaviours known as upskirting, which involves filming up a person's skirt for the purposes of obtaining sexual arousal or gratification. However, it will also cover situations in which a person's private parts are filmed when the person is engaged in a usually private act, but not necessarily in a private place, such as a public urinal. This surreptitious filming of people without their consent has become prevalent with the emergence of new technologies that allow anyone with a mobile phone to film another person without that person's consent, in inappropriate circumstances. It is important to send a clear message that such behaviour is not acceptable and will be taken very seriously by the courts."" (Hansard page 11705, 11/12/2008)

16The second reading speech for s 91K's preceding section which was expressed in similar terms, being section 21G of the Summary Offences Act 1988, also does not provide an indication as to what parliament intended ""sexual gratification"" to include but did include the following statement;

""Ultimately the proof of this offence will rely heavily on the types of images or recordings made and the locations in which the cameras are set up. The offence is also drafted in such a way as to catch those who produce these films for themselves or for the purpose of passing the recording on to another person."" (Hansard page 6754, 27/2/2004) 

17I am satisfied that the intention of the legislation as set out in both of the second reading speeches was to criminalise a new behaviour which invades people's personal privacy as a result of mobile phones and other small electronic recording devices. This was behaviour not previously contemplated by the criminal law and all the reasons for the behaviour also were not fully contemplated, the legislature did not simply require a motive of sexual arousal which is a more finite concept but added "" sexual gratification"" to cover a wider interpretation of motive. The speech indicates a desire on the part of the legislature to criminalise the filming of a person's private parts in situations where a person would not expect to be filmed and I am satisfied that I should give a wide interpretation to the phrase ""sexual gratification"". 

18As I have previously said a clear inference that can be drawn from the defendant illicitly filming himself having sex is that it was for sexual arousal, a second inference has been raised by the defendant as to his motivation is that it was to show his workmates that he was having sex with different women, to prove that he could. The defendant has argued that this was not for sexual arousal or sexual gratification. I accept that there is evidence that supports the interpretation of his motive as being to ""boast"" to his workmates about his sexual encounters. The definition of sexual gratification as referred to earlier is that the court must be satisfied that the defendant was seeking to satisfy a desire, which relates to one of the definitions of ""sexual"" referred to. I am satisfied that he was seeking to satisfy a desire for his workmates to see him as sexually active and able to attract women and have sex. The very nature of that desire was sexual as defined, specifically it was to show that he had a strong sex drive and was sexually capable and attractive to women. The evidence from his workmates in the way he showed the films on his phone to them indicates that he obtained pleasure or gratification showing them the films of him having sex. He showed the films widely and without a request being made. The film where he winks at the camera while having sex indicates pleasure not only at what he's doing in the film but the fact that he knows he's filming himself and will watch the film or have others watch it later and that he feels good about himself. The gratification he is obtaining from making the films and showing them is clear from the evidence and his own evidence. What he is doing in the films is all about sex, the showing of the films to his workmates is gratification, and the two concepts are inextricably intertwined. For these reasons I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant filmed each of the complainants engaged in the private act of sex with him without their consent and knowing they were not consenting for the purpose of his sexual gratification. I find the defendant guilty of each of the offences.

		24 March 2014",2013-08-12 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2762119,Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  On 10 February 2011 the appellant, Philip Matthews, was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment that charged him with an offence under s 307.11 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) of importing a commercial quantity of a ""border controlled precursor"", namely pseudoephedrine, intending or believing that another person intended to use any of the precursor substance to manufacture a controlled drug.  The ""commercial quantity"" of pseudoephedrine is 1.2kg.  On 18 March 2011 the jury returned a guilty verdict. 
2On 23 January 2012 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of four years and six months. His sentence was fixed to commence from 13 November 2010.
3The appellant now appeals his conviction. He also seeks leave to appeal from his sentence. The appellant was represented at his trial but was not represented on his appeal.  One of his grounds of appeal concerns the quality of the representation he received at his trial.  He raises a number of other grounds including that the jury's verdict was unreasonable.  For the reasons that follow, all of his bases of challenge to the conviction should be rejected and his sentence should not be interfered with.
The Crown case and the evidence supporting it
4As the appellant contends that the jury's verdict was unreasonable it is necessary to set out the Crown case and the evidence supporting it in some detail.  Section 307.11 of the Criminal Code provides:
""Importing and exporting commercial quantities of border controlled precursors
(1) A person commits an offence if:
(a) the person imports or exports a substance; and
(b) either or both of the following apply:
 (i) the person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug;
 (ii) the person believes that another person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; and
(c) the substance is a border controlled precursor; and
(d) the quantity imported or exported is a commercial quantity.
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 25 years or 5,000 penalty units, or both.
(2) The fault element for paragraph (1)(c) is recklessness.
(3) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(d).""
5It was not in dispute at the trial that on 27 May 2008 the appellant and Marcos Garcia (aka ""Gus"") travelled to Thailand and returned to Australia on 14 June 2008.  The Crown alleged that on the night before his return to Australia the appellant purchased a large amount of cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine from various pharmacies in Bangkok. It alleged that the appellant ground down the tablets, secreted the powder in a ""water heater"", and arranged to ship it back to Australia.  After his return to Australia, the appellant was arrested on 19 June 2008 for breaching his parole. The Crown alleged that while in custody he directed Garcia and Roxanne Thurling to continue facilitating the importation.  It further alleged that he did so, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use the pseudoephedrine to manufacture methylamphetamine, commonly known as ""speed"".
6The evidence said to support the Crown case can be conveniently described as comprising four parts.
7First, there were certain agreed facts concerning the importation and some uncontested evidence that linked the appellant to the importation.  Thus the following facts were agreed:
(a) a wooden crate containing two boxes of water filters and one water pump arrived in Australia on or about 15 July 2008;
(b) A4 sheets on the sides of the crate read: ""Shipping Mark:  Mr Eden Sydney T. 0416544414"";
(c) the crate was sent from Bangkok, Thailand and loaded on about 23 or 25 June 2008;
(d) it was estimated to arrive in Sydney on 16 June 2008;
(e) the Thai shipping company referred to on the bill of lading was On-Line Shipping Co Ltd (""Online"");
(f) various descriptions of the consignor on shipping documents included references to ""Mark Cooper"" and ""Mark Hooper c/- Eden Indoors, 56 Cummins Road, Wagga Wagga"";
(g) customs officers located 12.64 kilograms of off-white powder in the pump from the crate when it was examined on 22 July 2008;
(h) the powder contained 2.47 kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine;
(i) the powder was removed and replaced with an inert substance;
(j) a controlled delivery of the pump to 196 Burley Griffin Way, Springdale NSW was effected on 29 July 2008; and
(k) the appellant was not authorised or permitted by the relevant authority to import pseudoephedrine between 1 January 2005 and 21 January 2010.
8The telephone number on the side of the crate was subscribed to on 15 May 2008 in the false name Mark Mitchell, using the appellant's residential address.
9The Crown called evidence from Mr Mark Cooper. He denied having anything to do with the importation of the water pump.  He denied being associated with the email address ""m-h-cooper57@live.competition.au"" which was used to liaise with the forwarding agent for the importation of the water pump.  He said that he met the appellant while studying in 1992.  They started a horticultural business called Eden Indoors in 1998.  In 2000 they registered a company in that name with both as shareholders.  By late 2002 they had fallen out.  The appellant left Eden Indoors and conducted a business under the name ""Inspired Design"".  Eden Indoors was deregistered in 2005.  Mr Cooper said they incorporated the business with the purpose of developing a plant arrangement product known as ""Pot Toppa"".  He said that at one point they used a nursery in Wagga known as Rapley's Nursery which was located at 56 Cummins Road and operated by Mr Geoff Rapley. 
10Second, at the appellant's trial the appellant's co-offenders, Thurling and Garcia, gave evidence against him. They had both pleaded to guilty to various offences.  They were sentenced having regard to undertakings they gave to give evidence against the appellant (see s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)).
11The relevant parts of their evidence were as follows.  On 27 May 2008 the appellant and Garcia flew to Bangkok and then travelled from Bangkok to Kathmandu, Nepal before returning to Bangkok and then to Sydney on 14 June 2008.  
12On their last night in Bangkok, the appellant told Garcia he wanted to acquire some pseudoephedrine and send it back to Australia.  According to Garcia, the appellant stated he needed to raise money to pay for his home loan.  Garcia suggested they buy bulk cold and flu tablets from different chemists in Bangkok.  The appellant left with their driver and returned some time later with 500 boxes of tablets labelled ""Sudor"".
13The appellant and Garcia discussed packing the tablets and went to a supermarket in Bangkok where they purchased the water pump (also referred to as a ""water heater"") and the filters referred to in the agreed facts.  They also purchased a grinder for reducing the tablets into powdered form.  Garcia said that the appellant, either by himself or with the assistance of others, ground up the tablets.  Garcia said he saw the appellant the next day at the front of their hotel where they caught a taxi to the airport. The appellant told him that he ""went to the shipping company and sent it all off"" in reference to the water heater filled with pseudoephedrine.
14Garcia said the appellant told him he had used the name Eden Indoors and an ex-business partner's name on the shipping documentation.  He also said he had provided an email address which he would set up once back in Australia and a contact number. He told Garcia that the package was to be delivered to Rapley's Nursery at 56 Cummins Road, Wagga.
15As I have stated, the appellant and Garcia returned to Sydney on 14 June 2008.  On 19 June 2008 the appellant was arrested for breaching a parole condition that he was not to travel overseas without prior notification. 
16Garcia stated that on the night before the appellant was arrested he went to a social function at the home of Thurling's sister, Patricia Thurling.  He said the appellant was present as well as Ben Petterson (""Petterson"").  Garcia knew Petterson from gaol. Petterson provided him with amphetamine for personal use.  Garcia said that in the presence of others, including the appellant, Petterson said he wanted to ""cook"" amphetamine. Furthermore, Thurling stated that she overheard a detailed discussion at this function between Garcia and the appellant about placing pseudoephedrine in a water heater.
17After the appellant was arrested Garcia said he then travelled to the gaol on 21 June 2008 to find out what the appellant ""wanted me to do about this shipment"".  He was denied entry to see the appellant but Thurling was allowed in.  Thurling stated that during this visit she obtained the email address from him so that she could liaise with the shipping company.  Garcia said he was able to see the appellant at the gaol (on 5 July 2008) and he told the appellant that ""everything was going to where it was being sent"", that being a reference to Rapley's Nursery.  He also told the appellant that he, Garcia, ""wasn't up to cooking [the speed] and Ben [Petterson] was going to be doing it"".
18From this point both Garcia and Thurling described how they assumed responsibility for arranging the receipt and delivery of the water pump under the appellant's direction, which was given during recorded telephone calls from gaol.  The evidence concerning this is addressed below in the context of describing the transcripts of those conversations.  At this point, it should be noted that both of these witnesses were subject to a long and detailed cross examination which highlighted a number of inconsistent statements they had made.  It was suggested to Garcia that he sought to downplay his role in the importation at the expense of the appellant in order to achieve a reduced sentence, and to Thurling that she was an unreliable witness due to her self-confessed illicit drug use. 
19Third, as noted, on the evening of 18 June 2008 the appellant attended a social gathering at the home of Thurling's sister. Thurling's de facto partner, Damian Worldon, testified that he met the appellant and that the appellant had boasted that he was ""getting a heap of pseudo brought over to make heaps of speed and they were going to make heaps and heaps of money"".  Mr Worldon stated that the appellant said he had sourced it from Thailand and had it ""packed in a water heater"". In cross examination Worldon agreed that when he made a statement to the police he was suspicious of the appellant's (romantic) interest in Thurling, although he stated that ""didn't mean I didn't like him"". He also agreed that his police statement suggested that the conversation had occurred prior to the appellant's departure to Thailand. Worldon's evidence was strongly challenged in cross examination, but he maintained that the appellant referred to pseudoephedrine, a package from Thailand and a water heater or container.
20Fourth, a number of phone calls between the appellant, Garcia and Thurling were recorded while he was in custody. What follows is a description of the salient ones in the context of the events that unfolded after the appellant was arrested on 19 June 2013. 
21As noted, on 21 June 2008 Thurling visited the appellant in gaol. She stated that she obtained an email address from him to liaise with one of the shipping companies. 
22On 30 June 2008 an email was sent to the freight company for the water heater, ""On-Line"", from the email address m-h-cooper57@live.com.au  and purportedly from a ""mark h cooper"". In a telephone call the same day (""call 3"") Garcia and the appellant are recorded as having the following exchange:
""[Garcia]: Yeah. Hey, you know, that number, what's the depot called in Sydney?
[Appellant]: Um, no idea. It's, it will be on that email. Did you check the email?
[Garcia]: Yeah, there's nothing there.
[Appellant]: Well then you've got to wait till it comes cause it obviously hasn't been sent yet, m_h_cooper?
[Garcia]: Yeah, 57
[Appellant]: You checked that, yeah, you checked that email?
[Garcia]: yeah.""
23The Crown contended that this exchange revealed the appellant and Garcia liaising over the manner in which Garcia should follow up with ""On-Line"" about the progress of sending the concealed pseudoephedrine.
24On 3 July 2008 a call was recorded in which Garcia told the appellant that he ""just got an invoice from online"" and the appellant replied ""[y]eah"" (""call 4"").  Later in the conversation Garcia discussed an invoice from a ""freight company"".  The appellant is recorded as saying that the invoice ""obviously [has] got dates and everything on it"" with Garcia replying that it has ""got dates but not, of when it left ten days ago"".  The Crown contended that this conversation conveyed an appreciation by the appellant of the freight arrangements for the water heater, and involved a discussion about how Garcia could identify the date of delivery. 
25As noted, Garcia stated that in a gaol visit on 5 July 2008 he and the appellant had a detailed discussion about the pending importation of the water heater and its contents.
26On 10 July 2008 the freight forwarder sent an email to the Mark H Cooper address attaching a ""Sea Freight Arrival Notice"" listing an estimated date of arrival of 16 July 2008 and describing the goods to be delivered as a ""water heater"". The email sought the details of the appointed customs broker. (Brian Somerville, from Clemenger Customs Brokers, became involved as broker.)
27In a telephone call on 12 July 2008 the appellant and Garcia discussed the appellant's mounting bills (""call 6"").  The appellant asked Garcia ""[l]ike, are [you] going to have anything before I get out"", and Garcia replied ""[y]eah"".  The conversation continued:
""[Garcia]: I've got your water heater.
[Appellant]: Good.
[Garcia]: It's here.
[Appellant]: Fantastic.
[Garcia]: Gets here in a couple of days.
[Appellant]: Ok. That's all good. No problem at all."" 
28On 15 July 2008 the water heater arrived in Australia.  On 21 July 2008, Somerville telephoned the consignee's number specified on the bill of lading and spoke with Garcia, who purported to be Mark Cooper.  Somerville requested an ABN to process the paperwork. Garcia said he would call back.  On a later occasion Somerville spoke to Thurling (who also used an alias).
29In a telephone call on 24 July 2008 Thurling requested the ABN for Eden Indoors from the appellant (""call 9""). The call included the following exchange between Thurling and the appellant:
""[Thurling]: Everything's excellent.
[Appellant]: Everything's excellent?
[Thurling]: Yeah. We've received ...
[Appellant]: Hey?
[Thurling]: We received it.
[Appellant]: Really?
[Thurling]: Yeah, so everything's fine.
[Appellant]: You've already gone to Rapleys [sic].
[Thurling]: No, we've sent it somewhere else.
[Appellant]:  Sorry?
[Thurling]:  We've sent it somewhere else.
[Appellant]:  Beautiful. Well, that's all good ..."" (emphasis added)
30As noted, the initial address for delivery of the water heater containing the pseudoephedrine was the address of Rapley's Nursery at 56 Cummins Road.  In his evidence the appellant claimed in this conversation that he was referring to a (separate) package of water filters that he bought in Thailand. The only document in evidence concerning that package listed the delivery address as 16 Silverwood Road, Wagga Wagga.  In so far as Thurling referred to the sending of something ""somewhere else"", on 26 July 2008 an email was sent from the Mark Cooper email address to Somerville changing the delivery address for the water heater from Rapley's Nursery to 196 Burley Griffin Way, Springvale.
31There was another recorded call in the afternoon of 24 July 2008 (""call 10"").  During the call the appellant asked Garcia ""[h]ow you going for money?""  The conversation continued:
""[Garcia]:  Yeah, I've got Mick helping us.
[Appellant]:  Yeah. Good.
[Garcia]: Cause I left him some."" 
32In his evidence in chief Garcia stated that this was a reference to promising ""Mick"" (Mick Kelly) part of the pseudoephedrine when the water heater arrived.  The appellant then asked:
""[Appellant]: And, and Benny and Kenny, did they come through with anything?
[Garcia]:  Benny did.
[Appellant]: Yeah?
[Garcia]:  ... paid more.
[Appellant]:  Yeah, yeah good ...""
The appellant conceded that the reference to ""Benny"" in this conversation was to Petterson.
33The appellant and Garcia then discussed the costs ""for that parcel"" including ""import duties"".  The discussion continued:
""[Appellant]: ....all I can say is put everything aside [until he is released on parole]. There's no need to rush everything.
[Garcia]: Yeah. Well, I'm, we're, we've got -
[Appellant]: No need to.
[Garcia]: - one sold as is -
[Appellant]: Yeah.
[Garcia]: - to fix up the house money.
[Appellant]: Yeah.
[Garcia]: That's Mick arranging, that's why we're here. As soon as it gets here, just, I'll pull one out -
[Appellant]: Beautiful."" (emphasis added)
34Garcia explained that the reference to ""everything"" in ""put everything aside"" was to the water heater and its contents.  He also stated that he was advising the appellant that he had already (pre)sold one kilogram of pseudoephedrine to ""Mick"" which would be supplied when he took possession of the water heater.
35Garcia and Thurling arranged for various payments to be made to clear the package through Customs.  On 25 July 2008, both Thurling and Garcia were stopped by the police.  Their vehicle was searched and various documents were located, including invoices relating to the water heater and emails to and from Somerville.  They were released that evening and both went to a place called Wattle Farm in Ariah Park where Petterson operated a clandestine drug laboratory and was attempting to manufacture methylamphetamine.  The drug laboratory was discovered during a police raid at approximately 3.20am the following morning after a tip-off.  Various items were seized including the documents that Garcia had had in his possession relating to the water heater and emails with the customs broker.
36Petterson was arrested at the premises but he subsequently escaped.  He telephoned either Thurling or Garcia and told them about what had happened.  As stated, on 26 July 2008 Somerville received an email from the Mark H Cooper address advising that the package was to be sent to 196 Burley Griffin Way, Springdale.
37On 27 July 2008 Thurling told the appellant during a telephone call that ""big stuffs [sic] gone down"" and that ""Gus wasn't there [but] Ben was"" (""call 11"").  In a telephone call on 28 July 2008 Thurling and the appellant discussed Petterson evading custody and being on the run (""call 12"").
38The water heater was delivered to the Springdale address on 29 July 2008. It was a controlled delivery and the premises were under surveillance.  Petterson was at the premises and, once the package had been delivered, was heard saying on a phone ""Yeah, got it, just smashed the top open and there it was"".
39Shortly afterwards, police entered the premises and Petterson and another person were arrested.  Petterson possessed a list of phone numbers that included phone numbers for Thurling and Garcia.  He had received at least eight telephone calls from Garcia's phone that day. 
The appellant's case
40The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He denied being the principal in any importation of pseudoephedrine.  He denied the role attributed to him by Garcia and Thurling.
41The appellant described the history of his business relationship with Cooper, and claimed that when it ceased he left the rights to the ""Pot Toppa"" with Cooper on the basis that he would receive a royalty.  He claimed that he discussed using Cooper's details with Garcia as a means of chasing up his outstanding royalty payments.  He said he met Garcia in gaol in 2007 and also met a John Griffiths who claimed to be working on a contract with a pharmaceutical company in China.  He said that after his release from custody he tracked down Griffiths and pursued the business in China.  He stated that he left with Garcia to go to Thailand as a stop-over on the way to Nepal, which had a ""very sophisticated chemistry university"".  He stated that Garcia had funded the trip and its purpose was for the appellant to hand a chemical formula to a professor at the university to have it made into an ""active pharmaceutical ingredient"" that could be brought back to Australia.
42The appellant said that he and Garcia travelled to Thailand sometime around 27 May 2008.  While in Bangkok, he and Garcia went to a shopping centre and he bought ""two stainless steel water filters"".  He said he went to Nepal between 31 May 2008 and 7 June 2008.  He said he took a formulation he obtained from Griffiths for a product ""closely related"" to Viagra and he found a number of ""manufacturing companies"" that could make it.  He returned to Thailand and spent four further days in Bangkok but hardly saw Garcia. He claimed that Garcia told him that he had sent the boxes with the water filters to the appellant's place.  He denied going to any chemist shops in Bangkok to purchase pseudoephedrine or seeing Garcia do that.  He returned to Australia on the 14 June and travelled to Wagga.  He described meeting Thurling on the evening of 18 June 2008 but denied making admissions to Worldon.  He claimed that Garcia suggested using Cooper's identity as a means of contacting various companies and finding out information about the Pot Toppa.
43The appellant addressed the period he was in custody, including the visits and the various recorded calls.  He denied providing Thurling with an email address to deal with the shipping company during her first visit on 21 June 2008. He denied discussing the importation of pseudoephedrine with Garcia and Thurling during the second visit on 5 July 2008.  He stated that, of the recorded telephone calls, the earlier calls were mostly concerned with logistical discussions about the China business, the business needs of Inspired Design and the attempts to find out information about the Pot Toppa by using the assumed identity of Mark Cooper.  Thus in relation to call 3 he stated that the exchange noted at [22] above concerned seeking information about the Pot Toppa, and in particular what depot the Pot Toppa was stored at.  With respect to call 4 noted at [24] he stated that he understood the reference to ""invoice from online"" was not a reference to an invoice from the shipping company ""On-Line"", but instead was a reference to a statement received online for his business.  He claimed that the discussion of invoices concerned invoices relating to indoor plants for his business, Inspired Design. 
44As already noted, in call 6, Garcia advised the appellant that the water heater had arrived or was about to arrive. The appellant claimed that he was about to have a solar water system delivered and that he had discussed that with Garcia.  He claimed the cost of it was covered by a subsidy as it was solar powered and that it would save money, even though he was planning to sell his house.  He was cross examined about this evidence as follows:
""Q.  Can I suggest this to you, you knew the reference to the water heater was a reference to the pending importation of the water pump containing pseudoephedrine?A.  That's not my recollection of this at all.
Q.  And can I suggest this, it's code in which you're basically being told it will be here in a couple of days, that is the water pump containing the pseudoephedrine, what do you say to that?A.  I wasn't aware of any water pump heater other than my solar hot water system.
Q.  And that's what you say you got a full subsidy for?A.  Correct.
Q.  Are you telling the truth about that?A.  Yes.
Q.  You got a full subsidy for a water heater?A.  Yes, but the good thing was I didn't actually have to pay the balance of it because Ken can get generic models installed for the same price for the subsidy. I've had a second one. I've had two.
Q.  Was that the full subsidy that you got?A.  I don't know what the full subsidy is. He worked it out and there was nothing to pay.
Q.  All right. Well your evidence was the other day that there was nothing wrong with the existing hot water system and in terms of cost it was covered it was a full subsidy?A.  The subsidy covered the cost of the solar hot service from what I understood.
Q.  So you say - the Commonwealth Government was it?A.  I'm guessing. I've never seen it. I've never been back to this house since. I had Ken put one on another house that I owned, 50B Plumpton Road, and I had him put one on this house.
Q.  But do I understand what you say is the government at that stage were providing the full subsidies for solar hot water systems?A.  I don't know what their subsidy was. All I knew is it was covered with this particular item.
Q.  Well your understanding was you weren't out of pocket?A.  That's correct.
Q.  And then you go on to say:  'That'll be good. That'll save a bit?'A.  Yes
Q.  This is the house that you were planning to sell.A.  Yes.
Q.  And move on?A.  Yes.
Q.  And you thought it was good that you'd saved a bit?A.  Yes.""
45In relation to later calls the appellant asserted that he came to believe that Garcia had secreted pseudoephedrine in the water filters that he, the appellant, had bought, and he was trying to avoid it being sent to an address associated with him or his family.  The appellant said that he did not wish to report that to the authorities as he was in prison and feared retribution for being an informer if he did so.  Thus the appellant claimed that he understood that call 9, extracted above at [29], was about the water filters.  The appellant said he had been told by this stage that Garcia had ""replaced [the water filter canisters] with the same sort of style canister but with drugs in them"".  He further stated that he was glad to find out the parcel was not being sent to an address associated with him (ie ""Rapleys""). 
46With call 10, the appellant accepted that the reference to ""left him some"" in [31] was to leaving ""Mick"" some ""speed"", but claimed he did not relate that statement to the ""parcel"" whose importation costs Garcia and he then discussed.  He claimed that discussion concerned the costs and charges for the importation of the water filters and not the water heater or pump.  He stated that Garcia's reference to selling ""one"" was to selling either one of the filters or the ""contents of the filter"".
47Accordingly, the appellant asserted that by the time of the later calls he had learned that, while Garcia and he were in Thailand, Garcia had placed illegal drugs in the water filters that he had bought.  He had accepted that he was discussing with Garcia and Thurling where the filters would be sent and Garcia's use of the proceeds of the sale of the illegal contents of the filters.
48In cross examination the appellant attempted to explain his question in call 10 about ""Benny [Petterson] and Kenny"" in which he asked ""did they come through with anything"" (see [32]).  He asserted that he thought they might provide money because Garcia had told him that he gave ""Kenny"" a computer and ""Kenny"" therefore owed Garcia money.  He had denied ever meeting Petterson.  In cross examination he was asked as follows:
""Q.  Why would Benny and Kenny come through with anything?A.  Because I was told they were.
Q.  But why? What was your understanding as to what was in it for Benny and Kenny?A.  I don't know.  It was to do with Gus and Gus was working with me.
Q.  But if this relates to a drug importation [in] which you are not involved, he's telling you this on a recorded telephone call?A.  That's correct.
Q.  He says, 'Benny's here' and you go, 'Yeah.'  He goes, 'Paid more' and you go, 'Yeah, yeah good'?A.  Yes.
Q.  What did you mean by 'yeah, yeah good'?A.  He was paid more so obviously he got more for whatever - I was told it was a computer so he obviously got more for it.
Q.  Why is that good?A.  Well, because he was going to put it aside. He had - we had bills to pay and he had things to do.
Q.  You understood Benny and Kenny were in effect attempting to get you money so you could pay bills?A.  I didn't expect Benny and Kenny would give me anything. They didn't know me from a bar of soap.
Q.  What do you mean by 'we had bills to pay'?A.  Well, I had a contract to finish.  I had work to do.  I had plants to pay for.  I had a business to run.
Q.  That's your business and your [plants]?A.  Absolutely and Gus was, in my opinion, helping me at the time. It is clear through the progression of this operation [by what] he was doing that he's fallen by the way side and he's off doing his [own] thing.
Q.  I just want to ask you, on what basis did you believe Benny or Kenny would come through with any money at least for you in part that Mr Garcia could use?A.  Only that he has sold something of his.""
Ground 15:  Unreasonable verdict 
49Ground 15 of the appeal contends that the jury's verdict of guilty was ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence"" (see MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58]).  It is appropriate to deal with this ground first. In raising this ground the appellant implicitly seeks a grant of leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to raise a ground of appeal involving a question of fact or of mixed law and fact (Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]). The Court will grant leave.
50The invocation of this ground of appeal requires this Court to ""ask itself ... whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"" (M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493).  In doing so this Court must undertake its own ""independent assessment of the evidence both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" (Morris v R [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473).  The Court must consider any competing evidence to that presented by the Crown and weigh the conflicting evidence (SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [24] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ).
51In relation to the advantages enjoyed by the jury in hearing and observing witnesses compared to this Court in SKA at [13] French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ stated: 
""The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M [at 494] went on to say: 
'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred'.""
52In his submissions the appellant contends that the Crown case ""depended virtually completely"" upon an acceptance of Garcia's evidence as to the appellant's conduct during their trip to Thailand.  He submitted that Garcia's evidence was unreliable.  He also attacked the reliance by the Crown on Thurling's evidence, given the evidence of her drug usage.  He argued that the transcripts of the various telephone calls did not support the Crown case and that it was reasonably open to the jury to accept his explanations.
53The respective cases of the Crown and the appellant as well as the evidence supporting each have already been summarised.  The Crown case was overwhelming.  It would be wrong to view the Crown case as dependent upon the credibility of any or all of Garcia, Thurling or Worldon to any significant degree.  There were obvious problems with the credibility of each.  However the evidence of Garcia and Thurling only completed a narrative which was strongly pointed to by the other material, especially the telephone intercepts.  The ability to consider their evidence in light of that material was an advantage the jury enjoyed that this Court did not (M v R supra).
54The pseudoephedrine was secreted in a water pump (or a water heater) and sent from Thailand to Australia via the shipping company ""On-Line"".  All of the delivery details, ie the address for delivery, the identity of the consignee (""Mark Cooper"") and the contact phone number, were associated with the appellant and not, originally at least, with Garcia. In call 2 Garcia specifically tells the appellant that an invoice has been received from ""online.""  Later the delivery address is changed to another address associated with the appellant. 
55The most significant objective circumstance pointing to the appellant's guilt is the discussion in call 6 on 12 July 2008. As noted, on 10 July 2008 an email was sent advising of the forthcoming delivery to Australia of a ""water heater"".  Within two days Garcia reported to the appellant that the ""water heater"" was about arrive and this was acknowledged by the appellant (see [27]). What possible explanation for this conversation is there other than that Garcia was reporting the fate of the impending importation into Australia? The only potential answer to that question that emerged during the trial was in the cross examination of Garcia. Garcia agreed that he knew that telephone conversations with inmates were recorded. It was suggested to Garcia that by openly referring to a ""water heater"" he was trying to set up the appellant by attributing responsibility for the water heater to him (""your water heater"") and that it was Garcia's ""insurance policy if things went wrong"".  It was put to Garcia that he was trying to confuse the appellant, who was expecting a water heater (because his had broken).  Garcia rejected these suggestions.
56This aspect of the cross examination reveals that the appellant's counsel had correctly realised the deeply incriminating nature of this conversation and was attempting to address it. However the attempt was not persuasive.  Garcia would not necessarily have appreciated that such a discussion would be incriminating as that appreciation depended upon the listener having knowledge of something nefarious about the contents of the ""water heater"".  However, even if the discussion about a ""water heater"" was meant by Garcia to incriminate the appellant, it would also incriminate himself. Thus, Garcia would not be taking ""insurance"" by initiating a recorded conversation on that topic, but would instead be exposing himself to greater risk of apprehension, especially as he was not in custody and was taking active steps to import the precursor albeit under the appellant's control.
57What this reveals is a matter confirmed by the balance of the evidence, namely that neither Garcia nor Thurling was as astute as the appellant. The transcripts of the intercepted calls reveal they required detailed instructions from the appellant to perform various menial tasks. This reveals a contradiction at the heart of the appellant's case. On the one hand he stated that he was the prime organiser of the various alleged legitimate activities which he contended that neither Garcia nor Thurling had the intellectual capacity or means to pursue. On the other hand the appellant was forced to allege that somehow they were able to, deliberately and without his knowledge until the very end, enmesh him in their scheme to import a precursor as some form of future insurance in the event they were charged and needed to reduce their sentence.
58In the end result, the appellant's response to the incriminating nature of call 6, namely that he just happened to be expecting another water heater, could at best only be described as lame. For that response to be accepted would mean that the unluckiest and unlikeliest of circumstances came about, namely the making by him of separate arrangements for the delivery of an apparently free energy efficient water heater to his home while his travelling partner to Thailand used his need for a new water heater as a cover to arrange an illegal drug importation.  Otherwise it is implausible that the appellant would be so interested and happy to receive news of the delivery of the water heater in custody (""fantastic"") given that he accepted that by that time his house would be sold (see [44]).
59Of course the onus of proof of the charge remained on the prosecution throughout the trial.  However when considered with the other events that were unfolding, the transcripts of the telephone calls between the appellant, Garcia and Thurling clearly reveal that they were reporting to the appellant on the progress of the importation and taking guidance from him to effect it.  The appellant's explanation of those conversations was specious.  There is no doubt that a jury acting reasonably would reject them.  As stated his attempt to explain the conversations culminated in him stating that he knew or believed that Garcia was arranging an importation of something illegal and expected to receive some of its proceeds, although it was not an importation he arranged or was charged with.  The Court is satisfied that the true explanation for those conversations was that they all concerned the importation he arranged and continued to supervise while in custody. 
60This ground fails.
Ground 1:  Allegedly negligent conduct of the trial
61Ground 1 alleges that counsel for the appellant's conduct of the trial was ""negligent"" and involved ""misconduct"" resulting in a miscarriage of justice. The various complaints travel beyond matters of law.  Thus leave is required (Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1)(b)).
62In assessing complaints about counsel's conduct it must be borne in mind that the relevant inquiry is whether what occurred or did not occur at the trial occasioned a miscarriage of justice (TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [79] per McHugh J, Ali v R [2005] HCA 8;  214 ALR 1 at [18] per Hayne J).  None of the alleged failings of the appellant's counsel is even close to the potential category of errors by counsel adverted to by McHugh J in TKWJ at [76], namely those that are of such a nature that of themselves they might render a trial unfair (see Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [19] per Gleeson CJ and [87] per Kirby J).  Instead the nature of his complaints are such that what needs to be considered is what ultimately did or did not occur at the trial, whether there was some material irregularity in the trial and whether there is a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial (Nudd at [24] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; TKWJ at [31]-[33] per Gaudron J, at [79] and [97] per McHugh J, at [101] per Gummow J and at [103]-[108] per Hayne J).
63In conducting that inquiry a number of related matters should be noted. First, there is vested in counsel for an accused person control over and responsibility for the manner in which the trial will be conducted (TKWJ at [74] per McHugh J).  Second, relevant unfairness will not be established simply because an ""apparently rational decision"" by trial counsel produced adverse consequences for the accused (TKWJ at [16] per Gleeson CJ).  Third, inquiries into the subjective thought processes of counsel for taking the steps they did at the trial are to be avoided.  Instead the question is whether there could be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial (Ali per Hayne J, with whom Gummow J agreed at [25];  TKWJ at [110] per Hayne J).  If there could be such an explanation then no error or defect in the trial occasioning any miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred (Ali id).  Fourth, although the inquiry into whether there was an explanation for counsel's conduct is an objective one, there are some perhaps limited circumstances in which it is necessary for the appeal court to be apprised of material such as counsel's instructions (Nudd at [10] and [17] per Gleeson CJ). 
64The appellant has identified the failings of trial counsel under three broad headings, namely, failure to follow instructions, ""improper conduct"" and giving improper advice.  Each will be addressed in turn.  However at the outset it should be noted that a review of the trial record reveals that appellant's counsel opened the appellant's case and then cross examined the Crown witnesses thoroughly and competently.  After the close of the Crown case he called the appellant and led him through his evidence. Later he addressed the jury in a thorough and persuasive manner.  The difficulties he faced were considerable.  The Crown case was extremely strong. The appellant's response was to attempt to weave his way through some highly damaging transcripts by reference to various extraneous matters such as the water filters, the Pot Toppa royalty dispute, the China project and the ongoing needs of his business, Inspired Design.  It would have been a difficult task for any counsel to cross examine the Crown witnesses, lead the appellant through his evidence, and then address the jury concerning the appellant's version of events. 
Failure to comply with instructions
65The appellant's lengthy written submissions contain a number of assertions about the ""instructions"" he gave to his counsel during the course of the trial.  The appellant filed an affidavit reciting a list of complaints about his counsel and various instructions he asserts he gave.  The affidavit did not place those instructions in the context of the trial as it unfolded. Nevertheless each complaint of a failure to follow instructions will be addressed. However it should be noted that if the appellant in fact gave all the instructions he asserts he did in his submissions on appeal and his affidavit, many of which are nonsensical, then that would only have made a difficult task for counsel that much harder.
66First, the appellant complained that he instructed counsel to apply for separate trial in 2009, but that no such application was made. This complaint leads nowhere. In the end result the appellant obtained a ""separate trial"" as he was the only defendant on trial. 
67Second, the appellant complained that his instructions to his counsel ""to [seek a] voir dire based on Campbell's case were not followed"".  This makes no sense.  Thurling was originally charged with importation and committed for trial on that charge.  The acts against her all concerned events after the drugs had arrived in Australia. The Crown no-billed that charge having regard to the discussion of the meaning of ""import"" in Campbell v R [2008] NSWCCA 214; 73 NSWLR 272.  After an unsuccessful voir dire in relation to the evidence of manufacture, Thurling pleaded to a charge of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug.  The decision in Campbell was irrelevant to the appellant's position.  No sensible basis upon which there could have been a voir dire concerning the appellant ""based"" on that decision is apparent.
68Third, the appellant complained that his instructions to counsel to undertake some form of ""Basha enquiry"" (R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337) concerning the transcripts of the telephone conversations that have been referred to were not followed.  In particular he complains that some form of ""preamble"" in each discussion should have been rejected as ""it was a constant reminder of prejudice against [him]"".  It is not clear what this is referring to but it might possibly be a reference to so much of the transcript as referred to him being incarcerated.  If so, this complaint is groundless.  There was no possible basis upon which the appellant's counsel could have applied to exclude the references to the appellant's incarceration as it was central to the narrative of the Crown's (and the appellant's) case.  There was nothing inadmissible or relevantly objectionable in any of the transcripts. 
69Fourth, the appellant complains that he instructed his counsel to seek an adjournment for ""a Basha enquiry on Garcia's evidence upon [a] new statement during trial"" and that otherwise his counsel did not have ""time to prepare or read [the] new statement"".  It seems that a further statement from Garcia was served just prior to the trial.  On the morning the trial was due to start the appellant's counsel sought and was granted a short adjournment to read it before the Crown Prosecutor opened.  Garcia was not called as a witness until eight days later. He gave evidence in chief over a day and a half, and was then cross examined for in excess of three days.  With the consent of the Crown, the appellant's counsel was allowed to ask Garcia various questions in the absence of the jury about some documents that were in his handwriting and prepared while he was in custody. Thus, to that extent, there was a form of Basha inquiry in relation to Garcia's evidence.  Otherwise, there is no basis for contending that counsel did not have sufficient time to consider his statement or that counsel erred in not asking for more time.  A decision as to whether counsel has had sufficient time to prepare for cross examination is quintessentially a judgment they are best able to make. Counsel should not ask for more time to prepare simply because their client tells them to.
70Fifth, the appellant complains that he instructed his counsel ""to admit evidence from Ben Petterson's statement"" in which Petterson stated that he had not met the appellant. There was a dispute at the trial as to whether the appellant met Petterson at the social gathering on the evening of 18 June 2008 referred to above.  The appellant denied that he did so. This complaint has no basis for at least two reasons.  First, assuming that Petterson had made such a statement, it could not have been tendered because it was inadmissible as hearsay. Obviously, to have called Petterson as a witness in the appellant's case would have been a potential forensic disaster.  Second, whether or not the appellant had physically met Petterson was very much a side issue in the proceedings. The transcripts revealed that the appellant knew who Petterson was and of his involvement in drugs (see [48]).
71Sixth, the appellant complains that his counsel failed to follow instructions to require the officer in charge to be recalled for further cross examination.  This complaint has no substance.  The officer in charge was called on the first day of the trial.  He was cross examined on that day and on the second day.  His cross examination was interrupted as he needed to seek medical attention.  He was recalled just prior to the close of the Crown case.  He was then further examined by the Crown and cross examined by the appellant's counsel.
72Seventh, the appellant complains that his instructions were ignored ""all round by counsel with regards to objecting to all manufacture and irrelevant evidence from trial"".  He contended that ""60% of line of questioning from Crown to witnesses and 70% of evidence they admitted was in relation to the manufacture"".  The short answer to this contention is that the material concerning the manufacture of amphetamines was highly relevant to the charge against the appellant. The Crown case demonstrated that the appellant was aware that manufacture was being arranged, and that he was informed to that effect by Thurling and Garcia.  It was an element of the offence charged that the appellant intended or believed that another person intended to use the precursor he imported to manufacture a controlled drug.  The evidence the subject of this complaint sought to prove exactly that, as well as the appellant's ongoing supervision of the importation.  The responsibility for objecting to evidence led by the Crown rested with the appellant's counsel.  It would not have been a proper discharge of his duty to the Court or his client to make pointless objections, and he did not do so. 
73Eighth, the appellant complains that his counsel refused to follow instructions to obtain evidence from John Griffiths, China Development Corporation or Ken Parkins.  The nature of the evidence that these persons or entities could have given was not explained, but it is difficult to see how they could have said anything of relevance much less by way of rebuttal of the damning aspects of the Crown case that have been summarised above.  The Crown case was not dependent on it disproving that the appellant was pursuing other transactions while overseas.  Further, it was known that John Griffiths had convictions for manufacturing drugs. In the absence of knowing what evidence it is said these persons could have given, it cannot be concluded that there is not any ""reasonable explanation for not calling [them]"" (TKWJ at [107] per Hayne J).
74Ninth, the appellant complains that his counsel also ignored the instruction to inform the trial judge that her Honour's personal opinions were coming across by way of ""facial expressions"" and ""fluctuating breaths and stares"".  This complaint has no substance.  There is nothing in the material capable of supporting a complaint of bias on the part of the trial judge. 
Improper conduct and administration
75Under this heading the appellant complains about a number of other aspects of the conduct of the trial on his behalf by his counsel and solicitors. 
76First, he complains that counsel's instructing solicitor was rarely present during the trial.  To address this, it is not necessary to address the large question of whether the trial of a person on a serious criminal charge who is not represented by counsel instructed by a solicitor who is present for most, if not all, of the trial would necessarily be unfair and thereby warrant a stay (see R v Chaouk [2013] VSCA 99;  R v Chaouk [2013] VSC 48; MK v Victoria Legal Aid [2013] VSC 49).  Where the trial has concluded and resulted in a conviction different considerations arise in determining whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred compared with the prospective assessment involved in considering whether to grant a stay.  With the former there must be a consideration of the actual impact on the trial in question.  In this case, there was no satisfactory evidence before this Court concerning the periods in which counsel did not have the assistance of an instructing solicitor, much less whether this caused any difficulties in counsel for the appellant's conduct of the trial.
77The transcript records that on one occasion during the trial the appellant's counsel advised the trial judge that his instructing solicitor was absent.  He sought and was granted an adjournment until he attended so that counsel could confer with his client before deciding to re-examine.  This illustrates that a temporary absence of an instructing solicitor will not necessarily occasion a defect in the trial process, much less a miscarriage of justice.
78The appellant identified one instance of what he said was the prejudice occasioned by the absence of an instructing solicitor as follows:
""Regarding evidence given by the [appellant] in relation to a Simmone Von Viller from University of NSW. In re-cross examination, the Crown stated to the jury that this information was falsified and the person did not exist. The Crown continued to imply that the defendant was lying about the rest of his story too. It was subsequently discovered by the [appellant's] lawyer after conviction that Simmone von Viller in fact does exist. Unfortunately her name was misspelt by the [appellant] at trial. Had the [appellant's] lawyer been present during trial, this could have been avoided as he had prior firsthand knowledge of Prof. Simmone Von Viller in the form of an affidavit.""
79In his evidence in chief the appellant stated that he had been told by John Griffiths that he, Griffiths, had an association with a ""Professor Simone Von Wheeler"" from the University of New South Wales.  In cross examination the Crown Prosecutor suggested that there was no such person, to which the appellant responded ""[t]hat could be true"".  There was then a discussion about the spelling of the professor's name.  Ultimately the Crown Prosecutor did not submit to the jury that there was no such person, but instead submitted that the appellant did not ""know too much about the technical side of either venture"" and that the jury should not accept his reasons for travelling to Nepal.  Thus the question of whether or not there was a professor of the same or similar name to the one he stated was never resolved but in the end did not matter.  The appellant only claimed that he had been told of that person's existence by John Griffiths and the Crown did not ultimately dispute that claim.  In those circumstances, to have called evidence that there was a person with a similar name to that of the professor, assuming there was such evidence, would not have advanced the appellant's defence.
80Another instance of prejudice from the absence of an instructing solicitor was said by the appellant to arise from the following:
""A jury member informed the Judge during trial that he had been at a pub where the [appellant] was [playing music] during the trial. He and the [appellant] shared eye contact and the jury member claims he put his beer down and left. The [appellant] informed his solicitor that morning of the event via text message as the solicitor was busy with [another trial] and seldom came to court. As I was also present in the pub and witnessed this event, I can say that the jury member stayed drinking his beer for approx 20mins with his family. When the Judge read the jury note she commented in a very sarcastic and disapproving tone 'and thanks to the juror for bringing it to my attention. It probably would have been a good idea for your client to have told you, Mr Paish, as well'. No objection was made by counsel to clarify the situation.""
81Again, this complaint does not identify any defect in the trial or matter capable of causing a miscarriage of justice.  The comment of the trial judge complained of was made in the absence of the jury.  Counsel for the appellant explained to the trial judge in the jury's absence that the appellant did not have the opportunity to speak to him about the matter but had contacted counsel's instructing solicitor.  When the jury returned the trial judge stated:
""To the juror that let me know about the chance meeting with the eyes across a crowded bar last night ... thank you for letting me know.  The accused also let his solicitor know about [that].  There is no issue about that ...""  (emphasis added)
82Second, the appellant complained that one of the solicitors from the firm of solicitors he retained was ""disqualified"" because he had been convicted of manufacturing drugs (with Griffiths).  The details of this were not explored but it appears to have no substance.  The solicitor named by the appellant in his submissions was acquitted in 2002, six years prior to the trial (R v Piggott, Griffiths, Simeon [2002] NSWCCA 218).
83Third, the appellant complains that he was ""not informed of the change in Worldon's statement until the day Worldon was called at the trial"", even though ""Counsel for defendant was made aware 2 days prior"".  The nature of the change was not explained, but it does not matter. The appellant denied making any admission to Worldon. Worldon's evidence was strongly challenged in cross examination.  The appellant's counsel put his client's version of events to Worldon.  Assuming there was some aspect of Worldon's evidence that the appellant was only apprised of late, it was not productive of any defect in the trial or other matter occasioning any miscarriage of justice.
84Fourth, the appellant complains that ""[c]ontrary to instructions, counsel failed to argue grounds of recklessness as requested by [the] trial Judge"".  This is misconceived.  Prior to the Crown's address the trial judge raised with both counsel the form of the directions to be given concerning the elements of the offence.  The only reference to ""recklessness"" in that exchange concerned the element identified in s 307.11(1)(c), namely that the substance is a border controlled precursor.  Sub-section 307.11(2) provides that the fault element for that element is ""recklessness"".  In the end result there was no need for any argument from the appellant's counsel because her Honour decided to direct the jury that that element could be satisfied by recklessness, but that the Crown had to prove actual  knowledge of the importation (""intentionally imported"") and the proposed use (""intended to use ... or believed that another person intended to use""). 
85Fifth, the appellant complaints that ""[c]ontrary to instructions, counsel failed to argue relevance of accessorial liability not advanced in the trial, contrary to case of principle lead [sic] by the Crown"". This complaint also has no substance.  From beginning to end the Crown case was that he was the principal in the importation.  Her Honour directed the jury in terms that required them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intentionally imported the substance into Australia.  For the appellant's counsel to have raised any issue of accessorial liability would have only involved the agitation of another basis upon which his client could have been convicted.
86Sixth, the appellant contends that his counsel failed to apply for the discharge of a juror who was supposedly late for an international flight.  The substance of this complaint is addressed when dealing with ground 12.  In summary, the juror indicated that he had made alternative arrangements.
87Seventh and finally, the appellant also put forward a motley collection of complaints about his trial for which the fault apparently lay with his counsel.  These included complaints about the late provision of transcript, the apparent tardiness of the trial judge in attending the Court while the jury was deliberating, and a failure to obtain copies of the exhibits or jury notes.  None of these complaints has any substance. 
Improper advice
88The sole complaint under this rubric concerns the form of the charge that Garcia pleaded guilty to. The appellant's written submissions put the complaint in the following terms:
""The solicitor informed the [appellant] that the co-accused, Garcia, pleaded guilty after 2 years to the charge of Aiding and Abetting Philip Matthews in the Importation of a Border Controlled Precursor. Section 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code states that a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by another person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly. The [appellant's] counsel raised this concern in private conference however when instructed to acknowledge this in trial, instructions were refused. Given this charge does not appear in the criminal code, this administration error gives rise to unfair harshness."" 
89Assuming the appellant raised this complaint with his counsel, then presumably counsel's response was puzzlement. The sentencing remarks for Garcia refer to his pleading guilty to two offences.  One of the offences was ""aiding and abetting Philip Lindsay Mathews"" in the importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor contrary to s 307.11(1) of the Code when taken with s 11.2(1) of the Code.  There was no inconsistency in the charge against Garcia as recorded and the terms of the section he was charged under.
Conclusion on Ground 1
90None of the appellant's complaints about his counsel have any substance whatsoever.  It has not been demonstrated that there was any defect in the trial or other matter suggesting a miscarriage of justice occurred.  Leave to raise this ground is refused.
Ground 2:  Delay in the trial resulting in unfairness
91The appellant was arrested in 2008 and stood trial from February to March 2011.  Ground 2 complains that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned either because of this delay or because the trial judge failed to direct the jury in accordance with s 165B of the Evidence Act 1995.
92In support of this ground the appellant referred to the three witnesses against him, Garcia, Thurling and Worldon, and submitted that ""[g]iven the time the witnesses had with the brief before pleading guilty and the delay in the [appellant's] trial, the [appellant] argues delay in proceeding has resulted in procedural [un]fairness and a justifiable sense of grievance"".
93This ground has no substance. The delay between the appellant's arrest on 25 September 2008 and the commencement of his trial in early February 2011 was unfortunate but certainly not exceptional.  It appears to have come about by delays in the service of the Crown brief of evidence, the listing of committal proceedings, the making of a separate trial application by Thurling and the necessity for various adjournments to facilitate the pleas of guilty, sentencing and the subsequent assistance of Garcia and Thurling.
94Critically, nothing in the appellant's submissions has identified any relevant prejudice occasioned by delay that would warrant the extraordinary step of intervening. A permanent stay of a prosecution of a criminal offence where there is substantial delay is only to be granted in the extreme case where the apprehended defect causing unfairness to the accused is of such a nature that it goes to the root of the proceedings, and there is nothing a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial to relieve its unfair consequences: RM v R [2012] NSWCCA 35 per Whealy JA;  Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23;  Barton v R [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75; Dupas v R [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237.
95In this case the only consequence of the delay was that it facilitated two of the appellant's co-accused pleading guilty and giving evidence against him.  In substance the appellant's complaint is that the delay meant that the case against him gathered strength.
96The necessity for a direction under s 165B only arises:
""(2) If the court, on application by a party, is satisfied that the defendant has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay, the court must inform the jury of the nature of that disadvantage and the need to take that disadvantage into account when considering the evidence.""
97No direction under s 165B was sought.  If it had been, no basis for a finding of a ""significant forensic disadvantage"" is apparent. 
98Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to all aspects of this ground. Leave to raise it is refused.
Ground 3:  Failure to adjourn the trial upon receiving a new statement from a ""key witness"" (Garcia)
99Ground 3 complains about the failure of the trial judge to adjourn the trial upon the provision of a further statement by Garcia. The course of events surrounding the provision of Garcia's statement and the time afforded to the appellant's counsel to prepare for cross examination have already been described.  As stated, counsel did not seek an adjournment or suggest that he needed further time to prepare.  Instead he conducted a detailed cross examination of Garcia that took up the appellant's convoluted (and implausible) version of events. 
100Rule 4 applies to this complaint.  Leave to raise it is refused.
Ground 4:  Miscarriage of justice by submitting evidence from ""known perjured witness""
101Ground 4 alleges that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned because the Crown called evidence from a ""known perjured witness"", Garcia. He asserts that in sentencing Garcia the trial judge had stated that she ""did not believe the evidence given by Garcia"" and that the calling of such a witness by the Crown resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
102On 19 October 2010 Garcia pleaded guilty to the charges already referred to.  He was sentenced on 10 February 2011 by the same judge who conducted the appellant's trial. Garcia did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.  However, placed before the sentencing judge were statements from Garcia in which he asserted that it was not until after 5 July 2008, ie after he returned from Thailand, that he became aware that the ""water heater"" being imported into Australia contained pseudo-ephedrine. The sentencing judge rejected these assertions and found his role was much greater. 
103As I have stated, just prior to the trial the Crown served a further statement from Garcia in which he admitted a much greater role in the importation. This was confirmed in his oral evidence that is summarised above.  All of the discrepancies in Garcia's various accounts were fully explored at the trial.
104Nothing in this course of events reveals a miscarriage of justice. The version of events that Garcia testified to at the trial was consistent with the sentencing judge's finding as to his true role. Unlike other versions that Garcia had provided, his version at trial at least had the virtue of being consistent with the remainder of the evidence.  Both the appellant's counsel and, by reason of his efforts, the jury were fully aware of the variations and discrepancies in Garcia's evidence. Nothing in the Crown's conduct was inconsistent with the duties placed on Crown Prosecutors (as summarised in Banovec v R [2012] NSWCCA 137 at [59]-[60] per Hoeben JA, Basten JA and McCallum J agreeing).  In particular, the Crown was entitled to conclude that the last version of events given by Garcia was generally reliable.
105Leave to raise this ground is refused.
Ground 5:  Failure to call the officer in charge resulted in miscarriage of justice
106Ground 5 alleges that the failure of the appellant's counsel to further cross examine the officer in charge after he was initially excused due to ill health caused a miscarriage of justice.  The events surrounding that are described above.  The appellant's submissions under this ground contend that his ""counsel failed to seek leave to continue the defence examination"".  This is incorrect.  As stated, the appellant's counsel resumed his cross examination of the officer in charge when the officer returned. 
107One matter raised separately under this ground concerns counsel for the appellant stating to the trial judge that he neglected to raise with the officer in charge whether there was any fingerprint analysis of the water pump, the packing crate or a business card, but asking her Honour to remind the jury that the appellant's fingerprints were not on those items in her summing up.  This was not opposed by the Crown and her Honour did so.  The failure to cross examine the officer about this topic could be characterised as an omission by counsel, but the omission was corrected.  There was no defect in the trial, or any other matter that occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
108This ground has no substance.  Leave to raise it is refused.
Ground 6:  Trial miscarried by reason of Crown prosecutor (allegedly) raising unestablished false evidence as fact
109This ground repeats the complaint noted above concerning the identity of ""Professor Von Wheeler"" from the University of New South Wales. The appellant asserts that evidence has emerged that there is such a person at the University of New South Wales, and that he misspelt her name at the trial.  This evidence was not produced on the appeal and the Crown submitted that, even if it was, it would not meet the test for fresh evidence.  Accordingly, it submitted that there would only be a miscarriage of justice if the appellant satisfies this Court that the new evidence is such that, taken with the evidence at the trial, the conclusion should be drawn that he was innocent or that his guilt was not established beyond reasonable doubt so that the verdict cannot be allowed to stand (Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 520).
110It is unnecessary to address all of these contentions.  The suggestion that there was no such professor at the University of New South Wales was made once in cross examination and not pressed.  When it was made the appellant did not deny it, only stating that he had been told of that person's existence by John Griffiths.  The point made by the Crown Prosecutor to the jury with considerable force was that the appellant appeared to have little knowledge of the ventures he was pursuing which he said required him to travel to Nepal. The existence or otherwise of the professor at the University of New South Wales was of little significance to that contention.  Even if the contention put by the Crown Prosecutor that the professor did not exist was wrong, and that has not been demonstrated, that does not come close to establishing a miscarriage of justice.
111Leave to raise this ground is refused.
Ground 7: Alleged failure of trial judge to grant defence counsel permission to retain assistance
112Ground 7 complains that the trial judge wrongly prevented the appellant's fiancé from providing assistance to his counsel.
113At some point in the trial the appellant's fiancé commenced sitting at the bar table taking notes. Just after the appellant's cross examination commenced, an issue arose in the absence of the jury and the trial judge inquired as to who she was and her status.  Her Honour commented that she should not be ""sitting in front of the bar then unless she is a lawyer"".  Her Honour then specifically advised the appellant that, while under cross examination, he could not consult with anyone about the evidence he had given, including counsel, the appellant's solicitors and his fiancé.  However, contrary to the appellant's contention, his fiancé was not prevented from providing assistance to his counsel and nor did his counsel complain that he was being denied assistance from her.
114Rule 4 applies to this ground.  Leave to raise it is refused.
Ground 8:  Alleged denial by trial judge of (avenue of) cross examination of key witness (Thurling)
115Ground 8 alleges that a miscarriage of justice occurred because of ""the trial judge's decision to suspend [the] questioning"" of Thurling ""given the history of the trial judge's involvement in the proceedings"". It was contended that the ""pre-existing bias of the trial judge prior to trial commencement, due to familiarity with the co-accused's trial and the familiarity with Griffiths' sentencing, has influenced her decisions throughout the [appellant's] proceedings"".
116The background to the entry of a plea of guilty by Thurling to a charge of knowingly participate in the manufacture of methylamphetamine has been discussed above (at [67]).  During the cross examination of Thurling, counsel for the appellant asked:  ""You weren't asked to enter a plea in the District Court to anything that stated that you were involved [in], [or] aided and abetted, an importation of a border controlled substance"".  At this point the trial judge sent the jury out.  Her Honour explained the background against which Thurling came to enter a plea of guilty.  During the exchange her Honour stated to the appellant's counsel:
""Obviously you are entitled to cross examine her about all of that but I just thought it was fair that you knew some of the background of all of that, it is a somewhat peculiar case in that respect.""
117The appellant's counsel considered what her Honour stated and advised the Court that ""you have alerted me to - the legal [complexity] is such that the forensic advantage is worthless now that I understand the overall situation"".  The jury then returned and counsel for the appellant resumed questioning Thurling by reference to the charge she pleaded guilty to.
118The purpose of the trial judge's intervention was to bring to counsel for the appellant's attention the relatively complex legal background to the entry of a plea by Thurling.  Her Honour did so because her Honour correctly apprehended that once that was made known to counsel for the appellant, he would appreciate that a lay person such as Thurling may not be able to provide much insight into the course of events that led to the charge against her changing from being knowingly involved in an importation to knowingly take part in manufacture.  However, her Honour did not disallow any question or make any direction or order. Instead her Honour left it to counsel to exercise his judgment as to what line of questioning would be taken up with Thurling.
119This course of events does not reveal any defect in the trial, or any other matter that might give rise to a miscarriage of justice.  It does not give rise to any possible basis for a claim of bias on the part of the trial judge by reason of her Honour's knowledge of the course of proceedings against either Thurling or Garcia.  To the contrary, her Honour used her knowledge to ""intervene"" in a manner that assisted the appellant and his counsel.
120This ground fails.
Ground 9:  The trial judge erred in giving a direction as to recklessness
121Ground 9 alleges that the trial judge erred in directing the jury as to ""recklessness"" and, in particular, her Honour's instructions ""given on recklessness were vague and expressed to encompass the lack of requirement for the Crown to prove their assertion [that] the [appellant] intentionally imported pseudoephedrine"". 
122The substance of this complaint has been addressed in dealing with Ground 1.  Her Honour directed the jury that the Crown had to prove that the accused was reckless as to whether ""what was inside [the] water pump was a border controlled precursor"".  Her Honour did so in terms that reflect s 5.4 of the Code.  Her Honour also reminded them that the Crown case was that not only was the appellant ""reckless about that, but [he] knew full well what was inside the water pump"". 
123Her Honour's direction as to recklessness was clearly not erroneous. To the contrary it was mandated by s 307.11(2).
124This ground fails.
Ground 10:  Her Honour incorrectly characterised an aspect of the appellant's case in the summing up as a ""red herring""
125Ground 10 complains about the manner in which the trial judge directed the jury concerning the relevance of that part of the appellant's evidence in which he asserted that ultimately he came to the belief that Garcia had secreted pseudoephedrine in the water filters that he, the appellant, had purchased in Bangkok.  In particular, the appellant complains about her Honour's description of this part of his evidence as a ""red herring"".
126In summing up the Crown case her Honour stated to the jury:
""Another thing that this case is not about, is what may or may not have been hidden inside some stainless steel water filters that may or may not have come by DHL ...
... the accused says that towards the end of the series of telephone conversations, he had become aware for the first time that Mr Garcia and others were in fact engaging in or about to engage in the manufacture of a drug using pseudoephedrine...[the appellant] thought that it was and this is based on what Garcia had said to him he claimed that it was pseudoephedrine secreted inside stainless water filters ...
...
Well ladies and gentleman not only would you be careful about it but it is no part of the Crown case that, even if you accept the accused's evidence about his state of mind in relation to that importation that he became aware of after he had gone into custody, it is no part of the Crown's case that that constitutes the subject matter of this charge, nor could it be I direct you in the circumstances.
If at the end of the day all you are satisfied about is that the accused in those conversations was talking about an importation of pseudoephedrine of which he had acquired knowledge that was contained in some stainless steel water flights that in fact were his because they had been bought for him by Mr Garcia and were being sent back to Australia - if that is all you are satisfied about at the end of the day, then you would have to acquit the accused because not only is it not part of the Crown case that this is the subject matter of the charge, but it could not be either, as a matter of law I direct you.""  (emphasis added)
127Against this background her Honour then directed the jury as follows:
""... if all you come away with is a belief that the accused was talking about some later acquired knowledge of an actual importation taking place between Garcia and perhaps others in relation to which he had secreted some pseudoephedrine inside these stainless steel water filters that he was going to use with others to make methylamphetamine from, that the accused himself became aware of but did not say anything about [it] for a variety of reasons, including that he did not want to be a dog and did not want to be labelled as such in the prison system all for good reason, but in fact I tell you that that is in fact something of a red herring you might think because it is not part of the Crown case, could never [be] the subject matter of this charge and it is not something that you need to concern yourselves with as part of the proof that the Crown seeks to rely on as part of the circumstances in this trial otherwise."" (emphasis added)
128These directions did no disservice to the appellant.  To the contrary, what they clearly conveyed to the jury was that, if they accepted his evidence concerning his belief as to the contents of the water filters sent by air cargo, they could not use that evidence as a basis for finding him guilty of importation and instead should acquit him. Her Honour in effect directed the jury that they could not convict him of a different importation to that charged and alleged by the Crown.
129Later, in the absence of the jury, counsel for the appellant raised with her Honour the use of the phrase ""red herring"" in this context. In the ensuing discussion the trial judge (correctly) explained that the reference to it being a ""red herring"" was in the context of the Crown case, and in particular was designed to avoid the jury ""accepting [the appellant's] belief about [the filters]"" as a basis for finding him guilty of the offence he was charged with.  Counsel for the appellant told the Court that he was ""going to leave this alone"". His judgment on this question was undoubtedly right. The appellant's position was that, contrary to the Crown case, he was not orchestrating the importation with which he was charged, but was instead informed of a different importation and was discussing his likely receipt of the proceeds of that importation. This was a particularly unattractive aspect of his defence.  A direction to the jury that they should not convict him of the charged offence based upon that aspect of his evidence was clearly in his interest.  It was the most advantageous direction he could have reasonably anticipated.
130Rule 4 applies to this ground.  Leave to raise it is refused.
Ground 11:  Trial judge erred in giving directions on provision not relied on by the Crown
131Although ground 11 is expressed in terms that appear to complain about her Honour's directions, the written submissions in support of the ground are mostly unintelligible.  The Crown characterised this ground as a complaint concerning the decision to charge Garcia with aiding and abetting the importation and the appellant with importation when, according to the appellant, the ""true issue"" between the Crown and the appellant ""was one of accessorial liability under s 11.2 of the Criminal Code"".  The appellant appears to complain that this issue could not be adjudicated by the jury because the appellant was not charged as an accessory to the importation.
132If this is the complaint, it has no substance.  It was clearly open to the Crown on the available evidence to accept a plea from Garcia to aiding and abetting the importation, especially given that he also pleaded to knowingly take part in the manufacture of the prohibited drug methyl-amphetamine contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  The entirety of the evidence was clearly capable of proving that the appellant was the principal in the importation.
133This ground fails.
Ground 12:  Failure to discharge member of the jury
134Ground 12 complains that the failure of the trial judge to discharge a juror occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
135The Crown Prosecutor opened the Crown case to the jury on 14 February 2011.  The first witness was called that day.  On 23 February 2011 the jury sent a note advising that one juror was travelling overseas for work on 9 March 2011.  On 1 March 2011 the juror advised that the flight could be put back to 14 March 2011.  The matter was reconsidered on 9 March 2011.  At that point the accused was in the middle of being cross examined.  The juror was brought into Court in the absence of the other jurors.  He explained that he had ""flexi tickets"" and had made ""allowances [to] extend once again"".  The juror confirmed that he was ""free to remain"" and did not wish to make an application to be excused.  No application was made by either the Crown or counsel for the appellant that the juror be discharged then or at any later point.  The jury retired to consider its verdict at 11.56am on 16 March 2011 and returned with a verdict of guilty on at 12.25pm on 18 March 2011. 
136Nothing in this history of events warranted the discharge of the juror. Neither the juror, the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the appellant asked for the juror to be discharged.  Rule 4 applies to this complaint.  Leave to raise it is refused.
Ground 13:  Trial judge failed to provide jury with aide memoire or ""comprehensive explanation of summing up""
137The particular complaint made by the appellant in relation to this ground is as follows:
""After Jury retired for verdict on 16 March 2011 at 11.56am, Trial Judge failed to appear or reconvene at court that morning until 3.30pm 17 March 2011 [when] she had a court officer check on the jury progress. A Jury note was then presented asking for a copy of [the] summing up transcript to clarify some things. Judge declined the request, stating the transcripts were not available. The jury informed the Judge they had questions regarding recklessness amongst other things (T16/03/11 p99). The Judge informed the jury to take the 'literal meaning' ('from the dictionary', this second statement has not been recorded in transcripts instructions to obtain audio has [sic] not been followed through by prior counsel, defendant has been unable to obtain a copy), no further clarification was made as to the elements in which this fault element can apply.
...
Trial Judge adjourned after this to reconvene with any unanswered question in the morning of day 3 of deliberations. Judge appeared in court at approximately 11am [when] she informed counsel that the jury are still working on their questions (T18/03/11 p 101). The jury were never called into court for further assistance. At approximately 12pm [the] Trial judge informs that 'there has been no note forthcoming and they are continuing their deliberations'.""
138The balance of the submissions also complain that the trial judge erred in proceeding to take a verdict while the jury still had questions to be answered, citing R v TAB [2002] NSWCCA 274 at [72] per Levine J.
139These submissions misstate what occurred following the jury retiring to consider their verdict.  At around 4pm on 16 March 2011 the trial judge reconvened and adjourned the proceedings to the next day, 17 March 2011.  The transcript for the next day does not record whether the Court reconvened at 10am, but it is clear that the jury assembled and resumed their deliberations.  Sometime between 3.30pm and 4.00pm the jury sent a note asking for a ""written copy of the judge's final directions"". Her Honour reconvened and advised the jury that there was no written version of the summing up available at that time, but also pointed out that they were entitled to further assistance.  Her Honour invited the jury to be a ""bit more specific"" and ""tell me what is that you want"".  The foreperson said that the jury had been discussing ""some of the definitions of the words, like recklessness"".  The trial judge then asked if they could ""put that down into a note for me tomorrow, those areas where you think you need more assistance"".  Contrary to the appellant's submissions, the trial judge did not tell the jury that they should rely on a dictionary or use the ""literal"" meaning of recklessness.
140The transcript for the next day records that the jury did not send any note seeking clarification of any matter.  Instead they sent a note indicating they had reached a verdict. 
141All this reveals is that whatever initial concerns the jury had in relation to the meaning of recklessness, they were resolved.  This is not surprising. To satisfy the other elements of the charge under s 307.11 the jury had to be satisfied that the appellant ""intentionally imported the substance into Australia"".  In the context of this trial it meant that the jury had to be satisfied that he orchestrated the secretion of the ground down tablets into the water pump and its delivery to Australia. If the jury were satisfied of that, a conclusion that he was reckless as to whether the substance inside the water pump was a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, was inevitable. 
142Her Honour did not err in either failing to prevent the jury from deliberating while a transcript of the summing up was obtained, or failing to redirect them on the meaning of recklessness.  No complaint in that regard was made by the appellant's counsel.  Rule 4 applies to this complaint.  Leave to raise it is refused.
Ground 14:  The trial judge failed to afford the appellant procedural fairness
143Under this ground the appellant put forward a collection of complaints about the fairness of the trial.  In part, he repeats the complaints made in relation to ground 13 concerning the alleged failure of the trial judge to provide the jury with assistance after it had retired to consider its verdict.  Those complaints have already been rejected.  He also complains that the juror who had plans to fly overseas for work was under time pressure, and it amounted to a miscarriage of justice to not discharge that juror after deliberations commenced.  This complaint has also been rejected.  The time taken by the jury to reach a verdict in this case, being approximately two days, does not reveal a rush to judgment on its part. The juror had already indicated that arrangements to extend the departure date of his flight had been made.  If, prior to the jury retiring, the juror was experiencing any further difficulties in extending the departure date then it can be expected that he would have brought this to the trial judge's attention as he had previously.
144The appellant's submissions under this ground also repeat the allegations of bias against the trial judge. Nothing in the submissions supports those allegations.
145This ground fails.
Conclusion on conviction appeal
146Leave to raise grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 13 of the conviction appeal is refused.  Leave to raise ground 15 is granted but the ground is rejected.  The balance of the grounds are rejected. The appeal against the conviction will be dismissed. 
Sentencing appeal
147At all times the Court below was, and this Court is, exercising federal jurisdiction.  One source of that jurisdiction was and is s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), which makes applicable the right of appeal sourced in ss 5 and 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act:  see Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at [237] and Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [8] and [90]-[92].  In that fashion there is avoided ""the establishment of two independent systems of justice"" for offences against State and federal laws:  R v Murphy (1985) 158 CLR 596 at 617.  Section 68(11) confirms that any other federal investment of jurisdiction, such as by Judiciary Act s 39(2), continues to apply, but nothing turns on that for present purposes.
148Section 68(2) makes applicable the requirement contained in s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act for leave to appeal against sentence.  The question is whether this Court holds the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed; if so then s 6(3) requires the sentence to be quashed and a new sentence imposed in substitution therefor. Although some questions remain as to the precise nature of the appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act: see Banovec v R [2012] NSWCCA 137 at [19] (Basten JA), it is not necessary for present purposes to address them.
149In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704, Spigelman CJ emphasised that two positive opinions were necessary to be formed in an appeal pursuant to ss 5(1)(c) and 6(3): first, that there was error and secondly, that ""some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed"".  Each is an ""essential pre-condition"" for an exercise of power under s 6(3).  Even if error is identified, it must be material, that is, not technical or trivial in nature (Maldonado v R [2009] NSWCCA 189 at [19]) and it is ""not appropriate to make minor adjustments to the result in order only to give some practical recognition of or endorsement to the identified error if it is not otherwise warranted"":  Tabuan v R [2013] NSWCCA 143 at [28].  As Tabuan indicates, the residual discretion to decline relief which would constitute ""tinkering"" applies to all sentencing appeals, not merely Crown appeals, although that is where it is most commonly observed:  Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [62]; R v Woodland [2007] NSWCCA 29 at [53]; R v KB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [77].
150The sentencing judge was obliged to impose a sentence that was ""of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"" by reason of s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act, and to take into account the various matters identified in s 16A(2).  
151The applicable principles are well-established.  Sentencing judges have a ""substantial discretion"", as this Court said in Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562, with which interference is warranted only if it is demonstrated that the sentencing judge fell into ""material error of law or fact"".  That decision was approved in Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15]:
""The principles according to which an appellate court may interfere with such a discretionary judgment by a sentencing judge are well established. In their application to a Crown appeal against sentence they were summarised in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 and R v Clarke [1996] 2 VR 520. Of particular importance in the present case is the principle that a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. This is basic:  House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice.""
152In Adzioski v R [2013] NSWCCA 69 at [61], after referring to, inter alia, Allpass and Lowndes, Hoeben CJ at CL said, with the agreement of Slattery and Bellew JJ:
""While those statements of principle were given in cases involving Crown appeals, they are not restricted to appeals of that kind but are of general application. One needs to approach the sentencing task by reference to the facts found by the sentencing judge and his application of principle.""
153All those decisions reinforce the basic principle that the sentencing judge is required to perform a difficult balancing exercise, which very often involves competing and contradictory considerations:  Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [76]-[77], and that the onus lies upon the appellant to establish material error.
The sentencing judge's remarks on sentence
154The sentencing occurred on 23 January 2012, some months after conviction. The sentencing judge (who was also the trial judge) expressly addressed s 16A of the Crimes Act, and after stating as the ""overriding principle"" the obligation in s 16A(1), turned to address the nature and circumstances of the offence.  That involved two main elements.  The first was a detailed summary of the Statement of Facts which had been prepared by the Crown, dealing with the factual matters giving rise to conviction.  The second, which is important insofar as the appeal on sentence is concerned, was that the sentencing judge expressly proceeded on the basis that the jury's verdict coupled with the evidence confirmed that the role of the appellant was that of ""organiser"" or ""principal"" of the operations, something to which further attention is directed below.  The sentencing judge referred to the need for the sentence to reflect an element of general deterrence, the absence of a plea of guilty, and the fact that the appellant was on parole at the time (albeit not for a drug related offence), leading to the need for an element of specific deterrence. 
155The sentencing judge referred to the pre-sentence report and a psychological report from Mr Watson-Munro, not all of which she accepted, and some statements and references including from the appellant and his partner, which, once again, her Honour was unable to accept at face value.  Her Honour singled out for criticism the assertions in those statements that the appellant had no family and that he was a person of good character, especially in light of his criminal record.  That record included convictions and sentences to terms of imprisonment for four offences including aggravated indecent assault of a child under sixteen, act of indecency with a child under ten, and doing an act with the intention of perverting the course of justice.  At the time the offence the subject of this appeal was committed, the appellant was subject to a community service order of 300 hours for the offence of possessing child pornography, and he was also subject to the parole portion of a suspended sentence he had received for disseminating or producing child pornography.  He had been taken into custody for breaching parole, which was when the telephone calls referred to above were recorded.
156Her Honour referred to the family background of the appellant, the death of his father when he was eleven, the death of his mother when he was twenty-four, the death of his stepfather, and the relationship with Ms Elke Rautenberg, who was described as appearing to be ""somewhat naïve and trusting in relation to his earlier offences"".  There was reference to the intelligence and musical ability of the appellant, and his work history, which led to the likelihood that he would be able to obtain full employment when he was released.  However, her Honour referred to the fact that he taught children while on bail, a matter to which it will be necessary to return.  Her Honour assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as reasonable.  Her Honour referred to the conditions of his bail which were ""quite strict"", preventing him from returning to Wagga Wagga.  
157Finally her Honour referred to the question of parity or relativity.  She noted that there was no strict parity arising because of the different nature of the offences between the appellant and a co-offender, but accepted that issues of relativity did arise, in reliance on which her Honour came to the conclusion that an overall term of imprisonment of seven and a half years was called for. 
158In determining the length of the non-parole period, her Honour allowed for the delay both in the trial and the sentence proceedings, and that for some of the time the appellant had been on bail including initially daily reporting.  Her Honour also had regard to the reality that the non-parole period would be served in two separate periods with the bail intervening, amounting to a more onerous impact and the fact that his time in prison would be served on protection (having regard to the earlier offending behaviour), which to an extent made his experience in gaol more onerous.
159For those reasons her Honour set a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing from 13 November 2010 to allow for the pre-trial custody of four months and six days.  Her Honour rejected the submission that there should be ""a little further back dating"" to reflect totality. 
160Each of the appellant's grounds of appeal on sentence is addressed in turn below, using the language from his notice of appeal.  Ground 1:  Misconduct and negligence of Counsel and legal representation
161This ground resembles ground 1 of the appeal on conviction.  The appellant advances an elaborate series of arguments, which include serious allegations of misconduct by his former counsel and by the Crown. It is convenient to address them chronologically.  First, complaint is made about the barrister and solicitor appearing for him immediately after conviction, whom he advised the Court on 5 August 2011 he had sacked.  The appellant relies on text messages sent by Ms Rautenberg to his then lawyers.  The gravamen of the complaint includes the delay caused by an adjournment, the failure to follow instructions, the fact that an adjournment was sought and granted in the absence of the appellant, and seemingly the failure to secure bail after conviction. 
162It is neither possible nor necessary on the materials before the Court to determine the correctness or otherwise of all of the factual matters, although in evidence was a letter from the appellant's former barrister dated 25 July 2011 which included the following (emphasis in original):
""Your sentence was adjourned as you indicated you wished to provide police with relevant information for which you hoped to gain a discount.  If you changed your mind that is a matter for you.  The sentence would have been completed but for this decision.  The delay was caused by you alone. ... I will appear at your sentence to advise Judge Tupman that I can no longer act for you.  I don't need to go into detail as to why unless you insist.""
163Further, on 4 November 2011, the sentencing judge said this:
""I've also been told, or it's been suggested to me, that there have been delays in the sentence caused by the court or others.  The sentence has been adjourned twice in the past on the application of the offender, and they can shake their heads as much as they like in the back of the court to that proposition.  The fact is that the first time it was adjourned on the application of the offender through his counsel for matters that they wished to raise... The second time it was adjourned in ... circumstances [where] he withdrew his instructions from counsel and it became clear that there was a Legal Aid review application in place.""
164However, whatever be the circumstances which occurred prior to August 2011, none is shown to have led to any material error when sentence was imposed in January 2012.
165The second tranche of complaints is directed to the counsel and solicitor retained to appear on the sentencing hearing.  The complaints (which overlap) are a failure to clarify instructions, negligent preparation, and the failure to seek transcripts.  The appellant says that ""[t]he transcripts of past hearings were never supplied"" and that counsel did not have a chance to read the summing up which was supplied by the Crown on the day of the sentencing hearing.  
166However, newly retained counsel said he had been briefed with a copy of the transcripts of the hearing, and sought transcripts of the summing up on the first occasion and said that he obtained them prior to the sentencing hearing.  At the sentencing hearing counsel relied on written and oral submissions.  The written submissions are replete with transcript references, and concisely and effectively advance a wide range of factual and legal matters in the appellant's favour. 
167It is true, as the appellant points out, that counsel said that the summing up ""has only just been made available to me and I haven't finished reading all of it but I've got most of the way through"".  However, there is no basis on the material before the Court for concluding that there was any failure to advance points which properly could have been advanced on behalf of the appellant at the sentencing hearing, let alone any such failure as to constitute negligence or misconduct by counsel then retained.  For those reasons, this ground lacks substance.
Ground 2:  Crown raised sentencing matters known to be false, resulting in a miscarriage of justice
168The gravamen of this ground is a complaint that the Court was told, falsely, that the appellant had requested to meet with police to give further evidence in May 2011 and then refused to meet police in June 2011.  The appellant maintains such a request was never made, and no attendance by police was made while the appellant was in custody.  However, it is clear on the evidence before the Court that counsel then retained for the appellant believed that he had instructions to apply for an adjournment on the basis that the appellant wished to meet with police.  
169There is nothing to indicate that anything that happened in May or June 2011 led to any material error when sentencing occurred the following year.  The sentencing judge's remarks did not mention this issue at all, except insofar as it was an element of the delay between sentence and conviction (""In determining the length of the non-parole period I take into account the fact that for a series of reasons there has been a delay ..."") and to that extent it was favourable to the appellant.  It is appropriate to add that there is nothing in the material to which this Court has been directed that is capable of substantiating the serious allegation made by the appellant in support of this ground. 
170This ground fails.
Ground 3:  Sentencing judge bias resulted in a miscarriage of justice
171This complaint is principally based upon an exchange between the appellant and the judge on 5 August 2011 (when he represented himself) and the sentencing judge's finding that he was the principal, contrary to the submissions advanced on his behalf on 19 January 2012.  The appellant says that in the exchange in August 2011, he felt that ""the bias from Her Honour was not allowing his arguments to be heard"".  There is nothing in this complaint.  The Court has read the entirety of the transcript of that hearing, in the course of which there is nothing that could possibly amount to apparent or actual bias.  The appellant did not distinguish between the two, and it is appropriate to proceed on the significantly lower standard of apprehended bias: see Rouvinetis v Knoll [2013] NSWCA 24 at [10].  The appellant needed to identify the matter which might lead the judge to decide the case other than on its legal and factual merits, and he needed to articulate the logical connection between that matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits:  Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; 205 CLR 337 at [8]; Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; 244 CLR 427 at [63].  Nothing that took place in August 2011 might cause an informed bystander to conclude that her Honour might judge the case other than on its merits.  To the extent that the complaint is that her Honour found that he was a principal, for the reasons already expressed that finding was open to her.
172One aspect of this ground extends to what occurred on 19 January 2012.  For example, the appellant submits that:  (transcript references omitted)
""For example, defence counsel raises ABN number, in which Her Honour defends the Crown's inference by saying, 'Garcia wouldn't know an ABN number if it came and hit him in the head.'  The defendant argues that the clear inference is available given Garcia himself was a director of Tweed Scientific with John Griffith, and ABN details existed in evidence in the Crown's Case of which Garcia confirmed [sic].""
173Essentially this amounts to no more than a complaint, labelled as bias, that her Honour rejected the submission that was being advanced.  But as Basten JA said in Barakat v Goritsas (No 2) [2012] NSWCA 36 at [40]:
""No authority is needed for the proposition that an apprehension of bias, in the sense of an apprehension of prejudgment, does not mean an apprehension that the case will be determined adversely to the interests of the complaining party. It means a reasonable apprehension that the trial judge has formed a fixed view, to which it may be expected that he or she will adhere, regardless of the evidence or the submissions made by the complaining party.""
174This ground fails. Ground 4:  Sentencing judge erred in consideration of psychology report, resulting in prejudicial unfairness 
175The short point is that in her sentencing remarks, her Honour had regard to the report, accepted that the appellant ""is currently suffering from some depression and anxiety"", but discounted the weight to be given to the report. It was plainly open for her Honour to take that approach. 
176The appellant also complains that regard should have been had to a favourable character reference provided by the father of two of his students (who was also, apparently, a psychologist).  That complaint is ill-founded, as the letter was merely tendered as a character reference.
177This ground fails.
Ground 5:  Erroneous pre-sentence report content and procedure resulted in a miscarriage of justice
Ground 6:  Sentencing judge erred by acting on facts adverse to the defendant without proof beyond reasonable doubt, contrary to law in section 21A of Sentencing Act
178These two grounds are closely related.  Twice within her Honour's sentencing remarks there was mention of the appellant's disregard for the law. The passages are as follows (emphasis added): 
""He is a gifted musician and whilst on bail from January 2009 worked as a guitarist both in performance and teaching in Sydney. That, in general terms, should be seen as a positive but it operates as something of a concern in relation to this offender because I accept from the evidence and references and reports tendered that this included his teaching children. He was at the time subject to the provisions of the Sex Offenders' Register and there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that any of these employers or individuals were notified of or became aware of his background. That has two ramifications on sentence. One is that it is some further evidence, together with the fact that he committed the offence on parole, of his disregard for the law and the other is that he apparently proposes to continue teaching guitar presumably including teaching children when released on parole. All of that reflects on his lack of insight and amounts to some caution in relation to an assessment of his real prospects of rehabilitation.""
""It would appear that there was no further offending whilst on bail and his bail conditions were quite strict, initially including daily reporting. He was prevented from returning to Wagga. He has not been charged with any other offending behaviour whilst on bail. Of course, that particular consideration if it goes to demonstrated rehabilitation whilst on bail, must always be viewed in the light of what on the facts appears to be his disregard for his legal obligations given that he was teaching children, which at least on its face would appear to be contrary to his obligations as a person on the Sex Offender's Register.""
179On a fair reading of those passages, it is reasonable to infer that they played some not insignificant part in the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.
180Counsel for the Crown, Mr O'Donnell, candidly conceded that there was no evidence to support the finding by the trial judge that the appellant was a person on the Child Protection Register (often known as the Sex Offenders' Register).  Although the pre-sentence report expressed concern that the appellant taught music to children in the inner city, it did not go so far as to assert a breach of bail conditions.
181It would appear that the appellant is a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000.  A letter dated 29 April 2013 addressed to the Registrar of this Court from Detective Sergeant Fenwich, Investigations Manager of the NSW Police Force, which was tendered without objection on appeal, attached a copy of an acknowledgement form for the Child Protection Register signed by the appellant on 6 September 2010.  What is not clear, however, is whether the appellant undertook acts prohibited under Part 7 of the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998, the relevant Act in force at the time the appellant was added to the Child Protection Register, related to child-related employment, which would support the sentencing judge's findings that the appellant had acted contrary to his obligations as a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act.  Indeed, in the 29 April 2013 letter, Detective Sergeant Fenwich stated that the appellant had not been charged for any breach of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act. 
182On a fair reading of her Honour's sentencing remarks, her Honour was proceeding on the basis that the appellant had contravened his legal obligations.  That was something of which her Honour was required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt:  Leach v R [2007] HCA 3; 230 CLR 1 at [41]; Whitmore v R [2010] NSWCCA 157 at [93].  It will be seen that her Honour in both cases expressed her conclusion tentatively (""some further evidence""; ""presumably including teaching children""; ""what on the facts appears to be his disregard"").  However, those matters were irrelevant to the sentencing discretion unless they were established beyond reasonable doubt, and there was no basis in the material before her Honour to reach that conclusion to that standard.  What is more, it does not appear to have been something that was put to the appellant's counsel for a response.
183The foregoing discloses appellable error.  The remainder of the grounds will be addressed before returning to the consequences of establishing these grounds.
Ground 7:  Sentencing judge erred in consideration of onerous bail conditions
184There is no dispute that the sentencing remarks of the judge had regard to, expressly, the fact that the appellant had been on bail, including daily reporting initially, in determining the length of the non-parole period.  The substance of the complaint is that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the onerous nature of the reporting conditions, which included preventing the appellant from returning to Wagga Wagga, with the result that his business and home needed to be sold.  The short answer is that it was not necessary for her Honour to go further than she did this respect.  Her Honour expressly recognised that ""his bail conditions were quite strict, initially including daily reporting"", and expressly took into account ""that for a series of reasons there has been a delay both in the trial and the sentence proceedings and that for some of the time the offender has been on bail including initially daily reporting"".  
185As this Court said in R v Anderson [2012] NSWCCA 175 at [43]: 
""Once it is accepted that it may be appropriate in some circumstances to give a discount of 50% in respect of bail conditions the determination of what an appropriate discount might be in a given case is a discretionary judgment for the Sentencing judge. Accordingly, an error of the type referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 must be shown.""
186No such error is disclosed on the material before this Court, except perhaps to the extent addressed in grounds 5 and 6 above.  This ground fails.
Ground 8:  Sentencing judge erred in application of parity rule, resulting in procedural unfairness and miscarriage of justice
187This ground focuses on Mr Garcia, who was sentenced to a term of four years with a non-parole period of two and a half years for aiding and abetting the importation.  It was plainly open to the sentencing judge to form the view that Ms Thurling had a very different role.
188The starting point here is that although there were co-offenders in a broader sense, Mr Garcia and Ms Thurling were charged with different offences.  As the High Court noted in Green v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [30] the parity principle can apply in those circumstances:
""Those practical difficulties and limitations [of the difference between crimes of participants in the same criminal enterprise, and the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions] however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""
189The fundamental fact was that the sentencing judge correctly formed the view that there was ""no strict parity arising"", but had regard to questions of ""relativity"", which is apt to include the broader application of parity. Her Honour formed the view that the appellant was ""the only person who knew all of the details necessary to follow up the consignment"" and that the intercepted telephone calls ""had the flavour of the offender's directing the other two to ensure that the importation and delivery occurred"".  For the reasons given in relation to the appeal against conviction, no error is thereby disclosed.
190Appellate intervention on review on the basis of parity and relativity is a consequence of the appearance that justice has not been done:  Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610.  However, as French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said in Green at [31]-[32]:
""The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.
A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.""  
191In the present case, no appellable error is shown in the way the sentencing judge took into account the sentence of Mr Garcia.  This ground fails.
Ground 9: Sentencing delay resulted in procedural unfairness, and a miscarriage of justice
192The appellant's complaint is primarily directed, once again, to the delay between conviction and sentence.  In oral submissions, the appellant also referred to the delay between arrest and trial.  The short answer is that the sentencing judge expressly took into account that ""for a series of reasons there has been a delay both in the trial and the sentence proceedings"".   No appellable error is disclosed.  This ground fails.
Ground 10:  Amendment in Commonwealth Law resulted in excessive undue stress and a miscarriage of justice 
193The appellant complains that ""Due to recent amendments, [he] now falls under the new law stating Federal Inmates must now sit before the state Probation and Parole Board"".  He said in his oral submissions that when he was first sentenced, the sentencing judge alluded to parole being ""an automatic thing, that date [of parole] is an automatic time"".  He said that when he discussed parole with NSW Probation and Parole Board he was informed that they would ""not be advancing [the appellant's] earliest release"" but instead asking that it be held off.  
194It seems that the ""recent amendments"" to which the appellant alludes in his written and oral submissions are contained within Schedule 7 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Act 2012 (Cth), which commenced on 4 October 2012.  Prior to the commencement of the relevant part of this Act, federal offenders serving sentences of imprisonment of less than 10 years were released automatically upon the expiry of their non-parole period via a parole order made by the federal Attorney-General who had no discretion to refuse to release the prisoner on parole:  Crimes Act, former s 19AL.  The 2012 Act has abolished the automatic granting of parole.  It has been replaced by the requirement that the Attorney-General, before the end of a prisoner's non-parole period, makes, or refuses to make, a parole order directing the person be released from prison on parole:  current s 19AL.  The introduction of this discretion enables the Attorney-General to consider reports from State and Territory corrective service agencies on the offender's behaviour in prison:  House of Representatives, Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011, Explanatory Memorandum at 133.  One of the reasons cited for this change was the ability, prior to the amendments, of federal child sex offenders to ""refuse to participate in sex offender treatment programs, as they know they will be released at the end of their non-parole period regardless"".  Under the new arrangements it is thought that ""[o]ffenders would be encouraged to take part in rehabilitation programs if they knew that this would be taken into account in deciding whether they should be released on parole"" (House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 23 November 2011 at 13549).
195These recent amendments apply to the appellant's current term of imprisonment in relation to the importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor, as outlined in item 12(2)(a), Schedule 7 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Act.  However, there can be no error in the exercise of discretion by reason of legislation which was not then enacted, no differently from any other fact which did not exist at the time of sentencing:  Khoury [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [110] (Simpson J).
196This ground fails.
Ground 11:  Sentence manifestly excessive, resulting undue grievance 
197The relevant test in relation to ""manifest excess"" was restated in Papworth v R [2011] NSWCCA 253 at [53]-[55] (Hoeben J (as he then was) with whom Whealy JA and Simpson J agreed), and applied in Adzioski at [71]-[72] by Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Slattery and Bellew JJ agreed) (most citations omitted):
"" ...  'The relevant test is relation to 'manifest excess' was restated in R v Hayek [2010] NSWCCA 139:
""57...the task is not for this Court to decide whether it would have exercised its discretion differently. The applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was 'unreasonable or plainly unjust'.""
While consistency in sentencing is an important consideration and a desirable goal, this Court has repeatedly endorsed the principle in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 that the relevant question on appeal is whether the sentences are within a proper range. It is not a question of whether other sentences can be said to be more or less lenient by undertaking a detailed analysis of other decided cases, as these often possess wide and divergent differences in their objective and subjective circumstances to which the sentencing judge may have attached particular weight.
In Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 the plurality reiterated at [54] - [55] the limited value of statistics and previously decided cases in the sentencing process. They concluded: 
""59 As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen, '[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion'. And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate 'is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases'. Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong, '[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons'. But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that 'the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error'.""'
It follows that to make out this ground, the applicant must satisfy the Court that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust.  The focus of the applicant's submission is the starting point of the sentence before the 25 percent discount. Such an approach deflects attention from the proper question. The question for this Court is whether the sentence actually imposed was unreasonable.""
198The appellant relies upon R v Chandler [2010] QCA 21, where a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years was imposed for a principal actor in the importation of pseudoephedrine.  However, Keane JA there pointed out at [15] that:
""The learned sentencing judge identified the applicant's early plea of guilty as the significant point in mitigation of sentence.""
199The sentencing judge with respect correctly viewed the guilty plea in Chandler as significant.  No case is established for the requisite unreasonableness or want of justice.
200It seems that the sentencing judge was not taken to them, but a comparison of other comparable sentences confirms the absence of any reviewable error.  For example, in R v Tran [2011] NSWDC 105, a sentence of six years and three months with a non-parole period of four years was imposed in respect of the importation of 1.818 kg of pseudoephedrine, where there was a late plea of guilty, evidence of remorse (see at [48]), good prospects of rehabilitation (see at [27], [41]) and the sentencing judge was not persuaded (to the criminal standard) that Mr Tran was the central person involved (see at [37]).  Mr Tran was 30 years old at the time sentence was passed.  On the other hand, in R v Seriban (Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, Martin CJ, 16 March 2009, unreported) and R v Petras (Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, Angel ACJ, 30 January 2009, unreported) sentences of 15 and 12 years, respectively, each backdated by approximately a year, were imposed in respect of a conspiracy to import some 10 kilograms of pseudoephedrine.  In the case of Petras, there was a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity.  Although all cases have their own distinguishing features, they may provide a useful yardstick (Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [304]). Those three examples illustrate the absence of unreasonableness or want of justice in the sentence imposed upon the appellant.
201To the extent that, in oral argument, a submission was advanced challenging the backdating of the sentence, the Crown accepted that because the appellant had been in custody between 25 September 2008 and 21 January 2009 (a period of four months and six days), it would be appropriate to backdate the sentence to take account of those periods in custody. The sentencing judge did so, but not fully. Her Honour formed the view that that was not called for, saying:
""Already backdating it to 13 November 2011 provides a degree of partial accumulation to reflect totality because otherwise he would not have been due for release to parole until 11 November 2008 and on this basis he had been given full credit for the full four months and six days he spent in custody, bailed refused, following his arrest.""
202No error is disclosed by this aspect of her Honour's decision.  This ground fails.
Discretion to re-sentence
203The existence of not insignificant error in relation to grounds 5 and 6 warrants a grant of leave to appeal against sentence.  However, that does not dictate that the appellant be re-sentenced.  On the facts of this case, it would be wrong to do so.  The second threshold question for this Court is whether it is of the opinion that ""some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed"". There has been an error as to one factual matter which was not proven beyond reasonable doubt by the sentencing judge.  True it is that her Honour referred to it twice, and this Court has proceeded on the basis (favourable to the appellant) that it may be regarded as a material matter to her decision.  However, the essential question for practical purposes is whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law.  The short point is that in light of the nature of the criminal enterprise, the level of the appellant's involvement in the crime, and his criminal background including his breach of his bail conditions, the appellant's sentence could easily have been more severe.  That is confirmed by the comparable sentences referred to above.  At the very least all members of the Court are positively satisfied that no lesser sentence is warranted in law.
204One thing should be added for completeness. It is true that the discretion reposed in this Court falls to be exercised in light of the legislative regime as it currently stands, which includes the 2012 federal legislation the subject of ground 10 of the sentence appeal: see Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [121]-[124] (Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed); Baxter [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [6]-[7] (Spigelman CJ, with whom Latham J agreed).  However, the fact that parole is no longer automatic, but now involves an assessment of the offender's behaviour, is not a matter which operates in the appellant's favour so as to cause any different exercise of discretion.
205In those circumstances, were this Court to re-sentence, the result would be at best a minor adjustment.  The authorities clearly state that it is not appropriate to re-sentence merely to make a minor adjustment.
206Leave to appeal against the sentence should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. 
207Accordingly, the orders of the Court are:
(1)Leave to raise ground 15 of the conviction appeal is granted.
(2)Leave to raise grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 13 of the conviction appeal is refused.
(3)The appeal against the appellant's conviction on 23 January 2012 is dismissed.
(4)Leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on 23 January 2012 is granted.
(5)The appeal against the sentence imposed on 23 January 2012 is dismissed.

		23 August 2013",2013-08-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762121,AP v R [2013] NSWCCA 189,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: The applicant was convicted by a jury on 2 August 2011 of three counts of sexual intercourse with child under ten contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. He was acquitted of other charges pursuant to ss 66A, 66EA and 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. On 7 October 2011, a head sentence of imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of 18 months was imposed in relation to each conviction, with different starting dates. 

2The overall term expires on 1 November 2014. The applicant was admitted to parole on 1 May 2013, following completion of the non-parole periods of his sentences. He continues to be at liberty, subject to parole.

3The single ground of the proposed appeal is that ""the trial judge failed to put the Appellant's case to the jury."" 

Leave to appeal is required

4The notice of appeal was filed on 29 April 2013. Although it is confined to a question of law, there are two reasons why leave is required. First, there was and is some confusion as to the extent to which an extension of time was required. The Court's Registrar appears to have extended time, repeatedly, until 26 April 2013. Even so, a notice of appeal was not filed until 29 April 2013. However, an earlier notice of appeal was filed on 26 July 2012, without legal assistance. The Crown took the view, properly, that it would not oppose a three-day extension of time if that were necessary. In the circumstances, the question of delay is of minor significance to the resolution of the application, although it is to be regretted that the delay has been such that the applicant has now been admitted to parole.

5Much more substantively, and as was (very properly) disclosed in the applicant's written submissions, counsel then appearing at the trial was asked by the primary judge whether he wanted a summing up on the facts. He said that he did not. No objection as to the adequacy of the summing up was made at the trial. Accordingly, leave is required by reason of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 

6In order to deal with the threshold question of leave, it is necessary first to deal with the factual and procedural background.

Background

7At the time of the offences, the applicant lived with his mother and sister in Tregear in western Sydney. At the time of the events the subject of the indictment, the complainant was four, later five, years old and lived next door. The applicant was aged fifteen, later sixteen. The complainant and her mother would often visit, and play in, and eat at, and occasionally sleep at, the applicant's house. The Crown case was that on three occasions in 2006 the applicant sexually or indecently assaulted the complainant when she visited him in his bedroom. The complainant was interviewed in 2006, but charges were not laid until 2009 following a further interview. When charged in 2009, the applicant was cautioned and exercised his right to remain silent. 

8On 25 July 2011, the applicant was arraigned, the jury empanelled and the Crown opened. The complainant (then aged nine) gave evidence on 26 and 27 July. Evidence was also given by the complainant's mother, her step-grandmother, three police officers, a doctor from the child protection unit at the Children's Hospital at Westmead, and two DNA experts (one called by the accused) relating to DNA evidence (addressed further below). The applicant and his sister gave evidence on 29 July (a Friday). On Monday 1 August 2011 the Crown and defence made their closing addresses and the judge summed up. His Honour commenced his summing up before lunchtime. The jury retired at 3.10pm, was recalled for a further direction given at the request of the Crown, and returned a verdict at 1.20pm on Tuesday 2 August 2011.

9The essence of the applicant's case at trial was that he denied the allegations, he was a person of good character, he said that the reliability of the complainant's first interview in 2006 was suspect, that there were inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence, and that the DNA evidence was flawed, or could be explained by innocent transfer. 

10The summing up by the trial judge did not deal separately with the defence case. His Honour commenced by referring in general terms to the submissions that had been made on behalf of the Crown and the accused earlier that morning. He addressed the onus of proof and said:

""The fact that the accused has given evidence and called evidence before you does not alter the burden of proof. The accused does not have to prove that his version is true. The Crown has to satisfy you the account given by the accused and his sister should not be accepted as a version of events that could reasonably be true.""

11When addressing the standard of proof, the judge said:

""The accused has given and called evidence in answer to the case led by the Crown. You have heard this on Friday. If, having considered that evidence and the submissions of both counsel in relation to it, you accept it, then, of course, you must acquit the accused and bring in a verdict of not guilty because it would follow that the Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt its case in relation to the essential matters that it must prove. However, as I have told you, there is no obligation on the accused to persuade you to accept that evidence. The Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that you should reject it as a reasonably possible version of the facts.""

12The trial judge addressed the importance of the evidence of the complainant, and said this:

""You must exercise caution before you convict the accused because the Crown case largely depends on your accepting the reliability of the evidence of a single witness. This being so, unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is both an honest and an accurate witness in the account she has given, you cannot find the accused guilty. Before you can convict the accused, you should examine the evidence of the complainant very carefully in order to satisfy yourselves that you can safely act upon that evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial.""

13On the DNA evidence, the judge gave a relatively extensive direction, which included the following:

""It is not a case of choosing between [the experts'] evidence. If you think that there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence of Dr McDonald, favouring the accused, taken in conjunction with all the other evidence, may be correct, then you should proceed on that basis. In other words in determining whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt you are required to take into consideration the reasonable possibility that the evidence of Dr McDonald, when taken in conjunction will all the other evidence, may be correct.

...

Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I should sum up to some extent the expert evidence. It appears to me to be based on a number of things. One, there is a challenge to the methodology adopted by Ms Neville. [His Honour then summarised the criticism of the methodology which had led Ms Neville to conclude that very few individuals in the community in addition to the accused would have had the same DNA profile as had been found in the complainant's clothing]. ... However, perhaps this is rather academic because the real question is, how did the DNA get in the underpants? Dr McDonald told you, and he was not challenged in this, that on average 1,000 cells per square centimetre of skin are shed every hour, right? ... The technology used in the laboratory can readily identify DNA from approximately 20 cells. So, if the accused was sitting at his computer for six hours per day shedding skin cells at the rate of 1,000 per square centimetre per hour, imagine how much DNA would have been on his mouse, on his keyboard, on his chair, all around him.

...

The Crown asks you to infer that the accused's DNA got inside the complainant's underpants because he touched her genitals, skin cells went from his hand or penis onto her genitalia and then, when she pulled her pants up, that DNA of the accused was transferred from the skin of the complainant onto her underwear. That of course is a possible explanation of how it got there. But is it the only rational inference to be drawn in the circumstances? Can you think of other scenarios which might explain how the DNA got inside the accused's underpants? Could, for example, the complainant have played with the computer mouse for five or ten minutes, picked up DNA from the accused and somehow got it inside her own underpants? Is that possible? Is that a scenario? Again, I again draw your attention to the direction I have given you concerning inferences. That is that where proof is required beyond reasonable doubt, you should not draw any inference from the direct evidence unless it is the only rational inference in the circumstances.""

14The judge directed the jury as to the applicant's silence, and no complaint is made about that direction. The trial judge then concluded his summing up as follows:

""Under our law an accused person has a right to silence. However, he has not remained silent. He was not required to give evidence. As you have been told repeatedly, he does not have to prove anything. Yet he has entered the witness box and given you evidence on oath. However, as has been pointed out to you, that does not change anything. He is just another witness and you must assess him as a witness in the same way as you would assess any other witness.

The accused has called evidence to establish that he is a person of good character. The evidence demonstrates that he has no prior criminal convictions, no prior dealings with the police. In light of that, it is clearly open to you to find that the accused is a person of good character. The law provides that the accused is entitled to have you take that evidence into account in his favour in the following two ways. Firstly, the fact that the accused is a person of good character entitles you to consider the improbability of his having committed the offences alleged. In other words, you are entitled to take the good character of the accused into account on the question of his guilt. Secondly, the accused has given evidence in this trial. The fact that he is a person of good character supports his credibility. This is a factor which the accused is entitled to have you take into account therefore when deciding whether you accept his evidence. None of this means of course that good character provides the accused with some kind of defence. It is only one of the many factors which you are to take into account in determining whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused on any of the charges which he faces. 

Gentlemen, do you want me to sum up on the facts or do you think it is sufficiently covered?

Crown Prosecutor: I don't think so your Honour.

Porter: No.""

15Further, after the jury had retired, there was discussion as to further directions sought by the Crown. When defence counsel was asked as to his attitude, he said ""I don't want to say anything"".

Consideration

16Counsel appearing for the accused was much better placed than this Court on appeal to assess whether a fair trial required the judge to say more than had already been said. On any view, this was a relatively straightforward trial, objectively speaking. The impression obtained from reading the record and in particular the closing addresses is that both counsel proceeded on the basis that the jury understood the fairly obvious issues for them to decide: did they have a reasonable doubt based on the denials of the accused and his sister? Were they persuaded to a very high standard of the truth of the evidence of a young girl? Was there sufficient doubt as to the DNA methodology and the possibility of indirect transfer? However, a transcript cannot fully convey the extent to which it was obvious to the judge and those present in the court that all members of the jury appeared either to understand or to fail to understand the significance of the evidence and the issues for their determination. That reflects part of the policy underlying r 4, as to which, as was said in R v Germakian [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 by Giles JA, Hulme and Hislop JJ at [10]:

""The requirements of r 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside"".

17Further, as the Court added at [13].

""[L]eave under r 4 will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings: R v Tripodina (at 195) or as Mahoney JA said in R v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported), at 7, followed in R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360: '...unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level'.""

18Against this, Mr Taylor, who appeared for the applicant, candidly conceded that there was no explanation why counsel who appeared at the trial did not raise the matter, but pointed to what had occurred in Wong v R [2009] NSWCCA 101, where the same ground of appeal was taken. At that trial, the judge had asked at the conclusion of the summing up whether there was anything else counsel wanted him to say, and was told there was not (see at [126]), and yet Campbell JA, with the agreement of Grove and Howie JJ, after being taken to Germakian, concluded (at [145]) (emphasis in original):

""No explanation was provided, at the hearing of the appeal, as to why the objections were not taken at trial. Counsel for the appellant at the trial was an experienced criminal lawyer. Those two matters are ones that frequently count against leave being granted under Rule 4. Even so, the deficiency in the summing up in the present case is, in my view, one that is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. There are repeated statements of high authority that the defence case must be put to the jury, and the jury must be instructed about how the law applies to that case.""

The statements of high authority included RPS v R [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at [41], R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76] and [82]-[86] and Condon (1995) 83 A Crim R 335 at 347-348. 

19Campbell JA raised for consideration, but did not need to determine, whether there might be occasions where, despite the concurrence of counsel, the power in s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to dispense with a summary of the evidence, might not be available. The reason his Honour did not need to determine that point was because, as was said in [147] (emphasis added):

""While there are circumstances in which this court might decide that the failure of a trial judge to refer to certain items of evidence, or to relate certain items of evidence to the accused's case, was so serious that the judge could not have validly exercised his or her discretion under section 161, it is not necessary to decide whether the present case is such a case. That is because the failure to put the accused's case to the jury at all, and to apply the law to that case, is a sufficient reason why the conviction cannot stand.""

20There is, to my mind, a tension between the two lines of authority reflected in Germakian and Wong. On the one hand, it is said in Germakian that there must be a convincing reason for the point not being taken and the possibility of real injustice. On the other hand, and more recently, and after reference to Germakian but without squarely explaining why it was inapplicable, it has been said that failing to put the defence case to the jury by itself is appellable error.

21So far as I can see, Wong has never been followed in any superior court in Australia. On the other hand, the principles in Germakian have repeatedly been endorsed and applied, including at the appellate level: see ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148] (Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ agreeing) and FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [72] (RA Hulme J, McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreeing). Those later decisions have not addressed the potentially divergent approach in Wong.

22However, in my opinion, it is not necessary, and therefore not appropriate, to resolve that tension in order to determine this application. This is not a case like Wong, where it was found that there was complete failure to put the defence case to the jury. 

23The ultimate question is whether the summing up as a whole fairly puts before the jury the case of the accused. In RPS v R Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at [41]:

""The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. ... It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes.""

And the question of the fairness of the trial is a question of substance, rather than form. It is influenced by the nature of the issues, the nature of the case of the accused and the length of the trial. 

24It is true that the trial judge never separately identified and summarised the defence case. However, in my opinion that cannot of itself give rise to complaint. On no view of the law does the purpose of achieving a fair trial mandate that there be a separate section in the summing up identifying the elements of the accused's case. On occasion, and perhaps more frequently than not, the most effective way of the judge fairly putting the gravamen of the defence case to the jury is in the course of summarising the issues for their determination. 

25In my view, that is what occurred here. When dealing with the DNA evidence, the trial judge squarely summarised the challenge to the methodology, and explained in a way which was neutral, and fair, the defence case of the possibility of indirect transfer. When dealing with the evidence of the complainant, the judge stressed the caution that was necessary before relying on her evidence. His Honour did not summarise the evidence of the complainant to the effect that the accused had assaulted her, nor did his Honour summarise the evidence of the accused, that it had not happened. But I am not persuaded that that fundamental disparity between the testimonial evidence on the part of the Crown and the accused was not obvious. That was what the trial, at its most basic level, was all about. The trial judge told the jury that if they believed the accused, they must acquit, and further told them as to his right to silence and his good character. That is to say, in my opinion it was not necessary for the judge to include an extra sentence:

""The accused has given and called evidence in answer to the case led by the Crown. You have heard this on Friday. Of course, you will remember that he denied he ever touched the complainant in any sexual way. If, having considered that evidence and the submissions of both counsel in relation to it, you accept it, then, of course, you must acquit the accused and bring in a verdict of not guilty because it would follow that the Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt its case in relation to the essential matters that it must prove.""

26Any other result would be to elevate form over substance. 

27At one stage in oral submissions, the applicant said that the essence of the defence case was:

""The Accused stated that he did not sexually abuse the Complainant. The Complainant was an unreliable witness and the DNA evidence was open to interpretation.""

28In my view, there is no good reason to doubt based on the material available on the appeal that those essential elements were conveyed by the judge in his summing up, in a way that was fair. However, Mr Taylor submitted that although it might not seem to a court that there could be any real doubt, that was not to say that some or all of the jurors might not have appreciated the defence case. 

29There is force in Mr Taylor's point, in principle. However, to my mind, that brings to the forefront the considerations underlying r 4. For it is well settled that ""a failure to raise objections at the close of the judge's summing up is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of it"": ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [90] (Ipp JA); Tekely v R; Nagle v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89] (Sully J); ARS v R at [148] (Bathurst CJ). This was in my opinion not a case like Wong where there was no attempt at all to put the defence case to the jury. It is plain from the extracts reproduced above that, taking Mr Taylor's point at its highest, the substance of the defence case was, at the very least, put in large measure. In my opinion, it is permissible and accords with authority to rely upon the failure to object at trial to strengthen the conclusion that appears from the transcript, namely, that the summing up fairly put the defence case. 

30In short, the essential aspects of the defence case were the denial of the Crown case by the accused and his sister, the caution attaching to reliance on the evidence of the complainant, and doubts relating to the DNA evidence. As best as can be seen from the record, all three were squarely put to the jury by the judge, and the fact that that was so is consistent with counsel then appearing for the accused not making any complaint at the time.

31For those reasons, there is not a proper basis to grant leave to appeal on a point not taken at the trial. This is not a case like Wong. No error is shown which goes to the root of the trial. To apply what was said in Germakian, no convincing basis has been shown for complaint not having been made at trial, and it does not appear that there was the possibility of real injustice in light of the way the trial was conducted. I propose that leave to appeal be refused. 

32RA HULME J: I agree with Leeming JA.

33BUTTON J: I agree with Leeming JA.

2762128,Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 2) [2013] NSWDC 145,"Judgment

1This is an application by the plaintiff, a medical practitioner and a director of a company owning two properties at Surfers Paradise, Queensland, for leave to file an amended statement of claim for defamation. The relevant background to this application is set out in my judgment of 17 May 2013 (Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors [2013] NSWDC 63). The plaintiff's statement of claim filed on 22 March 2013 brought proceedings for four claims for defamation and other actions against four defendants.

2The following may be noted concerning the current proposed amended statement of claim, which was emailed to the court and to the defendants' counsel on 8 July 2013:

(a)The subject matter of these publications relates to complaints by neighbours about alleged misconduct in 2009 by short-term tenants occupying properties owned by the plaintiff and a company of which she is a director, and to subsequent involvement of councils and politicians in law reform proposals concerning short-term tenancies.

(b)These proceedings had been before the court for hearing on 29 April 2013, 8 May 2013, 17 May 2013 and 21 June 2013. I have made a series of rulings including the striking out of the whole pleading, but with leave to replead: [2013] NSWDC 63.The plaintiff's statement of claim is still not in a sufficiently presentable form for there to be an argument concerning the imputations conveyed by the pleadings.

(c)The latest draft, which is 103 pages of pleadings without any of the matters complained of attached, pleads 53 separate claims for defamation against 8 defendants for the period 21 December 2009 to 5 June 2013. A table of each matter complained of is set out in paragraph [4] below.

(d)The text of the matters complained of have been individually forwarded to my associate, over a period of two days, in more than 15 separate emails. Where no matter complained of has been provided, this is noted in the table.

3The application for leave to file the proposed amended statement of claim is opposed. The defendants seek orders striking out of the whole proceedings pursuant to Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") r 13.4. 

Structure of the proposed amended statement of claim

4The claim pleads 53 causes of action against eight defendants for publications between 21 December 2009 and 5 June 2013. These publications are set out in a schedule which was prepared by the court and provided to the parties before the hearing today:

""Gold Coast: Where NOT to go""

5The presentation of these 53 claims against eight defendants is complicated by the following difficulties:

(a)Up to 30 imputations are pleaded for some of the publications. There will have to be an argument as to the form and capacity of many of these. Some are in discursive form, such as imputation 51Z(iv), which is pleaded as follows:

""It was lawful and just to kick the black plaintiff repeatedly for four years with false allegations about her empty house, but the black plaintiff was not entitled to any civil rights, justice or law and order, and the black plaintiff would be bashed out of court by Channel 9 every time she dared it [sic].""

(b)Claims for what appear to be other causes of action appear throughout the pleading. For example, eight of the publications (numbers 37, 38, 45, 46, 47, 51, 52 and 53 complain of breach of the ""Voyeurism Act"" and contain references to s 91J Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

(c)The particulars of identification are still not provided for each publication where the plaintiff is not named. For example, it is asserted that ""some"" viewers were unaware of the plaintiff's identity in the 2009 and 2013 publications until they saw the 52nd matter complained of on 5 June 2013, but these persons are not identified. There are some minor problems, such as publications out of order (19, 20 and 53) and reference to the ""ninth"" matter complained of in paragraphs 48 and 54, but these are of no consequence.

(d)Pages 94 - 103 consist of unrelated issues such as criticism of the Gold Coast Bulletin by police for its reporting of allegations of a sex crime, the text of s 91J Crimes Act, the National Privacy Principles, the Indecent Articles and Classified Publications Act 1975 (NSW), the plaintiff's arguments in advance concerning honest opinion and malice, spoliation, statements about costs and quotations from legal texts and ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".

6Compilation of the schedule in [4] above required many hours of reconstruction of the emails sent by the plaintiff. This schedule was provided by the court to the parties prior to the hearing of the motion. It was the only way that the hearing of this claim could proceed in an orderly fashion. 

7The argument today was dependent upon the parties complying with the timetable set down when these proceedings were last in court, and the argument was not ready to proceed due to amendment the plaintiff made on the day. The defendants have provided written submissions in accordance with the timetable. The plaintiff's response has been to restate her right to appear as a litigant in person, and to plead her claim in its present form without any concessions for the concerns of the defendants about the number and vagueness of the claims as currently pleaded. For example, in response to the defendants' request for hard copies of the matter complained of and for these to be attached to the statement of claim, the plaintiff has responded that: ""I prefer to stick to electronic submission for preservation of trees and reduction of carbon emissions"". 

Case management issues in complex defamation proceedings 

8These are complex proceedings, brought by a litigant in person against eight defendants for publications over a four-year period, where many pleading problems are immediately evident. The five issues to which I have given consideration in endeavouring to respond to the parties' competing claims are as follows.

9The first is the need for courts to exercise the utmost care when striking out part or the whole of any proceedings. This is particularly the case in defamation, as I have already noted in my previous judgment in relation to Dr Ghosh's claim ([2013] NSWDC 63), and I will not repeat those principles here.

10The second is the need for careful attention to pleadings from the outset in all defamation proceedings. The defendants' complaints concerning the form of the pleading has been answered by the plaintiff as follows:

""(1) Claim too long and too many amended statements - a one page claim would not have done justice to the three times daily defamation on Channel 9, echoed by the Gold Coast Bulletin Newspaper, for four long years. Even 53 items is a very small fraction of the hundreds of publications defaming my house since Dec 2009, with no attempt to contact me except the ridiculous stalking incident by Katie Gregory aired on 5 June 2013 as ""Party House Court."" It has taken longer to finalize the claim because of your repeated refusal to provide discovery of publications. As a busy doctor, I have had to take time off work to retrieve the hundreds of publications about my house that were on the Internet for years, but were rampantly deleted after I launched legal action in March 2013.""

11The fact that there are many publications does not excuse the plaintiff from pleading her case with care. In Douglas v McLernon [2013] WASC 126, Le Miere J explains the need for precision in pleadings where there are multiple causes of action, as otherwise the litigation would become unmanageable. Mr Douglas had brought proceedings for 28 publications, which he had pleaded gave rise to 68 imputations. Le Miere J said at [51]:

""[51] I will refuse leave to file a statement of claim in accordance with the minute of proposed statement of claim dated and filed on 1 February 2013. There are substantial deficiencies in the proposed statement of claim which I have identified in these reasons. In particular, there are deficiencies in the pleading of the imputations said to arise from the Matters Complained Of. The statement of claim pleads 28 separate publications which are said to give rise to 68 imputations. The trial of the action will be completely unmanageable unless the imputations are precise and distinct, although more than one publication might give rise to the same imputation. Each imputation must stand alone. In a statement of claim that pleads 28 publications and 68 imputations it is particularly important that the defendant and the court know precisely what the alleged imputation is and which published words are said to give rise to the imputation. The proposed statement of claim fails to achieve those objectives.""

12The plaintiff is not to be criticised simply for bringing a claim for many publications. Claims for multiple causes of action in defamation are becoming increasingly common: see Billis v McLernon [2013] WASC 128 (22 publications); Matich v McLernon [2013] WASC 127 (9 publications); Findlay v Grimmer [2013] WASC 247 (13 publications), Douglas v Purpose Marketing Group Pty Ltd [2013] WASC 125 (which pleaded ""a number of matters"" (at [5], [10]); Wishhart v Murray [2013] NZHC 540 (numerous Twitter, Facebook, website and radio publications for which $NZ8M was claimed). The large number and complexity of these claims are often the result of electronic publications, repeated in many jurisdictions (or worldwide) on websites, in social media or by email. 

13The increasing complexities of electronic defamation remain unregulated by the courts. The warnings of Le Miere J in Douglas v McLernon, supra, about the problems such actions may cause are timely. These issues are of particular concern in Australia, as the conduct of such cases challenges the adequacy of use of ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act and rules, particularly the requirement for proportionality of costs (s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)). There has been no appellate (Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231; Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 at [35] - [41]) or Supreme Court (Barach v University of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 431) endorsement of the summary judgment procedure available in the United Kingdom to strike out proceedings on case management-related principles, first enunciated in Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission [2000] EMLR 296 (""Schellenberg"") and Dow Jones & Co Inc v Jameel [2005] QB 946. 

14Publication by electronic means, whether by internet, email and/or social media, will inevitably lead to the bringing of claims for defamation against multiple defendants, in jurisdictions all over the world, where the audience for some of those publications may be no more than a handful of persons. The question is the degree to which the court allows parties to add further complexity to what is already a difficult area of the law or rely upon case management principles such as the ""just, cheap and quick"" directive in s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). In Dank v Whittaker (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 1062 at [34] McCallum J, faced with proceedings her Honour described as a ""juggernaut"", commented:

""A number of observations can be made about these proceedings and I would expect them to be reported to the plaintiff personally. It is, of course, a matter for him how he wishes to conduct his defamation actions (hopefully on the strength of sensible and complete legal advice). It may be observed, however, that the full collection of proceedings commenced by Dr Dank has launched something of a juggernaut. There are multiple proceedings, multiple defendants, multiple legal teams and a vast number of imputations relied upon in all. The objections that are now taken by the defendants in the present application and other applications I have heard this week will afford the plaintiff an opportunity not only to recast his claims in response to my rulings but also to reassess the ambit of the fight he wishes to take on. I would urge the plaintiff and those representing him to give careful consideration to the way in which the claims are framed with a view to bringing before the court a manageable dispute calculated to raise the real issues required to be determined for the purpose of vindicating Dr Dank's reputation.""

15The third issue is the degree of assistance with which a litigant in person should be assisted by the court in the complexities of defamation proceedings. Again, this is an issue about which the procedural rules and appellate courts have not provided clear directions, although one in four defamation proceedings in Australia are brought by litigants in person. There have been differing opinions in the NSW Supreme Court (Jenolan Caves Resort Pty Ltd v Field; St George Bank Ltd v Field [2007] NSWSC 1117) and Court of Appeal (McGuirk v University of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 104 at [9] - [37] and [151] - [187]) as to the court's power to case-manage the degree to which courts should assist or supervise the conduct of litigation by litigants in person. The prevailing view is summarised by Young AJA in McGuirk v University of New South Wales, supra, at [43]), where his Honour rejected complaints by lawyers that the conduct of a litigant in person who was sending them hundreds of letters, many abusive, was causing them stress, adding that ""lawyers who cannot cope with the stresses of litigation must find some other area of law in which to practise"". 

16The plaintiff states in her submissions:

""(2) Not legally represented. In Australia one has the right to represent oneself in Court, and as an educated person I choose to exercise this right. Common Law is for common people and is there to protect common people (like me). Even when I was represented by lawyers in a 1 page submission in Qld, your lawyers gave all the same formulaic arguments and criticisms. My lawyer and friend is Gunnar Mollenbeck, and he will help me as required.""

17McGuirk v University of New South Wales, supra, sets out the nature and extent of the judge's power to make case-management orders, but does not tell the judge the degree to which help should be provided. Judges in other jurisdictions have formulated principles concerning the degree to which the court has obligations to litigants in person, particularly in relation to defamation claims where the complexity of pleadings causes so many problems, which are of assistance. One such example is Slipetz v Trudeau [2012] MBQB 111, where Martin J set out a series of helpful principles for dealing with a litigant in person in defamation proceedings in Canada:

""[8] Courts have dealt with the issues surrounding unrepresented litigants many times. A number of themes emerge:

(a) Self-represented litigants do not have some kind of special status.

· As noted in Sydorenko v. Manitoba, 2012 MBQB 42 (CanLII), 2012 MBQB 42, M.J. NO. 70 (QL):

29 ... this factor should not dissuade the court from applying the usual rules including when it comes to considering an award of costs.

· As noted in Ridout v. Ridout, 2006 MBCA 59 (CanLII), 2006 MBCA 59, 205 Man.R. (2d) 146), M.J. No. 243 (QL):

12 ... more and more litigants ... are self-represented. This often creates difficulties not only for them but for court staff and judges. Notwithstanding, it is not accurate to say ... that self-represented litigants (SRLs) have some kind of special status. ... while the court should provide assistance to SRLs, this must be done in such a way as to maintain judicial impartiality. ...

(b) Judges do not advocate on behalf of a self-represented litigant, do not provide legal or tactical advice and have no duty to help a litigant do a better job in developing their case. Judges do, however, ensure that a party's lack of legal training does not unduly prejudice them, nor affect their ability to participate meaningfully in the proceeding. (Ridout v. Ridout, supra.)

(c) Self represented litigants must be dealt with fairly and with appreciation of their potential legal handicap, but they are not entitled to undue favour nor should the rights of a defendant be overridden.

· As noted in Otte v Manitoba (Sheriff's Department), 2008 MBCA 63 (CanLII), 2008 MBCA 63, 166 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1032, M.J. No. 163 (QL):

12 ... The court must strike a delicate balance between ensuring that the self-represented litigant is dealt with fairly and yet not allowing the litigant undue favour precisely because he is self-represented.

· As noted in Coleman v. Pateman Farms Ltd., 2001 MBCA 75 (CanLII), 2001 MBCA 75, 156 Man.R. (2d) 144, M.J. No. 228 (QL):

15 In my view, a pro se litigant should not be denied the opportunity of presenting his or her case to the court by a strict application of the Rules. The touchstone is fairness and that involves the balancing of the pro se litigant's imperfect knowledge of rules and procedures with the right of the other party to know the legal and factual issues that he or she must meet.

· As noted in Baziuk v. Dunwoody (1997), 13 C.P.C. (4th) 156 (Gen. Div.), O.J. No. 2374 (QL): 

18 ... notwithstanding the difficulty with such parties attempting to properly represent themselves, courts must also balance the issues of fairness and be mindful of both, or all parties. Issues of fairness of course must always be determined in accordance with accepted legal principles and the law which has developed. A sense of fairness and understanding granted to unrepresented parties ought never to extend to the degree where courts do not give effect to the existing law, or where the issue of fairness to an unrepresented litigant is permitted to over ride the rights of a defendant party.

(d) Fairness simply means that a self-represented litigant should have a fair opportunity to present their case to the best of their ability. As noted in Davids v. Davids 1999 CanLII 9289 (ON CA), (1999), 125 O.A.C. 375 (Ont. C.A.), O.J. No. 3930 (QL):

36 ... Fairness does not demand that the unrepresented litigant be able to present his case as effectively as a competent lawyer. Rather, it demands that he have a fair opportunity to present his case to the best of his ability. Nor does fairness dictate that the unrepresented litigant have a lawyer's familiarity with procedures and forensic tactics. It does require that the trial judge treat the litigant fairly and attempt to accommodate unrepresented litigants' unfamiliarity with the process so as to permit them to present their case. In doing so, the trial judge must, of course, respect the rights of the other party.

(e) Some leeway may be given to self-represented litigants, but they are nonetheless expected to operate within the rules of the court and its procedures. While some leeway may give way to generous construction of the rules, it does not mean ignoring the rules altogether. 

· As noted in Nowoselsky v. Canada (Treasury Board), 2004 FCA 418 (CanLII), 2004 FCA 418, 329 N.R. 238, F.C.J. No. 2077 (QL): 

8 ... The imperatives of the Rules may be mitigated somewhat by the grace of counsel facing an unrepresented litigant, or by the Court's judicious exercise of the discretion to excuse compliance, but these are remedial measures and not a licence for non-compliance. ...

· As noted in Manitoba Agricultural Services Corp. v. Domenco, 2007 MBCA 125 (CanLII), 2007 MBCA 125, 220 Man.R. (2d) 214, M.J. No. 355, (QL):

6 With respect to the other grounds of appeal, the motions judge had a discretion as to whether to grant an adjournment or to consider additional materials filed out of time. Contrary to the defendant's assertion in his factum, the transcript reveals that the motions judge did attempt to assist the self-represented litigant to the extent that his judicial role would allow. However, as this court has observed on other occasions, a self-represented litigant is not entitled to ignore the rules of court. The rules which govern the conduct of civil proceedings are designed to ensure procedural fairness for all parties. See Basaraba v. Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, 2006 MBCA 27 (CanLII), 2006 MBCA 27, 201 Man.R. (2d) 302.

(f) Finally, as Mainella J. observed in Bazan v. The Assiniboine South School Division et al., 2013 MBQB 68 (CanLII), 2013 MBQB 68, M.J. No. 80 (QL), common sense dictates that:

71 ... Like lawyers, no two self-represented litigants are alike in terms of skill and knowledge. Some are so totally inexperienced and ignorant of the customs and procedures of the court that they become ""completely at sea"" during the litigation process. ... Others, however, are frequent denizens of the courthouse. In the accommodation of the principles of fairness and balance, a court should be mindful of the knowledge and experience of the self-represented litigant before it.""

18The next issue is the number of times that a party should be permitted to amend defamation pleadings. In Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corp [2008] NSWCA 37 at [24], [34] and [35], the New South Wales Court of Appeal warned that there was a limit, a view which was repeated in McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 308. Counsel for the defendants submits that the time has arrived, in this litigation, for such orders to be made here. The plaintiff considers that she should be entitled to amend her pleading as often as necessary and blames the defendants for any difficulties in obtaining the matters complained of, and for their conduct of the case generally.

19Associated with this issue is the degree to which parties should be entitled to depart from standard forms of pleadings, and in particular to make claims about disputed issues of fact in uncompromising language. The plaintiff's submissions on this issue are as follows:

(3) Not liking my language. My language is very mild compared to ""SLUMLORDS RUINING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD,"" ""SLUMLORDS FROM HELL,"" ""LANDLORD FROM HELL,"" ""PARTY HOUSE FROM HELL"" and ""BIZARRE RANT,"" which are just some of the insults I have endured repeatedly for four years on national TV, the world wide web, and in newspapers. My statement is factual, and your clients should be embarrassed by their excessively trashy reporting for four years.

20The fifth issue is the desirability of finality in litigation. In D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid (2005) 223 CLR 1 (at [34]), Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ stated: 

""A central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few, narrowly defined, circumstances"".

21While interlocutory applications should not be treated with the same firmness as may be called for by a court finally determining the proceedings, the same basic principle of finality applies. This is particularly the case in defamation actions, where the statutory proceedings concerning the limitation period should be given proper weight.

22Having noted these four general principles, I now turn to the facts in the present case.

Pleading history

23The pleadings provided to date by the plaintiff are as follows:

(a)The statement of claim filed on 22 March 2013 in the Newcastle registry was struck out, with leave to replead, on 8 May 2013 ([2013] NSWDC 63), and the proceedings transferred to Sydney for case management in the Defamation List.

(b)A draft amended statement of claim was provided to the defendants (through their counsel) at Court on 8 May 2013. The plaintiff abandoned this second pleading and served a third statement of claim.

(c)The ""amended"" draft amended statement of claim emailed to the defendants' counsel and the Court on 17 May 2013. The plaintiff was refused leave to amend in the form of the third draft statement of claim.

(d)A fourth draft amended statement of claim was emailed to the defendants' counsel and the Court on 14 June 2013. At the directions hearing on 21 June 2013 (dealing at the time with the Fourth Statement of Claim) the plaintiff was directed to serve a revised statement of claim. The revisions requested by the Court were primarily to plead the matters complained of in chronological order, the annexing of transcripts of the matters complained of and the removal of irrelevant material such as references to religious texts. The plaintiff's application to amend was specially fixed as a half day matter for Friday 9 August 2013.

(e)In accordance with the timetable, a fifth proposed statement of claim was served on 8 July 2013. Like its four predecessors, the matters complained of were not attached.

The current pleading

24The whole of the pleading is challenged. It is convenient to deal with the publications in groups, as is set out below.

The 1st - 28th and 53rd publications

25The 1st to 28th matters complained of (paragraphs 1-84 of the pleading and annexures A to N inclusive), and the 53rd matter complained of (paragraphs 156-158, annexure Z(ii)), are pleaded for publications which are either entirely or substantially outside the limitation period. It was for this reason that, in my previous judgment (Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors [2013] NSWDC 63 at [48]), I refused the plaintiff leave to plead any cause of action for defamation in respect of publications that were out of time. The plaintiff's current pleading has simply pleaded these publications again. 

26Any application for leave to claim damages for publications outside the limitation period should have been brought for determination either at or prior to the commencing of proceedings. The plaintiff cannot avoid the limitation period by reciting that the matter complained of remained on a website up until a date within the limitation period, as publication to a third person must be established (Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575 at [26] and [44]). In addition, as counsel for the defendants notes in her helpful submissions (at paragraph 19), it is significant that the plaintiff has pleaded what Ms Brown calls ""formulaic expression"" even in respect of publications which are not alleged to have been made on the internet, such as the broadcast of ""A Current Affair"" of 21 December 2009. 

27In addition, the fact that a publication remains on the website after the limitation period for the television programme or newspaper has expired does not entitle the plaintiff to claim that the limitation period should not run for the newspaper or television programme as well as for the publication on the internet. 

28Another reason why I refused leave was that a number of these publications (the 1st to 4th, and 19th to 20th matters complained of) were already the subject of defamation proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland, and the commencement of fresh proceedings in New South Wales is an abuse of process: Maple v David Syme & Co Ltd [1975] 1 NSWLR 97.

29The most significant problem, however, is that whether or not these publications are still online, the damage was done outside the limitation period; the number of persons who would have accessed these publications and identified the plaintiff within the limitation period would be insignificant in comparison. There is no ""single publication"" rule in Australia, and the plaintiff is therefore technically entitled to bring these claims. Should a plaintiff who has allowed the limitation period to elapse still be permitted to do so? 

30In Brunswick, Duke of v Harmer (1849) 14 QB 185, the plaintiff, intending to commence proceedings for defamation, sent his servant to purchase a copy of a newspaper published by the defendant 17 years previously, which newspaper contained a libel on the plaintiff. Delivery of the copy by the defendant to the servant was held to be sufficient publication. However, the publication subject of the action was the single publication to the Duke of Brunswick's servant; the mere fact that the Duke of Brunswick's servant was able to purchase the newspaper did not mean that the publication 17 years earlier, which was statute barred, was suddenly actionable again. 

31The Duke of Brunswick would not enjoy the same success today, because a publication solely for the purpose of commencing proceedings for defamation cannot be actionable, for the reasons explained by Hunt J in Toomey v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 291 (see also Perkins v Floradale Productions Pty Ltd & Ors (District Court of NSW, Walmsley SC DCJ, 28 May 2013) at [30]-[39]).

32The problems caused by the application of these principles to electronic publication have been the subject of comment in numerous reported decisions, articles and law reform reports. Over a decade ago, in Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575 at [92], Kirby J deplored the failure of defamation legislation and case law to respond adequately to the challenge of electronic communication:

""[92] The idea that this court should solve the present problem by reference to judicial remarks in England in a case, decided more than 150 years ago, involving the conduct of the manservant of a duke, despatched to procure a back issue of a newspaper of minuscule circulation, is not immediately appealing to me. The genius of the common law derives from its capacity to adapt the principles of past decisions, by analogical reasoning, to the resolution of entirely new and unforeseen problems. When the new problem is as novel, complex and global as that presented by the Internet in this appeal, a greater sense of legal imagination may be required than is ordinarily called for. Yet the question remains whether it can be provided, conformably with established law and with the limited functions of a court under the Australian constitution to develop and re-express the law.""

33The principal error that the plaintiff has made in her attempt to replead the publications which I have already struck out is that she has simply claimed that these publications are still available online today and thereby claims for all publication from the original date. Just as the Duke of Brunswick had to send his servant to purchase the newspaper in order to have a cause of action, as opposed to relying upon the fact that the publication had been made 17 years ago, so too the plaintiff in these proceedings must establish that within the limitation period, a person or persons have downloaded the material and identified the plaintiff, as well as providing the particulars of identification in relation to such publications, such as being able to recognise the plaintiff's house. This is what she has failed to do.

34The first 28 publications cover the period 21 December 2009 to 15 December 2011. The audience figure statistics for television broadcasts which are generally tendered in media trials cannot be tendered here, as those publications are outside the limitation period. The best the plaintiff can do is to point to a handful of persons who not only have accessed these publications online, but also are sufficiently familiar with the facts to identify her, in accordance with the particulars of identification, as a director of the company that owns these properties and/or as the owner of the house in question. 

35This brings me to the question of the fate of those online publications able to be accessed by these unknown person within the limitation period. The landmark decision which gave rise to the principles of Dow Jones & Co v Jameel [2005] QB 946 (see [57] - [58]) is Schellenberg v BBC [2000] EMLR 296 (""Schellenberg""). Those proceedings were struck out on case management principles alone, by reason of the lack of utility of fresh proceedings, because the plaintiff had previously commenced and later abandoned proceedings for the same defamatory imputations.

36In Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [153], McColl JA distinguished Schellenberg on the basis of its ""very unusual facts"", in that the plaintiff had commenced and later abandoned proceedings without a definitive result. In Habib, the plaintiff had commenced proceedings against a newspaper in the Supreme Court claiming damages for publications which included claims of republication on the radio later the same day, in that radio announcers referred to the newspaper article. The section 7A jury only considered the publication issue, republication being agreed to be an issue of fact for the judge. When the jury found the newspaper publications complained of were not defamatory, the plaintiff commenced fresh proceedings in the District Court in relation to the radio republications, on the basis that these had not been the subject of jury findings and were pleaded on damages issues only.

37Notwithstanding the limitations placed on it by the Court of Appeal in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd, supra, the Schellenberg approach to issues of proportionality in defamation litigation is applicable to two aspects of this case. The first is that these proceedings do in fact fall within the ""very unusual"" factual circumstance identified by McColl JA, in that Dr Ghosh commenced and abandoned (or left dormant) proceedings for six of the time-barred proceedings she now seeks to bring here, and the other time-barred publications give rise to the same (or similar) imputations. (The second issue, namely proportionality issues concerning the proceedings commenced in relation to Mr Butterworth's email, is discussed in more detail at [61] below.) 

38In addition, unlike the plaintiff in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd, supra, the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the Queensland Supreme Court for defamation, not for republication or in relation to damages issues only. This is a crucial factor. 

39Finally, as also occurred in Schellenberg, the plaintiff having taken those proceedings no further, she now seeks not only to plead those claims in New South Wales, but to add to them subsequent publications about o which no complaint was made during the limitation period. No application has been brought to extend time nor has there been any identification in proper form of the persons who saw the matter complained of within time and were able to identify the plaintiff (including how this occurred).

40The number of persons who have seen the matter complained of on the Internet since these publications appeared, and who are capable of identifying the plaintiff, is infinitesimal when compared to its total audience. While the purchase of one newspaper may have permitted the Duke of Brunswick to bring proceedings for that one publication 17 years later, the proportionality issues in s 60 Civil Procedure Act and the principles enunciated in Schellenberg should not permit a plaintiff who lets the limitation period expire, or abandons proceedings for the same or similar publications, to bring complex and expensive defamation proceedings in circumstances where the defendants have proceeded with their publications on the basis of there being no further complaint. 

41Independently of my prior striking out of these actions on the basis of the limitation argument (which I have already decided in my earlier judgment), any attempt to rescue these claims on the basis of their being available online during the 12-month period prior to 22 March 2013 to a handful of persons (assuming the identities of such persons could be established) would therefore be caught by the principles enunciated in Schellenberg, supra.

42I cannot strike out the pleadings that have been commenced in the Queensland Supreme Court. However, if the plaintiff wishes to continue in New South Wales proceedings actions for defamation commenced in the Supreme Court in Queensland, they must be cross-vested to New South Wales. She would be able to continue those proceedings without the leave of this court, but to commence a fresh set of proceedings in New South Wales for the same publications is an abuse of process.

43By a combination of these reasons, the first 28 matters complained of are struck out. Not only is the management of so many time-barred claims a logistic impossibility, and contrary to the principles of finality, but it would be contrary to the principles set out in ss 56 and 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).

The 29th and 30th publications

44Counsel for the defendants concedes that, if proper particulars of identification are provided, these actions have been commenced within time and cannot be the subject of a summary dismissal application as they do not satisfy the criteria set out by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955. However, counsel relied upon the discretionary issues concerning leave to amend identified by Johnson J in Udowenko v Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors (formerly St George Bank Ltd, a division of Westpac Banking Corporation) (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 1122 at [111] and [114]. 

45Leave to amend should be refused only in the clearest of circumstances, for the reasons explained by Johnson J. In those proceedings, a series of applications before two judges had still not resulted in pleadings in any manageable form, and Johnson J considered the court could have no confidence that further leave to amend would result in pleadings which were any clearer.

46Applying these principles to defamation litigation, McCallum J in Al-Shennag v Woodcock [2013] NSWSC 696 stated (at [110]):

""[110] The present case is unusual in that the plaintiff has not been dilatory. However, the discretion conferred by the rule is not confined to cases of delay caused by inaction. The prejudice faced by Mr Woodcock is that he must remain active in litigation which is slow to be brought to finality, not for want of any activity on the part of Mr Al-Shennag, but for want of any constructive activity. The prejudice of being required to face Mr Al-Shennag's numerous specious claims and allegations is manifest. As noted in Micallef, the rule contemplates the possible termination of a case without determination of an issue between the parties.

[111] In the present case, there is a more compelling reason for taking that course than in the case of mere dilatoriness. In my view, there is a substantial risk that, even assuming the plaintiff is successful, the costs of the action have already become disproportionate to any award of damages Mr Al-Shennag may receive. The claim for economic loss is substantial but most probably ambitious. Leaving that part of the claim aside, and for present purposes disregarding the defences, the cost of the ill-conceived applications Mr Al-Shennag has lost along the way is not warranted by any likely award of general damages for defamation and thereby offends the proportionality of costs principle enshrined in s 60 of the Civil Procedure Act.""

47Ms Brown submits (written submissions, paragraphs 39-41) that the plaintiff has had ample opportunity to properly plead her case, that she has been repeatedly advised to obtain legal advice about this complex and convoluted pleading. The defendants have had to deal with five versions of the pleading and are no closer to a pleading that can be readily understood.

48However, both these judgments deal with litigation that had been on foot for some time; the defamation proceedings McCallum J dismissed related to a publication in 1999 which had been the subject of extended litigation, including a s 7A jury trial and an appeal. 

49The court should be slow to strike out proceedings where there may be a genuine claim, however poorly pleaded or particularised (Ford v Nagle [2004] NSWCA 33). While I note the warnings of the Court of Appeal about the undesirability of multiple attempts at pleading, the plaintiff should be given another opportunity to replead her claim.

The 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 47th and 48th publications: no matter complained of and no evidence of publication

50It is a fundamental requirement of all defamation pleadings that the matter complained of must be attached to the pleading.

51The transcript or text of these matters complained of are not attached and the plaintiff concedes she does not have them. It is not uncommon for orders to be made for a defendant to provide a publication, and for the plaintiff to provide the best particulars he or she can of the broadcast: Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 11. However, in the present case, Ms Brown advises that these publications (for 13 June 2012, 5 March 2013 and 22 March 2013) cannot be located by the defendants (see the affidavit of Phillip Beattie dated 2 August 2013).

52Accordingly, I do not propose to grant leave to amend to plead the 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 39th, 45th and 47th matters complained of.

The 35th-36th matters complained of

53These publications are not referred to in any earlier version of the statement of claim. The leave I granted related to those publications identified by the plaintiff in the statement of claim filed on 22 March 2013. Publications dated 13 June 2012 are now out of time. No application has been brought to extend time. 

54Ms Brown draws my attention to s 64(2)(a) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Conformably with the decision of Simpson J in Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd, supra, I take the view that these proceedings cannot be rescued from the limitation bar by the use of this provision. I note that no proper particulars of identification have been provided for this publication, as counsel for the defendant points out in paragraph 30(a) of her written submissions.

55These claims are out of time and will be struck out. 

The 37th, 38th, 49th and 50th publications: identification in ""party house"" broadcasts in New South Wales

56The plaintiff is only named in the 25th, 26th, 51st and 52nd matters complained of (paragraphs 150-155 of the proposed amended statement of claim). The plaintiff has not sought to provide particulars of identification in relation to each publication as is required (Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors [2013] NSWDC 63 at [49](b)). In Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188 Hunt J warned that where a plaintiff had not been identified in a matter complained of, the plaintiff ""must nevertheless name those persons [who have identified the plaintiff], or suffer the loss of his action"". 

57This restriction does not apply where the publication is an ""unrestricted"" mass media publication (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG, supra, at 192; Leech v Sylvester [2012] NSWSC 1367). However, until such time as proper particulars of identification are provided for each of the matters complained of, all publications except the 51st and 52nd matters complained of (paragraphs 150-155) are deficient.

58Leave to replead is generally granted in such circumstances. However, in the present case, there is no reference in the 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th, 49th or 50th matters complained of concerning extrinsic facts of the kind relied upon by the plaintiff. In particular, there is no reference to the address of the plaintiff's property, the fact that she lives in Newcastle, or to any of her neighbours. These publications discuss party houses in New South Wales at Byron Bay (the 37th and 38th matters complained of) and Terrigal (the 49th and 50th matters complained of). They specifically identify other persons as the owners of these houses, not the plaintiff. The imputations conveyed by these broadcasts specifically relate to those persons.

59The plaintiff complains she is identified because pictures of a house which she says is one or the other of the two Gold Coast houses are shown. Careful particulars would need to be provided about these pictures, including not only how the plaintiff's house(s) are identified, but by whom. It is not sufficient for the plaintiff to claim (as she did, during oral submissions) that these are publications about ""party houses"", and this is a topic about which the defendants have repeatedly published material.

60The circumstances in which an action will be struck out because the plaintiff is not, or cannot be, identified require a very high standard of proof: Palace Films Pty Ltd v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1448; Palace Films Pty Ltd v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1136; Mahon v Mach 1 Financial Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 10), Leech v Silvester [2012] NSWSC 1367. I am satisfied that the plaintiff cannot establish identification. Even if photographs of her house(s) were shown, the specific nature of the allegations in each of these broadcasts does not relate the complaints of house parties in Byron Bay and Terrigal to the plaintiff. These claims will be struck out.

The 43rd and 44th publications: the email from Justin Butterworth

6151 of the 53 claims relate to publications by newspapers or on television. The 43rd and 44th publications are an email sent by a Mr Justin Butterworth.

62Counsel for the defendants submits that the plaintiff has not in fact been identified by the recipients of the 43rd and 44th matters complained of, and reliance is placed upon an affidavit of Courtney Elise Gillette McLean of 2 August 2013. This is challenged by the plaintiff, who provides emails indicating that these persons know who she is.

63Having regard to the distinction drawn by Hunt J in Lazarus between media and non-media publications, failure to provide proper particulars of identification is a significant issue. The continued failure to provide such particulars would, by itself, warrant the striking out of these claims.

64There are also pleading problems for the corporate defendants. No Webb v Bloch particulars of publication (Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331; David v Abdishou [2012] NSWCA 109) have been provided for Fairfax Media (which is mentioned in the matter complained of only as an email address) or Stayz Pty Ltd. Again, failure to provide such particulars strongly militates against the granting of leave to replead. I have previously refused the plaintiff leave to name Fairfax Media (and, for other reasons, News Limited) as a party in these proceedings: [2013] NSWDC 63 at [32] and [59].

65While these matters alone would warrant the striking out of these claims, an additional reason for doing so is the application of s 60 Civil Procedure Act. In this regard, I note also the Schellenberg principles of proportionality. I am conscious of the fact that the claims against these defendants does not fit within the ""unusual circumstances"" referred to by McColl JA in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd, supra. These claims arise because of a statutory provision in Australia which does not exist in the United Kingdom: general damages for defamation are capped. 

66That is an important factor to take into account when case managing a claim for dozens of alleged defamations. The technicalities of pleading each publication separately, with the result that dozens or even hundreds of claims are pleaded, should not make management of the case impossible in circumstances where the plaintiff can only recover, at best, the maximum cap on general damages. Additional matters may be relied upon in relation to damages (especially aggravated compensatory damages), for the reasons explained in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd, supra. (The issue of whether the cap applies to aggravated compensatory damages has never been the subject of judicial determination). 

67Issues of proportionality dictate that, given the defendants' affidavit evidence (albeit contested) that no persons were able to identify the plaintiff for publications 43 and 44, the cost of continuing to include these claims in what McCallum J calls ""juggernaut"" litigation outweighs any advantage to the plaintiff in bringing an action against these three additional defendants, in circumstances where the principal action lies against the first and second defendant.

68Accordingly, the proceedings against Stayz Pty Ltd, Mr Butterworth and Fairfax Media should not be the subject of any entitlement to amend to bring any claim against them personally. Leave to amend to bring proceedings in relation to these publications is refused.

Claims against News Ltd and Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd

69Similarly, the proceedings against News Ltd and Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd should be dismissed. Not only did I make similar orders in my previous judgment concerning further actions against News Ltd, but all of the publications alleged against these two defendants are out of time, and/or are the same (or substantially the same) as publications sued upon by the plaintiff in the Supreme Court of Queensland. In addition, the plaintiff has never provided proper particulars of identification for any of them.

Claims of criminal conduct: publication 37-38, 45-46 and 51-53

70Eight of the matters complained of (the 37th, 38th, 45th, 46th, 47th, 51st, 52nd and 53rd) bring claims which, although put forward as defamation claims, assert that the publication of the matter complained of was ""in breach of the Voyeurism Act"". It appears that this is a reference to s 91J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). As I indicated in my previous judgment at [45]-[46], actions for criminal libel may be brought only with the leave of the New South Wales Attorney-General. If a claim is being made for damages for an alleged breach of s 91J of the Crimes Act, no such cause of action is known to law. That part of these claims will be struck out.

The 39th, 40th, 41st, 42nd, 45th, 46th, 51st and 52nd pleadings

71Although the 39th and 40th publications could not be located by the defendants, a 20-second advertisement with ""Over the Fence and Out of Control"" was located during the hearing, and the parties agreed that it showed the properties in question. There was no sound available. I have made orders for the parties to each provide what material they have in relation to this publication.

72The 40th and 41st publications require proper particulars of identification but there is no issue of publication, limitation or identification, or proportionality.

73The plaintiff provided a DVD containing the 45th and 46th publications during the hearing. This must be transcribed and added to the next draft pleading, along with copies of all other matters complained of which have survived the defendants' application for summary dismissal.

74The 51st and 52nd publications do not require particulars of identification but, as is set out above, should be repleaded to exclude references to voyeurism and s 91J Crimes Act. 

Particulars

75The particulars of aggravated damages are prolix and contain serious allegations, including claims of commission of criminal acts by the defendants. 

76By contrast, the particulars of special damage, including loss of business and earnings, are only a few lines long and contain generalised claims such as ""the plaintiff's tax losses for both rental properties"" (which I note is not a quantified, or quantifiable, loss as it is currently pleaded), a reference to ""see attachment"" when the attachment is not annexed, and a general claim for ""loss of a business and earnings"" from the plaintiff's professional surgery, without the basis for this claim being explained. 

77Claims of this kind should be the subject of careful pleading, preferably supported by expert evidence. Leaving aside the likelihood that the corporate entity which owns one of the houses, rather than the plaintiff, suffered some of these losses, they need to be fully particularised. Accordingly I strike out these particulars, but with leave to replead.

Irrelevant issues raised in the pleading

78Page 94 to 103 of the proposed statement of claim include information about copyright, s 91J Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the ""Indecent Articles and Publications Act 1975"" (which I note should have been the Indecent Articles and Classified Publications Act 1975 (NSW), which is, moreover, repealed legislation), mob lynching and some personal opinions from the plaintiff about the malice and lack of honest belief of the defendants. The plaintiff concludes the proposed statement of claim by stating (p 102) that ""such practices are not 'Christian' or the norm in Australia, especially Surfers Paradise"" and adding a quotation from a legal dictionary. 

79These paragraphs are embarrassing and will be struck out pursuant to UCPR r 14.28.

Concluding remarks

80The plaintiff should be permitted one last opportunity to plead her claim for defamation. The removal of claims which are out of time and of parties against whom no claim is properly pleaded should result in a statement of claim centring on the real issues of the case, namely the plaintiff's claim for damages for defamation for a series of publications concerning criticism of the circumstances in which properties (owned by herself and a company of which she was a director) were let to short-term tenants who allegedly misbehaved. Since these claims have their genesis in events occurring four years ago, it is important that the plaintiff formulate her claim in such a way that the matter can be made ready for hearing expeditiously.

81I have set out in my orders below those causes of action for which the plaintiff is granted leave to prepare a further amended statement of claim. However, in the circumstances, I shall limit that leave to a leave to bring further draft pleadings, in the event that there are further difficulties with the statement of proposed pleading of these proceedings. That pleading must contain proper particulars of identification and attach all matters complained of, so that an imputations argument can be dealt with. Given the serious deficiencies in the pleading to date, and the number of publications, I have listed the plaintiff's application at a date suitable for the parties, in the District Court at Newcastle (to suit the convenience of the plaintiff, a Newcastle resident) as I propose to regard myself as part-heard in this application. Once the application is completed, the proceedings will be returned to the Defamation List for further case management.

Other applications

82The plaintiff foreshadowed an application for an interlocutory injunction, but no submissions or evidence were put before me in accordance with the timetable. The plaintiff in fact complains that many of these publications are now not available on the Internet, and the utility of such relief is unexplained.

83I decline to make any such order.

Costs

84The defendants seek the costs of these proceedings. I have included an order accordingly.

		20 August 2013",2013-08-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762132,R v Wilson (No. 1) [2013] NSWSC 1146,"Judgment (On ADJOURNMENT OF inquiry concerning fitness of Accused to be tried - t12)

1JOHNSON J: This is an inquiry into the fitness of Joseph Rowan Wilson to be tried on charges of murder, solicit to murder, and commit act intended to cause a person to give false evidence. The trial of the Accused is presently fixed to commence on 4 November 2013 at the Wollongong Supreme Court, with a four-week estimate. 

2The murder is alleged to have been committed on 4 November 2008. The Accused was charged with that offence on 25 November 2009. The solicit to murder charge relates to events in January and February 2010 and the act with intent to cause a person to give false evidence charge relates to events between December 2009 and February 2010. 

3Since 2011, if not earlier, issues of the fitness of the Accused to be tried have been raised for consideration in this Court. In November 2011, Latham J commenced an inquiry into fitness which was adjourned until April 2012. The issue at that time involved the compliance or otherwise of the Accused with a treatment regime which was considered necessary for paranoid schizophrenia. 

4Dr Olav Nielssen had examined the Accused on a number of occasions on behalf of the defence. Professor David Greenberg had examined the Accused on a number of occasions on behalf of the Crown. The consensus as between the psychiatrists in November 2011 was that, if time was allowed for the Accused's medication regime to stabilise, then he may be fit to be tried. 

5On 2 April 2012, Latham J determined, on the basis of the view of both psychiatrists, that there was no longer an issue as to the fitness of the Accused to be tried so that, for the purpose of s.8(2) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, an inquiry was no longer needed. 

6A trial date was fixed for October 2012. In early October 2012, the matter came before Schmidt J. It appears that Dr Nielssen had further examined the Accused and had formed the view that he was again unfit to be tried. 

7It emerged that the Department of Corrective Services had transferred the Accused to the Goulburn Correctional Centre, where the Accused ceased taking his medication. On 15 October 2012, on the basis of the evidence which once again established that the Accused was not medication compliant, Schmidt J determined that the Accused was unfit to be tried and referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal""): R v Wilson [2012] NSWSC 1247.

8In accordance with applicable statutory procedures, the Tribunal came to consider the Accused's matter. The reasons of the Tribunal of 7 March 2013 reveal the steps that had been taken with respect to the Accused between October 2012 and March 2013. Of particular importance was the fact that the Accused had been housed, for a significant continuous period, in the Hamden Unit at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater (""MRRC""). 

9Dr Usman Malik, psychiatrist, had provided a continuous period of treatment and supervision of the Accused's medication. In that setting and with a consistent level of treatment, the Accused was compliant with his medication regime (after some early resistance) and Dr Malik expressed the opinion that the Accused was fit to be tried but could become unfit if he did not take his medication. 

10The Tribunal had before it all the reports of Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg, together with oral evidence from Dr Malik and the clinical nurse consultant who had played a part as well in the treatment of the Accused. 

11The Tribunal determined, for the purpose of s.16 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, that the Accused will, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the offences for which he was charged. The Tribunal made an order under s.47(1) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 that the Accused be detained in the MRRC to receive care and treatment. In that respect, the Tribunal had been informed of the recommendation of Dr Malik that the Accused should remain in detention at that place in the Hamden Unit, with appropriate treatment being continued by Dr Malik. 

12Professor Greenberg examined the Accused on 22 and 29 April 2013 at the MRRC. In a report dated 30 April 2013, Professor Greenberg referred to the Accused's chequered history with respect to medication compliance. Professor Greenberg referred to the fact that the Accused was then receiving oral Solian, an antipsychotic medication. Professor Greenberg noted that the Accused continued to suffer from bizarre fixed encapsulated delusions, despite receiving psychiatric treatment. However his delusions, although bizarre, appeared to Professor Greenberg to be encapsulated, and did not appear to intrude on his understanding, for the purpose of application of the well-known criteria for fitness to be tried arising from the decision in R v Presser (1958) VR 45. 

13Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion that the Accused was then fit to be tried, but observed that a review of his fitness to stand trial may need to be undertaken if his legal representatives detected any difficulties concerning fitness. Professor Greenberg observed that it was imperative that the Accused remain on his antipsychotic medication during Court proceedings. 

14The matter was placed in the arraignment list before Latham J on 3 May 2013, when the trial date was set for 4 November 2013. The necessary inquiry as to fitness was fixed for today. 

15A report from Dr Nielssen dated 1 August 2013 indicates again that the Accused is not presently fit to be tried. 

16Dr Nielssen interviewed the Accused by audio-visual link on 31 July 2013. For reasons that are not able to be explained today, the Accused at that time was housed again at the Goulburn Correctional Centre. That Correctional Centre had been the facility in which the Accused had been housed in the past when he did not comply with his medication regime. Moreover, the detention of the Accused in that location was contrary to the view expressed (indeed, the order made) by the Tribunal on 7 March 2013 that the Accused be housed at the MRRC, no doubt in the Hamden Unit. 

17Why it is that the Accused was no longer housed at the MRRC but, by the end of July 2013 was located at the Goulburn Correctional Centre, is simply not known. What has happened since this transfer is entirely predictable. The Accused has not been taking his medication and he was exhibiting florid psychotic behaviour. 

18Dr Jeremy O'Dea from Justice Health informed Dr Nielssen that he had visited the Accused at the Goulburn Correctional Centre and had formed the view that he was acutely mentally ill, probably because he had not taken antipsychotic medication, with Dr O'Dea certifying the Accused under relevant mental health legislation. 

19At some time since 31 July 2013, the Accused has been brought to Sydney for the purpose of today's inquiry. The Accused is not presently in Court. His counsel, Mr Ainsworth, has informed the Court that he spoke to the Accused in the cells associated with this Court complex this morning. The words and conduct of the Accused were aggressive, to say the least. Indeed, Mr Ainsworth informs the Court that the Accused has withdrawn instructions from him. The Court is grateful to Mr Ainsworth for remaining at Court whilst the inquiry has proceeded to the extent it has today. It seems clear from the information provided by Mr Ainsworth, and also from associated sounds discernible from the Court, that the Accused is in a highly agitated state. All of that suggests that medication compliance is not in place. 

20The position under the legislative scheme is as follows. If the Court found that the Accused is presently fit to be tried, then by operation of s.30(1) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the proceedings would go forward with the trial scheduled to commence on 4 November 2013. 

21If the Court concluded that the Accused was unfit to be tried, then s.30(2) of the Act would come into play. Section 30(2)(a) requires the Court to conduct a special hearing in the case of an accused person who has been detained in custody as an inmate or in a mental health facility as a forensic patient, for a period or continuous periods in the aggregate of not less than 12 months, and in respect of whom a special hearing has not been held. 

22If the Accused did not fall into that category, then s.30(2)(b) would provide a discretion for the Court to conduct a special hearing, if such a hearing had not already been held, or to order that the Accused be returned to custody or a mental health facility from which he was taken. 

23The statutory scheme is clear. Once an accused person has been found unfit to be tried and has proceeded to the Tribunal, and that Tribunal determines fitness, then the matter returns to the Court via s.29 of the Act. Once the Crown has expressed an intention to proceed with the proceedings, and requests the Court to hold a further fitness inquiry, then the Court proceeds to do so. That is the point reached so far in the case of this Accused. 

24Accordingly, if the Accused is found fit to be tried, the trial fixed for 4 November 2013 would proceed. If found unfit to be tried, and if he falls within the 12-month or more class in s.30(2)(a), then a special hearing would proceed at the listing to commence on 4 November 2013. 

25The difficulty that the Court has at this moment is that the Accused is capable of being fit to be tried, if steps are taken in particular with respect to his medication regime. The prospect of his medication regime being complied with is related clearly to the place in which he is being housed. Whatever has happened between April and July 2013, concerning the placement of the Accused within the custodial system, has been unsatisfactory and contrary to the proper administration of justice. 

26The course I propose to take is to not proceed to determine the issue of fitness today. Rather, I propose to adjourn the inquiry to a date in September 2013. The Crown had informed the Court that Professor Greenberg is in a position to assist further with respect to the fitness of the Accused. The Court is grateful for the report of Dr Nielssen of 1 August 2013 which is the most recent specialist assessment of the Accused. However, the way forward, it seems to me, is to engage the assistance of Professor Greenberg (the Director of Community and Court Liaison Service, Justice Health) to assess the Accused, and to provide information as to what has happened with respect to the Accused in the custodial system, and in particular by way of treatment and care by Justice Health, and what is to happen in the future in that respect. 

27As these extended remarks make clear, there is a close relationship between the fitness of the Accused to be tried and the medical resources available at the place where he is detained. I propose to make a strong recommendation that the view of the Tribunal expressed in March 2013 should be acted upon, and that unless there is some very good reason which officers of Justice Health have to take a different course, the Accused ought be housed in the Hamden Unit at the MRRC, and receive care and treatment as proposed by the Tribunal. 

28I will also request that Professor Greenberg, for the purpose of giving evidence to assist the Court on the next occasion, ascertain from Justice Health records what has in fact been done with respect to the Accused since March 2013. The Court would be assisted by information as to why the Accused was transferred from the MRRC to the Goulburn Correctional Centre, and what steps were taken by Justice Health with respect to his treatment, and the continuation of his medication regime, in that period. The Court would be grateful if Professor Greenberg could, as well, ascertain the assessments apparently made by Dr O'Dea at the Goulburn Correctional Centre and what steps were taken consequential upon Dr O'Dea's certification of the Accused, as summarised in the most recent report of Dr Nielssen. 

29I will ensure that copies of these reasons are furnished to the Crown and Mr Ainsworth and to the instructing solicitor for Mr Ainsworth, so they can be provided to any interested persons, including Professor Greenberg and Dr Nielssen. It may be that Dr Nielssen has something further that he would wish to say on these matters. 

30On the next occasion, I will conclude this inquiry and make a finding as to the fitness or unfitness of the Accused to be tried, and then determine what further orders ought be made under s.30 of the Act. 

31I request further that the Crown, with the assistance of Professor Greenberg, calculate periods relevant to the application of the formula contained in s.30(2)(a) of the Act. If the position is that the Accused fits within that category and is unfit to be tried, then a special hearing is mandatory. I say no more about that for the moment. 

32I will adjourn the inquiry until 9 September 2013. If it is the case that Professor Greenberg is unavailable to attend on that day, then I am prepared to make an order in Chambers varying the next listed day to 10 or 11 September 2013. I am conscious of the demands on Professor Greenberg's time but the Court would be very much assisted by his attendance on the next occasion. 

33I make the following orders:

(a)The inquiry is adjourned until 10.00 am on 9 September 2013.

(b)An order is made unde s.77 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 for the attendance of the Accused on that occasion. 
(c) Bail is refused.

34I recommend in the strongest terms that the Accused be housed in the Hamden Unit at the MRRC, and that he receive treatment, including appropriate medication, under the supervision of Dr Usman Malik or such other psychiatrist as may be considered appropriate to provide such treatment.

		11 November 2013",2013-08-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762136,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v KPB [2013] NSWLC 12,"Judgment

Remarks on Sentence

1I make a non-publication order prohibiting the publication or other disclosure of information tending to reveal the identity of, or otherwise concerning, any party to, or witness in, proceedings before the court or any person who is related to or otherwise associated with any party to or witness in proceedings before the court. The order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to, or witness in, criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency): see sections 7 and 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010. The order is to apply in the State of New South Wales until further order. To avoid doubt, the order also applies to the Offender because, in the circumstances of this case, to identify him would be to identify the Complainant and her family. I will refer to the Complainant in these Remarks on Sentence as AB. [The Offender] will be referred to as KPB or ""the Offender.""

2The Offender stands for sentence having entered pleas of guilty to the following charges -

""(For that he) between 1st June 2009 and 31st July 2009 at Ariah Park in the State of New South Wales, did assault [AB], a person then under the age of 16 years, to wit, 13 years, and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon her."" Section 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900.

""(For that he) between 1st August 2009 and 30th September 2009 at Ariah Park in the State of New South Wales, did assault [AB] a person then under the age of 16 years, to wit, 13 years, and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon her."" Section 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900.

""(For that he) between 1st October 2009 and 21st November 2009 at Ariah Park in the State of New South Wales, did assault [AB], a person then under the age of 16 years, to wit, 13 years, and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon her."" Section 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900.

""(For that he) between 1st September 2009 and 31st October 2009 at Ariah Park in the State of New South Wales, did assault [AB], a person then under the age of 16 years, to wit, 13 years, and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon her."" Section 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900.

""(For that he) between 1st June 2010 and 30th June 2010 at Ariah Park in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly contravene a restriction specified in an Apprehended Violence Order.""
Section 14(1) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.

3An offence contrary to section 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 carries upon conviction on indictment a penalty of imprisonment for 10 years and has a standard non-parole period of 8 years. The Local Court is limited to imposing a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment but can cumulate up to 5 years. Despite the jurisdictional limitation it is well settled law since R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 that a Court, in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence, is to have regard to the maximum legislative penalty not the jurisdictional limit. An offence contrary to section 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 carries a penalty of imprisonment for 2 years or a fine of 50 penalty units, or both.

4A Statement of Agreed Facts has been tendered to the Court and is part of the Court record so there is no need to rehearse its content at length. The Court has also received into evidence on sentence a statement from the Complainant's mother relevant to the CADVO charge (Seq. 5); a Pre-Sentence Report from Mrs Luff of the Young District Office dated 29 June 2011; a Pre-Sentence Consultation with the Offender by Anne Young, Senior Specialist Psychologist, Community Offender Services, dated 29 June 2011; an updated Pre-Sentence Report from Mrs Luff dated 16 August 2013 and a testimonial for the Offender by Mr Raymond Catlin, dated 31 July 2013.

General Background.
5The Offender is aged 56 years. The Complainant AB is currently 15 years of age but was aged 13 years at the time of the offending. The Offender worked for the Complainant's parents as a farm hand for about 9 years. He was often invited to meals at the Complainant's house. The Agreed Facts says he was in a position of trust so far as the Complainant's family was concerned. 

6Sometime during the early part of 2009, the Complainant was upset over something and talked to the Offender about it. During this conversation, the Offender started to hug her. This was the first time there had been any physical contact between them. After that initial hug, the Offender began to hug the Complainant regularly. The Complainant says he would often hug her before he left to go home for the day. These hugs would take place in locations that were not visible to the parents, for example, behind a truck.

7Sometime later, the Offender began sending notes to the Complainant. These notes are asserted to be of a romantic nature. He left the notes in the door of his car from where the Complainant would collect them. At the same time, she would leave a note that she had written to him. In September 2009 the Complainant's mother found one of the notes written by the Offender in the pocket of her school uniform. At that time the mother did not know that the Offender had written it. Among other things, the note said, ""Hope I did not upset you on Thursday. Did I go too far when I put my hand down your pants. If so I am very sorry."" The note was signed, ""Your best mate, love you xx"". When confronted with the note the Complainant lied and told her mother that the note belonged to a school friend. The mother kept the note.

8During the second week of November 2009 the Complainant went on a school excursion to Sydney. She had left her school backpack on the kitchen floor and her mother wanted to empty and wash it. In a small Velcro pocket on the side of the bag the mother found approximately 16 notes written by the Offender to the Complainant. The notes were asserted to be romantic in nature and the mother realised from their content that they were written by the Offender. 

Sequence 1.
9About June 2009 the Offender and the Complainant were alone together putting a bale of hay out at the quarry. The quarry is some distance from the house. The Offender was sitting on the seat of the tractor and the Complainant was seated beside him. The Offender stopped the tractor and began kissing the Complainant on the mouth. While he was kissing her he lifted her over so that she was facing him on the seat. He then placed his hands on the cheeks of her buttocks and moved them around on the outside of her clothing.

Sequence 2.
10Sometime between the end of August and early September 2009 the Offender and the Complainant were in the shearing shed. During a conversation the Offender pulled her close to him and started kissing her. At the same time he put his hand on her buttocks underneath her underwear. The Complainant says that she pulled away from him and he let her go.

Sequence 3.
11Some time between September and October 2009 the Complainant and the Offender were in a shed. He was fixing a truck tyre and she was helping him. He attempted to bend her over the bonnet of his car but she managed to move away. A short time later he asked her to bring him something. When she did, he pulled her down onto the chair on which he was sitting so that she was sitting on his lap facing sideways. He then began to kiss her chest area and put his hands down the front of her pants. He commenced rubbing her on her genital area underneath her underwear. During this incident, the Complainant said she noticed he had an erection as she could feel it against her thigh.

Sequence 4.
12Sometime either in September or October 2009 the Offender and Complainant were alone together near the shearing shed on the property. They were putting things into a bucket on the tractor that the Complainant's father then took to the tip. The Offender began to hug her and started grabbing her breasts. The Complainant said this ""hurt like hell.""

13Following discovery of the notes written by the Offender, arrangements were made to speak to the Complainant when she returned from the school excursion. She initially denied that there had been any inappropriate physical contact between her and the Offender and said that the ""touching"" referred to in the letters did not happen. She later disclosed the offences.

14The Offender was arrested at his home at Ariah Park on 17 September 2010. As was his right, he declined to be interviewed and was charged with the present matters.

Sequence 5.
15Following the discovery of the handwritten notes previously referred to, an Apprehended Personal Violence Order was granted at Temora Local Court naming AB as the Protected Person and the Offender as Defendant. The order was in terms of 1 (a), (b), (c), 3, 7 and 9. AB was doing work experience a local business in Ariah Park. The Offender breached orders 3 and 7 by going to her place of work. He waited for AB to finish serving another customer and then asked her to cash a cheque for him.

Crown Submissions
16I was referred to relevant authorities and the provisions of section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Crown's position was made abundantly clear from the outset - the community regards sexual offences against children with abhorrence. Children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life, caused by such conduct. It was submitted that the Court should pay regard to the age difference of the Offender and AB and the breach of trust involved. The submission said that this was the most prominent feature of the offending - the trust placed in him was betrayed in the most profound way and in a manner that amounted to every parent's worst nightmare. He was able to access the victim for the purposes of grooming and sexual interference. He was very easily able to engineer situations to be alone with the victim in order to perpetrate the offences upon her. Moreover, he was able to do so without attracting the suspicion of her parents in a way that someone outside the family would. 

17The Crown submits that the Court must look at the nature of the touching involved. It is a matter to which the court must have regard in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. The touching was very sexual in its nature and increasingly intrusive. In addition, rather than being a fleeting or momentary touching, each offence was of some duration. The touching consisted of behaviours such as touching the victim's breasts, kissing her on the mouth, kissing her chest area, placing his hands down her pants and rubbing her on the genital area. The touching of the genital area of the victim and the occasion on which the accused had his penis against the thigh of the victim are also significant as instances of 'genital connection' to which the court must have regard.

Defence Submissions
18The Defence submits the Court should keep in mind the purposes of sentencing as set out in sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am asked to apply a full discount of 25% in accordance with the principles to be derived from R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. In this regard the Court file notes that pleas of not guilty were entered to all charges (involving both girls) and brief service orders were made. True it is that pleas of guilty were subsequently entered to the charges involving the present Complainant and it has not been necessary to assemble witnesses or go into evidence. Counsel points out that the present sentencing hearing was delayed due to other matters. This obviously refers to the proceedings in the District Court involving AB's younger sister that, I am advised, are to be finalised next month.

19The submissions acknowledge that while Courts take a serious view of indecent assaults upon children, the present charges cannot be said to ""go anywhere near"" what might be termed ""the worst"" within the category. While it is always possible to imagine a worst case scenario, I have made my own assessment of where the offences fall on the notional scale of offending.

20Subjectively, it is submitted that the Offender has no prior convictions or criminal record and despite a lack of higher education he has always been employed. He suffered psychologically after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and the loss of his mother in 2010. He has been of considerable help and assistance to his cousin, Mr Catlin, who is a partial paraplegic. Mr Catlin's letter sets this out in detail. I am asked to take into account that the Offender has been on onerous bail conditions for 3 years without lapse. 

21Counsel takes issue with a number of matters raised in the Crown submissions. I will not refer to each of them exhaustively. One issue is the reference to a standard non-parole period for the subject offences. It is submitted that section 54D of the Act does not apply if the offence is dealt with in the Local Court. That is true so far as it goes, however, section 45 is not in the Division referred to in section 54D. It seems to me that the relevance of the Crown's reference to standard non-parole periods is to stress the Legislature's view of the objective seriousness of the offences and to point out that a Local Court cannot impose a fixed term for such an offence. Authority for that latter contention can be found in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [47]; Houssenloge v R [2010] NSWCCA 9 at [3]; Aguirre v R [2010] NSWCCA 115 at [32] and Mendes v R [2012] NSWCCA 103 per Davies J.

22Issue is next taken with the Crown submissions referring to ""grooming"". But that aspect, and using that terminology, is specifically raised in the report of Anne Young, Senior Specialist Psychologist, Community Offender Services, dated 29 June 2011, which is in evidence before the Court. As such, the Crown is entitled to refer to it. The content of the notes is not in evidence other than the agreed assertion that their content was ""romantic in nature"" (whatever that may mean). For myself, I would have thought their content was particularly relevant to the state of mind of the Offender at the relevant times, however, they are not before the Court and I cannot speculate about them.

23Issue is next taken to reference of the offences involving AB's younger sister. It was submitted that the factual material in the Crown Submissions should not be before the Court. It needs be said at once that a Court does not proceed to sentence in a vacuum, particularly given the family dynamics in the present case. For my part, I took the reference to the other charges as advisory only and I have seen nothing of the actual factual allegations concerning the younger sister. 

24I take this opportunity to record my thanks to the Crown and Defence for their helpful written submissions.

Matters of General Principle
25It is of considerable significance when assessing the objective seriousness of indecent assaults against children to consider the actual character of the assault, including the degree of physical contact involved: R v PGM (2008) 187 A Crim R 152 at [31], applying GAT v R [2007] NSWCCA 208 at [22]; Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [71]. In the present case there was, in my view, a steady escalation of offending conduct. The contact progressed from hugging and kissing AB on the mouth, to rubbing her buttocks on the outside of her clothing, to placing his hand on her buttocks underneath her underwear. Contact progressed further to putting his hands down the front of her underwear and rubbing her on her bare genital area to grabbing her breasts and causing her physical discomfort. 

26This progressive behaviour is, as outlined in the Report of Anne Young, Senior Specialist Psychologist, consistent with ""the grooming process where a sex offender gradually desensitises a child to increased levels of sexual intrusiveness."" Such was the process adopted by this Offender. 

27The Courts have emphasised that the criminal law in this area operates to protect children from themselves, as well as from those who may exploit their vulnerability: R v Dagwell [2006] NSWCCA 98. Even if they are not unwilling participants: R v McClymont (Unrep, NSWCCA, 17/12/1992) and R v Brady (Unrep, NSWCCA, 3/3/1994).

28The age difference between the Applicant and the victim aggravates the objective seriousness of the offence: Dagwell (supra) at [35]. See also Kenny v R [2010] NSWCCA 6 at [3]-[8], [38]-[41]. In this case, given the Offender's association with the family over time, there could be no suggestion of any doubt in his mind as to the Complainant's age. At the material times, the Offender was aged 52 years and the Complainant was aged 13 years. See Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [77].

29Also relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences is the fact that the Offender's association with the Complainant came about through his friendship with, and employment by, her family so that some element of breach of trust is reflected in his offending: Corby (supra) at [79]. See also R v Muldoon (Unrep, NSWCCA 13/12/1990).

30There is nothing put forward to suggest the use of threats or coercion by the Offender, however, an absence of threats ""may have much less, and perhaps little, weight"" in the context of offending by persons in positions of authority or trust over their victims than in the case of Offenders not in such a position. See BT v R [2010] NSWCCA 267 at [24] per RS Hulme J referring to R v Woods [2009] NSWCCA 55 at [52]-[53].

Lack of Criminal History and Good Character.
31Given the Offender's prior lack of criminal antecedents, his obvious work ethic and general reputation, the question of good character requires more than cursory attention - particularly given the understandable emphasis placed upon it by the Offender's Counsel. 

32The common law as to prior good character is clear. It is of less significance in cases involving sexual misconduct towards the young than otherwise would be the case: see R v AEL (2005) NSWCCA 148. Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 is authority for the proposition that an offender's otherwise unblemished past is still deserving of some measure of leniency. 

33However, since the decision in Ryan, the New South Wales Legislature enacted section 21A (5A) and (5B) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which specifically provides that in child sexual offences, a Court is not to take good character or lack of previous convictions into account as a mitigating factor if the Court is satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to the Offender in the commission of the offence. 

34There is no doubting the Offender's good reputation preceded him. He was well and respectably known generally, and, particularly, by AB's parents. The Offender was entitled to rely upon his standing and reputation. Had it been otherwise he would not have been permitted to have the close contact with AB as he obviously did.

35These charges do not, for example, arise out of a chance or casual encounter between strangers where the Offender, coincidentally, just happened to be of prior good character and that, perhaps, is where a distinction can be drawn. It may seem harsh, but the Parliament's intention is clear. If character and repute was ""of assistance"" in the commission of the offence - that character cannot be relied upon. I am satisfied that good character was, in the requisite sense, of assistance to the Offender in the commission of the offences and, as a consequence, I must not take that character into account as a mitigating feature.

36It is not the case that the subject offences were unpremeditated, unplanned and opportunistic. Quite to the contrary. I have already made comment as to the actual character of the assaults, including the degree of physical contact involved and the gradual desensitising of a child to increased levels of sexual intrusiveness. 

Victim Impact Statement.
37The Court has received a Victim Impact Statement (VIS) from AB outlining the impact the Offender's conduct has had upon her. The common law requires sentencers to have regard to the effect of the crime on the victim: Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [54]. See also Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656. The common law rule is that a court can only have regard to the consequences of an offence that were intended or could reasonably have been foreseen: R v Josefski [2010] NSWCCA 41 at [3]-[4], [38]-[39]. Section 3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that one of the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender is ""to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community"". 

38Division 2 Pt 3 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act contains provisions regulating the receipt of VIS. In the Local Court it applies, relevantly for present purposes, to offences that are prescribed sexual offences referred to in Table 1 of Sch 1 Criminal Procedure Act (previously ""or an act of sexual assault""): see s 27(3)(c) and (d). The VIS complies otherwise with the statutory requirements for admission. 

39The application of s 3A(g) and s 21A(2)(g) (""the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial"") in a given case is limited by the common law rule cited in Josefski at [38]. What is ""substantial harm"" in this area of the law was considered as far back as 1993 in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 where the Court of Criminal Appeal acknowledged that child sexual assault offences are ""apt to produce"" adverse long-term consequences of a psychological nature ""even though they may not manifest themselves until some time in the future"". Allpass was applied in Enrique v R [2012] NSWCCA 60 at [50].

40In making a valid assessment of future psychological harm to the child it is not necessary for the Crown to adduce evidence from studies on the subject or an individual psychiatric assessment. In DBW v R [2007] NSWCCA 236 at [239], Spigelman CJ said, ""the public and the Courts have become much more aware of, and knowledgeable about, the effects of child sexual abuse."" He continued that the sentencing judge was permitted to draw a reasonable inference about the effect of the crime on the child and ""would have been entitled to act on the basis that there was a substantial harm.""

41I have carefully read the VIS setting out the physical and emotional consequences of the progressive course of conduct undertaken by the Offender. She was, as previously noted, 13 years old at the time of the offences. She resided on a property in a country area and I have had regard to the impact on her and her family arising out of these offences, particularly in the important time of her personal development. The material adduced permits a reasonable inference that the harm to AB is ""substantial"" within the meaning of section 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I so find.

42In applying the content of the VIS to the principles in Josefski, (supra) I cannot conclude that the consequences as set out by AB were intentional on the part of the Offender. Nevertheless, any person with even a modicum of insight and morality could reasonably foresee the consequences complained of arising out of the Offender's actions.

Likelihood of re-offending and rehabilitation
43I have read the report of Anne Young, Senior Specialist Psychologist, Community Offender Services, dated 29 June 2011. It is somewhat dated but I doubt much, if anything, has changed. The report says the Offender's risk of sexual re-offending was assessed using an actuarial risk assessment, the Static-99R. The Offender's total score on the Static-99R places him in the low risk category. I note during the interview, while admitting to the sexual offences, the Offender said he was still feeling that he had an emotional connection with AB and had been motivated by helping her. I have to say I find this difficult to reconcile with his now admitted, and more serious, sexual misconduct with AB's then 8-year-old sister. In my view one does not stand with the other.

44Ms Young says that as a low risk offender he would be eligible for community based sex offender treatment conducted by Corrective Services, however, this program is only conducted in Sydney and requires weekly attendance over an 8 to 10 month period. She says that should he receive a custodial sentence, as he is going to, he would be eligible to apply for the CORE custody-based treatment program for low to moderate risk offenders. 

Pre-Sentence Report
45An updated Pre-Sentence Report from Mrs Luff and dated 16 August 2013 (annexing the original PSR of 29/6/2011 and the Pre-Sentence Consultation of Anne Young of 29/6/2011) says the Offender resided in Ariah Park all his life but for the past two years he has been living with his sister and partner in another country town. He works as a casual farm labourer and is not receiving any Centrelink payments. The Offender indicated that he had developed an attachment to AB and that he ""worries about his situation all the time and that it was the dumbest thing (he) had ever done.""

46During the adjournment the Offender was referred to the Departmental Psychologist, Mr Evans for an up-date assessment the result of which is included in the PSR. He remains a low risk of sexual recidivism, however, when the Facts become available in the charges involving the younger sister a further review will be necessary prior to any final opinion. The PSR says the Offender presented as a quiet man with little insight into his offending behaviour. He is assessed as suitable for a medium/high level of intervention by the Service including an individualised case plan with ongoing intervention with the Service's Senior Psychologist. He is unsuitable for a Community Service Order.

Assessment of Criminality
47I assess the criminality of Sequence 1 to be mid-way on the scale of offending. I assess the criminality in Sequences 2 and 4 to be above mid-way on the scale of offending due to the increased level of intrusiveness in physical contact directly with the person of the Complainant. I assess the criminality in Sequence 3 to be well above midway on the scale of offending dealing, as it does, with the touching of AB's vaginal area on bare skin. I am not advised for how long this conduct persisted but it seems to have been without demur or protest by AB and provides a fair indication that the desensitising process was all but complete. As noted earlier, it is as well her mother found the Offender's notes when she did. 

48According to the Court file, pleas of not guilty were initially entered to all charges but pleas of guilty were entered to the present charges on 20th February 2012. There has been quite some delay in bringing the sentencing on for hearing due to charges in the District Court involving AB's younger sister that were listed for trial. I am advised that sentencing for those matters is listed in September 2013. I will allow a pragmatic discount of 20% to recognise the utilitarian value of the pleas.

Cumulation of Penalty
49The issue now arises as to whether any sentences imposed in respect of the offences with which I am now dealing should be served cumulatively. Cumulation of sentence will be appropriate when wholly concurrent sentences would not take into account the differences in conduct in the various offences with which the Court is dealing, or, put another way, where there are completely different episodes of criminality.

50In Vaovasa v R [2007] NSWCCA 253 at [15] Justice Howie said

It has been made clear that, simply because a number of offences arise out of the same incident or course of criminal conduct, it does not follow that concurrent sentences will be appropriate to meet the total criminality involved.

51His Honour referred to the decision in Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41, and continued at [16]:

This is not a new principle. Similar observations have been frequently made in this Court since Pearce was taken to require that each individual sentence imposed reflect only the criminality of the conduct to which it related and that the totality principle be addressed by an order making the individual sentences concurrent or at least partly cumulative.

52In response to any suggestion that this was simply one ongoing episode of criminality, and accordingly, any sentences imposed should be wholly concurrent, I refer to the judgment of Howie J (Gyles JA, Fullterton J agreeing) in R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255 at [36]:

This Court has been at pains to make it clear that sentences for multiple offences are not made concurrent simply because they arise from a single incident of criminality or because they are of a similar nature and committed in similar circumstances. The statement of Simpson J in R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 concerning the discretion of a sentencing judge in respect of the structuring of offences has to be read subject to what is required in a particular case to reflect the totality of the criminality before the Court. 

53In Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14 at [12] Howie J (Sully and Price JJ agreeing) said:-

It seems obvious from a number of matters that have been before this Court recently, that there is abroad an insufficient understanding of the principles of totality and of the relevant factors to be taken into account when determining whether to order that sentences be served concurrently or made, at least, partially cumulative. There is no rule that sentences committed on the same day or in the same criminal enterprise should be served concurrently. The issue has been considered in a number of decisions of this Court that should make it plain that the question to be asked is whether the criminality of one offence can be encompassed in the criminality of the other offence; see generally R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272.

54I have come to the view that there must be some partial cumulation in sentences to be imposed upon the Offender to address the total criminality involved given the nature and extent of the offending. Also, it is necessary to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice by imposing sentences which do not suggest that multiple offences will be punished in the same way as one or two offences: see R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37].

55The applicable sentencing principles are found in sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: see R v Ma (2004) 145 A Crim R 434; R v King (2004) 150 A Crim R 409 per McColl JA. I am satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

56In arriving at that conclusion I have regard to the nature and repetition of the offences committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general and specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the Offender. Taken together, I am of the view that this is not an appropriate case for a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the Offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. 

57It follows from what I have just said that it is not appropriate for the sentences to be suspended: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17; R v Blundell [2008] NSWCCA 92 per Simpson J. There is no pre-sentence custody to take into account. I turn now, and perhaps not before time, to the penalties to be imposed.

Penalties.
58For Sequence 1, the Offender is convicted and sentenced to an original term of imprisonment of 12 months. I apply the discount of 20% resulting in an actual term of sentence of 9 months and 18 days, however, in conformity with the decision in Rios v R [2012] NSWCCA 8, per Adamson J (Bathurst CJ and Simpson J agreeing) I will pragmatically round down the sentence in favour of the Offender to one of 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months to commence on 19 August 2013 and expire on 18 February 2014. There will be a balance of term of 3 months to commence on 19 February 2014 and expire on 18 May 2014.

59For Sequences 2 and 4, the Offender is convicted and sentenced to an original term of imprisonment for 18 months. I apply the discount of 20% resulting in an actual term of sentence of 14 months and 12 days, however, in conformity with Rios v R (supra) I will pragmatically round down the sentence in favour of the Offender to an actual term of sentence of 14 months with a non parole period of 9 months to commence on 19 October 2013 and expire on 18 July 2014. There will be a balance of term of 5 months to commence on 19 July 2014 and expire on 18 December 2014.

60For Sequence 3, the Offender is convicted and sentenced to an original term of imprisonment for 2 years. I apply the discount of 20% resulting in an actual term of sentence of 19 months and 6 days, however, again, in conformity with Rios v R (supra) I will pragmatically round down the sentence in favour of the Offender to an actual term of sentence of 19 months with a non parole period of 12 months to commence on 19 December 2013 and expire on 18 December 2014. There will be a balance of term of 7 months commencing on 19 December 2014 and expiring on 18 July 2015.

61I find circumstances are sufficiently special for the statutory proportion to be reduced owing to the Offender's age; this will be his first time in custody; and there has been partial cumulation of sentences. I direct the release of the Offender to parole at the end of the non-parole period provided he is otherwise eligible for release. I direct as a condition of parole that the Offender be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service for such period as that Service deems necessary and undertake any program or treatment recommended by the Service. 

62For Sequence 5, the Offender is convicted and ordered to enter into a Bond pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 2 years to date from 19 August 2013 with the statutory conditions.

		03 October 2013",2013-08-18 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2762148,Ghosh v Google Australia Pty Ltd [2013] NSWDC 146,"Judgment

1This is an application by Google Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 102 417 032) (""Google Australia"") for summary dismissal of defamation proceedings commenced against it by the plaintiff for the publication of three blogs:

(a)""holidayhousefromhell.blogspot.com"" (http://holidayhousefromhell.blogspot.com.au/search?updated-min=2011-01-01T00:00:00%2B11:00&updated-max=2012-01-01T00:00:00%2B11:00&max-results=9);

(b)""Where NOT to go: Never again. HORRIBLE HOLIDAYS ON THE GOLD COAST, BUNDALL GOLD COAST"" (http://travel.ninemsn.com.au/domesticinsiders/goldcoast/660485/gold-coast-where-not-to-go); and,

(c)""A Current Affair's Naked Neighbours Video of November 2011"" (http://surfbreakrentals.tumblr.com/)

2The application for summary dismissal was heard on 16 August 2013. The plaintiff asked for additional time to provide me with documentation in support of her claim, which she has sent me on 19 August 2013. As I am on circuit in Wollongong, the parties agreed that I could hand down judgment in Wollongong and that I should dispense with the need for an appearance on behalf of any of the parties.

3The plaintiff's claim was initially commenced in the Newcastle Local Court, but was then discontinued, as the Local Court has no jurisdiction in defamation: s 33(1)(b) Local Court Act 1982 (NSW). Seven other defendants are named in the statement of claim, but they are not parties to the application, and do not appear to have been served in accordance with r 10.20(2)(a) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""). I have not been provided with a copy of the Local Court proceedings, and it is unclear how many of those defendants were parties to that action. The second to seventh defendants, against whom these and a further four claims of defamation are pleaded, are not in court today. The first defendant is not a party to the remaining four claims.

4The particulars of publication recite that each matter complained of was published ""online on the world wide web"", on ""Google Australia"", which operated as a ""feed, constantly updating more and more slander from all defendants"". The blogs were ""repeatedly attached and sent to all listing holiday rental websites"" by ""all defendants, urging each successive holiday rental website to remove the plaintiff's listings."" 

5Google Australia seeks summary dismissal of the claim under r 13.4 UCPR. An affidavit in support, sworn by Marlia Ruth Saunders on 15 August 2013, provides evidence to the effect that:

(a)Google Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Google International LLC registered in Victoria, and Google Inc, which is incorporated in the State of Delaware in the United States of America, is the ultimate holding company of Google Australia;

(b)Google Australia is not responsible for the day-to-day operations of Google Inc and is neither authorised to, nor able, to control or direct the conduct of Google Inc;

(c)Google Australia does not own, operate or control the Google Inc service known as Blogger, nor does it have the ability or power to control or direct Google Inc's actions in respect of removals of any material hosted by Blogger. It is therefore not in a position to take any action in respect of the removal of any material from Blogger, including controlling or directing action in respect of blocking internet publication; and

(d)Google Inc owns and operates the domains google.com.au as well as google.com. Search engines at the domains mentioned are exclusively operated and controlled by Google Inc.

6The plaintiff's documentary evidence to support her assertions that Google Australia control the search engines consists of the copyright notice for these websites and related material, which she forwarded to the court on 19 August 2013. That copyright notice reads:

""Copyright © 2013 Google Inc. All rights reserved""

7It would also appear that the copyright notice exists elsewhere simply as ""©Google"".

8Even assuming (which I do not accept) that possession of copyright gives Google Australia some kind of power to act in relation to breach of copyright (as to the difficulties of which, see Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd (2012) 286 ALR 466), this does not enable Google Australia to act in relation to claims of defamation. The plaintiff does not otherwise challenge Google Australia's evidence in support of the motion.

9Google Australia relies on Rana v Google Australia Pty Ltd [2013] FCA 60, where a similar claim failed. The plaintiff in those proceedings made identical submissions (at [35] - [36]), namely that Google Inc owns and operates the business that supplied the Google Web Search and other Google produces, and that it offers the products on its website to the public pursuant to written terms of service which affirm that these services are provided by Google Inc.

10This decision is the latest in a series of decisions where actions against Google Australia have been summarily dismissed. In the first of these, Duffy v Google Inc [2011] SADC 178, where an application for interim injunctive relief was brought against Google Australia, Millsteed DCJ stated:

""[23] The plaintiff's application for injunctive relief against Google Australia must fail if for no other reason than there is no evidence Google Australia has the ability to remove URL links and snippets from the Google Search index.

[24] The plaintiff's case in this regard is based upon a weak inference that she seeks to draw from the following circumstances. After the plaintiff's proceedings were served on Google Australia, on or about 18 February 2011, but before they served on Google Inc, six of the URL links that were the subject of her claim were removed from the domain www.google.com.au. On 29 May 2011 a Google search conducted by or on behalf of the plaintiff on www.google.com.au using the keywords ""Dr Janice Duffy"" provided a list of URL links at the bottom of which appeared the words ""In response to a legal request to Google, we have removed 6 result(s) from this page"".

[25] As I understand the plaintiff's argument it is suggested that it can be inferred from the removal of the URL links prior to Google Inc being served that Google Australia had some control over their removal. The argument is entirely speculative. Google Inc may have decided, as a result of earlier requests from the plaintiff, to remove the URL links without any input from Google Australia. It may be the case that Google Australia contacted Google Inc and requested the removal. Even then it does not follow that it has the legal capability to conduct such removals whether acting alone or as an accessory to Google Inc There are, of course, other possible explanations for the removal of the URL's upon which the plaintiff relies.

[26] A court will not make an injunctive order which cannot be complied with: Active Leisure Sports Pty Ltd v Sportsmans Australia Ltd [1991] 1Qd R 301 at 308. There is no evidence before me that supports the plaintiff's assertion that Google Australia exercises some relevant legal control over Google Search and would, therefore, be able to meet the terms of the proposed orders. It is not sufficient for the plaintiff merely to assert in her statement of claim that Google Australia in some way shares control of Google search with Google Inc The assertion has been contradicted by the contents of Mr Stewart's sworn affidavit and documents exhibited to it.

[27] Accordingly, the application for injunctive relief against Google Australia must be dismissed.""

11In A v Google New Zealand [2012] NZHC 2352, Google New Zealand brought a summary judgment application in relation to proceedings for defamation in relation to material accessible though the search engine domain name google.co.nz. The court concluded (at [44]) that the operation and control of the Google search engine resides with Google Inc and not with Google New Zealand. Google New Zealand did not meet the test of being able to have prevented the continued publication of the material (Sadiq v Baycorp (NZ) Ltd [2008] NZHC 403).

12Similarly, in Tamiz v Google Inc and Google UK Ltd [2012] EWHC 449 Eady J noted (at [4]) that Google UK Ltd, which did not operate or control Blogger.com, had been ""joined in the proceedings inappropriately"".

13As Mansfield J held in Rana v Google Australia Pty Ltd at [40], the same reasoning is applicable for Google Australia as for the subsidiaries in New Zealand and in the United Kingdom.

14The plaintiff, in the series of nine further written submissions she sent on 19 August, relies upon Trkjula v Google Inc (No 2) [2010] VSC 490 and Trkjula v Google Inc (No 5) [2012] VSC 533 as establishing that she can bring proceedings against Google Australia. Both these actions were brought against Google Inc, not Google Australia, and are of no assistance to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also relies upon newspaper reports of other persons suing Google. Not only do those reports fail to refer to Google Australia, but they relate to proceedings which have not resulted in the consideration of this claim by any judge.

15The plaintiff also drew my attention to press reports concerning a French decision, MX v Google Inc, Eric S, Google France (Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance, decision of 8 September 2010). In that litigation, both Google France and Google Inc were parties. Google Inc was held liable, but the court accepted submissions that Google France was inappropriately joined (""En revanche, c'est à bon droit que la société Google France sollicite sa mise hors de cause, n'ayant pas de responsabilité directe dans le fonctionnement du moteur de recherche ni dans le site google.fr.""). As to the liability of Google Inc, the contrary result occurred in Metropolitan Schools Ltd (t/as Skillstrain and/or Train2game) v Designtechnica Corporation (t/as Design Trends), Google UK and Google Inc [2009] EWHC 1765, as Inforrm (""Google found liable for defamation by French court"", 26 September 2010) points out.. 

16Cases against entities other than Google Inc have been commenced (for example, in McKeogh v John Doe 1 & Ors [2012] IEHC 95 the proceedings were commenced against Google Ireland) but the question of its liability was not raised, presumably because the relevant material had been removed from youtube prior to the interlocutory relief sought. 

17The weight of all these decisions confirms there is no reasonable prospect of the plaintiff proving that Google Australia has the ability to control or direct the conduct of Google Inc, and thus she has no reasonable prospects of succeeding in her claim. The claim against Google Australia must be dismissed.

The future conduct of these proceedings

18The plaintiff has not sought leave to amend to join any other party in the place of Google Australia Pty Ltd, and it is unnecessary for me to consider the considerable problems the plaintiff would have in seeking to bring proceedings against Google Inc, some of which are outlined by Mansfield J in Rana, supra, at [42] - [82]. 

19This brings me to the remaining claims against the second to seventh defendants. Although the plaintiff tendered evidence of postage of the statements of claim on these parties, that is not a satisfactory means of compliance with r 10.20(2)(a) UCPR. The other defendants must be personally served with any amended statement of claim, and I have made an order to that effect.

20The statement of claim in its current form suffers from many deficiencies of pleading. These deficiencies include a claim for statements made in the course of CTTT proceedings, failure to provide proper particulars of identification, limitation issues and rolled-up pleadings. The proper pleading of defamation claims is complex and the plaintiff would benefit from legal advice before incurring more expense.

21The plaintiff asked me to reserve costs, or to make an order that the costs be payable at the end of the proceedings. I reject those submissions. The plaintiff's claim against Google Australia Pty Ltd is completed, and it is entitled to an order for the costs of the proceeding, as was the case in Rana v Google Australia Pty Ltd (at [41]). This means those costs may be assessed now. 

Orders

(1)Plaintiff's claim against the first defendant, Google Australia Pty Ltd, is struck out and dismissed pursuant to UCPR r 13.4.

(2)The plaintiff pay Google Australia Pty Ltd's costs of the proceedings.

(3)The plaintiff have leave to file and serve an amended statement of claim, such amendments to include deleting any claim against Google Australia Pty Ltd, by 20 September 2013.

(4)The amended statement of claim must be personally served on each of the defendants named therein, together with a copy of this judgment.

(5)These proceedings stood over for directions to the District Court (Newcastle) on 10 October 2013 for consideration of any application that these proceedings should travel together with proceedings number 2013/88183.

2762158,R v Patricia Anne Gallagher [2013] NSWSC 1102,"Judgment
INTRODUCTION
1Between the late evening of 11 February 2009 and the early hours of the morning of 12 February 2009 William Grant (""the deceased"") was stabbed at his home in suburban Revesby. At about 4.14am on 12 February 2009 he was pronounced dead. There is no issue that the cause of his death was an abdominal stab wound which severed his thoracic aorta. The Crown alleges that Patricia Anne Gallagher (""the accused"") was responsible for his murder.

2A special hearing has been held pursuant to the provisions of s. 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Forensic Provisions Act"") which are in the following terms: 

19 Court to hold special hearing after advice received from Director of Public Prosecutions 
(1) If the Court receives a notification of a determination from the Tribunal under section 16 (3), 45 (3) or 47 (5) that a person will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for an offence, the Court: 

(a) is to obtain the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether further proceedings will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the offence, and 

(b) is to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable unless the Director of Public Prosecutions advises that no further proceedings will be taken. 

(2) A special hearing is a hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged. 

(3) If the Director of Public Prosecutions advises the Court under subsection (1) (a) that no further proceedings will be taken in respect of the offence, the Director of Public Prosecutions is also to give that advice to the Minister for Police. 

(4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Court has already held a special hearing in relation to the offence concerned. 

3On 30 August 2012 the court received a report from the Mental Health Review Tribunal advising (inter alia) that because of her severe cognitive impairment, the accused was not fit to be tried for the offence of murder and that on the balance of probabilities, that situation would continue and the accused would not become fit during the ensuing 12 months. A determination was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s. 19 of the Forensic Provisions Act that further proceedings were to be taken in the matter. It is against this background that the special hearing has been conducted. 

4Pursuant to s. 21A of the Forensic Provisions Act, a special hearing is to be conducted by a Judge alone unless an election is made by either the Crown or the defence that there be a jury. No such election was made by either party in the present case. 

5Pursuant to s. 22(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act, the following verdicts are available to be returned:

(i)that the accused is not guilty of the offence charged;

(ii)that the accused is not guilty on the ground of mental illness;

(iii)that on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged; and 

(iv)that on the limited evidence available the accused committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.

6As to the matter in (iv), manslaughter is an available alternative verdict, given that the accused has been indicted for the offence of murder. 

7At the commencement of the hearing, counsel foreshadowed that there would be a number of evidentiary issues which I would be asked to determine. However, neither party sought the preliminary determination of such issues. By agreement with counsel for the accused, the Crown adduced the entirety of its evidence and indicated, in the course of doing so, those particular parts of it which were relevant to the evidentiary issues which I would be asked to determine. At the conclusion of the entirety of the evidence, both Counsel addressed these specific issues individually, before proceeding to make submissions as to the evidence as a whole. 

AN OVERVIEW OF THE CROWN CASE
8At the time of his death, the deceased lived at Unit 5, 16-22 Blackall Street, Revesby. The accused, who had known the deceased for some years, lived in the nearby suburb of Padstow. Although it is not completely clear, it appears that they may have been in a sexual relationship at some point. 

9At the time of the deceased's death the accused had a cognitive impairment as a result of numerous aetiologies. The accused and the deceased both drank to excess, sometimes in the company of each other. 
10At or about midday on 11 February 2009 the accused went to the deceased's unit block. In or about the early afternoon of that day the deceased and a neighbour, Jack Jones (""Jones"") moved a refrigerator from the deceased's premises to a garbage area made available for residents. The accused was present during that activity and was heard to tell the deceased that she would ""kill him"" if he didn't ""get off the wine"". 

11In or about the late afternoon or early evening of the same day the accused attended the premises of Michael Baston (""Baston"") who lived in Unit 3, and who was known to the accused and others as ""Pommy Dad"". The accused left two shopping bags at Baston's premises before attending Jones' premises at Unit 9 where she and Jones had an argument. The accused also attended the residence of Elisabeth Smith at Unit 7, either before or after visiting Jones. 

12At some point, the accused made her way to the deceased's premises. At 7.21pm she made a 000 call from the landline of the deceased, apparently complaining that Jones had indecently assaulted her. 

13In response to that call, police arrived at the deceased's premises at about 8.50pm, at which time both the deceased and the accused were present. 

14The attending police formed the view that the accused was affected by alcohol. They described her as aggressive, difficult to understand and ""rambling"" as she gave her account of what had allegedly happened between her and Jones. 

15The deceased who was sitting on a lounge chair at the time, said to the accused: 

""Calm down Pat, they're just doing a job. Just listen.""


16The accused told the police that earlier in the day, she had gone to Jones' premises. According to the accused, Jones expressed his affection for her and in doing so, grabbed her breasts. The accused told police that she simply wanted Jones ""spoken to"" and that she did not wish any action to be taken beyond that. 

17Police left the deceased's premises and spoke with Jones who admitted that the accused had been at his premises earlier in the day. He also said that he had asked her to leave as a consequence of her removing food from his premises, and otherwise denied the accused's allegations. 

18Late on the evening of 11 February a number of calls were made from the landline attached to the deceased's premises to a televised appeal for donations for bushfire victims. There were also calls made from that landline to the premises of Hilda Fetch during that evening as well as in the early hours of 12 February. Mrs Fetch was the mother of Norman Fetch, an acquaintance of the accused. It is the Crown case that each of the calls made to her number were made by the deceased.

19At some time during the late evening of 11 February, the accused left the deceased's premises and went to Baston's premises where she collected the shopping bags which she had left there earlier in the day. The accused told Baston that she was feeling tired and wanted to go home. Baston saw the accused leave his premises and walk across the car park of the unit complex, in a direction opposite to that of the deceased's premises.

20At 12.28am on 12 February the accused called 000 from the deceased's premises. She told the operator (inter alia) that the deceased was bleeding from the stomach.

21Ambulance officers arrived at the deceased's premises at about 12.43 am. The accused, who was known to one of the ambulance officers as a patient whom he had previously treated, was present at the time. She was described as being upset, and in a state of panic and distress. When asked what had happened the accused said (inter alia): 

""I don't know"".

22The deceased was observed by the ambulance officers to be sitting at the base of the toilet in the bathroom with a towel covering his chest. He was conscious and when asked what happened by the ambulance officers he too answered:

""I don't know"".

23The ambulance officers then commenced to treat the deceased at the scene. One of them said (inter alia):

""Who's done it? Who stabbed him?""

24The accused replied:

""I don't know. He tried to kill himself before. He's got mental health issues"".

25The accused's assertion that the deceased had previously tried to take his own life is said by the Crown to be a deliberate lie, and thus evidence of her consciousness of guilt. 

26The accused also said to police:

""He's stabbed himself and overdosed before"". 

27On the Crown case that statement was a second deliberate lie told by the accused.

28After police attended the deceased's premises, the deceased had a conversation with a police officer in which he said:

""You think I did this to myself? I wouldn't, I have never done anything to myself"".

29The deceased was transported to hospital by ambulance. On the way to the hospital he was again asked what had happened to him, and he again replied that he did not know. He also told the ambulance officers that he had been drinking. 

30On the way to the hospital, the deceased was asked by one of the ambulance officers whether he had inflicted the injury upon himself. He responded:

""Don't be a bloody idiot, I've survived cancer, why would I try and kill myself?""
 
31Although the deceased was treated at hospital, he was pronounced dead at about 4.14 am on 12 February 2009. The cause of death was an abdominal stab wound which severed his thoracic aorta. 

32The accused participated in two lengthy interviews with police. The first of those interviews was conducted in the early hours of 12 February 2009, and the second on 30 March 2009. The accused was not placed under arrest on either occasion and she denied being responsible for the deceased's death. 

33Scientific evidence establishes that a bloodstain, said by the Crown to be left by the deceased, was found on the floor of the kitchen of his premises. Nearby, there was a knife seized by police which, when subjected to a presumptive test, revealed the possible presence of blood.

34The Crown alleges that some days after the deceased's death, the accused telephoned the landline of Hilda Fetch and left a message on an answering machine in which she admitted having stabbed the deceased. Whether this evidence should be admitted is another of the evidentiary issues for determination. 

35In 2009, police commenced an undercover operation with the objective of obtaining admissions from the accused as to the killing of the deceased. The accused was befriended by an undercover police officer referred to in these proceedings as UCO-1, with whom she met regularly over the ensuing 12 months. Despite the frequency of their meetings, and despite the deceased's death being a subject of discussion between them, the accused made no admissions to UCO-1. SUPPRESSED. Other matters which were the subject of discussion included the accused's psychological treatment, and her alcohol addiction.

36On the morning of 16 November 2010, as part of the undercover operation, police attended the accused's premises and informed her that she had been identified as the main suspect in the murder of the deceased, and that she was required to attend the police station at 8.00 am on the following morning for questioning. Following that visit by the police, UCO-1 attended the accused's premises at which time the accused informed her of the earlier visit by the police. UCO-1 then informed the accused that she too had been questioned by the police as to her association with the accused. SUPPRESSED. 

37SUPPRESSED who was in fact another undercover officer known as UCO-2. Consistent with the discussions which had previously taken place between UCO-1 and the accused, SUPPRESSED. The entirety of the accused's conversation with UCO-2 was recorded and is in evidence before me.

38In the course of these discussions, the accused made a number of statements denying any involvement in the deceased's death. These denials were met, in almost every case, by UCO-2 expressing some disbelief of them, SUPPRESSED. Finally, the accused told UCO-2 that she had stabbed the deceased. Shortly after doing so, other police officers who had been monitoring the conversation in an adjoining room, entered the room and arrested the accused. After the accused was conveyed back to the police station, she made further admissions to the police. Whether the evidence of the accused's admissions to UCO-2 and the other police should be excluded is another of the evidentiary issues I am required to determine.

39It is part of the Crown case that the accused was a person who had a tendency to act in a violent and aggressive manner. Whether some of the evidence relied upon by the Crown in this respect should be admitted as tendency evidence is another of the evidentiary issues for determination.

40In summary, the Crown case is that the accused, having consumed alcohol, armed herself with a knife from the kitchen of the deceased's premises and stabbed him, either before she left his premises late on the evening of 11 February, or when she returned in the early hours of the morning of 12 February 2009. The Crown alleges that she did so either intending to kill him, or intending to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. 

41The Crown further alleges that having murdered the deceased, the accused cleaned the knife which she had used to stab him, before returning it to the knife block which was located on the kitchen bench. 

42The primary position of the accused is that the entirety of the evidence is insufficient to establish that she was responsible for the death of the deceased. 

THE EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
43As I have noted in outlining the case, I have been asked to determine the following evidentiary issues: 

(1)whether the admissions made by the accused to UCO-2, and subsequently to other police, should be excluded, pursuant to either s. 138 or s. 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 (""the EA"");

(2)whether evidence of previous behaviour on the part of the accused should be admitted as evidence tending to establish that she is a violent and aggressive person; 

(3)whether evidence of an admission, said to have been left by the accused in a message on a telephone answering machine, should be excluded pursuant to the provisions of either s. 90 or s. 137 of the EA; and

(4)whether statements made by the deceased constitute lies which evidence a consciousness of guilt.


44I have dealt with the last of those issues when considering the ultimate issue of whether or not the evidence establishes, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused murdered the deceased. 

THE ACCUSED'S ADMISSIONS
The undercover operation
45In or about mid July 2009, the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Taylor, made contact with the undercover branch of the New South Wales Police. On that occasion, he discussed what he described as ""strategies"" for the ongoing investigation. At some point, a decision was taken to implement an undercover operation. In broad terms, it was proposed that an undercover officer, UCO-1, would befriend the accused over a period with a view to obtaining admissions from her regarding the deceased's death. 

46The accused had been admitted to hospital in about mid 2009, causing the commencement of the undercover operation to be delayed. On 1 October 2009 Detective Taylor made the first of a series of applications for warrants authorising the use of listening devices by UCO-1, the officer who was to meet with and befriend the accused. Those meetings took place over a period of approximately 12 months, and the transcripts of what was said in those meetings are before me in evidence.

47As events transpired, the accused made no admissions to UCO-1. However, in the circumstances more fully described below, the accused ultimately met with another undercover operative, UCO-2, to whom she admitted having stabbed the deceased. Shortly after making that admission, the accused made further admissions to Detective Taylor. In order to determine whether the evidence of these admissions ought be excluded, it is necessary for me to set out, in some detail, the relevant aspects of the undercover operation.

The accused and UCO-1 meet
48UCO-1, who first met the accused on 28 October 2009, gave evidence (commencing at T215 L10) of the manner in which the operation was conducted, and its objectives: 

Q. That undercover operation was carried out over the course of a year? 
A. Yes. 

Q. During that undercover operation the intent, in terms of your involvement, was to record admissions by Patricia Anne Gallagher in relation to the murder? 
A. Not myself, no. 

Q. You were recording your conversations with Patricia Gallagher? 
A. Mmmmmm. 

Q. When you were having conversations with Patricia Gallagher, your hope was that she would discuss the murder? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And make admissions against her interests in relation to that murder, is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. In terms of that operation, that was unsuccessful in that on no occasion did she make such admissions? 
A. Not to me, no, she didn't. 

Q. In terms of that operation, she wasn't talking to anyone else? 
A. My understanding is there was one operation, Strike Force Woodfield. It was the one operation. 


49UCO-1 first met with the accused on the morning of 28 October 2009. On that occasion she stopped the accused on a street in Padstow and, on the pretext of being new to the area, she struck up a conversation with the accused in which she (UCO-1) asked her to recommend a nearby coffee shop. They spoke to one another over a period of about one hour on that day, in the course of which the accused provided (at UCO-1's request) her contact details. Their meeting concluded with an arrangement to meet again the following week. 

50UCO-1 subsequently met with the accused on numerous occasions between October 2009 and September 2010. She also spoke with the accused on the telephone on various occasions during that same period. It is not necessary for me to set out the entirety of the subject matter that was discussed on those occasions. Much of it was somewhat mundane conversation which was obviously directed to the objective of UCO-1 forming a relationship with the accused in which the accused would feel sufficiently comfortable to speak about the deceased and admit to killing him. There were, however, some particular matters which were the subject of discussion to which I must refer, and which are relevant to the issue of whether or not the accused's admissions ought be excluded. 

51Firstly, the accused and UCO-1 discussed the fact that the accused was, at the time, undertaking some form of psychiatric or psychological treatment. For example, in the conversation recorded on 16 March 2010 the following appears (commencing at T 6):

""UCO-1: And Robbie's the psychiatrist.
Accused: Yeah.

UCO-1: Now I got you.
Accused: Yeah.

UCO-1: So how does, I don't understand how it works.
Accused: Well get...paper, and she writes...

UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: ...oh well, I...

UCO-1: Tell me about it. They, everyday, there's another one, isn't there?
Accused: ...She said, There's...and she said, actually there are...

UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: ...bullshit

UCO-1: They are, a lot of them. Yeah.
Accused: She'd write that down and then she gives me a, like, a book...and then my...and then I gotta...don't know what that means...

UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: And am I...treatment.

UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: Unsatisfied and I write very satisfied.

UCO-1: What happens if you say an unsatisfied?
Accused: Hmm.

UCO-1: What happens if you say unsatisfied? What do they do?
Accused: Put me onto another.

UCO-1: Oh, so if your unsatisfied with that person, with Robbie?
Accused: Yeah.

UCO-1: Ok. I got you.
Accused: Yeah. And then that goes...hand.

UCO-1: So Robbie's a girl?
Accused: They're both girls.

UCO-1: They're, ok.
Accused: Yeah.
UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: ...

UCO-1: Oh, yeah, I knew...but Robbie is girl?
Accused: Yeah.

UCO-1: Yep. Ok.
Accused: ...

UCO-1: Sweet.
Accused: But on the back seat, I said...to much...

UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: And on that...like, why would you do that...and I just write, well with the hell I've been through, I don't know what I'd do without counselling.

UCO-1: ...yeah.
Accused: I, I don't 

UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: I never had it before.

UCO-1: No.
Accused: Never got a, are you mental, is that why you're here...

UCO-1: Is that what they said? 
Accused: Yeah. If you are here on...are here because you have mental issues and I go, Robbie...so. I'm here 'cause and then I'm...she says, No, you're here anger management.

UCO-1: Yeah.
Accused: Well its got no anger management or not, its got mental. But she give it to me don't worry about that, you don't worry about...and I go, Well, what'd you give it to me for.""


52This was not the sole occasion on which the accused discussed her psychological care and treatment with UCO-1 (see conversation of 13 April 2010 at T 2; conversation of 30 April 2010 at T 1; conversation of 1 July 2010 at T 1 and 5; conversation on 15 August 2010 at T 37 - 40; conversation of 15 September 2010 at T 34).

53Secondly, both in the context of conversations concerning the accused's psychological treatment as well as independently of that, the accused told UCO-1 that she had been having suicidal thoughts. For example, in the conversation of 15 August 2010 (commencing at T 37) the following exchange took place:

""Accused: - - -if I could shop (sic) my head off and put somebody else's then I would do it but I mean, I tell you what lately I've just been thinking and can't get...my car and I'm chicken.

UCO-1: Don't do anything stupid Pat.

Accused: And then I thought, I'd been thinkin' I'll nip me fuckin' self. 

UCO-1: No you don't do, no, no, no.

Accused: Why am I thinkin' it?

UCO-1: If knew that you've nipped yourself or you've taken pills I'll fuckin' come down on you like a ton of bricks, no don't do that, there's ways around it, if you have to move, move. If you're not happy where you are, move or find a ... that, that's not the answer its not. And if you're feeling that way you really need to go and see someone professional - - -""

54In a later conversation on 15 September 2010 there were references to Banks House, an institution which the accused referred to as a ""nut house"", as well as references to the accused having considered suicide. 

55Thirdly, there were references in the accused's conversations with UCO-1 (in the context of her psychological treatment) to the fact that she had been prescribed, and was apparently using, some form of medication. For example, in the conversation of 15 August 2010 the following exchange took place (at T 42):

Accused: See all this medication, it's not working;
UCO-1: So you need to tell her. Who's given you the medication?

Accused: ...


UCO-1: Well have you told him that, what's he got you on?
Accused: I don't know.

56Finally, there were references in conversations with UCO-1 to the accused's attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous. For example, in the course of the conversation of 15 September 2010 the following exchange took place (at T 33):

UCO-1: Mmm. So yeah, so your week, what days are good for you so I can plan my life around you, what days do you go to AA?
Accused: Thursday, tomorrow AA;

57UCO-1 was cross-examined by counsel for the accused in relation to her role in the undercover operation and, in particular, in relation to her knowledge of the accused's psychological condition. She told the court that in the absence of reviewing the transcripts (a task which, for reasons which are unexplained, she had not undertaken prior to giving evidence) she had little memory of the content of her conversations with the accused. 


58The cross-examination of UCO-1 by Counsel for the accused included the following (commencing at T220 L27):

Q. From your dealings with her over the year, did you form the view she had a problem with alcohol? 
A. No, because every time I met her it was for a coffee, and she was never drunk on occasions I met her...

...

Q. Did you become aware she was being treated for psychiatric problems at Banks House in Bankstown? 
A. No. 

...

Q. Do you remember her mentioning the first names of psychologists, one being Robbie and one being Veronica? 
A. I remember the name Robbie, yes. 

Q. You remember that as a psychologist? 
A. I remember the name Robbie. 

Q. Do you remember her on occasion discussing with you suicidal thoughts? 
A. No. 

59This cross-examination culminated in the following (commencing at T221 L40):
""Q. On any account, can I take this from those answers, that you when you spoke to Detective O'Toole, prior to the commencement of the operation at SUPPRESSED, you didn't raise with him any issues of Patricia Gallagher being an alcoholic, you didn't raise that with him? 
A. No. 

Q. Any psychological problems she may have? 
A. No. 

Q. Any problems with her memory? 
A. No. 

Q. Any problems in relation to brain injuries she had suffered in the past? 
A. No, not that I recall. I don't remember any of that being mentioned."" 

60It is impossible to reconcile at least some of UCO-1's evidence with the content of the transcripts of some of her conversations with the accused. For example, as I have pointed out, the accused's attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous was the subject of a specific discussion with UCO-1. In these circumstances, I do not accept UCO-1's evidence that she did not form a view that the accused had some problem with alcohol. I also do not accept UCO-1's denial of any knowledge of the accused's treatment at Banks House. That too was the subject of a specific reference in one of the conversations. In my view, UCO-1 must have been aware of the fact that the accused was under some form of psychological treatment, that she was taking medication and that she was undergoing treatment for alcohol dependence. 

61In these respects, the evidence of UCO-1 may be usefully contrasted with that of Detective O'Toole who was her supervisor and who, in that capacity was someone with whom UCO-1 was in regular contact during the course of the operation. 

62Detective O'Toole took over the management of the undercover operation in February 2010, approximately 3 months after its actual commencement. On 31 March 2010 he contacted a Behavioural Science Team in the Forensic Services Group of the NSW Police due to what he described as ""difficulty"" in UCO-1 building a relationship with the accused. Detective O'Toole corresponded with that group between April and July 2010 and, on one occasion, he and UCO-1 met with a Psychologist to discuss how UCO-1 could build a stronger relationship with the accused. Throughout this period Detective O'Toole supervised UCO-1's meetings with the accused. 

63In cross examination, Detective O'Toole explained (commencing at T229 L42) that the reason he contacted the Behavioural Science Team was that UCO-1 was having ""some issues"" in dealing with the accused. When asked by me about the nature of such ""issues"" Detective O'Toole responded (at T229 L49):

""Just not concentrating on discussions as they were taking place and things to that sort of regard"".

64Detective O'Toole went onto to describe (at T230 L5) the accused as being ""a different person to deal with than (he) was certainly used to"". When asked to elaborate on the difficulties that UCO-1 was experiencing in dealing with the accused Detective O'Toole said (at T230 L17):

""From my memory, it was mainly just having her concentrate on a topic of conversation. She would go off on tangents. If something more interesting was happening around her, she would concentrate on that other than the topic of conversation with UCO-1"". 

65Detective O'Toole agreed that he had been made aware that the accused had some issues with alcohol and that he was generally aware of the possibility that she may have abused alcohol at some stage in her life. He also agreed (at T231 L13) that he had been informed that the accused was receiving treatment for anger management, although he thought that the source of that particular information was Detective Taylor. Detective O'Toole then gave the following evidence (commencing at T231 L38):

""Q. Do you have any recollection of being told that she was under the care of any psychologist for any particular condition? 
A. During a particular deployment I recall Patricia telling UCO-1 that she was speaking to somebody about some psychological issues, I believe. 

Q. Was that someone she only mentioned by first name, Robbie or Veronica? 
A. Robbie does ring a bell with me. 

Q. Does this refresh your memory that Robbie was her case worker at Revesby Medical Centre? 
A. I'm not sure. I recall the name Robbie being mentioned.

HIS HONOUR 

Q. Were you aware of all of these things at the time that the forensic psychologist at the Behavioural Science Team became involved? 
A. I believe I was, yes. 

Q. So you were aware at that time, were you, that there was some history of the accused having what might be described as anger management issues? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You were aware at that time she was being treated by some form of health professional for psychological issues? 
A. She was undergoing some sort of treatment, yes. 

Q. For psychological issues? 
A. I don't recall if it was psychological issues but certainly some treatment. 

Q. What form of medical treatment did you think it was or was it simply the case that you didn't know? 
A. Well, thinking back now, I was just aware it was medical treatment. I didn't concern myself with knowing what branch of the medical treatment it was taking. 

Q. You are also aware from your conversations with UCO-1 that there was a difficulty, if not an inability on the part of the accused to concentrate in the course of a concentration? 
A. Yes."" 

66I formed the view that Detective O'Toole gave candid and honest evidence. I am satisfied that at some point after he assumed the management of the operation, he became aware of the fact that the accused had the difficulties he identified in his evidence, as a result of which he sought professional advice as to how those difficulties might be overcome, and a closer relationship forged between UCO-1 and the accused, so as to increase the prospect of the accused making admissions.

67Within the period during which UCO-1 spoke with the accused there were two meetings which were particularly significant. The first was a meeting on 13 April 2010 and the second a meeting on 15 August 2010.

The meeting on 13 April 2010
68When she met with the accused on 13 April 2010 UCO-1 put an offer to the accused regarding work with SUPPRESSED a role later adopted by UCO-2. On that occasion, the following was said (commencing at T 13):

UCO-1: I've got a proposition for you if you're keen.
Accused: (LAUGHS) 

UCO-1: But it goes nowhere. It's between you and me and no - one else.
Accused: ...

UCO-1: Yeah, definitely. Thank you. Ta.
Accused: Thank you.

UCO-1: Well, you are, you're like a sister to me. Um, SUPPRESSED. Um I've mentioned him before. 
Accused: Hmm. 

UCO-1: SUPPRESSED
Accused: But he doesn't know me from a bar of soap.

UCO-1: No, and he doesn't want to know you. He wants, needs, like, SUPPRESSED
Accused: Oh, eh...

UCO-1: Yeah, yeah. Um, but I said, like, I trust you with me life and everything and he was pretty happy with that but, um, so if you're interested, like, I'll have to speak to him obviously. SUPPRESSED 
Accused: Oh...

UCO-1: - - - You keep it at your place, I come and get it off you.""

69The conversation concluded with arrangements being made, in general terms, to speak in the coming weeks. 

The meeting on 15 August 2010
70When she met with the accused on 15 August 2010, and after the accused had made a reference to the deceased, UCO-1 sought to direct the conversation towards that subject, saying (at T 7):

""I poured my heart out to you about the bloke that flogged the crap out of me, you never told me about you and Billy"".

71In the ensuing conversation, the accused spoke of the history of her relationship with the deceased. She also told UCO-1 that the deceased was the victim of a ""fatal stabbing"" and that she had found the deceased and called 000. At no stage of the conversation did the accused admit stabbing the deceased. 

The meetings between UCO-1 and the accused conclude
72The undercover operation, in so far as it incorporated conversations between the accused and UCO-1, was unsuccessful in securing any admissions from the accused. There followed the introduction of the undercover operative UCO-2 into the investigation. UCO-1 explained how that came about (commencing at T219 L16):

""Q. On any account, the activity at SUPPRESSED was different in terms of what was being done, if we could put it in those terms, from Ms Gallagher, from the activities that you had been involved with in the operation up to that point. Is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. The decision to carry out the investigation, if that term could be used for it, at SUPPRESSED, was made after a lengthy period of you having discussions with Patricia Gallagher which resulted in no admissions by her in relation to the murder. That is right, isn't it? 
A. Yes, she didn't make admissions to me. 

Q. The reason for proceeding with the use of the Undercover Operative UCO-2 at SUPPRESSED was because up to that point the operation had been unsuccessful in terms of obtaining admissions from Ms Gallagher. That is right? 
A. Yes. 

73A question did arise in the proceedings as to whether the undercover operation incorporating the meetings between the accused and UCO-1 was a separate operation to that which took place at SUPPRESSED, or whether the latter was simply a continuation of the former. In my view, nothing turns on that question, and it is not necessary for me to resolve it. 

The police attend the accused's premises on 16 November 2010
74As a prelude to that part of the undercover operation which ultimately took place at SUPPRESSED, Senior Constable Dabin attended the accused's premises on 16 November 2010. On that occasion, he told the accused that he had been assigned to investigate the death of the deceased and that the accused had been identified as the ""main suspect"" in that investigation. He told the accused that he required her to attend the Bankstown Police Station at 8.00 am the following morning so that detectives could ""speak"" with her. The conversation between the accused and Senior Constable Dabin included the following:

Dabin: Ok. I want you to get some legal advice from a lawyer and bring one with you tomorrow to the police station.
Accused: A lawyer. Where will I get lawyer from? I don't know any lawyers. Should I call my caseworker?

Dabin: I don't know if your caseworker can help you. Maybe you have a friend that can help you with that I don't know. I just want you to know that I need you to come to Bankstown Police Station tomorrow morning at 8am.
Accused: Yes. Yes. I just don't know.

Dabin: Patricia. As you know this investigation has been ongoing for quite some time?
Accused: Yes I know that. 

Dabin: Ok. I believe that we have enough evidence surrounding the case now that identifies you as the main suspect which is why I am giving you the chance to get a lawyer and bring him with you. I don't where to get a lawyer from. You might have a friend who knows one I don't know. You might want to bring some spare clothes also.
Accused: Clothes. I can do that.

Dabin: Good. Look I am just trying to be fair with you today. If the murder happened yesterday then I would probably arrest you right now. But because it happened almost 2 years ago I am going to let you get some help. Ok.""

75Following his conversation with the accused at her home, Senior Constable Dabin went to SUPPRESSED where he spoke with Detectives Stamoulis and Taylor. 

76Senior Constable Dabin did not record the time at which he arrived at, or departed from, the accused's premises. The evidence establishes that UCO-1 made calls to the accused's landline at 12:12pm, 2:02pm, and 2:16pm on that day. None of those calls were answered and on each occasion UCO-1 left a recorded message. Between the first and second of those calls UCO-1 attended a briefing with other police.

UCO-1 attends the accused's premises on 16 November 2010
77At about 3.16pm on 16 November 2010, following the visit by Senior Constable Dabin, UCO-1 drove to the accused's premises and had a conversation with her. It is evident from reading the transcript of that conversation that the accused was in an agitated state which, I infer, was a consequence of what she had earlier been told by Senior Constable Dabin. 

78UCO-1 told the accused that the ""cops had just pulled her over"" and had questioned her about her association with, and knowledge of, the accused. The accused then told UCO-1 that she had been accused of the deceased's murder. At that point UCO-1 told the accused that she had ""spoken to SUPPRESSED"". UCO-1 also told the accused that SUPPRESSED. 

UCO-1 and the accused travel to SUPPRESSED 
79The accused and UCO-1 travelled by car from Padstow to SUPPRESSED. As with all of the other conversations between the accused and UCO-1, the conversation which took place between them on the way to SUPPRESSED was recorded and a transcript of that conversation is before me in evidence.

80Significantly, that conversation included the following (at T 9): 

""UCO-1: Yeah. I think we need SUPPRESSED, Pat, don't you?

Accused: Yeah, but I didn't, I didn't kill Billy."" (my emphasis).

81Later (at T 15) the accused said:

""They, they're giving me a chance. I didn't kill anyone. Now, they reckon I've killed someone, though, right? Well why did they just leave me there? (my emphasis).

UCO-1: I've got no idea mate. I don't understand how they work. I don't know. I don't have a legal mind. I don't know what that does.""

82As they reached SUPPRESSED UCO-1 said to the accused:

""We'll ask him. All we can do is ask. SUPPRESSED.""

83Upon arrival at SUPPRESSED, UCO-1 took the accused to meet UCO-2 in a room which was equipped with a recording device. The subsequent conversation between the accused and UCO-2 was monitored by Detectives Taylor and Stamoulis who were in the adjoining room. The DVD recording of that meeting, and the transcript of what was said, are in evidence before me.

The accused meets with UCO-2 at SUPPRESSED
84At the commencement of the conversation with UCO-2, and as the accused sat down, the following was recorded:

""Accused: Oh, this is like the psychologist's chair.
UCO-1: Um, I went around to see Pat - - - UCO-2.

Accused: Yeah.
UCO-1: - - - cause we were going to catch up for a coffee today, right.

UCO-2: Psychologists chair.
Accused: Yeah.

UCO-2: Yeah.
Accused: I go to psychology.

UCO-2: Do they do any good?
Accused: No, no.""

85The conversation proceeded with UCO-2 speaking to the accused about SUPPRESSED which had previously been the subject of discussion between the accused and UCO-1 (at T 5): 

""UCO-2: SUPPRESSED

Accused: Oh, right.

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED
Accused: Ah hmm. 

UCO-2: Alright. Alright.""

86It is appropriate to note at this stage that as he explained it, SUPPRESSED. Notwithstanding the somewhat basic terms in which that was explained, it is evident that the accused, initially at least, fundamentally misunderstood what was being asked of her. In particular, and despite no such request having been made, she apparently understood SUPPRESSED. So much is evident from the following conversation which followed:

""Accused: SUPPRESSED 

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED me.
Accused: SUPPRESSED

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED

(INTERFERENCE)

Accused: Oh, got you.""

87It was not until UCO-2 explained it again that the accused expressed a clear understanding SUPPRESSED 

88The conversation between the accused and UCO-2 then moved to the subject of the murder of the deceased. UCO-2 explained to the accused that SUPPRESSED

""UCO-2: SUPPRESSED 

Accused: SUPPRESSED

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED

Accused: Oh, what.

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED


89At that point of the conversation the accused interrupted UCO-2 and stated:

""I didn't kill Billy"". (my emphasis)


90Following that interjection, UCO-2 continued:

""UCO-2: SUPPRESSED

91UCO-2 then SUPPRESSED:

SUPPRESSED

92The accused then made reference to various events on the evening of the deceased's death and told UCO-2 (inter alia) that she found the deceased in the bedroom of his premises. Those statements made by the accused were entirely exculpatory. This seemingly prompted UCO-2 to interject and say to the accused:

""UCO-2: SUPPRESSED

93SUPPRESSED

94At that point the accused interjected and said:

""Billy and I have never hurt each other"" (my emphasis)

95I should note that the statement made by the accused in [94] is not fully transcribed. The transcript records the words ""Billy and I"" and then records the word ""interference"". However, having listened to the recording carefully on a number of occasions, I am satisfied that the words that were said by the accused at that time were as I have recorded them. 

96At that point, UCO-2 continued:

SUPPRESSED

97The accused said: 

""Yeah. But what, I didn't stab him"" (my emphasis).

98UCO-2 continued:

SUPPRESSED

99At this point the accused interrupted and said:

""I can't say I stabbed a person when I didn't"" (my emphasis).

100The conversation then continued with the following exchange:

""UCO-2: Here's the big one, OK. Forgive me for saying this, but dead men tell, tell no lies.
Accused: Hm.

UCO-2: Ok.
Accused: I've heard that story.

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED
Accused: I didn't even know what the - - - 

UCO-2: Well anyway, I'll finish. So - - - 
Accused: I don't know how many times he was, how many times was he - - - 
UCO-2: SUPPRESSED
Accused: Right.""

101UCO-2 then reiterated to the accused that he required SUPPRESSED

SUPPRESSED

102The accused then proceeded to give an account of the events of the evening. She told UCO-2 that the deceased had gone to bed and at that time he was ""alright"". At that point the following ensued:

""UCO-2: Are you, are you going to tell me that you didn't stab him?
Accused: He went to bed, Billy did go to bed. Can I talk?

UCO-2: Yeah, you can, SUPPRESSED
Accused: Do you want me to talk?

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED
Accused: Billy did go to bed.""

103The accused then explained that she left the deceased's premises and went to Baston's premises. She then explained what happened when she left:

""Accused: Right. So I went ""I'm going home now, ok"". I shut door before I go, went on my way out. When I got there he was, he, this was this mmm, mmm, he was crunched on, he was crunched up to here like, may I?

UCO-2: Listen, listen. 
Accused: And he's like that.

UCO-2: Yeah.
Accused: So someone - - - 

UCO-2: Ok. Now stop there, stop there. SUPPRESSED
Accused: Yeah.
UCO-2: SUPPRESSED 
Accused: Yeah.

UCO-2: I like the sound of you, I, I like that you can handle yourself and I like that you're older and, that you trust us, UCO-1 trusts you, all that sort of thing, alright.
Accused: Yeah.

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED
Accused: Right 

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED 
Accused: Ah hmm

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED
Accused: That's want me to take clothes.

UCO-2: Yeah. So - - - 
Accused: I don't want to take clothes - - -

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED

104UCO-2 then continued:

""UCO-2: SUPPRESSED
Accused: It was in, in the abdomen they said (my emphasis).

UCO-2: SUPPRESSED




105At that point the accused said:

""Ok. We'd had a little bit, alright, little bit of an argument.""

106When asked by UCO-2 to tell him what she did the accused said:

'Billy, I don't want to do this, its going to kill me to do this, but I've had it'.

107At that point the accused demonstrated a blow in a downwards direction with her hands clasped. 

108The accused then explained how she telephoned 000 and the following exchange took place between her and UCO-2:

Accused: Yeah. He got out.
UCO-2: He got out of bed?

Accused: Yeah.
UCO-2: What, after you stabbed him?

Accused: That's what I'm talking about.

109It will be evident from the extracts of the conversation between the accused and UCO-2 set out above that the accused denied, on a number of occasions, killing the deceased. On each of those occasions, SUPPRESSED. He also told her that he did not believe her denials that she had killed the deceased. 

110UCO-2 SUPPRESSED. For example he said (commencing at T28):

""He's laying in bed, you lay next to him, you've got a knife hidden under your pillow just in case, you're rowing, you're rowing. He turns around and says ""Fuck you"" grabs the knife and comes at you. You grab it so you're laying here, you grab his hand, look at me. You grab his hand as it comes over you, he's, he's old, he's pissed, he's not real strong. You've, he's got the knife coming down at you like this, stabbing down and you've got, you've got a knife - - -
Accused: Well it wouldn't be the first time he come at me.

UCO-2: Exactly. And then you just go like this.

Accused: Yeah, well - - -

UCO-2: Hear me. You just go like this, woofa, whack, he stops it, he goes away, he drops the knife, you step back, you shit yourself. And you say that, you say 'I panicked, he dropped the knife'. You've curled up in a ball, like you said, so you grab his knife, you grab your knife, cleaned it off, you put them both back in the block and then you rang triple-0. And the reason that you - - -

Accused: I didn't have 2 knives, I only had one. 

UCO-2: No, you had one, he has one.

Accused: Oh, I got it""

111After further discussion about the scenario put by UCO-2, the following conversation took place (commencing at T31):

""UCO-2: Well, what do you think about that? SUPPRESSED Pretty simple.

Accused: We'd be practising all night""

112There was then further discussion between UCO-2 and the accused, SUPPRESSED

113UCO-2 gave evidence before me and was cross examined about information he had been given about the accused prior to meeting with her. He was unable to recall whether he had been informed that the accused may be an alcoholic, and was similarly unable to recall whether he had been made aware of the accused having any psychological or psychiatric problems. In this regard, UCO-2 said (at T183 L28):

""I'm may very well have been, but its three years ago, I can't recall""


114UCO-2 ultimately appeared to accept (commencing at T183 L33) that he had been given some information about the accused but could not recall any detail of it. 

The accused is arrested by police
115After a little over one hour of conversation with UCO-2, Detectives Taylor and Stamoulis, along with Constable Pigott, entered the room. The accused was cautioned and then arrested for the murder of the deceased. At that stage, the following conversation took place: 

""Accused: Yes, why did you use the bloke - - -want to know why I did it and set me up why?""

Taylor: We'll talk about that back at the Police Station.

Accused: He was telling me to lie, SUPPRESSED - - -How stupid could I have been - - - SUPPRESSED and where did UCO-1 go? (my emphasis) 

Taylor: We'll talk about it when we get back.""

The accused is taken to the Police Station
116The accused was then conveyed to the police station, where Detective Taylor had the following conversation with her: 

""Taylor: Patricia, I have just charged you with murder, do you understand that?

Accused: Yeah, I knew that was going to happen. 

Taylor: Patricia is (sic) there any questions you wish to ask me at this stage? I know that you have spoken to Detective Sergeant Stamoulis . He informed me that you are unable to get a solicitor at this stage. If you still want to speak to us after you speak to a solicitor we can do that at another time.

Accused: Phil, can you make sure my dogs are ok?

Taylor: That is the least of your problems, do you understand that you have just been charged with the murder of Billy (William) Grant that occurred on or around the 12th February 2009?

Accused: Phil, I know that. I was drunk when I did it, that's what I want to say. I did it when we were drunk.

Taylor: Patricia, as I said we were formally interview you when you receive legal advice if that is what you still want. Is there anything else that you wish to ask me?

Accused: Phil, you and Lauren looked after my dogs when I was in hospital last time, could you please go and see Kay Fowler at 9 School Parade and get the Animal Welfare League to look after my dogs. She will know what to do. Please don't get the RSPCA, just the Animal Welfare League.

Taylor: Patricia, I will see what I can do, I have to go now. Is there anything else that I can do for you?

Accused: Thanks, thank you Phil.""
 
117In addition, the accused had a conversation with Detective Stamoulis which was in the following terms:

""Stamoulis: Patricia, do you wish to partake in a record of interview?
Accused: I was drunk when I did it, I don't remember. I want to speak to a lawyer"".

The Police attend upon the accused in custody
118On 1 March 2011 Detective Taylor in the company of Senior Constable Paff, went to the Metropolitan Remand Centre and spoke with the accused. On that occasion the following conversation took place:

""Taylor: Patricia, we are here today to speak to you in relation to the murder of William Grant. Just after the arrest on 19 November 2010 you indicated that you wanted to speak to a solicitor before speaking to us. Have you spoken to a solicitor?

Accused: Yes and she told me not to say anything.

Taylor: Do you wish to participate in an electronic record of interview?

Accused: I want to talk to you but I've been told by my solicitor not to say anything to you.""


119There is a large body of medical evidence before me which bears upon the issue of the accused's cognitive impairment and which is necessarily relevant to the question of whether her admissions to police should be excluded, be it on the grounds of impropriety or unfairness. 

120The majority of the experts who provided reports also gave oral evidence. It is appropriate that I deal with evidence of each of them individually. 

Dr Susan Pulman
121Dr Pulman, a Clinical and Forensic Neuropsychologist, was requested to carry out a neuropsychological assessment of the accused. She provided a report dated 11 October 2011. The initial recommendation for Dr Pulman's assessment had come from Dr Olav Nielssen, a Forensic Psychiatrist who also provided a report and gave evidence in the proceedings. 

122Part of the history obtained by Dr Pulman was contained in medical records of the accused's general practitioner and treating psychologists. In this regard Dr Pulman reported:

""A letter from Ms Gallagher's General Practitioner, Dr Odysseas Missiakos dated 21 March 2011 reported that she ""suffered from cigarette induced asthma and alcoholism"" and epilepsy. To his knowledge, (she) had stopped drinking alcohol in early 2010. At that time, she was referred to a psychologist, Robbie Kordian and commenced antidepressant medication to treat anxiety and depression.

Progress reports from Robbie Kordian document that Ms Gallagher was seen for treatment between February and April 2010 for anger management and anxiety, interpersonal relationship skills, psycho education about alcohol relapse prevention, and alcohol abstinence maintenance. The reports noted that she had made some progress and her mood was stable; however she required further communication problem solving training, and (alcohol) relapse prevention.""

123Dr Pulman noted that available records from Bankstown Hospital indicated multiple admissions of the accused between 2006 and 2009, and complaints by the accused of depression and intoxication. 

124Dr Pulman also had access to Justice Health records from 2010. In this regard she reported:

""Justice Health records from 2010 documented ongoing mental health issues on a background of head injury, alcohol related brain damage, asthma and grand mal epilepsy...They also reported (17 and 18 November 2010) a suicide attempt by hanging four weeks earlier. On 18 November 2010 it was reported that Ms Gallagher had impaired cognition including poor memory.""

125Dr Pulman administered psychometric testing which demonstrated (inter alia) that the accused's overall level of intellectual functioning fell within the extremely low range, with her individual results falling below the first percentile (0.5). These results led Dr Pulman to conclude: 

""In summary, Ms Gallagher's performance on tests of executive functioning was well below average. Her verbal and nonverbal abstract reasoning skills were extremely low and borderline respectively. On a conceptual reasoning task her performance was impaired and she was extremely perseverative. Her mental flexibility was also impaired. Verbal fluency for letters and semantic categories was low average and borderline respectively. She showed some disinhibition and perseveration on these tasks. Her copy of a complex geometric figure was impaired, significantly affecting her recall of the figure after a short delay. She demonstrated a very rushed and haphazard approach, despite repeatedly being instructed to slow down and take her time.""


126Ultimately, Dr Pulman expressed (inter alia) the following opinion:

""On current neuropsychological testing, Ms Gallagher shows vast differences between her verbal and nonverbal abilities. Her nonverbal abilities, which are less affected by cultural and educational factors, suggest that her true intellectual ability is more likely to lie within the borderline range. Her verbal skills are significantly weaker, falling in the extremely low range. This is not unexpected given her poor educational and vocational background; however this discrepancy is considered unusual, possibly supporting her reports of learning difficulties and hearing problems. She also has severely impaired intentional abilities, significant executive dysfunction, including mental flexibility, conceptual and abstract reasoning, planning and organisation, disinhibition and perseveration. Her new learning and memory is also extremely low. Her processing speed, basic language, visuo spatial and visuo constructional skills remain relatively intact. Finally she endorses significantly elevated levels of depression, stress and anxiety at present.""

127Dr Pulman gave evidence before me which included the following (commencing at T279 L24):

""Q. In relation to Patricia Gallagher, what is your opinion as to the presence of any underlying brain injury which contributes to her condition? 
A. When I assessed her in 2011, I saw a pattern, a cognitive profile, which was consistent with a history of both repeated head injuries and the alcohol dependency, alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse, particularly, given the deficits I observed in her memory, you find the hippocampus, which is an area of the brain which stores memory and is very susceptible to alcohol, you could find shrinkage of that area of the brain or sclerosis of the hippocampus area. And also, if you take the history of seizures on top of that, you are getting a threefold effect of brain injury, epilepsy, alcohol abuse which together would show impairments in memory. 

Then the traumatic injuries or the brain injuries would affect the front area of the brain, so we are talking about this area here, compared to the hippocampus, and that is where you find a much slower thought process, and when I interviewed her she was particularly her processing speed you could notice was slow, her thinking was slow. Just in conversation it was at a much reduced speed than what you would say was in the normal range. So both her presentation, from a clinical perspective and from the results of neuropsychological assessment, were consistent with a history of alcohol brain injury and epilepsy. 

Q. In relation to alcohol, long-term alcohol abuse can leave damage in the brain itself that is present even when alcohol isn't being consumed. Is that the case? 
A. Yes, alcohol dependency is highly variable. When somebody ceases consuming alcohol, some individuals recover very well, others show very limited recovery and others show virtually no recovery at all. It depends upon the individual, their own cognitive resilience and the extent of the alcohol use and, without knowing exactly how much alcohol was consumed over a period of years, it is difficult to say. 

...

Q. In her case, there may be indicated from the results some degree of damage to the brain due to years of alcohol abuse, is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. But on any account what is clear is there is significant damage to the frontal lobe area of her brain that is indicated by the results of your testing and other materials you have examined? 
A. Yes, and also by the MRI scan which I understand showed white matter changes in the frontal lobe of the brain, ischaemic changes."" 

128Dr Pulman expressed the opinion (commencing at T281 L2) that in 2009 and 2010 (i.e., during the period of the undercover operation in which the accused was meeting with UCO-1) the accused's level of impairment would have been in the vicinity of that which she had outlined in her report. In response to being asked whether the accused's impairments were such as would render her likely to be more easily led by others, Dr Pulman said (commencing at T281 L18):

"" When we look at the individual's higher order reasoning, they are less able to think through the options that are available to them when they are making decisions. They are less likely to think ahead of what could happen tomorrow. They are more than likely to think about the here and now. They are much more concrete in their thinking in the sense of not understanding the bigger picture and that was clear in police interviews. You can see at the very beginning of the process the concrete thinking. So having said that, there can be implications, whether that is being easily led, whether it is making easy decisions, whether it is making very disorganised thought processes, there could be a whole presentation around those sorts of reasoning abilities that were different from your typical, average person in the street."" 


129In cross-examination by the Crown, Dr Pulman's attention was drawn to the interviews in which the accused participated, the footage of which Dr Pulman had viewed. In this regard she said (commencing at T283 L5):

""She digressed quite a lot during the DVDs that I watched. She would probably become because she wouldn't have insight into these difficulties, she wouldn't necessarily understand why she was being redirected, because she wouldn't see necessarily she was off topic. So with individuals like that, because of their quite poor insight, they get quite annoyed when you bring them back to topic because they think they are telling you something that is of interest, but it is not really necessarily of interest so when you try to bring them back to topic they can get quite irritated. I have noticed that from my years of experience.

HIS HONOUR 

Q. Does the fact they are off topic reflect a lack of understanding of the question put or the topic 
A. It can be both but it is they really don't understand the point of the question because she also has very poor verbal abstract reasoning, so she can't understand the concept of what you are trying to get at, won't see the big picture, what is a theoretical or hypothetical question, won't necessarily understand that. So both poor insight and very poor verbal abstract reasoning would, in combination, get many people irritated. 

...

Q. Leaving aside the testing, did you detect some impediment and abstract reasoning in your interactions with her? 
A. Yes, because you have to be careful of the way you ask questions, you might have to word them slightly differently. They have to be very concrete, don't put too many points within a question, only ask one very clear, straightforward, succinct question like I could have said to her ""for the purpose of this interview I know you are Patricia, but for the purpose of what we are doing now we need you to tell me what your name is"". So there are different ways you would ask questions that, from my experience you know has that abstract reasoning difficulty. They are not necessarily trying to be difficult; they just don't understand your question. 

Q. Did you deliberately simplify the terms in which you conversed with her for that reason? 
A. Yes, for the interview I did, but when the testing is conducted, that is standardised and that is not changed. ""
 
Dr Olav Nielssen
130Dr Nielssen provided a report of 30 September 2011 following his examination of the accused. For the purposes of providing that report, Dr Nielssen had also viewed the DVD recordings of the interviews conducted by police with the accused. He described the answers given by the accused to questions asked of her on those occasions as ""disorganised and digressive"". 

131Following his examination of the accused's mental state, Dr Nielssen reported (at page 5):
""Her speech was quite disorganised and difficult to follow and she seemed to have trouble finding words and also in keeping to the topic of conversation, in a way that was consistent with damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. She denied ever experiencing symptoms of psychotic illness and no delusional believes (sic) were elicited, including any apparently delusional beliefs involving Mr Grant.
Her attention and concentration were quite impaired as she was easily distracted and wandered from the point.""

132Dr Nielssen diagnosed: 

(1)an alcohol dependence and abuse disorder;

(2) a brain injury, both traumatic and alcohol related; and 

(3)epilepsy.

133His ultimate opinion included the following (at page 6):

""The pattern of intellectual impairment was consistent with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain which influences planning, emotional regulation, social judgment and impulse control. At the time of the ERISP and during the recent interview Ms Gallagher was inappropriately cheerful, emotionally labile, and was disorganised in her speech in a way that was consistent with frontal lobe injury...Ms Gallagher was not thought to have a mental illness of a kind that might leave open the defence of mental illness. However, traumatic brain injury is an underlying condition that is likely to have resulted in impairment in Ms Gallagher's ability to control her actions, notwithstanding the effects of intoxication with alcohol, because her intoxication with alcohol would exacerbate the effects of her underlying brain injury.""

134When called to give evidence, Dr Nielssen was asked to comment upon any particular aspects of the accused's mental state which he considered might render it more difficult for her to deal with official questioning. He said (commencing at T297 L29):

"" Well, I mean, having her brain injury or brain damage would make it more difficult to understand questions, to understand the thrust of questions, if you like, in an abstract way, possibly even recognising the exact significance of being questioned, but I will just make one other observation from her treating team was that Ms Gallagher has a propensity to confabulate, which is to fill in gaps in memory with made up information, which is very characteristic of people who have alcohol related dementia. Hence her answers might be quite unreliable""


135In cross-examination by the Crown, Dr Nielssen described (at T 298 line 19) the history provided by the accused as ""very scattered"" such that the impairment in her cognitive function was ""obvious"". He then gave the following further evidence in the course of cross examination by the Crown (commencing at T298 L25):

""Q. When my learned friend was asking you questions you indicated that the most prominent symptom that you observed in the course of your examination of Ms Gallagher was her communication disorder, is that correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. By that, communication disorder, can I take it that it means that her speech can be quite disorganised? 
A. That's correct, not finishing a sentence. 

Q. She has trouble finding words? 
A. That's right, using odd words, and I have given a couple of quotes of odd usages. 
Q. Did she find it difficult keeping on topic? 
A. Definitely. 

Q. She has difficulties with attention concentration which impacts on that ability to communicate? 
A. Yes. 

Q. That is very different to the ability to understand and appreciate what one is being asked, isn't it? 
A. Yes, although it is difficult to pursue a person's clear understanding if they are not keeping on the topic and confirming that they understood what you asked them but, yes, maybe her receptive language might have been a little better than her expressive language. 

Q. You told my friend in his evidence that alcohol exacerbates the symptoms that she displays as a consequence of this underlying disorder you found, is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. If she were to be questioned at a time when she hasn't been consuming alcohol, the symptoms would not manifest themselves to the degree they would if she had been consuming alcohol? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Therefore, her ability to communicate might be better, her ability to understand and appreciate what is being asked would be more acute? 
A. Than when affected by alcohol, yes."" 

Dr John McMahon
136A report of Dr John McMahon, Clinical Psychologist, dated 30 March 2012 was tendered by the Crown, although Dr McMahon did not give oral evidence in the proceedings. Dr McMahon had been asked by the Director of Public Prosecutions to undertake a neuropsychological assessment of the accused. He conducted that assessment over a period of two days and diagnosed:

(1)dementia;

(2)an alcohol dependence disorder;

(3)a sedative dependence disorder;

(4)dependent and avoidant traits;

(5)epilepsy; and

(6)a brain injury. 

Dr Stephen Allnutt
137Dr Stephen Allnutt, Forensic Psychiatrist, provided three reports at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The first of those reports was dated 1 March 2012 in which (in the context of expressing an opinion as to the fitness of the accused to stand trial) Dr Allnutt said:

""...(she) seemed to become quite easily confused, suggesting she has learning difficulties; this became more apparent near the end of the interview when she seemed to have difficulty in understanding the consequences of a finding of guilty or not guilty requiring some degree of clarification on my part; while she appeared to understand this I have concerns about probable underlying cognitive impairments that would impact on her capacity to follow proceedings and thus engage adequately and qualitatively with counsel during the course of the trial.""

138On 13 April 2012 Dr Allnutt provided a further report having had the benefit of reading that of Dr McMahon to which I previously referred. He noted that the contents of the report of Dr McMahon were consistent with the conclusions he had reached, and reaffirmed his opinion that the accused was unfit to stand trial.

139On 19 June 2013 Dr Allnutt provided a further report in which he recorded (inter alia) the following:

""She believed that around the time of the alleged offending that she was taking Dilantin and Tegretol prescribed by her general practitioner; she said had been taking this medication since age 18 since, she was hit by a truck and developed epilepsy; she stated that alcohol sometimes would trigger seizures; she estimated these occurring ""twice in a blue moon"" and described seizures consistent with grand mal; her last episode of seizure before the alleged offending was about 12 months at Christmas time while in the shopping centre but said she could not be sure about this.

She was also taking valium and serapax (both Benzodiazepines) which she was getting from friends at the time; by the time of the index incident she was taking about four tablets of between 10 and 20mg of valium as well as serapax two tablets a day; sometimes she was only taking valium and on other occasions she would take a combination of valium and serapax; she would take this medication in addition to Dilantin and Tegretol; she said that she had been taking the Benzodiazepines for about one year; she said when she took the combination of the Benzodiazepines and the anti-epileptic medication she would have ""not a care in the world"".


140Dr Allnutt also had access to the DVD footage of the accused's interviews with police. He described the accused in those interviews as having ""demonstrated persistent cognitive difficulties in the absence of substances"".

141Dr Allnutt's ultimate opinion included (inter alia) the following (at page 8 of his report):

""In my opinion the defendant likely manifests underlying cognitive impairment secondary to chronic alcohol abuse, recurrent head injury with associated grand mal epilepsy; this has been demonstrated to be consistent with dementia on neuropsychological testing.""


142When called to give evidence, Dr Allnutt said (commencing at T265 L17) that there was evidence of disorganisation in the accused's thought processes, leading to a diminution in her capacity to comprehend. He went on to explain (at T265 L36 and following) that although he was able to interact with the accused, her answers to questions were not always appropriate, leading to the quality of such interaction being (as Dr Allnutt described at it) ""somewhat disorganised"". 

143When asked whether the inappropriate nature of some of her responses to questions asked of her may have been reflective of a lack of understanding of the questions asked, Dr Allnutt said (at T266 L4):

"" I don't think it was necessarily the lack of understanding of the questions asked, no. I think look, my memory doesn't give me that impression, my impression is that her responses however, in other words the way she formed her responses to me was pathological and indicative of disorganised thought processes but she probably had capacity to understand questions and I note she was able to be redirected in the interview so that would indicate the capacity to understand the questions.""

144Dr Allnutt went on to express the view (commencing at T267 L25) that the accused's diminution in cognitive ability was evident upon objective observation. When asked whether there was evidence of disorganised thought processes he said (at T267 L29):

""I thought disorganised thought processes and that seems to be consistent, it is not just my subjective view, it was an impression I had when I saw her, which is why we found her unfit. Two neuropsychologists tested her to show she had underlying condition. If you have cognitive problems in brain damage, alcohol and substances can compound that. That was my reasoning in this case"". 

145Dr Allnutt confirmed that there was evidence of damage to the frontal lobe area of the accused's brain which he thought could be consistent with head injuries and a history of substance abuse, including alcohol abuse. He agreed that on the assumption that Dr Pulman's test results and opinions were accurate, a person with that level of disability could be more easily led, or could have a propensity to be more easily led, than those who did not similarly suffer, although he added that this was not the impression that he formed in the present case. In re-examination, when confirming the existence of brain damage, Dr Allnutt said (at T274 L11 and following):

""Let me just say my conclusion of brain damage is based on the neuropsychological assessment, and to the extent to which that is accurate and valid, that would then indicate organic brain damage in broad terms, it means biological damage to brain function and structure."" 

The relevant statutory provisions
146Counsel for the accused relied upon two statutory provisions in support of his application that the accused's admissions be excluded. The first was s. 138 of the EA which provides as follows: 

138 Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
(1) Evidence that was obtained: 

(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 

(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning: 

(a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or 
(b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission. 

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 

(a) the probative value of the evidence, and 

(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 

(c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 

(d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 

(e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 

(f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and 

(g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 

(h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. 

147The second was s. 90 of the EA which provides as follows:

90 Discretion to exclude admissions 
In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 

(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence. 
 
148I will deal with each of these provisions, and the submissions made by the parties in relation to them, separately.

The submissions of the parties - exclusion under s. 138
149Mr Austin submitted that I would be satisfied that there had been impropriety on the part of the police in obtaining the accused's admissions and that, having reached that conclusion, I would further conclude that the various factors in s. 138(3) of the EA weighed in favour of the exclusion of the evidence. He submitted that for the purposes of determining whether the evidence ought be excluded (be it pursuant to s. 90 or s. 138) there were no differentiating factors between the accused's admissions to UCO-2 and those subsequently made to Detectives Taylor and Stamboulis, such that they should, in effect, be treated together. 

150In terms of impropriety, Mr Austin submitted that I would conclude that the police were aware from an early stage of the investigation that the accused suffered from some form of intellectual impairment. He submitted that the relevant impropriety stemmed from the fact that, seized of such knowledge, the police implemented, and persevered with, an undercover operation, in circumstances where they gave no, or no proper, consideration to the accused's mental state. 

151As I understood it, Mr Austin submitted that the impropriety became more significant as the operation progressed. This submission was put on the basis that as UCO-1's interaction with the accused increased over time, the police necessarily had an increasingly greater awareness and appreciation of the accused's impaired intellectual capacity. The thrust of Mr Austin's submission was that in these circumstances the police should have terminated the undercover operation.

152Mr Austin argued that impropriety on the part of the police was further demonstrated by the nature of the interrogation to which she was subjected by UCO-2 at SUPPRESSED. In developing this argument, Mr Austin submitted that it must have been evident to police by that time that the accused suffered from some form of mental disability, yet she was subjected to what he described as a ""process of interrogation"" in which she was unreasonably pressured to confess to the deceased's murder. He pointed out that in the course of such a process, the accused had steadfastly denied to UCO-2 (as well as to UCO-1 on the way to the SUPPRESSED) that she was responsible for the deceased's murder. He pointed out that in response to those denials, UCO-2 threatened to withdraw (inter alia) SUPPRESSED and repeatedly urged her to tell the truth. In this regard, Mr Austin called in aid the provisions of s. 85 of the EA. Although he did not suggest that those provisions were directly applicable to the present case, he submitted that the accused's mental state was illustrative of the vulnerability to which that section was directed. 

153Mr Austin then addressed the factors contained in s. 138(3). In doing so he accepted, as I understood it, that the importance of the evidence (s. 138(3)(b)) and the seriousness of the offence (s. 138(3)(c)) were factors which weighed in favour of the admission of the evidence. 

154However, in terms of its probative value (s. 138(3)(a)) Mr Austin submitted that the evidence should be regarded as unreliable. Such unreliability arose, it was submitted, primarily from the accused's mental state, although Mr Austin also relied upon the form of UCO-2's questioning of the accused. 

155In terms of ss. 138(3)(d) and (e), Mr Austin did not submit that the impropriety upon which he relied was deliberate, in the sense that the police, knowing of aspects of the accused's mental condition, made a deliberate and conscious decision to exploit it or take advantage of her. However, Mr Austin submitted that the impropriety upon which he relied was at least reckless. That recklessness, he submitted, was reflected in the fact that the police were on notice of the general nature of the accused's mental state but nevertheless proceeded with the undercover operation in the circumstances which I have described.

156The Crown did not argue against the proposition that the admissions made by the accused to UCO-2 and later to Detectives Taylor and Stamboulis should be effectively be dealt with as one. The Crown submitted that in light of the submissions advanced on behalf of the accused, the question of impropriety was to be determined having regard to:

(i)the nature of the accused's mental state;

(ii)the extent of the knowledge of police as to that mental state; and 

(iii)whether having regard to that knowledge, the police made a conscious decision to take advantage of the accused in that respect.

157As to the first of those matters, the Crown accepted that there was a body of expert evidence which supported the conclusion that the accused was cognitively impaired. However, the Crown placed particular reliance upon Dr Allnutt's rejection of the proposition that the accused's cognitive deficits rendered her likely to be more easily led by others. The Crown also relied upon the evidence that the accused had some capacity to understand questions put to her, albeit a diminished capacity. 

158The Crown also pointed to the fact that there was no suggestion that the accused had consumed alcohol prior to meeting with UCO-2. In this regard, the Crown relied upon the evidence of Dr Nielssen (in [134] above) that the accused's ability to communicate was greater when she had not been drinking. 

159As to the second matter, the Crown accepted that it was open to me to take into account the accused's demeanour in the two recorded interviews in which she participated with the police when considering the issue of the extent to which the police were aware of the accused's condition. The Crown conceded that there was ""no question"" that the accused's demeanour and presentation in those interviews was consistent with the existence of some form of cognitive deficit.

160In these circumstances, the Crown conceded that it was open to me to conclude that the police knew to ""some degree"" that they were dealing with a person who had some form of intellectual impairment. In this regard, the Crown made specific reference to the evidence of Detective O'Toole and conceded that it would be open to me to conclude that there was ""some interaction"" between Detective O'Toole and UCO-1, as a result of which they both understood that the accused had some form of cognitive impairment. Notwithstanding these concessions, the Crown did not accept the thrust of the submission made on behalf of the accused that these circumstances effectively gave rise to some obligation on the part of the police to cease the controlled operation. However, no submission was advanced as to what responsibilities did fall upon the police in those circumstances. 

161As to the third matter, the Crown submitted, with some force, that there was no evidence upon which it would be open to me to conclude that the police, seized with some knowledge of the accused's mental state, deliberately set out to exploit that circumstance or take advantage of the accused in some related way. The Crown submitted that the accused's responses to the questions put by UCO-2 exhibited ""a degree of astuteness"" and that although her answers may not have been ""delivered in a sophisticated or cultural way"", there was ""an understanding of what had been put to her and the situation she was in"". In all of these circumstances, the Crown submitted that I would not find that there was impropriety on the part of the police. 

162In advancing the submission that I would not be satisfied that there was any impropriety within the meaning of s. 138, the Crown relied, in particular, on the decision of Basten JA in Robinson v Woolworths Limited trading as Woolworths Plus Petrol Werrington (2005) 64 NSWLR 612; (2005) 227 ALR 353; (2005) 158 A Crim R 546; [2005] NSWCCA 426. The Crown submitted that the mere fact that the accused had some mental incapacity which was known to police would not, of itself, be sufficient to demonstrate impropriety, and that the decision of the police to implement an undercover operation needed to be balanced against (inter alia) the serious nature of the offence and the responsibilities of the police to investigate it. However, having made that submission, the Crown also said (commencing at T333 L34):

""... and when one puts all that together, I wouldn't say it was improper. There may be doubts as to whether it was an appropriate course in all the circumstances to take, and the courts may perhaps say something to caution police about taking such a course in circumstances where they haven't informed themselves fully of the cognitive impairments of a particular individual"".

163Finally, the Crown submitted that the mere fact that the undercover operation involved deception did not, of itself, support a conclusion of impropriety. In this regard, the Crown sought to draw some comparison between the facts of this case and those considered by the High Court in Tofilau and ors v R (2007) 231 CLR 396; [2007] HCA 39.

164In respect of the provisions of s. 138(3) the Crown submitted that: 

(i)the probative value of the evidence was high (s. 138(3)(a));

(ii)the evidence was important in the proceedings (s. 138(3)(b));

(iii)the alleged offence was obviously a serious one (s. 138(3)(c)); and

(iv)the gravity of any impropriety, if found, would fall at the lower end of the scale(s. 138(3)(d)) and would not be regarded as deliberate or reckless (s. 138(3)(e)).


165Further, and bearing in mind that the considerations that the court may take into account are not limited to those set out in s. 138(3), the Crown submitted that there was no evidence that the accused held any delusional beliefs. It followed, he submitted, that her evidence should therefore be regarded as cogent and reliable.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION 
General principles governing s. 138
166Before considering the submissions of the parties it is necessary to set out some principles which guide the application of s. 138. 

167The onus is on the party seeking exclusion of the evidence (in the present case the accused) to establish that the evidence was improperly or illegally obtained. If that is established, it is then for the party seeking to have the evidence admitted (in this case, the Crown) to satisfy the court that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it, having regard to the way in which it was obtained (see generally R v Eade (2000) 118 A Crim R 449; [2000] NSWCCA 369).

168It is therefore not appropriate to speak of a discretion to exclude the evidence. Section 138 requires me to exercise a discretion to admit the evidence, notwithstanding some impropriety or illegality. However, the onus remains upon the accused in the present case to establish the impropriety or illegality before any onus is placed upon the Crown to persuade me that the evidence should nevertheless be admitted (see generally R v Coulstock (1998) 99 A Crim R 143).

169It is also necessary to bear in mind that a finding that evidence was obtained as a consequence of some impropriety is a serious and significant one. In this regard Howie J in R v Cornwell (2003) 57 NSWLR 82 said (at [87]-[88]) said: 

""I am of the view that, otherwise than when subs 138(2) or s 139 apply, the court should determine whether the section is engaged having regard to the particular facts and circumstances before it but with due regard to the seriousness of a finding that evidence was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety and the outcome of such a finding. Not every defect, inadequacy, or failing in an investigation should result in a finding that the section applies merely because it may be considered that, as a result of those defects, inadequacies or failings, the investigation was not properly conducted or that the police did not act properly in a particular respect.""

170Subsequently in Director of Public Prosecutions v AM (2006) 161 A Crim R 219; [2006] NSWSC 348, Hall J (at [45]) said:

""As Howie, J. stated in Cornwell at 87, an imperfection or defect in procedures utilised by law enforcement officers will not necessarily equate to impropriety within the meaning of s.138 of the Evidence Act. Similarly, in my opinion, not all inappropriate conduct of a law enforcement officer will necessarily be improper with the meaning of that term in s.138(1)(a).""

Impropriety in the context of s. 138
171In Robinson (supra), Basten JA specifically considered the concept of impropriety in the context of s.138. His Honour said (at [23]):

""It follows that the identification of impropriety requires attention to the following propositions. First, it is necessary to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as ""the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement"". Secondly, the conduct in question must not merely blur or contravene those standards in some minor respect; it must be ""quite inconsistent with"" or ""clearly inconsistent with"" those standards. Thirdly, the concepts of ""harassment"" and ""manipulation"" suggest some level of encouragement, persuasion or importunity in relation to the commission of an offence: thus, in describing the first category of cases, the joint judgment in Ridgway (at 39) referred to offences being procured or induced.""

172His Honour went on to say (at [36]):

""These principles should inform the determination of a court as to what constitutes ""improperly"" obtained evidence or ""impropriety"" for the purposes of s 138. In circumstances where there is no unlawfulness on the part of any law enforcement officer, mere doubts about the desirability or appropriateness of particular conduct will not be sufficient to demonstrate impropriety.

[37] Before leaving these broad principles, it is necessary to note the indeterminacy of the test identified by reference to inconsistency with 'the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement': Ridgway (at 36). Such a test invites assertion and counter-assertion, with no objective touchstone to assist in deciding which to accept and which to reject... The answer is not necessarily to eschew the task, but to establish, in advance, standards of conduct against which a claim of impropriety can be assessed. Where no relevant pre-existing standard has been breached, it should be a rare case in which impropriety would lead to exclusion.""

173His Honour's references to Ridgway were references to the decision of the High Court in Ridgway v R (1984) 184 CLR 19, a case decided prior to the enactment of the EA. In that case, Mason CJ, Deane J and Dawson J observed (at page 37) that:

""...the stage of impropriety will be reached in the case of conduct which is not illegal only in cases involving a degree of harassment or manipulation which is clearly inconsistent with minimum standards of acceptable police conduct in all the circumstances.""

174Their Honours in Ridgway also acknowledged that effective investigation by police may involve subterfuge and deceit, and may extend to the intentional creation of opportunities for the commission, by a suspect, of a criminal offence. They also acknowledged that a finding that law enforcement officers had engaged in clearly improper conduct would not suffice, of itself, to give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence of the alleged offences. They also accepted that deceptive tactics which did not involve illegal conduct will ordinarily be legitimate. In Robinson (supra) it was determined that these principles should be applied to s. 138 when considering whether particular events constituted an impropriety (see Fleming v R [2009] NSWCCA 233 at [17] per McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was).

Analysis of the medical evidence 
175In considering the medical evidence, it should be noted at the outset that although the various examinations of the accused were conducted after her arrest, there was no suggestion that her mental state at that time was different to what it was at the time of the deceased's death, or during the period of the controlled operation. As I have noted (at [128] above) this issue was specifically addressed by Dr Pulman. 

176In my view, when the medical evidence is closely analysed, there is little or no difference in the opinions expressed by the various experts concerning the accused's mental state. Based on those opinions, I am satisfied that during 2009 and 2010 the accused was suffering from (inter alia) brain damage, an alcohol dependence disorder, dementia and epilepsy. 
 
177I am further satisfied that as a consequence of these conditions, the accused was cognitively impaired and had a reduced level of intellectual functioning. It may well be, as Dr Nielssen properly conceded in cross-examination, that the accused's ability to communicate was better in the absence of being affected by alcohol. However, that does not convert to the proposition that in the absence of consuming alcohol, she was not impaired at all. As Dr Allnutt pointed out (at [140] above) the accused's cognitive difficulties were apparent and persistent, even in the absence of substances. 

178I am satisfied on the evidence that the accused's cognitive difficulties manifested themselves in a number of ways. In particular her thought processes were impaired, in the sense that they were slowed and disorganised. That, in turn, affected her ability to properly and effectively communicate, and led to a diminution in her capacity to comprehend. As a consequence of her underlying conditions, she had a propensity to become easily confused. 

179To the extent that there was any difference at all in the opinions expressed by the experts, it concerned the issue of the capacity of the accused to understand questions which were put to her, as well as the related issue of whether or not she might be prone to being ""easily led"". 

180Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that the accused's brain injury would have rendered it more difficult for her to understand the ""thrust"" of questions which were put to her, to the point of possibly not understanding the significance of being questioned at all. However, he conceded in cross-examination that at least some of the accused's communication difficulties were distinguishable from, and different to, an inability to understand a question which was put to her. 

181Dr Allnutt thought that the accused ""probably"" had the capacity to understand questions put to her. He did not form the impression that her various mental impairments led to a propensity for her to be more easily led than might otherwise have been the case. However, as I have set out (at [142]) Dr Allnutt also thought that the level of disorganisation in the accused's thought process resulted in a diminution of her capacity to comprehend.

182I am not satisfied that the evidence establishes that the accused had a propensity to be more easily led in the sense suggested in the cross- examination of Dr Allnutt by counsel for the accused. I am satisfied that the accused had some capacity to understand questions put to her. However I am also satisfied that as a result of her cognitive and intellectual impairments, her capacity in that regard was diminished. 

183Moreover, the fact that the accused may have had some capacity to comprehend questions does not lead to the conclusion that her answers to those questions were responsive or, more importantly, reliable. Dr Pulman expressed the view (in [124] above) that a ""three fold effect"" of brain injury, epilepsy and alcohol abuse would lead to an impairment of memory. Dr McMahon diagnosed the accused as suffering from dementia. As I have noted, there was no submission made that any of the conditions from which the accused was diagnosed as suffering did not exist in 2009 and 2010. 
 
184Bearing in mind the findings of Dr Pulman, and the diagnoses of Dr McMahon, it is relevant to note that Dr Nielssen (at [134]) referred to the accused's team of treating practitioners having concluded that she had a propensity to confabulate, or as he put it, to ""fill in gaps in memory with made up information"". He described this as being ""very characteristic of people who have alcohol related dementia"". In the opinion of Dr Nielssen this had the capacity to render any answers given by the accused to questions put to her ""quite unreliable"". Dr Nielssen's opinion in this regard was not the subject of any challenge in cross-examination, nor was any contrary opinion expressed by any other expert who gave evidence in the proceedings. 

185In these circumstances, I accept Dr Nielssen's opinion. It follows that even if it is accepted that the accused had some capacity to understand questions put to her, her answers to those questions may nevertheless have been unreliable as a consequence of her intellectual impairments. 
 
Is impropriety established?
186One of the fundamental bases of Mr Austin's submissions was the proposition that the police involved in the investigation knew, at least in general terms, of the accused's mental state and that their knowledge increased over time, such increase being generally commensurate with the degree of contact between the accused and UCO-1. In fairness to the police involved, it is important to recognise that they obviously did not have available to them the body of expert medical evidence which is before me and which I have summarised above. However notwithstanding that, I am satisfied that a number of the officers involved in the investigation were aware, at least in general terms, of the fact that the accused suffered from some form of cognitive impairment or intellectual deficit. 

187As I have noted, part of the evidence which the Crown conceded was available to me in order to consider the extent of the knowledge of the police of the accused's mental condition was the DVD footage of the two interviews conducted with her on 12 February 2009 and 30 March 2009 respectively. The first of those interviews was of approximately three hours duration, and the second approximately five hours duration. The footage of both of those interviews was played in the proceedings before me and I have reviewed it for the purposes of preparing this judgment. 

188The first interview was conducted within a matter of hours of the deceased's death. At the conclusion of the interview, when informed that the deceased had died, the accused became visibly distraught. However, even prior to that time, her demeanour was overly animated. In my observation she was, generally speaking, discursive in her answers to questions, often to the point of giving an answer which was unresponsive to the question asked. My impressions of her presentation on that occasion are generally consistent with the medical evidence I have summarised above.

189Had the evidence of interviews between the accused and the police been limited to that which was conducted on 12 February 2009, it may have been possible to explain the accused's demeanour by factors such as the early hour of the day at which the interview took place, along with the fact that it was concluded only a matter of hours after the deceased had been taken to hospital by ambulance. However, the accused's presentation in the second interview was, generally speaking, the same as it had been in the first. 
 
190Detective Taylor, who is the officer in charge of the matter, was not only present at the second interview, he was the principal questioner. As such, he was responsible for putting the vast majority of questions to the accused. This, in my view, rendered him particularly well placed to make observations of the accused's presentation. 

191I accept that Detective Taylor does not have any professional expertise or qualification which enables him to diagnose a psychiatric or psychological condition. However in my view, the accused's presentation in both interviews with police was such as to make it evident that, at the very least, she had difficulty in concentrating upon, and responding to, questions which were put to her. In his capacity of what might be described as the principal questioner in the second of the two interviews, I am satisfied that Detective Taylor was aware of those matters and that it was in those circumstances that he put the necessary steps in place to facilitate an undercover operation.
 
192To the extent that Detective Taylor may have been in any doubt about the accused's mental state, I am satisfied that the fact that she suffered from some impairment would have been apparent to him as the operation progressed, and as she had greater contact with UCO-1. It is inconceivable that as the officer in charge of the case (albeit not the manager of the undercover operation) Detective Taylor would not have been in contact, and discussed aspects of the investigation, with UCO-1 and Detective O'Toole. Although this issue was not the subject of specific cross-examination it would, in my view, be fanciful to suggest that such discussions did not take place, and that they did not include references to the accused's mental state. This is particularly so in circumstances where firstly, aspects of the accused's psychological state had been the subject of discussion between the accused and UCO-1 and secondly, where Detective O'Toole considered it appropriate to obtain advice from a Psychologist as to how to go about forging a relationship with the accused, whom he described as ""different"". 

193I am also satisfied that UCO-1 was aware of the fact that the accused had some form of cognitive difficulty. In particular, I am satisfied that UCO-1 was aware of the fact that the accused was attending Alcoholics Anonymous, that she was under some form of medical treatment, that she had been prescribed some form of medication, and that she was unstable, to the point where she had been having thoughts of suicide. Her knowledge of those matters came directly from her discussions with the accused. I do not accept UCO-1's evidence that she was unaware of the fact that the accused had a problem with alcohol. Such an assertion simply flies in the face of the terms of some of her conversations with the accused.

194Further, and particularly in light of the content of such discussions, I do not accept that UCO-1 did not observe anything about the accused which was suggestive of a psychological impairment. I have already commented upon the accused's presentation when interviewed by police, as depicted on the DVD footage. There is no reason to conclude that the accused's demeanour when she met with UCO-1 was any different to what it was when she was interviewed. Whilst I do not have similar footage of the meetings between the accused and UCO-1, the transcripts of what was said on those occasions by the accused would tend to suggest that her presentation was precisely the same as it had been when interviewed by police. UCO-1, of course, was not only able to observe such presentation. She was able to do so in the context of what the accused was telling her about her personal circumstances. 
 
195In answer to some questions which were put to her in cross examination, UCO-1 explained that her inability to recall aspects of the accused's presentation was due to the fact that she had not reviewed the transcripts of her conversations with the accused prior to giving evidence. Given the importance of the issue to which her evidence related, that failure was, to say the least, unfortunate. The court is entitled to expect that a police officer who is on notice that he or she is required to give evidence will undertake the task of reviewing any necessary material before doing so. This is particularly so when the relevant events occurred some years before. 

196I am satisfied that UCO-1 was in regular contact with Detective O'Toole in the course of the undercover operation. According to UCO-1, she did not raise, with Detective O'Toole, any issues regarding the accused's presentation at any time. It is clear from the evidence of Detective O'Toole, who, as I have said, impressed me as a frank and honest witness, that he became aware (at least in general terms) of the fact that UCO-1 was having difficulties forging a relationship with the accused which might result in admissions being made. On the evidence, the only person who was dealing with the accused directly at the time was UCO-1. As a matter of common sense, the information which caused Detective O'Toole to form the view that the accused was ""different"", and to seek professional assistance in relation to the best way in which to gain her confidence, emanated from UCO-1. For these reasons, I reject UCO-1's evidence that she did not raise, with Detective O'Toole, any issue stemming from the accused's presentation. I am satisfied that whatever the precise level of Detective O'Toole's knowledge of these matters might have been, UCO-1 was the primary source of it, and that it was sufficient to cause him to seek particular professional assistance on how to best advance the operation.
197For all of these reasons, I regard the various aspects of UCO-1's evidence to which I have referred as most unsatisfactory. 

198The evidence of UCO-2 as to his knowledge of the accused's mental state was also unsatisfactory, albeit for a different reason. In short, his evidence in relation to this issue was vague in the extreme. As I have noted, he told the court that he ""would"" have been given information prior to meeting with the accused but could not remember any of the detail. Despite his inability to recall such detail, any suggestion that he would not have been given information as to those aspects of the accused's presentation which had a bearing upon the role that he was to play would be contrary to common sense. However, the evidence does not permit me to make a specific finding as to what he was told. 

199It follows that I am satisfied that the members of the police investigative team were aware, to the extents that I have described, of the accused's psychological condition. I am also satisfied that their knowledge increased over the period of the operation, commensurate with the ongoing contact between the accused and UCO-1. However, and perhaps leaving aside the accused's alcoholism, I am not satisfied that the police were aware of the precise nature of the accused's condition, in the sense of being aware of a diagnosis. However, they were sufficiently aware of the general nature of it to decide that it was necessary to obtain guidance from a Psychologist in an effort to further the operation, and preserve its integrity. 

200It was in such circumstances that a decision was made to implement, and importantly to continue, the undercover operation. There is no evidence that either Detective Taylor, as the officer in charge, or Detective O'Toole, as the manager of the undercover operation, turned their respective minds to the question of whether or not it was appropriate to implement, or continue, the operation in light of the accused's cognitive difficulties as they were aware of them. Given the decision which was made to seek the assistance of a Psychologist, I am satisfied that the principal objective of the police was to continue the operation with a view to achieving its objective, namely to obtain admissions from the accused. I am satisfied that neither Detective Taylor nor Detective O'Toole considered the question of whether the operation should cease in view of the accused's psychological state. 

201In terms of the questioning by UCO-2 at SUPPRESSED, I do not accept that Mr Austin's description of it being in the nature of an ""interrogation"" is necessarily an accurate one. Moreover, the fact that some of the circumstances which prevailed might fall within the provisions of s. 85 of the EA is really not to the point, given that no application was made under that section for the exclusion of the evidence. 

202Perhaps the more significant factor, as the Crown submitted, is that the evidence does not support a finding that any of the officers involved in the investigation consciously made a decision to take advantage of the accused, or to exploit her mental state, with a view to obtaining admissions from her. No such suggestion was even vaguely explored in cross-examination, much less put directly to any of the police who gave evidence. 

203This is a case in which the police simply did not turn their minds to the question of whether an undercover operation should be implemented at all, or the associated question of whether, it having been implemented, it should continue. In my view, whilst the situation might well have been different had they had no knowledge at all of the accused's mental state, the prevailing circumstances imposed, at the very minimum, an obligation upon the police to at least give consideration to the questions I have identified. Whilst I accept that their failures were inadvertent rather deliberate, they nevertheless constituted a breach of the minimum standard which the community is entitled to expect from those engaged in law enforcement. The implementation and continuation of an undercover operation targeting a person who was mentally ill at the time, in the absence of giving any, or any proper, consideration to that person's mental illness, is in my view, not something to be encouraged. 
 
204All of that said however, the evidence does not establish that the police acted in any way unlawfully. I also accept the Crown's submission that the fact that the police may employ methods of deception in an undercover operation does not mean that their actions are improper (see generally Tofilau (supra)). Perhaps even more importantly, there is no evidence that a conscious decision was made to implement or continue the operation with a view to exploiting the accused, or taking advantage of her. 

205Whilst there are, as I have said, aspects of this investigation which are not to be encouraged, I am not satisfied that impropriety has been established in terms of s. 138, in circumstances where the police did not act unlawfully and did not seek to take advantage of the accused's mental illness. In these circumstances I am not required to consider the provisions of s. 138(3). 

206Whilst impropriety has not been established, it is another question entirely as to whether, in the circumstances I have described, the evidence of the accused's admissions should be excluded pursuant to s. 90 on the grounds of unfairness. It is that issue to which I now turn.

Submissions of the parties - exclusion under s. 90
207Mr Austin firstly submitted that there was inherent unfairness in instigating and continuing an undercover operation directed to the accused when the police knew, or ought to have known, that the accused was suffering some form of mental illness. 

208Secondly, he submitted that I would come to the view that the accused's admissions were unreliable. In this regard he relied upon the medical evidence and, in particular, on the evidence of Dr Nielssen (to which I have referred) as to the accused's tendency to confabulate. Mr Austin submitted that in light of that evidence, there was a very real possibility that the accused had no memory of the relevant event at all, and that her admissions to the police were simply an example of her filling the gap to compensate for her lack of memory. 

209Thirdly, Mr Austin relied upon the nature of UCO-2's questioning of the accused at SUPPRESSED. He submitted that some ""real pressure"" was placed on the accused to admit to stabbing the deceased, such pressure emanating from UCO-2's repeated exhortations to the accused to be truthful, in circumstances where she repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. 

210The Crown submitted that for the purposes of s. 90 the question to be determined was whether it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence of the admissions. In this regard the Crown submitted that the fact that there was a covert recording of the conversation with UCO-2 did not establish unfairness, nor did the fact that the operation involved deception. In this latter respect the Crown again relied upon the decision in Tofilau (supra). The Crown also relied upon the decision in Tofilau in answer to Mr Austin's submission that the form of the conversation which had taken place between the accused and UCO-2 was unfair. SUPPRESSED in Tofilau, the High Court reaching the conclusion that the admissions by the accused in that case were nevertheless voluntary. 

211The Crown further submitted that in the context of s.90, no unfairness arises from unreliability if a tribunal of fact is in a position to assess and evaluate the reliability of the admission. In support of that submission the Crown relied upon the decisions in R v Nelson [2004] NSWCCA 231; Riley v R [2011] NSWCCA 238. 

212Finally, the Crown submitted that unlawfulness and impropriety were also relevant considerations in determining whether the evidence ought be excluded under s. 90. He submitted that I would find that there was neither impropriety nor unlawfulness on the part of the police in the present case.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION
213In Em v R (2007) 232 CLR 67 Gleeson CJ and Heydon J (at [56]) observed that the language in s. 90 is so general that it would not be possible, in any particular case, to mark out the full extent of the meaning of the section. Their Honours also observed that the application of the section was likely to be highly fact-specific, such that the result would turn on the facts of the particular case under consideration. They further observed (at [63]) that the onus of establishing unfairness under s. 90 lies upon the accused.

214In the same case Gummow and Hayne JJ (at [107]) noted that whilst the section requires that regard be had to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it is the use of the evidence at the trial which must be characterised as unfair in order to support its exclusion under the section. Their Honours also observed (at [72]) that reliability of evidence is a factor affecting the fairness of its use, although it is not exclusive (see R v Swaffield; R v Pavic (1998) 192 CLR 159 at 197; [78] per Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ). 

215Gummow and Hayne JJ also pointed out in Tofilau (supra) (at 423; [68]) that aside from reliability, other forms of disadvantage may arise in a situation such as the present, but that the chief focus remains upon the fairness of the use of the evidence, as opposed to any purpose of disciplining police or controlling their investigative methods. 

216Just as the fact that deception is employed by law enforcement agencies to detect the commission of a crime does not, of itself, evidence impropriety, it similarly does not, of itself, lead to the conclusion that there will be unfairness in the use of any admission so obtained. In Swaffield (supra) Brennan CJ observed (at 185; [35]) (citations omitted):

""The investigation of crime is not a game governed by a sportsman's code of fair play. Fairness to those suspected of crime is not the giving of a sporting opportunity to escape the consequences of any legitimate and proper investigation or the giving of opportunity to invent plausible falsehoods"".

217As I have noted, the Crown placed particular reliance upon the decision in Tofilau (supra) to support the submission that there was no unfairness in the use of the admissions made by the accused. In that case, undercover police had posed as criminals and had told a murder suspect that in order to join their gang to participate (and profit from) their activities, he was required to tell their boss about his involvement in a murder. He was also told that if he did so, their boss could make his problems ""go away"". The initial denials by the accused were met with insistence on the part of the police upon the need to tell the truth. Ultimately, a confession was made by the accused and an issue arose as to whether it was to be regarded as voluntary. The High Court concluded that the deception which was practiced did not render the statements involuntary. 

218SUPPRESSED. This was, at least in part, the basis upon which the Crown submitted that the admissions in the present case should not be excluded under s. 90.

219SUPPRESSED Tofilau does not, however, inevitably lead to the conclusion that the result must be the same in terms of the admission of the evidence. In Knight v Maclean [2002] NSWCA 14 Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) observed (at [61]) that it was ""tempting but erroneous"" to compare closely the facts of cases decided in the past with the facts of the case calling for decision. His Honour went on to observe:

""In Tidy v Battman [1934] 1 KB 319 at 322, Lord Wright said: 'It is unfortunate that questions which are questions of fact alone should be confused by importing into them as principles of law a course of reasoning which has no doubt properly been applied in deciding other cases on other sets of facts'. In Teubner v Humble (1963) 108 CLR 491 at 503 Windeyer J said: 'Decisions on the facts of one case do not really aid the determination of another case. Observations made in the course of deciding issues of fact ought not to be treated as laying down rules of law' ... "" 

220Whilst his Honour's observations were made in the context of common law proceedings involving allegations of negligence on the part of a driver towards a pedestrian they are, in my view, of universal application. Indeed, they are of particular significance in a case such as this where, as I have observed, the question of exclusion pursuant to s. 90 will be highly fact specific.

221The use of deception in the present case was not, in my view, productive of unfairness. To that extent, the decision in Tofilau provides some support for the Crown's position. However, there is an important circumstance which distinguishes the facts of the present case with those considered in Tofilau, namely that the accused in this case was cognitively impaired at the relevant time. It is that particular circumstance upon which Mr Austin primarily relies as giving rise to the unreliability of the admissions. He relies, in turn, upon that unreliability in support of his submission that the use of the evidence would be unfair.

222As I have previously noted, the Crown submitted that there is no unfairness in the context of s. 90 if the circumstances are such that the tribunal of fact is in a position to assess and evaluate the reliability of the admission which is made. For present purposes, I obviously constitute the tribunal of fact. 

223In Nelson (supra), which was the first of two authorities relied upon by the Crown in this regard, exclusion of an admission had been sought on the basis that at the time that it was made the appellant was (inter alia) drunk and in shock, in circumstances where she had been involved in a serious car accident and had become aware that her child was badly injured. The Court rejected the proposition that the trial judge had erred in not excluding the admission pursuant to s. 90. 

224Grove J (at [19]), having referred to the decision in Swaffield (supra), noted that the concept of unfairness is lacking in precision and necessarily involves an evaluation of all of the relevant circumstances. His Honour concluded that on the facts and circumstances of that case, there was little, if anything, arising out of the appellant's emotional state to suggest that her statement might be unreliable. 

225Sperling J said (at [55]):

""Insofar as the relevant statement was made when (the appellant) was distressed, that was a factor which the jury was well able to assess and evaluate in weighing the exercise of statements made by the appellant shortly after the accident. The appellant's intoxicated state is also relied upon in the appeal as a further reason for it being unfair to the appellant for the evidence to be used against her. That also was a factor which the jury was well able to take into account"".

226The second authority relied upon by the Crown in this regard was Riley (supra). In that case, the appellant asserted that the trial judge had erred in admitting into evidence a document which was described (at [50]) as a ""narrative of the appellant's problems (which was) centred very much on chronic depression throughout his life"". There was evidence that the appellant had suffered from chronic depression from time to time and that on occasions he took prescribed medication which was capable of inducing a ""high"". 

227McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hoeben J and Grove AJ agreed) said (at [155]):
"" ..... there are suggestions in R v Nelson [2002] NSWCCA 231 at [54] - [55] that where the characteristics of the person making the admission may affect the reliability of that admission (for instance, intoxication), exclusion under section 90 may not be justified if the jury would be well able to assess and evaluate such matters in weighing the evidence"". 

228 A number of observations should be made in relation to these authorities.

229Firstly, the nature and extent of appellant's mental state in Nelson, which was described by Sperling J as ""distressed"" and ""intoxicated"", were somewhat removed from the circumstances of the present case. 

230Secondly, as Grove J pointed out in Nelson, the concept of unfairness is imprecise. Consistent with that observation are the more recent observations of Gleeson CJ and Heydon J in Em (supra) (cited at [213] above), namely that (inter alia) the application of the section is likely to be highly fact specific, in circumstances where unfairness is not defined and necessarily covers a wide range of factors. 

231Thirdly, the nature and extent of the appellant's mental state in Riley was a depressive condition which was treated with medication and which resulted in the appellant having what McClellan CJ at CL described as a ""confused state of mind"". The mental state of the accused in the present case, whilst it incorporates a confused state of mind, extends far beyond that.

232Fourthly, I do not read the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Riley (supra) as authority for the proposition that a conclusion that a tribunal of fact is in a position to assess and evaluate the relevant characteristics of the person making the admission must prohibit exclusion under s. 90. His Honour simply concluded that this may be the case. Whether it is will depend upon a consideration and evaluation of all of the relevant circumstances.

233In the present case, although the evidence establishes that the accused had some capacity to comprehend questions put to her, it is clear that such capacity was impaired. It is also clear that her thought processes were disorganised, that her ability to effectively communicate was impaired, and that she had a propensity to become easily confused. In my view, all of these matters necessarily have a resultant effect upon the reliability of any answer she gave to any question put to her. In terms of reliability, they are conditions of substantially greater gravity than conditions of distress, intoxication or depression. 

234Moreover there is evidence, which for the reasons that I have previously outlined (at [183] - [184] above) I accept, that the accused's illnesses were productive of a propensity to confabulate. In other words, she had a propensity to fabricate some imaginary experience so as to compensate for a loss of memory. 

235In Uniform Evidence Law (10th Ed) the author (at [1.3.5820]) cites, by reference to the decision in R v Medcalfe [2002] ACTSC 83, the danger of confabulation as one of the circumstances which might render exclusion under s. 90 appropriate. In Medcalfe Higgins J, in circumstances where the accused had been found unfit to plead and where there was a considerable body of evidence regarding his mental state, formed the view that the accused did not understand a caution which had been given to him by police, and was giving answers he thought would please.

236The decision in Medcalfe (supra) was referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Jarrett [2012] NSWCCA 81, a case in which the court upheld an appeal by the Crown against the decision of a trial judge to exclude confessional material under s. 90 on the basis of evidence that the accused was mentally disordered. Blanch J (with whom Basten JA and Hall J agreed) noted (at [16]) that the facts were significantly different from those considered in Medcalfe before continuing (at [17]):

""In this case there was no evidence of the mental state of the respondent at the time of the admissions. A bare assertion that he was mentally disordered was not sufficient to conclude that it would be unfair to admit the evidence. The doctor was not called to give evidence and it is plain from the hospital notes that the only basis for concluding the respondent was mentally disordered was his concern he might go to gaol as a result of committing the offences and was threatening to commit suicide"".
 
237The evidentiary position in the present case regarding the accused's mental state is obviously substantially different to that considered by the court in Jarrett. 

238In Nelson (supra) Grove J concluded that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that the evidence of the admission would have been excluded had an objection been taken at trial. One of the circumstances which his Honour took into account (at [23]) was that in the context of all of the evidence, there was little, if anything, to suggest that the evidence in question might be unreliable. That could not be said to be the case here. Indeed, there is specific evidence before me which suggests the contrary of the position which was before Grove J. 

239His Honour then proceeded to observe (once again at [23]):

""Unreliability is not synonymous with unfairness, but it is a relevant indicator of whether admission of particular testimony might be unfair"". 
 
240Apart from the accused's mental state, I have had regard to the circumstances in which the accused's admissions were made to UCO-2. They came against a background of the accused consistently denying that she was responsible for the deceased's murder, and were made in the context of UCO-2, in effect, pre-empting her denials and repeatedly interrupting her account to remind her SUPPRESSED if she did not tell the truth. In some circumstances, such methods of investigation may not give rise to any unfairness (SUPPRESSED). However, each case must be determined according to its own facts. In the present case, such method was utilised not only in respect of a person who was cognitively impaired, but who had demonstrated a difficulty in comprehending the basic terms of some of the things she had previously been told (see [85] - [87] above). 

241In my view, the evidence of the accused's mental state and its consequences support the conclusion that her statements to UCO-2, and those to Detective Taylor and Detective Stamboulis, are unreliable. These circumstances, along with those others to which I have referred, lead me to the conclusion that the use of the accused's admissions to UCO-2, Detective Taylor and Detective Stamoulis would be unfair.

242For these reasons, that evidence should be excluded pursuant to s. 90 of the EA.

THE TENDENCY EVIDENCE
The relevant notice 
243The Crown served three tendency notices pursuant to s. 97 of the EA although it is only the third of those notices, namely that dated 15 May 2013, which is relevant for present purposes (its contents encompassing the contents of the first and second). Paragraphs (1) and (2) of that notice are in the following terms:

(1)The person whose ""tendency"" is the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced is Patricia Anne Gallagher. 

(2)The tendency sought to be proved is her tendency to:

(i)have a particular state of mind - that being an explosive or volatile aggressive temperament; and

(ii)to act in a particular way - to lash out in a physically aggressive or violent manner.

244Section 97 of the EA is in the following terms:

97 The tendency rule 

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 


(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if: 


(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party. 


Note: The tendency rule is subject to specific exceptions concerning character of and expert opinion about accused persons (sections 110 and 111). Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions. 

245Section 101 of the EA is in the following terms:

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant. 

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant. 


246The evidence relied upon by the Crown came from a number of witnesses. I will deal with their evidence separately.

The evidence of Veronika Depinski
247In 2009 Ms Depinski was a resident of the same complex as the deceased. She gave evidence (commencing at T 102 L5) of an incident with the accused on the afternoon of 6 September 2008 in which the accused was said to have punched her in the stomach and cut a blind in her premises. It was put to Ms Depinski that neither event had occurred, a proposition she denied.

The evidence of Belinda Wiltshire
248Ms Wiltshire gave evidence that she had met the accused, through another friend named ""John"", in or about mid 2005. There were two aspects of her evidence which were relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence. 

249The first concerned an incident, said to have occurred in or about the winter of 2005. According to the evidence of Ms Wiltshire (commencing at T 115 L 42) she was in the company of the accused on that occasion when the accused became intoxicated and was asked by ""John"" to leave. Ms Wiltshire told the court that she and the accused then engaged in a ""punch on"" after which she was pushed down some stairs. 

250The second aspect of Ms Wiltshire's evidence upon which the Crown relied in this respect (commencing at T120 L1) concerned an assertion by Ms Wilshire that the accused had admitted to making an attempt to strangle the deceased with a belt on an occasion prior to his death. Ms Wilshire also asserted that following the deceased's death, the accused had expressed that she was ""happy"" that the deceased had died.

The evidence of Richard Shane Swan
251Mr Swan gave evidence that he had met the accused in or about 2003. From that time onwards he saw her regularly at a local community centre. The first aspect of Mr Swan's evidence (commencing at T 150 L1) which was relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence concerned an incident at the accused's premises where, according to Mr Swan, the accused had been drinking with the deceased and slapped him (the deceased) in the face. Mr Swan maintained that there were also other occasions on which this occurred.

252The second aspect of Mr Swan's evidence which was relied upon by the Crown (commencing at T 151 L29) concerned a second incident at the accused's home, after the deceased's death. According to Mr Swan the accused had been drinking and a call was received from ""Belinda"" (i.e. Ms Wiltshire), following which Mr Swan went to leave. According to Mr Swan, the accused grabbed him by the shirt collar, but he managed to break free. He fled the premises but was pursued by the accused who, according to Mr Swan, struck him in the head with a house brick.

The evidence of Jennifer Susan Glover
253The evidence of Ms Glover upon which the Crown relied (commencing at T92 L22) was that she was at the accused's premises late one evening when the accused appeared to have been drinking. According to Ms Glover, she attempted to leave the premises when the accused said words to the effect ""you're not leaving"" before placing her hands around Ms Glover's throat and squeezing it. After a short period, Ms Glover managed to open the front door of the premises and flee.


The evidence of Mark Thomas Pride
254The evidence of Mr Pride relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence concerned an incident in January 2009 at the accused's home. According to Mr Pride (commencing at T234 L39) he saw the accused one evening after she had been drinking appearing ""over (him) as he lay on the bed with a knife in her hand .... moving it around and sort of flicking it around in 
her hands and looking vacantly at (him)"". 

The submissions of the parties
255Mr Austin submitted that the evidence of Jennifer Glover and Mark Pride should not be admitted as tendency evidence. Mr Austin raised no issue about the admissibility, as tendency evidence, of that of Mr Swan, Ms Wiltshire and Ms Depinski. For reasons which it is not necessary to detail, the Crown subsequently withdrew the evidence of Jennifer Glover from the tendency notice. Accordingly, the only issue I am left to determine is whether the evidence of Mark Pride should be admitted as tendency evidence. 

256Mr Austin submitted that, having regard to the terms of the relevant notice, the evidence of Mr Pride was not admissible as tendency evidence. His primary submission was that even when taken at its highest, Mr Pride's evidence provided no support for the tendency relied upon by the Crown because it simply did not tend to establish that the accused acted in the particular way which the Crown suggested. He further submitted that some of Mr Pride's answers to questions put in cross-examination rendered his evidence unreliable.

257The Crown pressed the evidence of Mr Pride as being admissible as tendency evidence, submitting that there was sufficient similarity between the incident he described and the circumstances surrounding the deceased's death.


Consideration and conclusion
258No issue is raised by Mr Austin in respect of notice. Accordingly, the first matter I am required to consider is that raised by s. 97(1)(b), namely whether the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced, ""have significant probative value"".

259Evidence that a person has, or had, a particular tendency can be adduced in order render more probable the proposition that, on a particular occasion relevant to the proceedings, the person acted in particular way or had a particular state of mind. Section 97 proceeds on the basis of inferential reasoning that people behave consistently in similar situations (see FB v R [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [23]; R v Chittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; (2008) 198 A Crim R 492.)

260In order for the evidence of Mr Pride to have significant probative value as required by s. 97, it is necessary for the Crown to establish that the evidence possesses a degree of relevance to the events charged, such that it could be said that the evidence is ""important or of consequence"" (see FB v R (supra) at [25]), citing R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702).

261It is important to bear in mind that in determining the probative value of the evidence, there is no need for there to be a striking pattern of similarity between the evidence of the two incidents. In particular, it is not necessary that the incidents which are relied upon as evidence of tendency be closely similar to the circumstances of the alleged offence, or that the tendency be a tendency to act in a way that is closely similar to the act which is alleged against the accused. That said, and generally speaking, the closer and more particular the similarities, the more likely it is that the evidence will have significant probative value in the sense referred to in s. 97 (see BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [108] per Hodgson JA).

262The meaning of the phrase ""significant probative value"" was considered by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459 where his Honour observed:

""...the probative value of evidence is the degree of its relevance to the particular fact in issue. There is no definition of significant probative value as that phrase is used in s.97. In its context as I have outline it however, significant probative value must mean something more than mere relevance but something less than a substantial degree of relevance...One of the primary meanings of the adjective 'significant' or 'important' or 'of consequence'. In my opinion that is the sense in which it is used in s. 97. To some extent, it seems to me the significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence must depend upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is relevant and to the significance (or importance) which that evidence may have in establishing that fact.""
 
263Even if I were to come to the view that the evidence of Mr Pride had significant probative value, I would be required to have regard to the further restrictions imposed by s. 101(2). That section requires that I exclude the evidence unless I come to the view that its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have upon the accused. In that regard, I must apply the precise terminology of the section: (R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 at [90] per Spigelman CJ.)

264The essence of the evidence of Mr Pride was that on the occasion of which he spoke the accused was ""over him"" with a knife in her hand. He described the accused as ""moving"" the knife and ""sort of flicking it around"" at that time. According to Mr Pride, the accused was ""ranting and raving"" at the time and making derogatory comments about the accused, and appeared ""vacant"". 

265According to the notice served by the Crown, the tendency which is sought to be proved is that:

(1)the accused had an ""explosive or volatile and aggressive temperament""; and

(2)that the accused had a tendency to ""lash out in a physically aggressive or violent manner.""

266Leaving aside the inconsistencies between the statement made by Mr Pride and some of his answers in cross-examination, it was not suggested by Mr Pride that the accused had displayed any explosive or volatile aggression on the occasion of which he spoke, nor was it suggested that the accused had ""lashed out"" in a physically aggressive or violent manner. At its highest Mr Pride's evidence was that the accused was ""moving"" the knife around and ""sort of flicking it"" in her hands. Far from asserting any accompanying act or appearance of aggression, Mr Pride described the accused looking ""vacant"" as she did so. 

267In my view, even when this evidence is considered with the other evidence in the case, and particularly when one has regard to the terms of the notice served by the Crown, the probative value of the evidence is far from significant.

268In these circumstances the evidence of Mr Pride should be rejected as tendency evidence.

THE ACCUSED'S ALLEGED ADMISSION TO NORMA BOON
The evidence of the admission
269Norma Boon is an acquaintance of the accused who, at one time, was in a relationship with Norman Fetch. Ms Boon gave evidence that in March 2009, she was with Mr Fetch when he played her a number of messages left on an answering machine in his mother's premises in which he was staying. She recalled that there were three messages one of which was left in a voice that she recognised to be that of the accused. According to Ms Boon the message left by the accused said:

""I stabbed him"".


270Ms Boon made a statement to police on 15 April 2009, only a matter of weeks after the death of the deceased (and similarly only a matter of weeks after allegedly hearing the message). She made no mention of the message in that statement. It was not until April 2013, more than 4 years later, that Ms Boon first disclosed the message to the police. The circumstances in which she did so are not completely clear. She gave evidence that the police attended her premises in April 2013 to inform her of her obligation to attend court to give evidence, and that it was only then that she told police that she had overheard the message said to have been left by the accused. When asked whether there was any reason for omitting any reference to it in her first statement she said:

""Well at the time with (Mr Fetch's mother) being as sick as what she was, almost dying, when we had to move her, and I just totally, with Hilda and Norm at the time, and it just totally slipped my mind when I was making my statement. It wasn't until after I went up with Norm thought back what I heard and cleared my head after I few years relationship with him and that is what I remember hearing."" 

271When cross-examined Ms Boon agreed that at the time of making her first statement in 2009 she had understood that the police were interested in the messages which had been recorded on the answering machine. When asked whether she thought that police would have a particular interest in the message said to have been left by the accused, Ms Boon said (at T129 L36):

""Well, like I said at the time, we had a lot going on with Norm's mum, running back and forwards to the hospital, and I never thought of that.""

272Ms Boon told counsel for the accused that she thought nothing more of the message said to have been left by the accused in the intervening four year period until the police contacted her in April of this year. In this regard, she explained:

""...because when I split up with Norm, I was going through counselling and it, my counselling sessions, it got brought up."" 

273Ms Boon then told the court that in either late 2011 or early 2012 (that is, more than 12 months before she made her second statement to police) the message said to have been left by the accused was raised in the course of psychological counselling she was undertaking at that time. When asked whether, at that time, it had occurred to her that she should inform the police, she said:

""Well, I tried to contact them but Phil was always on leave, or whatever.""
274The reference to ""Phil"" was a reference to Detective Taylor, the officer in charge of the investigation. Ms Boon went on to say (commencing at T130 L32) she did not leave a message for Detective Taylor but ""kept ringing back...two or three times"".

The submissions of the parties
275Mr Austin's primary submission was that the evidence of Ms Boon ought be excluded pursuant to s. 90 on the basis that it was unreliable and that, as a result, there would be unfairness if it were used against the accused. Mr Austin submitted that such unreliability stemmed primarily from the circumstances in which the evidence was disclosed. He also relied on the fact that Norman Fetch provided no corroboration for Ms Boon's assertions. 

276In the course of his submissions, but still within the context of s. 90, Mr Austin submitted that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of its unfair prejudice. When that submission was made, I made the observation that the terms in which it had been couched appeared to lend themselves more to a submission that the evidence should be excluded pursuant to the provisions of s. 137 of the EA. 

277At that point, the Crown indicated that he did not wish to be heard on the exclusion of the evidence. He expressly conceded that the evidence of Ms Boon had, as he described it, ""many difficulties"". 

Consideration and conclusion
278In my view, the evidence of Ms Boon as to the accused's alleged admission should, consistent with the Crown's proper concession be excluded. Ms Boon's explanations for the circumstances in which the evidence emerged some four years after the event were entirely unconvincing. The evidence is unreliable in the circumstances and its use would be unfair to the accused.

THE REMAINING EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ACCUSED 
279Having dealt with those evidentiary issues, I now turn to the fundamental question of whether the entirety of the evidence is sufficient to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused was responsible for the deceased's murder. 
 
The accused's lies
280As I have previously indicated, part of the evidence relied upon by the Crown are two statements made by the accused which, it submits, are lies which constitute evidence of the accused's consciousness of guilt. It is appropriate that I deal with this issue before summarising the balance of the evidence. In doing so, it should be noted that there is evidence of other statements having been made by the accused in terms which are similar to those relied upon by the Crown as lies. However, the Crown made it clear that the only two statements relied upon in this regard are those set out below.

The first lie
281The first of the accused's statements which is said to be a lie was made to Peter Dilonardo (""Dilonardo"") an ambulance officer who attended the scene of the deceased's stabbing and who gave evidence of having had the following conversation with the accused:

""I said to Pat, 'Who's done it? Who's stabbed him?

Pat said, 'I don't know. He's tried to kill himself before. He's got mental health issues' "".

282It is the italicised portion of this passage which is said to amount to the lie. 

The second lie
283The second statement made by the accused which is said to constitute a lie was made in a conversation with Detective Chapman in the early hours of 12 February 2009, again at the deceased's premises. Detective Chapman's evidence was that the conversation included the following:

""I said, Has Billy tried to harm himself before?""

Patricia Gallagher said, ""Yeah, he was in Bankstown Hospital again. He doesn't want to lose me. He's stabbed himself and overdosed before.""

284Again, it is the italicised portion of this passage of conversation which is said to constitute the lie

The evidence relied upon by the Crown to establish the lies
285The evidence relied upon the Crown to establish that the statements were in fact lies is comprised of: 

(i)the dying declarations of the deceased;

(ii)evidence of the deceased's treating general practitioner;

(iii)evidence of the deceased's sister and brother-in-law;

(iv)evidence of relevant hospital and other records.
 


The dying declarations of the deceased
286Dilonardo gave evidence that he had the following conversation with the deceased during the trip from his home to Liverpool Hospital:

""Dilonardo: What happened?""
Deceased: I don't know.

Dilonardo: Did you do this to yourself?
Deceased: Don't be a bloody idiot. I've survived cancer, why would I try and kill myself?.""

287In addition, Senior Constable Hickey, who attended the deceased's premises at or about the same time as Dilonardo, gave evidence that after Dilonardo had informed him (presumably on the basis of information provided by the accused) that the deceased had a history of self harm, the deceased began to become ""slightly aggressive in his tone of voice"" before saying: 

""You think I did this to myself? I wouldn't, I have never done anything to myself"".

The evidence of the accused's treating medical practitioner
288A statement of Dr Odysseas Missiakos, a general practitioner who treated the deceased on 5 occasions between 29 October 2008 and 10 February 2009, was tendered in evidence. In paragraph 6 of his statement Dr Missiakos, having outlined his awareness of the deceased's medical history (which included the fact that at the end of 2008 renal scans had evidenced a renal cell carcinoma), said:

""Mr Grant was aware that diagnosis meant he had an incurable illness. I am not aware of any significant psychiatric history for this patient. There was no previous evidence of self-harm or attempted suicide.""

289In the same paragraph he also stated:

""I can recall that Mr Grant stated on 10/02/2009 that if the cancer was found to have spread, he could not live with this idea.""

The evidence of the deceased's sister and brother-in-law
290The Crown also relied on the evidence given by Margaret Turner and Thomas Turner, the deceased's sister and brother-in-law respectively, to establish the accused's lies. Both gave evidence that they had visited the deceased in December 2008, two months before his death. Mrs Turner told the Court that although the deceased was undergoing Chemotherapy at the time he was ""quite happy"" and that he had told her that ""things were positive"". Mr Turner told the Court that the deceased was in ""good spirits"" at the time and that everything ""looked on the up and up"".
Hospital and other records
291Finally, the Crown relied on the evidence of Detective Taylor who searched the records of Bankstown and Liverpool Hospitals, along with the internal records of the ""COPS"" system. Detective Taylor's evidence established that, having had access to medical records produced by the Liverpool and Bankstown Hospitals, there was no entry in respect of the deceased having been admitted for any purpose related to self-harm or suicide. 

292His evidence further established that the COPS reports in relation to the deceased revealed no information which suggested any report having been made by or on behalf of the deceased in relation to self harm.

The submissions of the parties 
293The Crown submitted that the statements made by the accused constituted lies which were evidence of consciousness of guilt. The Crown accepted that in order for me to accept this submission, it would be necessary for me to conclude that the statements of the accused were in fact lies (that is, that they were untrue to the knowledge of the accused) and that they were deliberate. The Crown also accepted that the evidence of the accused's mental state would have some bearing upon those issues. However, the Crown relied on the fact that there was no evidence which established that the accused's mental state affected her capacity to tell the truth, nor was there any evidence which established that she was delusional. 

294The Crown further submitted that I should conclude that in asserting that the deceased had a history of self harm, the accused had made a conscious decision to try and divert attention from herself as the person responsible for the deceased's murder, and thus implicate the deceased as the person who inflicted the wound that ultimately caused his death. He submitted that the time at which the statements were made, namely shortly after the arrival of police and ambulance officers, was significant in this respect.

295Mr Austin firstly submitted that the statements of the accused did not amount to lies at all. Alternatively, he submitted that even if they did, they were not capable of constituting evidence of consciousness of guilt because I would not be satisfied that they were deliberate. In this regard Mr Austin again relied on the medical evidence of the accused's cognitive impairment. He submitted, in particular, that her mental state might well have been such that she believed that certain incidents of self harm had occurred, when in fact they had not. 

Consideration and conclusion
296In Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 (at [210] - [211] per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ), and subsequently in Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234 at [244] (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) the question of how evidence of lies may be used was discussed. The principles established in those two cases were summarised by Whealy J (as his Honour then was) in R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 672 at [24] (citations omitted):

""The statements of principle in Edwards v R, as clarified in Zoneff v R, may be summarised as follows: 
(1) a lie can constitute an admission against interest only if it is concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence (i.e. it relates to a material issue); (2) the lie must be precisely identified, as should the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest; (3) the jury must be satisfied that the lie was a deliberate lie; (4) the lie may be taken into account only if the jury is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence, or some aspect of it, and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the commission of the offence; (5) it is necessary for the jury to be reminded that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt."" 

297His Honour observed that these ""beguilingly simple statements of principle, were often much more complicated in their application"" before continuing at [27]:
""...the weight of authority and academic opinion favours a very cautious approach to the issue as to whether lies evidencing consciousness of guilt should be left for a jury in a criminal trial. (R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697 at 701 per Street CJ; R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 at 236 per Gleeson CJ; R v Ray [2003] 57 NSWLR 616 at 632 per Wood CJ at CL; Zoneff v R (supra) at 244"".

298His Honour then said (at [29]):

""...the duty of a trial Judge in circumstances such as the present is to enquire, as a preliminary, whether the statements made by the accused in the witness box or prior to trial are capable of being fairly regarded as lies. It would also be necessary for the trial Judge, as a preliminary, to enquire whether it is open to the jury to draw an inference that the lie, if it be a lie, resulted from fear of the truth, in the sense that that expression is mentioned in the authorities.""

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION
299In order to for this evidence to be used in the manner urged by the Crown I must firstly be satisfied that either or both of the statements of the accused, namely ""He's tried to kill himself before"" and ""He's stabbed himself before"" are, in fact, lies within the meaning of that term as it is used in the authorities. In order to be so satisfied, I must be satisfied firstly that what the accused said on either or both occasions was untrue, and secondly that what was said was untrue to the accused's knowledge. 

300The deceased's denials that he had harmed himself on this particular occasion are directly relevant to the question of the existence of an alternative hypothesis which might explain his death, an issue which I have considered further below. However, they have less of a bearing on the question of whether he had attempted self harm at any time prior to this occasion. In other words, the acceptance of the deceased's denials that he had harmed himself on this occasion does not mean that he had not done so, or attempted to do so, in the past. 

301Similarly, whilst the evidence of Mr and Mrs Turner, as well as that of Dr Missiakos, establishes that the accused's frame of mind was generally positive in the two months prior to his death, it does not, in my view, establish that there had been no attempt at self harm prior to that time. Significantly, the evidence of Mr and Mrs Turner was essentially restricted to the deceased's frame of mind when they saw him in December 2008. Neither Mr Turner nor Mrs Turner were asked any question at all concerning their respective knowledge of any attempts by the deceased to harm himself at any time prior to that. Similarly, the fact that Hospital and other records are bereft of any reference to the deceased having previously harmed himself is far from conclusive.

302However, amongst the statements made by the deceased to Senior Constable Hickey was his statement that he had ""never done anything to (himself)"". Based upon that evidence, I am satisfied that the accused's statements to the contrary were untrue. 

303However, in order to conclude that the accused's statements were lies in the sense discussed in the authorities to which I have referred, I must also be satisfied that those statements were untrue to the knowledge of the accused when they were made. In this regard, there is force in Mr Austin's submission that the accused's mental state was such that she may have believed that previous incidents of self harm had occurred when in fact they had not. Although there is not, as the Crown pointed out, evidence that the accused suffered from some delusional state, there is, as I have noted, evidence (inter alia) that her thought processes were confused and that she had a tendency to confabulate. 

304For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the statements, although untrue, were untrue to the knowledge of the accused. I am therefore not satisfied that they are properly regarded as lies. 
 
305Even if I was satisfied that the statements were lies, before using the evidence in the manner urged by the Crown I would also have to be satisfied that the lies were deliberate, in the sense of being told by the accused out of some fear that the truth would implicate her. Other than the fact that the statements were made at or about the time of the arrival of the police and ambulance officers, the Crown did not point to any other evidence which was said to support the conclusion that the accused had made a conscious decision to lie for the purposes of distancing herself from the responsibility for the deceased's stabbing. 

306Finally, and even had I reached the point of concluding that the accused had told a deliberate lie or lies, before using that evidence in the manner urged by the Crown I would be required to remind myself that people do not always act rationally, and that the telling of a lie may be explained on another basis. Had I reached that point, the evidence of the accused's mental state would, once again, have been relevant.

307In these circumstances, the evidence of lies told by the accused does not constitute evidence of consciousness of her guilt. 

308It was not clear to me whether the Crown, in the alternative, argued that the statements made by the accused were nevertheless relevant to her credit. However as I have outlined, although I am satisfied that the statements were untrue, I am not satisfied that they were untrue to the knowledge of the accused. Accordingly, they are not lies and are thus not capable of being used as evidence bearing upon the accused's credit. 

THE REMAINING EVIDENCE OF THE EVENTS OF 11 AND 12 FEBRUARY 2009 
309In light of the conclusions I have reached in relation to the evidentiary issues I was asked to determine, I now turn to the remaining evidence relied upon by the Crown.

310Jones gave evidence that at about 11.00am on 11 February 2009 he assisted the deceased in moving a refrigerator from his premises. He told the court that the accused was present when that was being done. When asked whether the accused said anything to the deceased in his (Jones') presence, Jones answered:

""They were having muttering their differences, and that, after the fridge was released, and was walking and she turned around and said to Bill, ""I'll kill you if you get back on the wine."" I remember that very definitely. Those sorts of things stay with you.""

311Another resident of the unit block, Jean Thompson (""Thompson"") also observed that the accused was present when Jones and the deceased were moving the refrigerator, although she gave no evidence of hearing anything said between the deceased and the accused at that time. 

312In the course of cross-examination, Jones was asked whether or not he had ever heard arguments between the deceased and the accused. He said (commencing at T72 L13):

"" Yeah, I have and it was, sort of, like she was arguing with him. She would be out the front of his place, that was the time of the argument. She would shout at him, you know. 

Q. When you say ""she"", are you referring to Pat? 
A. Yes. 

Q. How often did you hear 
A. About two or three 

Q. On two or three occasions? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Is that prior to the events of 11 February? 
A. Prior, yeah. 

Q. Did you hear Pat say or scream anything on those occasion? 
A. I heard her threatening him, and things like that. 

Q. What did you mean by threatening? 
A. I'll kill you if do you this; I'll kill you if do you that."" You just take with a grain of salt, like a domestic argument, type of thing.""

313Baston told the court that he saw the accused at about 4:00pm on the afternoon of 11 February 2009 when she attended his premises and asked if she could leave some shopping bags there. He gave evidence that the accused had stayed at his place on that occasion ""about 5 minutes"" after which she went back to the deceased's premises. According to Baston, the accused was in the habit of referring to the deceased as her brother. 

314A call was made to 000 from the deceased's premises at 7.21pm, in response to which police attended the deceased's premises at about 8.50pm. Constable Cross gave evidence that she had been informed by police radio that the ""victim"" (i.e. the accused) had reported that she had been indecently assaulted by a man named ""Jack"" (i.e. Jones). Upon arrival, Constable Cross spoke with the accused, who introduced the deceased as her brother. According to Constable Cross, the premises were untidy at the time.

315According to Constable Cross, the accused admitted that she had been drinking during the day. In Constable Cross' assessment, the accused was ""well affected"" by alcohol. She also observed that the accused's demeanour:

"" ..... fluctuated between levels of calmness, aggression and disbelief as she attempted to convey to us what had occurred that afternoon. Gallagher was very confusing and hard to understand as she continued to ramble about previous incidents which had occurred the day before, week before, and with other incidents which had no bearing on what police had attended the location to investigate"". 

316Constable Cross managed to ascertain that the accused alleged that Jones had grabbed her breasts earlier in the evening. However, the accused then informed Constable Cross that she did not wish the matter to be further investigated. 

317Constable Cross gave evidence that she informed the accused that if she wished to take the matter further, she would be required to provide a statement to the police whilst sober. She then stated:

""Gallagher then became defensive and started to pace between Constable Scipione and I whilst rambling about previous incidents which had upset her where other police officers had attended and spoke to her in the past. 

I then saw (the deceased) turn his chair. (He) said, ""Calm down, Pat. They're doing a job. Just listen."" 


318Constable Cross described the deceased as being ""tolerant and understanding"" when he said those words. 

319Constable Cross subsequently spoke to Jones who denied the allegations. Constable Cross then left the unit block at some time after 9.30 pm, having spoken with Jones.

320There is evidence that calls were made from the landline of the deceased's premises to the telephone service of Hilda Fetch (the mother of Norman Fetch) at the following times on the evening of 11 February and the morning of 12 February:

20.02.32 - duration 40 s.
22.47.00 - duration 46 s.
22.52.40 - duration 18 s.
22.53.26 - duration 201 s.
00.27.49 - duration 25 s.

321There is also evidence that calls were made from the mobile telephone of Norman Fetch to the landline at the accused's premises at the following times on 11 February:

12.19.16 - duration 35 s.
15.08.25 - duration 0 s.
18.26.25 - duration 25 s.
21.14.01 - duration 4 s.
21.14.36 - duration 4 s.
21.20.17 - duration 0 s.
21.20.48 - duration 5 s.
22.34.29 - duration 2 s.
22.49.09 - duration 4 s.
22.38.37 - duration 23 s.
23.18.55 - duration 0 s.
23.32.04 - duration 13 s.

322Further, there is evidence that calls were made from the accused's landline to Norman Fetch's mobile telephone at the following time on 11 February:

15.19.23 - duration 402 s.

323There is also evidence that a call was made from the deceased's landline to Norman Fetch's mobile telephone at the following time:

16.11.43 - duration 40 s.

324Finally, there is evidence that a call was made from the deceased's landline to the accused's landline at 00.10.00 on the morning of 12 February 2009. The duration of that call was 54 seconds.

325Norman Fetch gave evidence that he had known both the accused and the deceased for a period of approximately 40 years and he had been in a relationship with the accused for a short period approximately 12 months prior to the death of the deceased. Mr Fetch accepted that during February 2009 his mother was in hospital and that he was residing at her premises. Mr Fetch was taken to each of the calls set out in [320] to [323] above but could recall nothing about any of them. He explained that he had been an alcoholic for a number of years and that this had an effect upon his memory. 

326There is also evidence that calls were made from the deceased's landline to Channel 7 at 23.22.55 and 23.26.19 on 11 February. There is evidence of a further call to a ""Bushfire Appeal Hotline"" at 23.30.49 on the same night. In the course of her second interview with police, the accused stated that she had made each of those calls.

327Baston gave evidence that the accused returned to his premises at about 12:30am on 12 February 2009 and collected her shopping bags before leaving. However, the 000 call to emergency services reporting the deceased's injury (which was clearly made by the accused) was logged at 00.28.39. The Crown accepted that in these circumstances it was unlikely that Baston's evidence as to the time at which the accused attended his premises was accurate.

328Baston's evidence in relation to that issue was given by reference to various television shows that he said he was watching at the time. The last of those television shows, entitled ""Life"", commenced at 11:50pm. It was Baston's evidence that the accused did not attend his premises when he was watching this particular program. It follows, that whatever time the accused attended his premises and collected her shopping bags it must have been at some time before 11:50pm on 11 February 2009. 

329Veronika Depinski, upon whose evidence the Crown relied in support of the tendency notice, also gave evidence that when watching a television program which commenced at 7.30 pm on 11 February 2009, she heard the accused ""screaming on (the deceased)"" and that this continued until about 9.00 pm. She was then woken up by the accused screaming ""Come fast .... He can die like this"". She then heard the accused recite the deceased's address and telephone number.

330Jean Thompson, another resident of the unit block, gave evidence that whilst watching television at some time after 8.30 she heard a noise and voices outside her premises. She then heard a conversation at about 10.30 pm between two people which she described as ""commotion"" and ""raised voices"". Although she gave evidence that she thought that one of the people was a female, she had previously told police that she could not distinguish. She said in her evidence that she thought that one of the voices she had heard was that of Baston. 

331As previously noted the accused called 000 from the deceased's premises at 00.28.39. Both a recording of that call and an accompanying transcript were tendered in evidence. The accused sounded obviously distraught. She told the operator that she was at her ""brother's"" and that he was bleeding from the stomach. She was advised to treat the bleeding with a towel, and that an ambulance was on its way. 

332Dilonardo, accompanied by another officer, Anthony Painter, arrived at the deceased's premises at 12.43 am on 12 February. Upon arrival, Dilonardo was told by the accused:

""He's in the bathroom, he's bleeding"". 

333When Dilonardo asked the accused what happened she replied:

""I don't know"".

334Contrary to the earlier observations of Constable Cross, Dilonardo said that the premises appeared to be clean and tidy. Dilonardo noted that the accused had no blood on her skin or clothes. He found the deceased sitting on the floor of the bathroom, conscious, and with his eyes open. When he asked the deceased (on two separate occasions) what had happened the deceased replied each time: 

""I don't know"".
335On the second occasion on which he asked the deceased what had happened, Dilonardo described the deceased as becoming ""narky"". 

336Dilonardo then gave the following evidence:

I said to Pat, ""He's been stabbed"". 

Pat said, ""He's been stabbed...no"". 

Pat started to become upset and had tears in her eyes. 
...

The conversation I had with Grant and Pat went back and forth. I continually asked ""What happened?"" ""Who's done this to you?"" 

Grant said ""I was in the bedroom, I noticed I was bleeding so I got up and went to the bathroom."" 

I said to Pat, ""Who's done it? Who's stabbed him?""

Pat said, ""I don't know, he's tried to kill himself before. He's got mental health issues. We've had problems with the neighbour upstairs, he's threatened him before. The police were here not long ago.""

I said, ""Was he alright when the police left?"" 

Pat said, ""yes."" 

I said to both Grant and Pat: Who's done it, how could you not know you've been stabbed?"" 

Grant kept saying ""I don't know, I don't know.""

I said: ""Where have you been today?"" 

Pat said: ""I've been here all day"", 

I said: ""If you've been here all day how could you not know what's happened."" 

Pat said: ""I went out for a couple of hours. I've only been back a couple of hours"". 
I said: ""Was he alright when you got back?"" 

Pat said: ""I don't know."" 

Pat started to get agitated and panicky. 

I said: ""What time did you get back? Was it still daylight or was it dark?"" 

Pat said: ""I don't know"". 

At some stage Pat said, ""He's been drinking all day"".
...

[16] I walked back into the bathroom. I said: ""What 's happened"". 

Grant said: ""I don't know"". Grant was closing his eyes but when he would speak to me he would open his eyes.

[17] As we were wheeling him out I said: ""What happened?"" 

Pat said: ""We're having problems with the guy upstairs. I don't know what happened"".


337On the way to Liverpool Hospital, Dilonardo again asked the deceased what had happened and the deceased again replied that he did not know. It was at this time that the deceased denied harming himself in the terms I have previously described. He also admitted to Dilonardo that he had been drinking.

338Upon arrival at Liverpool Hospital Dilonardo overheard the admitting doctor ask the deceased what happened. The deceased again replied that he did not know.

339At about 12.55am on 12 February 2009 Constables Cullerton and Hickey responded to a request to attend the deceased's premises. Upon arrival they heard the accused yelling ""He's going through Chemotherapy, they won't listen, tell them"". Constable Cullerton described the accused as being ""very agitated and suffering the effects of intoxicating liquor"". She asked the accused what had happened but could not understand her response. 

340Constable Hickey gave evidence that she had been informed by an ambulance officer that the deceased had a history of self harm. She then had a conversation with the deceased in which the deceased denied harming himself on this occasion. The full text of that part of the conversation was said by Constable Hickey to have been as follows:

""Grant then began (sic) slightly aggressive in his tone of voice and said ""You think I did this to myself, I wouldn't, I have never done anything to myself."" 

I said: ""What happened"". 

He said: ""I don't know, I was on my bed and next thing I know I am in the bathroom and I'm stabbed"". 

I said: ""Who stabbed you?"" 

He said: ""I don't know"". 

I said, ""Did you stab yourself?""

He said: ""No, I told you, I wouldn't do that."" 

I said: ""The police were here earlier tonight, what did you do after they left?"" 

He said: ""I had a few beers and I went to bed and then next thing I wake up and I have been stabbed."" 

I said: ""Where is the knife?"" 

He said: ""I don't know.""

341Constable Hickey searched the deceased's premises. She found no sign of blood and no implement which might have been used to harm the deceased. She then had a conversation with the accused in the following terms:

""I said: ""what happened"". 

She said: ""I came in and I could hear him making a noise"". Gallagher then demonstrated a whining and groaning noise. 

She said: ""I went in and found him stabbed so I rang triple 0, they told me to get a towel so I did and I put it on him."" 

I said: ""How he got (sic) into the bathroom?"" 

She said: ""I don't know, he got up I put towel on him."" 

I said: ""Did he walk into the bathroom, how did he get in there?"" 

She said: ""No, he crawled in there."" 

I said: ""What happened before he got stabbed? Where were you?"" 

She said: ""I went to see Pommy Dad"". 

I said: ""How long were you gone for?"" 

She said: ""About half and (sic) hour.""

342Constable Hickey, in the company of other police, then attended at Jones' premises. Those premises were searched but nothing of interest was found.

343At 3:05am Detective Chapman arrived at the deceased's premises. He observed the front wooden door of the premises to be open, but the front screen security doors closed. There did not appear to be any damage to the screen door lock, or to any external window or door at the front of the premises.

344In the presence of Constable Macarthur, Detective Chapman had a conversation with the accused which was set out in his statement in the following terms: 

""I said: ""Patricia, my name is Detective Chapman and this is Detective Macarthur from Bankstown Police. Can you tell me what happened here tonight?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""Billy's been stabbed. I don't know, he doesn't need a priest. 
I said: ""How was he stabbed?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""that what we're trying to find out"". 

I said: were you there when he was stabbed?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""No, I've told you where I've been. Pommy Dad's up there. I know whose in on it, Jack, unit 9. Me and Billy told him off, we've had a few arguments with Jack, not between me and Billy.""

I said: ""What happened when you found Billy?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""he was singing out Mum, Mum, Mum, Mummy. I rang triple 0."" 

I said: ""Where were you before this?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""I've been two places, Pommy Dad and UCO-2. Came from Pommy Dad's and also I visited Betty to give her some hot cross buns."" 

I said: ""Was the door open when you came back?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""I always leave it open. It was ajar."" 

I said: ""I understand police came here earlier in the night and spoke to you and Billy. What happened after the police left? 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""Everything was alright, me and Billy were half nude. He's said I'm going to die, he's got diarrhoea at the moment."" 

I said: ""Did you see Billy go anywhere last night."" 
Patricia Gallagher said: ""Billy didn't leave the house."" 

I said: ""What were you and Billy doing last night?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""Me and Billy were watching TV."" 

I said: ""What happened when you found Billy."" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""There was blood on his singlet. I rang triple 0, lots of blood in the bedroom. I said help quick, Billy's bleeding.""

I said: ""Has Billy tried to harm himself before?"" 

Patricia Gallagher said: ""Yeah, he was in Bankstown Hospital again. He doesn't want to lose me. He's stabbed himself and overdosed before."" 

I said: ""Did you stab Billy?"" 


Patricia Gallagher said: ""Why would I want to stab him for? Me and Billy blue all the time but we always make up""
 


345At about 6:20pm on 12 February police met with Mr and Mrs Turner, who advised that a message had been left on their home answering machine by the accused. There is evidence that a call was made from the deceased's landline to the number of Mr and Mrs Turner at 00:39:32 on 12 February 2009. The message left on the machine was in the following terms: 

""Margaret and Tom, its me, Patty, listen Billy's bleeding and suffering through diarrhoea. The ambulance is on its way, Bankstown, ok, listen, ohhhhh, can you please resp...please gimme a call on this number...he's just...Mum or something just, Mum, Mum, I don't know, just get in contact...straight away please.""


346There is also a body of scientific evidence relied upon by the Crown which can be summarised as follows. 

347Dr William Allender, a Forensic Scientist, recorded that a blood sample taken from the deceased prior to his death was found to have present (inter alia) alcohol of 0.230 grams per 100ml of blood. A post-mortem sample was found to contain 0.143 grams per 100ml of blood. Dr Allender stated:

""At a blood alcohol concentration of 0.230g in 100ml or above, all people would be under the influence of alcohol to the extent that there would be substantial impairment of their faculties. These include cognitive, motor and visual functions such as reaction skills, motor co-ordination, perception, judgment and decision-making skills, which I would expect to all be substantially impaired at this blood alcohol concentration or above...Based on my specialised knowledge, and relying on the information supplied, I am of the opinion that at the time of the incident, given the level of alcohol in (the deceased's) blood, his ability to repel any possible attack with a knife (or similarly sharp object) would have been compromised"".

348The Crown also tendered a statement of Detective Taylor which summarised the results of a fingerprint examination undertaken of various areas of the deceased's premises. No fingerprints of the accused were found at any of the areas of the deceased's premises which were subject to fingerprint examination. 

349The Crown also tendered a statement of Senior Constable Lee, a member of the Forensic Services Group, who attended the deceased's premises at about 7:30am on 12 February 2009. At paragraph 21 of his statement, Senior Constable Lee stated:

""A brown and beige coloured plastic knife block with a ""Wiltshire"" brand black handled carving knife and a black handled fork was located at the eastern end of the southern bench (marker J). There was a dark coloured staining to the base of the blade, adjacent to the handle, of the black handled carving knife. I later collected the black handled knife, and the knife block with black handled fork from Marker J"".

350Marker J, knife, and the knife block, referred to by Constable Lee, were depicted in photographs 40 and 41 of a group of photographs tendered by the Crown. Constable Lee marked the knife item 10 and the knife block item 11. The Crown tendered a further statement of Detective Griffin in which he recorded the results of an examination of the knife which had been conducted on 26 November 2010. Detective Griffin stated that material which was red/brown in colour was scraped from ""beneath"" the handle of the knife. The precise point beneath the handle from which the sample was taken was not further specified. A presumptive test for the presence of blood returned a positive result, indicating that blood may be present. There is no evidence of the age of the substance from which the sample was taken.

351In cross-examination, Detective Griffin agreed that it was ""almost certain"" that the presumptive test which had been carried out was what was known as a ""Hemastix test"". He agreed that such a test was incapable of differentiating between human blood and animal blood. He also agreed that the positive result which is returned following the application of a presumptive test can be consistent with the presence of substances other than blood, including rust and potato starch. 

352Constable Lee also found evidence of a bloodstain on the floor of the kitchen of the deceased's premises at which he placed another marker, ""I"". A swab was taken from that bloodstain which returned a positive result when screened for blood. Rebecca Williams produced a report dated 25 January 2011 which was tendered by the Crown, in which she expressed the opinion that DNA recovered from that sample could be that of the deceased. In a supplementary report dated 20 June 2013 she expressed the opinion that the DNA profile recovered from the swab of the stain at marker I was expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion individuals in the general population. There is no evidence as to the age of the bloodstain on the kitchen floor.

353Dr Matthew Orde, a Forensic Pathologist, provided two reports which were tendered by the Crown. In the second of those reports Dr Orde stated (inter alia) the following:
""[7] In light of both the initial autopsy findings and the information provided by Dr Theivendran, it appears that the deceased sustained a single stab wound to the epigastric region (upper front part) of his abdomen, with associated injury to his liver, duodenum and inferior vena cava. 

[8] Whilst the internal injuries would undoubtedly have bled profusely, there appears to be no significant arterial injury which would have resulted in haemorrhage under pressure.

[9] In my opinion it is entirely possible that the great majority of the haemorrhage stemming from these internal injuries could have been retained within the abdominal cavity. Given the position of the stab wound through the abdominal wall, if the deceased had been positioned lying on his back, then this would seem more likely. There would of course have been at least some bleeding from the skin wound, though it is possible that this may have been relatively minor, and may well have also partly have been absorbed into the fabric of clothing which the deceased had been wearing.

[10] Conversely, it is of course also possible that there may have been significant external loss of blood from the stab wound to his abdomen, and any such bleeding is likely to have been enhanced by movement of the deceased away from a supine recumbent position"".

354In an addendum to his reports dated 18 June 2013, Dr Orde stated that in his opinion the nature and location of the stab wound sustained by the deceased did not preclude a conclusion that the wound was self inflicted.

355Finally, and as I have previously indicated, the Crown tendered the recordings, and accompanying transcripts, of the accused's two interviews with police. Neither party addressed me to any real degree upon the contents of those interviews, although the Crown did place some reliance upon the accused's admissions that she was responsible for making the calls from the deceased's landline at 23.22.55 and 23.30.49 (to Channel 7) and at 23.30.49 (to the Bushfire Appeal Hotline).

The elements of the offence of murder
356In order to establish that the accused murdered the deceased, the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt:
(i)that the deceased died on the morning of 12 February 2009;

(ii)that the accused did an act, namely the act of stabbing, which caused the death of the deceased; and


(iii)that the act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased was done by the accused either;

(a)with the intention to kill the deceased; or

(b)with the intention to inflict really serious bodily injury upon the deceased.

357There is no issue that the deceased died on the morning of 12 February 2009 as the result of a single stab wound to the abdomen which severed his thoracic aorta. The real issue in the present case is whether the evidence is sufficient to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was the act of the accused which caused the deceased's death. If I am not so satisfied, I must find the accused not guilty of the deceased's murder. If, on the other hand, I am satisfied that it was the accused who stabbed the deceased, I must then proceed to consider a number of alternative issues including the question of the deceased's intention and, depending on the resolution of that issue, whether or not the deceased should be found guilty of the alternative count of manslaughter. Further, and depending on what view is reached in relation to some or all of those issues, I am required to give consideration to the issue of whether or not the accused was substantially impaired at the time.



The submissions of the parties
358Both the Crown and counsel for the accused structured their submissions around the principle question that I have identified. 

359The Crown emphasised that in case dependent on circumstantial evidence, it was necessary for me to consider the entirety of the evidence, and not approach my evaluation of it in a piecemeal way by reference to individual aspects of it. The Crown's submissions touched upon a number of aspects of the evidence of events which took place on 11 and 12 February. Whilst those submissions were not structured in a chronological sequence, the position advanced by the Crown may be better understood if I summarise the submissions in that way.

360In terms of the evidence of Jones the Crown referred, in particular, to his evidence that he had observed the accused and the deceased, ""muttering their differences"" during the early afternoon of 11 February. In particular, the Crown relied on Jones' evidence that he had heard the accused say to the deceased ""I'll kill you if you get back on the wine"". Even allowing for the evidence of Jones that in his observation, statements and behaviour of that nature were perhaps not atypical of the relationship between the accused and the deceased, the Crown submitted that such evidence served to paint something of a background picture, against which the evidence of the subsequent events of the day ought be assessed. 

361The Crown also submitted that the evidence of Jones established the accused's state of mind at that time. The Crown argued that this evidence was generally consistent with the tendency evidence to which I previously referred. The Crown submitted that such evidence established that the accused was, generally speaking, a person prone to violence. 

362The Crown also relied upon the evidence of the telephone calls to which I have previously referred. The Crown submitted that the evidence established that the accused was present at the deceased's premises at 9.21.16 on the evening of 11 February 2009, when a call was made to 000 for the purposes of the accused complaining about Jones. It was submitted that having regard to the statements made by the accused in the second of her interviews, and having regard to the nature of the complaint which was made at the time, I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who made that telephone call and that I would thus be satisfied that she was at the deceased's premises at that time. The deceased was obviously alive at that time.

363The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied on the evidence that when the police arrived at the deceased's premises shortly after 8.50 pm on the evening of 11 February, the demeanour of the accused was consistent with her having an aggressive state of mind. This, he submitted, was consistent with her engaging in an aggressive act of killing the deceased some hours later. 

364The Crown also relied upon the evidence that the deceased had intervened and told the accused to (inter alia) ""calm down"" when the police were at the premises during the evening of 11 February. The Crown's submission, as I understood it, was that there was an inference available that the accused's subsequent act of stabbing the deceased was a reaction to the deceased's earlier intervention. In this context the Crown also relied upon the tendency evidence to which I have previously referred. 

365The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied that the accused was at the deceased's premises at 23.22.55 and 23.26.19 (at which time calls were made to Channel Seven), at 23.30.49 (at which time a call was made to a bushfire appeal) and again at 00.28.39 (at which time the accused called triple 0 advising that the deceased was bleeding).

366The Crown also relied upon the telephone contact between the accused and Norman Fetch which I have earlier set out. The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied that each of the calls made from the landline of the deceased's premises, firstly to the landline of Hilda Fetch and secondly to the mobile service of Norman Fetch, were made by the accused. The Crown submitted that, if such a conclusion were reached, that evidence sustained the inference that the accused was in the deceased's premises at the time of the making of each of those calls. 

367The Crown also addressed me in relation to the evidence of fingerprints. He submitted that such evidence established that there was a fingerprint of the deceased present near the front door, along with two fingerprints of a Mr Finlay, who had been identified as a locksmith who had worked on the door some days before. The Crown pointed out that there was no identified fingerprint of any other person at or around the front door. He submitted that this tended against the proposition that some other person had entered the deceased's premises after the accused had left to go to the premises of Baston. However, the Crown candidly conceded that such a submission was deserving of limited weight, and specifically stated that he did not ""put that submission highly"".

368In respect of the evidence of Dr Orde, the Crown submitted that the fact that the accused was not found to have any blood on her clothes did not exculpate her in view of the opinion of Dr Orde that the haemorrhage suffered by the deceased would have been confined within the abdominal cavity.

369The Crown further submitted that I would find that whomever was responsible for stabbing the deceased had cleaned the knife and the knife block which were the subject of examination by the police. In this regard, the Crown pointed, in particular, to the bloodstain which was found on the kitchen floor of the premises which, he submitted, I would find was the blood of the deceased. He submitted that this evidence was consistent with the person responsible going to the kitchen to return the knife, observing the blood on the floor and then cleaning the knife and the block. In these respects the Crown also relied upon the fact that a swab taken from the blade of the knife did not reveal the presence of blood. 

370The Crown identified two competing hypotheses concerning the circumstances of the deceased's death. The first was that the deceased had harmed himself. The Crown invited me to reject that hypothesis, principally on the basis of the same evidence as that which was relied upon in support of the earlier argument that the accused had told lies about how the deceased was harmed. He also submitted that the evidence of the bloodstain on the kitchen floor, and what he submitted was the cleaning of the knife, was inconsistent with such a hypothesis.

371The second was that an unknown person had entered the deceased's premises and stabbed him, in circumstances where the accused had left the front door of the premises open. The Crown submitted that this was not a reasonable hypothesis because there was no evidence of any identified person having a motive to harm the deceased in any way. 

372The fundamental proposition advanced by Mr Austin on behalf of the accused was that when the evidence was viewed as a whole it established little more than the fact that the accused had an opportunity to kill the deceased. He submitted that the evidence fell short of being sufficient to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused had in fact done so. 

373Mr Austin took me to the evidence of the relationship between the accused and the deceased and, in particular, the evidence of Jones as to his observations of the two of them during the course of 11 February 2009. Mr Austin submitted that the conclusion to be reached on the basis of that evidence was that interactions between the accused and the deceased of which Jones gave evidence were a normal incident of their relationship and that the accused's expressions to the effect of ""I'll kill you"" were not said with an intention to carry out such a threat, and were not (and were not intended to be) expressions of aggression or violence. To the extent that the accused had told the deceased that she would ""kill him"" if he did not stop drinking wine, Mr Austin submitted essentially submitted that expressions of that nature were often said by people, be it out of frustration or otherwise, and without any accompanying intention to ever carry out such a threat. It should be noted that the Crown, when taking me to that evidence, conceded that it was ""not a piece of evidence ..... which one would place great weight on"". 

374Mr Austin submitted that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the knife, or the knife block, had in fact been cleaned. He pointed out that the evidence of the results of the presumptive test were equivocal, that there was no evidence of the age of the blood stain (if it was, in fact, a human blood stain) that was found on the knife, and that there was similarly no evidence of the age of the bloodstain found on the floor. 

375Mr Austin did not argue against a finding that the accused was in an agitated state when the police attended the deceased's premises at 8.51 pm following her complaint about Jones. However, he submitted that even if that were the case, it did not follow that she was similarly agitated three hours later and that she stabbed the deceased in that frame of mind. In this regard Mr Austin pointed out that the accused's agitation at that earlier time was directed towards Jones, not the deceased. Although there is evidence that the deceased told the accused at that time to ""calm down"", Mr Austin submitted that this intervention was not of a kind which would have provided some catalyst for the accused to want to harm the deceased several hours later. 

376Mr Austin also relied on the fact that there was nothing in the evidence of the statements made by the deceased which was in any way inculpatory of the accused. He also pointed out, that the deceased was asked on more than one occasion what happened and he repeatedly replied to the effect ""I don't know"".

377In these circumstances, Mr Austin submitted that the entirety of the evidence established nothing more than the fact that the accused had the opportunity to kill the deceased. He submitted that neither of the competing scenarios could be excluded as a possibility and that the Crown had failed to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was the act of the accused which killed the deceased.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION
General principles 
378Both the Crown and counsel for the accused made reference, in the course of their submissions, to the fact that the Crown case was entirely circumstantial. As the tribunal of fact, it is necessary for me to consider and weigh all of the circumstances established by the evidence in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence open on that evidence (see generally R v Hillier (2007) 228 CLR 618 at 637 per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ).

379It is also important to recognise that often in a case based upon circumstantial evidence there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. However, a circumstantial case is not to be considered in a piecemeal fashion. Consideration must be given to the weight which is to be ascribed to the united force of all of the circumstances put together (Hillier (supra) at 638 citing R v Chamberlain [No. 2] (1984) 153 CLR 521). At the conclusion of such a consideration, the guilt of the accused should not be simply a rational inference. It should be the only rational inference that is able to be drawn in all of the circumstances (see generally Shepherd v R (1990) 170 CLR 573). The accused is presumed innocent until her guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt, such a standard being an exacting one (see Douglass v R (2012) 290 ALR 699 at [47]).

What circumstances are established by the evidence?
380The accused and the deceased had known one another for some time. Whilst the precise nature of that relationship is not completely clear, I am satisfied that it was characterised by arguments taking place between them, in the course of which the accused had threatened to kill the deceased. However I am not satisfied that those threats, when made, were accompanied by an intention on the part of the accused to in fact kill the deceased. 
381Both the accused and the deceased were prone to drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. The evidence also establishes that the accused was prone to acting aggressively, particularly when she had been drinking. Mr Swan gave evidence of one occasion on which he saw the accused be violent towards the deceased, although that is the only evidence of such an incident having taken place. 

382I am satisfied that during the course of 11 February 2009 the accused went to Baston's premises and had left two shopping bags there. She had also been present in the vicinity of the unit block when the deceased and Jones were moving a refrigerator in the course of which she had told the deceased, in Jones' presence, that she would ""kill (him) if (he) did not get off the wine"". That, I am satisfied, was not atypical of statements which the accused would make towards the deceased from time to time. However, there is no evidence that the statement was accompanied by any overt display of aggression on the part of the accused, and there is no evidence of anything else about her demeanour on that occasion which would support a conclusion that she intended to put her threat into effect.

383I am satisfied that the accused called 000 from the deceased's premises at 19.21.16 on 11 February 2009 in order to complain about the alleged indecent assault by Jones. I am satisfied that the when the police arrived at about 8.50 pm that evening, the accused was well affected by alcohol, that she was confused, and that she was exhibiting a mood which fluctuated between being calm and aggressive. There is no evidence that there had been any act on the part of the deceased which might have caused the accused's aggressive frame of mind. To the extent that the accused was aggressive at that time, the evidence supports the conclusion that her aggression was directed towards Jones, not the deceased. 

384I am satisfied that in the course of the accused making her complaint to the police at that time, the deceased intervened and urged the accused to (inter alia) ""calm down"". However, there is nothing to suggest that the deceased did so in an aggressive fashion. On the contrary, I accept the evidence of Constable Cross that the deceased intervened in a fashion which was ""tolerant and understanding"". In these circumstances I do not accept the submission advanced by the Crown that the deceased's intervention on that occasion somehow provided a reason or motive for the accused to be aggressive towards the deceased and kill him some hours later. There is nothing in the evidence which would suggest that there was any particular behaviour on the part of the deceased at any time during the course of 11 February 2009, or at any other relevant time, which might have provided some motive to the accused to want to kill him.

385The evidence establishes that the police spoke to Jones following the accused's complaint at 9.30 pm. The time at which they left the deceased's premises is not clear but in circumstances where Jones' premises were in the same unit block, I am satisfied that it was some time shortly before 9.30 pm. The accused and the deceased were present in the deceased's premises when the police left. 

386The evidence establishes that between 9.30 pm and 11.30 pm, a total of three calls were made from the deceased's landline to the landline of the premises of Hilda Fetch, who was the mother of Norman Fetch. Norman Fetch had known both the deceased and the accused for a considerable period of time. However, he had had greater contact in recent years with the accused, having been in a relationship with her for a short of period of time some 12 months prior to the deceased's death. 

387In these circumstances, bearing in mind the other evidence of telephone contact between the accused and Mr Fetch on or about the day of the deceased's death, and notwithstanding Mr Fetch's inability to recall any detail whatsoever of calls which were recorded as having been made to or by him, I am satisfied that all of the calls which were recorded as having been made from the deceased's premises to those of Mrs Fetch were made by the accused. It follows that I am satisfied that the accused was present at the deceased's premises at the times of those calls being made.

388In particular, I am satisfied that the calls made to Mrs Fetch's premises on the evening of 11 February 2009 at 22.47.00, 22.52.40 and 22.53.26 were made by the accused and that the respective durations of those calls were 46 seconds, 18 seconds and 201 seconds respectively. Mr Fetch could remember nothing about these calls, or indeed any of the calls which were made to his mother's landline or his own mobile service. I am satisfied that his inability to do so is attributable to his alcoholism. Accepting that he spoke with the accused on those various occasions, there is no direct evidence, nor is there any other evidence which would support an inference, as to what was discussed on any of those occasions. The only possible exception to that is the call made from the deceased's premises to those of Mrs Fetch at 12.27 am to which I have referred below.

389I am satisfied that the accused made two calls to Channel 7 at 23.22.55 and 23.26.19, and that she made a further call to the ""Bushfire Appeal Hotline"" at 23.30.49. The duration of the last of those calls was 54 seconds. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the accused was present at the deceased's premises at least until just after 11.31 pm on 11 February 2009.

390The accused subsequently went to Baston's premises and collected the two shopping bags which she had left there earlier in the day. The evidence does not enable me to be precise about the time at which she left the deceased's premises to go to Baston's. However, in light of Baston's evidence that the accused did not attend his premises in the course of a particular television program which had started at 11.50 pm, I am satisfied that it was some time prior to that. I am also satisfied that the accused left Baston's premises walking in a direction opposite to that of the premises of",2013-08-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762163,Suzanne Marie Ryan and Mary Agnes Briggs as executrices of the estate of the late Patrick Joseph Donoghue & Anor v Prenitha Srimath Wikramanayake & Anor [2013] NSWSC 1150,"Judgment

1Between March and October 2005 Mr Patrick Joseph Donoghue and his wife Marie Josephine Donoghue (""the Donoghues"") resided in an aged care facility, Lavington Lodge in Warren Street, Lavington, near Albury in New South Wales. 

2Mr Donoghue died on 31 October 2009 and Probate of his Will was granted on 23 March 2010. Mrs Donoghue died on 6 January 2012. The plaintiffs, Mrs Suzanne Ryan and Mrs Mary Briggs, are the Donoghues' daughters and the executrices of their estates. 

3By their Further Amended Statement of Claim of 24 May 2012, the plaintiffs seek the return of two accommodation bonds that the Donoghues paid under resident agreements between the Donoghues and the operator of the facility, Plus 55 Village Management (Albury) Pty Ltd (ACN 108 976 503) (""Plus 55""), or compensation in lieu of the return of the bonds.

4The first defendant, Mr Prenitha Wikramanayake, and the second defendant, Mrs Margaret Wikramanayake, (""the Wikramanayakes"") were at relevant times the two shareholders and two directors of Wagga Road Properties Pty Ltd (ACN 108 886 568) (""Wagga Road""). Wagga Road owned the property at Warren Street, Lavington (""the Warren Street property"") on which Lavington Lodge was built, and which it had agreed to lease to Plus 55. Wagga Road, formerly the third defendant, had commercial lease arrangements with Plus 55 which both entitled it to receipt of accommodation bonds, and required it to pay accommodation bonds back to residents on their exit from the facility. Wagga Road was deregistered on 8 November 2011, and the plaintiffs no longer proceed against it.

5The plaintiffs bring their proceedings in constructive trust, and alleging interference with contractual relations, and misleading and deceptive conduct. The Wikramanayakes say that any liability to refund these accommodation bonds lies with Plus 55, not with them.

6Additional context is required to understand these proceedings. The narrative below comprises the Court's findings, on what is mostly uncontested evidence. The findings on areas of more controversial evidence are included later in these reasons, when the plaintiffs' various claims to relief are considered.

7Mr Van Aalst of counsel appeared for the plaintiffs and Mr Bolster of counsel for the defendants.

Lavington Lodge 2002 - 2007

The Wikramanayakes meet Mr Smith and Mr James
8Combined House Pty Ltd (ACN 089 961 900) (""Combined House"") owned the Warren Street property before Wagga Road. From 1999 Combined House retained Mr David Smith and Mr John James as consultants to assist in constructing the aged care facility on the Warren Street property facility that was to become Lavington Lodge. Mr Smith and Mr James had arranged with Combined House to build and then sell the first stage of the project, which comprised some 24 apartments. But in 2002, Combined House ran out of funds and could not complete construction. To meet the funding deficiency, Mr Smith and Mr James, approached the Wikramanayakes with a proposal that they finance Combined House's completion of the facility

9Mr Smith and Mr James' December 2002 proposal was that the Wikramanayakes would lend funds to Combined House for the completion of this first stage of Lavington Lodge. Mr Smith and Mr James would then operate the facility through Combined House. The Wikramanayakes would take security by first mortgage over the Warren Street property, and take a fixed and floating charge over the assets of Combined House. But the proposal ultimately involved the sale of the facility. Mr Smith anticipated the units could be sold in one line for a price of about $85,000 each - so the sale of 24 units was anticipated to generate approximately $2.04 million.

10In March 2003, the Wikramanayakes accepted Mr Smith's and Mr James' proposal. In accordance with a letter of offer dated 14 March 2003 the Wikramanayakes lent Combined House $1,300,000 (clause 1.2(a)) for the purpose of the construction of what was described as an ""aged and disabled hostel"" (clause 1.3). The loan had a term of 18 months (from 23 December 2002) (clause 1.5) with an interest rate of 10.50% per annum (clause 1.8).

11The parties to the financing arrangement - Combined House, Mr Smith, Mr James and the Wikramanayakes - envisaged in March 2003 that the 24 apartment facility would be completed by the end of June 2004, by which time the Wikramanayakes mortgage would be repaid. 

12Messrs Smith and James and the Wikramanayakes did not fully document the arrangements they made in March 2003. Combined House was paid $380,000 to compensate it for its original investment in Lavington Lodge, and the profit from the sale of the 24 units was to be split three ways - one-third to Mr Smith, one-third to Mr James, and one third to the Wikramanayakes. But the Wikramanayakes were nevertheless to control the sale proceeds. 

13Combined House began to draw down on the loan in March 2003. Building and construction proceeded towards the anticipated completion date of 30 June 2004.

A New Structure is Proposed - April 2004

14But planned completion did not eventuate. Instead in the first half of 2004 Mr Smith and Mr James proposed a restructure of the parties' obligations. This was apparently necessary because, as Mr Smith explained to the Wikramanayakes, despite his marketing efforts the 24 units of the facility were too small to be sold in one line to an investor. This meant that the facility would have to be made operational so the unit could be sold individually to persons entering an operating facility. So, in February 2004, Messrs Smith and James proposed a further plan: buying the site from Combined House, and for them to operate the completed facility, which could take advantage of Commonwealth funding for its operations, until individual units were sold. 

15On 19 April 2004, the Wikramanayakes, Mr Smith and Mr James attended what has been called in the proceedings a ""whiteboard meeting"". At that meeting Mr Smith and Mr James proposed a tripartite corporate structure for the future operation of Lavington Lodge: one company would purchase the land from Combined House; a second company would operate the facility; and, a third company would employ staff at the facility. The parties agreed in principle to this idea. But disputes later emerged about what was agreed. 

16After the April 2004 whiteboard meeting, preparations were made to implement the corporate structure discussed and agreed in principle. Mr Smith and Mr James established Plus 55 which was to function as the Lavington Lodge's operating company. Mr Smith was appointed as Plus 55's sole director and shareholder. 

17In June 2004 the Wikramanayakes established the Wagga Road Trust, and appointed Wagga Road as the trustee of that trust, as a preliminary to Wagga Road acquiring the Lavington Lodge land. At the same time, Mr Smith and Mr James secured an amendment to the Development Consent for Lavington Lodge to permit construction of an additional 32 units. 

18I accept the Wikramanayakes' evidence that Mr Smith explained to them that under these proposed arrangements Plus 55 would contract with the residents coming into the facility, and would accept their accommodation bonds. I accept that the Wikramanayakes thought that this was a deviation from the spirit of what they thought had originally been agreed: that the Wikramanayakes would control the sale proceeds. 

19So, Mr Smith and Mr James agreed that 100% of what they called the ""security deposit"" paid by the residents to Plus 55 would flow on to Wagga Road and that there would be a formal agreement between Plus 55 and Wagga Road to that effect. This understanding gave considerable comfort to the Wikramanayakes. Wagga Road was buying the land, to rescue Combined House, and had to borrow further money to do so. They thought it only fair that all accommodation bond monies Plus 55 received should be paid on to Wagga Road, so they could apply those funds to reducing their external mortgage obligations. I accept Mr and Mrs Wikramanayakes' evidence about their discussions with Mr Smith and Mr James and about their concern about this issue. But despite their emphasis upon this important issue, this arrangement between Wagga Road and Plus 55 was never documented.

20Combined House defaulted on the Wikramanayakes' loan before 30 June 2004. The default resulted in Wagga Road purchasing the facility from Combined House. On 28 June 2004 Wagga Road completed settlement of the purchase of the Warren Street property on which the almost constructed Lavington Lodge stood by, paying Combined House $407,581.30. 

21After Wagga Road purchased, the Warren Street property, a first mortgage to the NAB secured a $700,000 loan to Wagga Road and the Wikramanayakes took a second mortgage to secure their then total investment of $1,201,707.52. Wagga Road remained the registered proprietor of the Warren Street property until 29 October 2010.

22Following completion Plus 55 operated Lavington Lodge, which was officially opened on 23 August 2004. Aged care facilities such as Lavington Lodge may only be operated after accreditation under the Aged Care Act 1997 (Cth). Plus 55 made an application for Aged Care Act accreditation. On 8 March 2005, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing (""DOHA"") approved Lavington Lodge as an accredited aged care facility under the Aged Care Act.

23On 15 October 2004 Wagga Road and Plus 55 entered into a written agreement (""the lease agreement"") defining their commercial operating relationship. The lease agreement was made in circumstances of some urgency, because the then deadline for the 2004 Commonwealth Aged Care Approval Round (""ACAR"") was approaching. The lease agreement contemplated that Wagga Road would grant a lease, described as an ""end Lease"" to Plus 55 after the facility was completed. Recital B of the lease agreement contemplated that the lease would ""allow Plus 55 to enter into loan/licence agreements with residents on the terms and conditions contained in a document entitled Lavender Lodge Serviced Apartments Residential Agreement which document has been acknowledged by both parties"". ""Lavender Lodge"" is an early name for Lavington Lodge. It was not in issue that the ""Residential Agreement"" referred to in Recital B was the same as the standard form Resident Agreement into which the Donoghues entered on 18 March 2005.

24Under the 15 October 2004 lease agreement, Wagga Road leased Lavington Lodge to Plus 55 for two years, Plus 55 agreed to operate the facility during that period, and Wagga Road was responsible for capital expenditure at the facility. The full terms of the lease agreement were as follows:

1. Wagga will grant and Plus 55 will accept a Lease of stage one (1) ('the lease').

2. The term of the lease will be for a period of two (2) years or such other period as may be agreed between the parties.

3. Plus 55 will pay to Wagga during the period a rental of Sixteen thousand two hundred dollars ($16,200.00) per annum for each unit for the period on a pro rate basis that is being occupied pursuant to a loan/licence agreement.

4. During the period of the lease Plus 55 will:-

(i) Operate and conduct the facility in accordance with the prescribed terms and conditions of the Albury City Council and the laws of New South Wales and the Commonwealth as they relate to the provision of accommodation case and service for Low Care residents.

(ii) Maintain the facility in good condition having regard to the maintenance of the fire and safety equipment and the maintenance of all hot water electrical and gas fired/operated equipment.

(iii) Maintain all internal lighting and electric circuity.

(iv) Provide the general level of cleaning care and maintenance of all painted, treated and polished surfaces.

5. Wagga will:-

(i) Provide maintenance and upgrade when required to ensure that the facility complies and continues to comply with the requirements of all appropriate Local State and Commonwealth Governments and their Instrumentalities, Departments, Service or Licensing entities.

(ii) Make all loan refunds to residents exiting the facility in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the Residence Agreement.

(iii) Replace all items of capital expenditure plant fixtures and fittings required to conduct the facility.

6. Both parties will share equally the payment of land tax, Council rates, charges and insurances, public risk, professional indemnity in respect to the facility.

25One of Wagga Road's financial obligations under the lease agreement was to make loan refunds to residents exiting the facility ""in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the ""Residence Agreement"": clause 5(ii). The lease agreement's reference to the ""Residence Agreement"" is actually a reference to a standard form ""The Resident Agreement"", which each resident entering Lavington Lodge was required to make with its operator Plus 55. Under the Resident Agreement incoming residents lodged an accommodation bond with Plus 55, which was repayable on resident exit. I infer that the parties to the lease agreement were aware of this obligation in the standard form Resident Agreement. As between Wagga Road and Plus 55, Wagga Road agreed to take on this accommodation bond repayment obligation.

26The relationship between the Wikramanayakes, Mr Smith and Mr James became strained by late 2004. Disputes developed between them about: whether the lease agreement was a preliminary statement of intent, or something more final; about the financing of the proposed second stage of the Lavington Lodge development; and, about responsibility for the repayment of accommodation bond money paid by residents of Lavington Lodge. 

27I will return to these disputes later in these reasons. But in the midst the Donoghues became residents of Lavington Lodge.

The Donoghues enter Lavington Lodge

28Mr and Mrs Donoghue each had health issues such that by late 2004 it became necessary for them to investigate, and ultimately to become, residents of an aged care facility. They visited Lavington Lodge just before Christmas 2004.

29During their pre-Christmas 2004 visit the Donoghues together with their daughters Mrs Ryan and Mrs Briggs met the then manager of Lavington Lodge, Mrs Shirley Cornish with a view to taking two units in the facility. I accept Mrs Ryan's evidence that during Mrs Cornish's tour of the facility there was discussion about the need for the Donoghues to pay a bond of about $110,000 each to the facility operator and that Mrs Cornish said that the bond would be refunded after a resident left, as soon as the unit was occupied by another resident.

30Mrs Ryan and Mrs Briggs visited the facility again with their parents on 21 January 2005. On this occasion the visitors further discussed the payment and conditions of repayment of the bonds with Mrs Cornish, and they paid a holding deposit of $4,000 to Plus 55. Mrs Cornish gave them two copies of the Resident Agreement to take away. As their evidence made abundantly clear, this visit was a typical example of the close and affectionate support that Mrs Ryan and Mrs Briggs so obviously gave to their parents in their final years. 

31On 18 March 2005, both Mr and Mrs Donoghue separately entered into a Resident Agreement with Plus 55 under which they were each granted a right to occupy a unit in Lavington Lodge. Mr Donoghue occupied unit 16 and Mrs Donoghue occupied unit 17 in Lavington Lodge. 

32Before signing, Mr and Mrs Donoghue received legal advice about the proposed Resident Agreement with Plus 55 on 2 February 2005. Mr Ian Geddes of Carter and Blumer gave written legal advice to them on 2 February 2005 . Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 of Mr Geddes' letter of advice are relevant to the issues that later emerged between the parties:

2. Current resident fees are $242.30 per week, irrespective as to whether or not you obtain a Centrelink benefit or not.

3. The residence fees are calculated upon 85% of Centrelink entitlements for a single person, plus 100% rent assistance for a single person. As these payments go up according to Centrelink rules, then the resident's fee will increase. As advised, it does not matter whether you receive Centrelink payments or not, this is how the fees are calculated.

4. There is accommodation and bond of $110,500.00. The home gets the interest on this bond. There is also the monthly retention rate which is deducted from the bond.

...
6. The retention rate commences after 2 months. If, for some reason a person decides to leave on or after the 2 month period, then $4,134.00 comes off the bond, then a month after that a further $1,381.00. The retention rate for one year is $16,575.00 and for 2 years a maximum of $33,150.00. If there are any late payments paid to the home, interest is calculated at 13.49% being the current interest rate. This of course, will change. The retention rates are calculated on a whole monthly basis. This means that if you are a resident commencing next month and then decide to leave, you pay the whole month even though you May have only been in the premises for one week.
...
8. As far as a refund of the bond, you only receive this once a new resident replaces the resident leaving, and signs an Agreement and pays the new bond.
9. Any amounts owing to the home can be deducted from the bond before it is repaid.

33The Resident Agreement governed all the financial arrangements between residents and Plus 55. Under the Resident Agreement each resident was liable to pay an accommodation bond of $110,500 as well as an ongoing resident fee. At the time the Donoghues' entered at Lavington Lodge, the resident fee was $242.40 per week (cl 10.02), calculated as 85% of the current, maximum, basic, single, aged pension, plus 100% of the current, maximum, rental assistance payable in respect of a single, aged pensioner with no dependent children. 

34The Resident Agreement also provides for standards of care and resident conduct. The operator, Plus 55, contracted under the Resident Agreement to provide a level of basic care set out in Part 1 of Schedule A (cl 8.01) as well as any extra care that may be required from time-to-time set out in Part 2 of Schedule B (cl 8.02). But using an extra care service, which was not included as a basic care service, would result in an additional charge (cl 8.10). The resident also agreed to adhere to the Rules of the Care Facility (cl 13.01). The resident could nominate a person to represent them in their dealings with the operator, Plus 55 (cl 18.01). The terms of the Resident Agreement confer rights only upon the resident and Plus 55, and not upon any other person. The Resident Agreement does not refer to Wagga Road's assumption of Plus 55's accommodation bond repayment obligations under the lease agreement.

35The Resident Agreement also provided, in clause D7.01, for the refund of the balance of the accommodation bond. Mr Geddes' letter of advice (paragraph 8) had accurately summarized the effect of clause D7.01, which provided as follows:

D7.01

Subject to the provisions of this clause D7, the accommodation bond balance must be refunded by the Organisation:-

(a) if You die; or

(b) if You cease to be provided with accommodation and care at the Care Facility or at any other residential care service conducted by the Organisation (other than because You are on leave);

PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT the Organisation shall have received a new Resident Agreement in respect of your Accommodation duly executed by the new incoming Resident and the Organisation together with the payment of a new accommodation bond to the Organisation by the new incoming Resident.""

36The Donoghues entered Lavington Lodge on 18 March 2005. At entry they each became liable to pay to Plus 55 an accommodation bond of $110,500. The Donoghues met their total liability of $221,000 prior to entering Lavington Lodge. As they had already paid a $4,000 deposit in January 2005 to Plus 55 to secure Units 16 and 17, the Donoghues paid the outstanding amount of $217,000 on 18 March 2005. 

Trouble at Lavington Lodge - March 2005

37But by March 2005, and unknown to the Donoghues at the time of their entry, the relationship between the Wikramanayakes and Wagga Road and Mr Smith, Mr James and Plus 55 had broken down. Unsatisfactory dealings between the Wikramanayakes and Messrs Smith and James had led the Wikramanayakes refusing to deal with Mr Smith and Mr James other than through lawyers. Their principal disputes were in relation to the management of Lavington Lodge and Messrs Smith and James' dealings with the accommodation bond monies Plus 55 had collected. 

38Whilst the Donoghues were considering whether to take up residence, tensions rose dramatically between the Wikramanayakes and Messrs Smith and James. After returning from an overseas vacation in January 2005, the Wikramanayakes completed Wagga Road's accounts. They discovered that Messrs Smith and James had not been remitting received accommodation bonds to Wagga Road. They wrote in demanding and distrustful terms to Mr Smith on 9 February 2009. The letter was intended to reach Mr James as well. It raised a number of other relevant complaints in addition to the problem of the unremitted accommodation bonds.

39The but missing accommodation bonds represented the Wikramanayakes' prime aggravation, as they explained to Mr Smith:

Dear David,

After we came back to Australia we have become extremely alarmed at your failure to pay back any of the debt due to us despite having the funds, and despite repeated requests from us.

We have now had an opportunity to bring the accounts up to date and we find that in the time we were away substantial funds have been collected from resident and dissipated. In fact in excess of $850,000 has been collected from residents and apart from the initial $204,000 you have not made any significant repayments.

When we agreed to finance this project it was always on the understanding that our funds would be paid out. Given the remaining number of units, and the funds that will become available (assuming you don't continue to spend these funds) you are not going to be liable to pay the principal due to us nor the interest. We assess the shortfall to be of the order of $500,000. This is unacceptable.

When we agreed to finance this project it was always on the understanding that our funds would be paid out. Given the remaining number of units, and the funds that will become available (assuming you don't continue to spend these funds) you are not going to be able to pay the principal due to us nor the interest. We assess the shortfall to be of the order of $50,000. This is unacceptable.

You must be aware of this when you spent nearly $400,000 of the funds that have come in, and yet have not chosen to discuss this with us.

You have funds and yet you continue to ignore our requests for repayment. This is a breach of our arrangements and we now want the interest due on our loan to be repaid each month at the rate of our costs of capital + 2%. For the month of January this payment will be $8,583.38 (computation attached).

40The Wikramanayakes thought that Messrs Smith and James had pressured them on 15 October 2004 to sign an inappropriately worded lease agreement, and were now dragging their feet on rectifying it. According to the Wikramanayakes the lease agreement was supposed to be a ""mirror image"" of the Resident Agreement, which it was not:

The agreement between Plus 55 Village Management (Albury) PL and Wagga Road Properties was to have been a mirror image of the agreement between Plus 55 and the residents. When David made a submission for government funding he asked us to sign an agreement in order to expedite the application. This agreement was deficient in many respects. It was our understanding that John would attend to this and set in place a proper agreement when he had more time. This is still outstanding and John has agreed to give us the rectified agreement at the next meeting.

41The Wikramanayakes' 9 February 2005 letter also raised concerns about deficient project management and delays to completion of the project, which had already led to litigation. They explained to Mr Smith that both the project management problems and the failure to remit promised moneys to Wagga Road, were putting in jeopardy the expansion of the project to Stage 2, which would require the Wikramanayakes to invest further funds into the purchase of an adjacent property, known as the Donnelley property. It was hoped that the purchase of the Donnelley property would allow the facility to be expanded from 24 to 110 units. Finally the Wikramanayakes complained about the poor marketing of and resident take up of units in Lavington Lodge, saying ""we are not prepared to plough on without appraisal of this critical factor"".

42They then summarized what they thought needed to be done immediately to rectify the situation between Wagga Road and Plus 55:

What do you need to do to rectify the situation

1. Undertake to pay our interest as set out, in addition to servicing the NAB interest and lease payments.

2. Remedy the incorrect agreement with Plus 55 Village Management (Albury) PL and Wagga Road Properties.

3. Consult with us before you spend any more money.

4. We need to see all the bills for litigation on which you spent the $100,000 or so, and we need a proper explanation of these costs.

5. Give us a complete assessment of the situation with the litigation and its impact on this project. Come up with a forecast of how you intend to retire your debt to us. This will include a realistic projection on costs and expected sales.

43Mr Smith met the Wikramanayakes the next day, 10 February. To reduce tension Mr Smith promised to pay $100,000 off Wagga Road's NAB loan. But Mr Smith did not make that payment immediately, nor did he make the payment before the Donoghues went into Lavington Lodge. 

44By mid-March 2005 Wagga Road had liabilities of $1,845,396 comprised of a loan from the NAB of $697,000 and a loan from the Wikramanayakes of $1,148,396. Plus 55 had still not accounted to Wagga Road for all the bond monies it had received from residents up to that time.

45But surprisingly Mr Smith and Mr James were still looking at their plans to expand Lavington Lodge by purchasing the adjacent Donnelley property. The Wikramanayakes were unsympathetic to that idea whilst Plus 55 was not accounting to Wagga Road for the funds Plus 55 had received from residents.

46On 18 March 2005, the same day the Donoghues paid the outstanding accommodation bond balance of $217,000 to Plus 55 and entered into the Resident Agreement, Plus 55 was making demands on Wagga Road and the Wikramanayakes to press ahead with Stage 2 of the project. Plus 55's language showed few niceties:

Dear Pren, Margaret and John,

We must meet today to resolve the issue of purchasing the 482 Wagga Road site from the Donnollys.
To facilitate this we must all be in attendance.
To support the meeting and to clear any current misunderstandings and to sort out the preferred positions of each respective stake/interest holders in relation to moving the project forward.
To assist in achieving these requirements we must have the following information and or documents on the table for the meeting.
The Constitution, Share Register and Share Certificates of Wagga Road Properties Pty Ltd, the original 'stamped copy' of the Wagga Road Unit Trust Deed, the Unit Certificates and two blanks.
In respect of the current Lease Arrangements, it remains imperative that they remain as they are presently until such time as the negotiations proceeding with the Commonwealth are successfully concluded. This is because we will not under any circumstances prejudice any advantage already gained with out Commonwealth Approval as this in turn is to the detriment of the project going forward in any case. 
I suggest we meet early this afternoon to allow time for two of us to travel to Bankstown and effect an Exchange of the contract following out meeting.
Regards,
David [Smith].

47These 18 March 2005 demands shocked the Wikramanayakes. Of continuing major concern to them was Plus 55 not remitting accommodation bonds it received to Wagga Road. Now Plus 55 was pressuring to the Wikramanayakes to invest more funds. 

48So the Wikramanayakes consulted solicitors, Verekers Lawyers (""Verekers""), who wrote to Mr Smith on 21 March 2005. Verekers demanded that Plus 55 honour its arrangements with Wagga Road and remit to Wagga Road the accommodation bonds that Plus 55 already had received. The Verekers' made demand to Plus 55 in the following terms:

We have recently been consulted by Wagga Road Properties Pty Limited ('Wagga Road') and Mr & Mrs Wikramanayake regarding a series of arrangements concerning a retirement village known as 'Lavender Lodge' at 484 Wagga Road, Lavington ('the Property').

As you know Wagga Road is the registered proprietor of the Property and we are instructed that pursuant to partly written and partly oral arrangements your company ('Plus 55 Albury') is operating the retirement village business being carried on at the Property.

We are instructed that pursuant to those arrangements Plus 55 Albury (as agent for Wagga Road) is engaged in selling rights to occupy residential units to members of the public who are paying $110,500 for a right to occupy a unit.

Pursuant to the arrangements between our clients and Plus 55 Albury, Plus 55 Albury is required to account to Wagga Road for the whole of the sum of $110,500 for each right to occupy a unit sold until such time as certain debts associated with the purchase, construction and fitout of the Property are repaid. Those debts are owed by Wagga Road to the National Australia Bank Limited ('NAB')"" (which holds the first mortgage over the Property) and Mr & Mrs Wikramanayake.

As you know, the costs of the purchase, construction and fitout of the Property totalled approximately $2.2 million. We are instructed that 12 rights of residence have been sold but our clients have received only $324,000 (ie. $224,000 to Mr & Mrs Wikramanayake and $100,000 to the NAB). In addition our clients acknowledge that payments approximately $10,000 per month for the last two months have been paid to the NAB on account of equipment leases and they agreed to $20,000 being paid to each of yourself and John James.

Further, we are instructed that a number of payments have been made to subcontractors (to whom our clients were not liable) without our clients' prior consent.

We are instructed that three sales were completed on 16 and 18 March 2005 such that Plus 55 Albury ought to have received $331,500 on account of those sales.

Our clients hereby demand that that sum be paid to Mr & Mrs Wikramanayake forthwith.

Further we require that, by 5pm on 23 March 2005, a full accounting for all sums from sales of residential units be provided.

Our clients otherwise reserve their rights and we advise that we are taking further instructions regarding the current and future arrangements concerning operation of the village.

49The Verekers' demand led to a meeting three days later. But before that Plus 55 responded strongly to Verekers' letter, complaining that ""despite your being asked to attend a meeting this afternoon you have not chosen to make yourselves available to further discuss the issues relating to the ongoing operation of the Lavington Lodge project"". The Plus 55 letter then claimed that ""two-thirds of both the [Wagga Road] Share and Unit entitlements in the Project Structure belong to John and/or myself currently being held on trust by yourselves, with the remaining portion, being one-third, to be held by yourselves as part of the agreed structure"". The Wikramanayakes were alarmed at Mr Smith and Mr James' claims to entitlement to two-thirds of the Wagga Road Trust, so they agreed to meet, to see what could be discussed.

50On 24 March 2005 the Wikramanayakes and their Verekers solicitor, Mr Robert Tassell, met Mr Smith and Mr James at the offices of Verekers. The Wikramanayakes say, and I accept, that at the time of this 24 March 2005 meeting, they had no knowledge the Donoghues had paid their full accommodation bonds to Plus 55 or had entered into the Resident Agreements. Further, Mr Wikramanayake says that he was not aware that the Donoghues had actually become residents of Lavington Lodge until late April 2005 or early May 2005.

51The parties did not resolve their differences on 24 March 2005. Little common ground could be reached. But I accept the Wikramanayakes' evidence that during this meeting Mr Smith represented that he had an ""investor"" ready to buy out the Wikramanayakes' interests in Wagga Road and that as a sign of good faith the an investor would immediately pay $200,000 off Wagga Road's mortgage to the NAB.

52But little progress was reached on the important question of Plus 55 accounting to Wagga Road for deposit moneys. So on 24 March a procedural compromise was reached, which would also facilitate the future sale of Lavington Lodge: Mrs Wikramanayake would prepare accounts for the Wagga Road Trust, and Mr Smith would provide relevant bank statements to assist her to prepare the accounts.

53Mr Smith made good on one aspect of his promise at the 24 March meeting. On 29 March he caused Plus 55 to pay $200,000 directly into Wagga Road's NAB mortgage account.

54But there was no investor. The $200,000 was substantially the proceeds of the Donoghues' $217,000 accommodation bond money paid on 18 March 2005. This was money to which Wagga Road was already entitled under the existing Plus 55-Wagga Road arrangements about accommodation bonds. Only a few days had elapsed between the Donoghues paying their $217,000 deposit to Plus 55 on 18 March, and Plus 55's payment to the NAB on 29 March. Immediately before the payment to the NAB on 29 March, Plus 55's bank account had a credit balance of $372,574.20. Between the time of the Donoghues' deposit of $217,000 on 18 March and 29 March there were only minor transactions on Plus 55's account: some further credits of $2,352.80 and further debits of $2,334.33.

55Plus 55's bank accounts about this time indicate that no amount of $200,000, or any figure like it, had been paid into its account by a third party other than a resident of Lavington Lodge. The $200,000 paid to Wagga Road had come from Plus 55's existing resources, supplemented by the Donoghues' bond payments on 18 March.

56Despite the unreliability of some of the information she had been given, Mrs Wikramanayake did prepare accounts for Wagga Road in anticipation of its sale in early May.

The Wikramanayakes take over Lavington Lodge - July 2005

57In anticipation of the further escalation of the dispute with Plus 55 and the increasing likelihood of their taking possession of Lavington Lodge, on 10 June 2005 the Wikramanayakes registered a shelf company Lavington Lodge Retirement Village Pty Ltd (ACN 114 703 749) (""LLRV"") and became its two shareholders and directors of LLRV.

58On 8 July 2005 LLRV took possession of the facility. LLRV operated Lavington Lodge from 11 July 2005 to 29 October 2010. In August 2005 Messrs Smith and James and Plus 55 commenced litigation against the Wikramanayakes and Wagga Road in the commercial list of this Court. Messrs Smith and James claimed that the Wikramanayakes had orally agreed to grant each of them a one-third share both in the Wagga Road Unit Trust and in the Trustee, Wagga Road. Plus 55 also sought recovery of monies it alleged it had expended in connection with the facility for the benefit of Wagga Road, which constituted it claimed loan advances from Plus 55 to Wagga Road.

59Not surprisingly, Wagga Road cross-claimed in that litigation for the benefit of the accommodation bonds residents of the facility had paid to Plus 55, for which Plus 55 had not accounted to Wagga Road, and for unpaid rent, and for a declaration that Wagga Road had validly terminated the lease agreement.

60This litigation was decided in February 2007. The litigation meant that Messrs Smith and James and the Wikramanayakes remained in complete standoff. But in the months of July and August 2005 the contest between these parties played out in front of the Lavington Lodge residents.

61On 23 July 2005 Mrs Wikramanayake wrote to the residents of Lavington Lodge informing them of the change in its management. She explained to the residents: that Wagga Road had taken effective possession of Lavington Lodge; that Mr Smith was no longer involved with the operation of Lavington Lodge; and that, because Wagga Road and not Plus 55 was now operating Lavington Lodge, the residents should pay any ongoing residents fees into the trust account of Atkinson Vinden Lawyers, as opposed to the bank account of Plus 55.

62Mrs Wikramanayake's 23 July 2005 letter provoked a public contest with Plus 55 about who was actually running Lavington Lodge. Mr Smith wrote to residents an undated open letter: asserting that Wagga Road was not operating Lavington Lodge. The Donoghues received that letter sometime shortly after 23 July 2005. The residents of Lavington Lodge were becoming the unfortunate bystanders to a developing war.

63But Wagga Road soon brought matters to a head. On 29 July 2005, each of the Donoghues received a letter under the letterhead of Verekers, informing them that due to the failure of Plus 55 to procure Commonwealth Government funding under the Aged Care Act for the operation of Lavington Lodge, Plus 55 had committed a fundamental breach of the Resident Agreement and that Wagga Road had resolved to appoint, and had appointed, LLRV as the operator of Lavington Lodge. In the same letter, Verekers advised the residents that all monies payable to the operator in the future under Resident Agreements should henceforth be paid to LLRV. The Donoghues had already paid their accommodation bonds to Plus 55 under their two Resident Agreements. 

64Mrs Wikramanayake began corresponding with residents on behalf of LLRV. On 3 August 2005, she wrote to the first plaintiff Ms Sue Ryan, requesting that she attend a meeting on 11 August 2005 at Lavington Lodge to discuss financial information concerning the operation of the facility and the structure of the Residents Agreements. The Donoghues had appointed their daughter, Mrs Ryan to receive such correspondence and to handle financial aspects of their accommodation.

65On 8 August 2005, Mrs Wikramanayake wrote a letter addressed to ""The Residents' Families"", outlining what she saw as the then current management situation at Lavington Lodge. She dealt in particular with the dismissal of Ms Shirley Cornish, the former manager of Lavington Lodge. Mrs Wikramanayake's letter clearly conveyed that LLRV was then operating Lavington Lodge. She also reiterated her request to residents to pay ongoing resident fees to LLRV.

66Mr Smith again retaliated. On 8 August 2005, he wrote an open letter to the residents, families, friends and staff of Lavington Lodge. The open letter detailed, from Mr Smith's perspective, the status of the existing Supreme Court litigation between Plus 55 and Wagga Road about the possession of the Warren Street property.

67On 2 September 2005, Mrs Wikramanayake wrote two letters to Mrs Ryan. The first letter requested details of the payment by the Donoghues of any resident fees and any other amounts by way of rent or occupation fees. I infer from this letter that in September 2005 the Wikramanayakes were uncertain as to exactly what accommodation bonds had been paid to Plus 55 by what residents. The second letter informed Mrs Ryan of a new pricing scale for care at Lavington Lodge, which distinguished between the cost of Basic Care and Extra Care.

68On 12 September 2005, Mrs Wikramanayake again wrote to Mrs Ryan requesting payment of the recurrent fees due for the period 8 July 2005 to 12 September 2005. She noted, as was the case in the Commercial List proceedings, that this Court had directed payment of all monies due from residents into an account controlled by the Court.

69On 14 September 2005, Mrs Wikramanayake again wrote to Mrs Ryan requesting payment of Basic Care services from 8 July 2005 to 30 September 2005 as well as of certain Extra Care services.

The Donoghues leave Lavington Lodge

70With the dispute still simmering in October 2005 the Donoghues each had to leave Lavington Lodge for a more intensive care regime. The first to leave was Mr Donoghue. On 6 October 2005, Mrs Ryan wrote to Mr Smith, informing him that Mr Donoghue would cease being a resident of Lavington Lodge as of 7 October 2005. Mr Donoghue vacated Lavington Lodge on 7 October 2005. Despite the correspondence with Verekers, Mrs Ryan sent this correspondence to Mr Smith rather than Mrs Wikramanayake.

71Correspondence between the Wikramanayakes/Wagga Road and the Donoghues continued throughout the period that the Donoghues were preparing to depart Lavington Lodge. On 15 October 2005, Mrs Wikramanayake wrote to Mrs Ryan invoicing her in relation to the Donoghues' accommodation and care. Mrs Wikramanayake included invoices for Mr Donoghue's accommodation services for the period 1 October 2005 to 7 October 2005; and for Mrs Donoghue, for the period 1 October 2005 to 26 October 2005. These invoices reflected the family's plan that Mrs Donoghue would leave the facility about two weeks after her husband, as indeed occurred.

72On 19 October 2005, Mrs Ryan received a further letter from Verekers informing her that any monies owed to the operator of Lavington Lodge, should be paid into a joint account controlled by the Court.

73On 21 October 2005, Mrs Ryan wrote to Mr Smith informing him that Mrs Donoghue would cease being a resident of Lavington Lodge as of 26 October 2005. Mrs Donoghue vacated Lavington Lodge on 26 October 2005. 

74In total, Mr Donoghue had resided at Lavington Lodge for just under 7 months and Mrs Donoghue for just over 7 months.

Reclaiming the Accommodation Bonds - 2005 to 2007

75Shortly after the Donoghues had left Lavington Lodge, Mrs Ryan began efforts to recover their respective accommodation bonds. On 24 October 2005, Mr Donoghue's solicitor, Mr Ian Geddes wrote to Plus 55 seeking the return of his accommodation bond. On 3 November 2005, Plus 55 replied, informing Mr Geddes that he should direct his request for return of the accommodation bond to Wagga Road, because Wagga Road had assumed the management of Lavington Lodge on 8 July 2005. When dealing with Plus 55's liabilities, it now seemed quite content to accept that LLRV had taken over operating responsibility for Lavington Lodge, from July 2005. LLRV is not a party to these proceedings.

76On 15 January 2007, Mr Geddes wrote to Verekers, inquiring whether Wagga Road intended to reimburse the accommodation bonds paid by the Donoghues.

77On 28 February 2007 Hammerschlag J delivered judgment in the commercial division proceedings: Smith v Wikramanayake [2007] NSWSC 136. His Honour dismissed Mr Smith and Mr James' claim for a one-third share in the Wagga Road Unit Trust and in the Trustee, and dismissed Plus 55's loan claim. On Wagga's Road cross claim for accommodation bond monies his Honour found: an implied term derived from the lease agreement clause 5(ii), that Plus 55 was to pay accommodation bonds to Wagga Road; and, that there was an express agreement to the same effect at the ""whiteboard meeting"". His Honour gave judgment for Wagga Road on its cross claim against Plus 55 for $626,833.16, calculated as $814,921 in unaccounted for accommodation bonds received by Plus 55 less amounts Plus 55 had expended on the Lavington Lodge Road facility for Wagga Road's benefit. No appeal was brought from this judgment which represents the final legal position between those parties. In the meantime Mrs Ryan and Mrs Briggs changed solicitors and kept pursuing the return of the accommodation bonds.

78On 29 March 2007, Cater & Blumer wrote (for the executrices) to both Verekers (for Wagga Road) and The Law Company (for Plus 55), demanding reimbursement of the accommodation bond.

79Each of Plus 55 and Wagga Road then told the Donoghues to look to the other for repayment of the accommodation bond. On 30 April 2007, Verekers for Wagga Road, responded to the Cater and Blumer letter of 29 March 2007, stating that Plus 55 is required under the Resident Agreements to refund the accommodation bonds, if and when such refund were to fall due. On 4 April 2007, The Law Company also responded on behalf of Plus 55 stating that Wagga Road and not Plus 55, was responsible for refunding the Donoghues' accommodation bond. 

The Statutory Context Aged Care Act 1997 (Cth) 

80Lavington Lodge was licensed to operate under the Aged Care Act 1997. Plus 55 was an approved provider under the Aged Care Act for providing a residential care service for care recipients as defined under that Act. Parties did not provide the Court with a detailed analysis how the legislation applied to this facility. But the plaintiffs' submissions assumed and the Wikramanayake's submission did not contest that Aged Care Act Division 57 - ""What are the responsibilities relating to accommodation bonds and entry contributions?"" applied to accommodation bonds paid to Plus 55 in late 2004 and early 2005 in respect of Lavington Lodge. These reasons therefore start by making that assumption, without further analysis. 

81As these reasons show Aged Care Act Division 57 was not the basis of any cause of action pleaded by the plaintiffs. Rather it is pleaded as context to the plaintiffs' other causes of action.

82Aged Care Act Division 57 sets up a complex regime of rules about the receipt, preservation and refund of accommodation bonds. Aged Care Act s 57-2 provides basic rules about what residents may be charged accommodation bonds by approved providers, what information must be provided to residents, the maximum amount of an accommodation bond that may be charged and circumstances in which charging of accommodation bonds is prohibited. 

83The Aged Care Act s 57-2 ""Basic rules about accommodation bonds"" include an obligation under Subdivision 57-B upon an approved provider not to use the accommodation bond for a purpose that is not related to providing aged care to care recipients or that does not comply with certain prudential requirements:

57-3 Compliance with prudential requirements 
An approved provider complies with the prudential requirements if the approved provider complies with the Prudential Standards made under section 57-4.

57-4 Prudential Standards 
(1) The User Rights Principles may set out Prudential Standards. Prudential Standards are standards providing for: 

(a) protection of * accommodation bond balances of care recipients; and 

(b) protection of * entry contribution balances of care recipients; and 

(c) sound financial management of approved providers; and 

(d) provision of information about the financial management of approved providers. 

(2) The following are examples of matters with which the Prudential Standards may deal: 

(a) corporate governance requirements for approved providers; 

(b) financial reporting requirements for approved providers; 

(c) liquidity requirements for approved providers; 

(d) capital requirements for approved providers; 

(e) insurance requirements for approved providers; 

(f) information retention and provision requirements for approved providers.

84The Aged Care Act sets out ""User Rights Principles"" which specify many of the matters provided for in Aged Care Act s 57-4. These user rights principles cover the maintenance of accommodation balances of care recipients, the requirement to refund bond balances in a timely way, and detailed matters concerning the maintenance of accommodation bond balances in a liquid and secure form. But the Further Amended Statement of Claim in these proceedings did not plead specific breaches by Plus 55 of these User Rights Principles. Rather it focused on another part of Plus 55's responsibilities in relation to accommodation bonds, namely its obligation to refund bonds when the relevant care recipient ceases to be provided with residential care by the approved provider. The Further Amended Statement of Claim did plead the obligation in Aged Care Act Subdivision 57-G- ""Refunds"" provided for in Aged Care Act s 57-21. That provision follows:

57 21 Refunding of accommodation bond balance-approved providers
(1) The *accommodation bond balance in respect of an *accommodation bond paid by a care recipient for *entry to a residential care service or flexible care service must be refunded by the approved provider conducting the service if:
(a) the care recipient dies; or
(b) the care recipient ceases to be provided with:
(i) residential care by the residential care service (other than because the care recipient is on *leave); or
(ii) flexible care provided in a residential setting by the flexible care service; or
(c) in respect of an accommodation bond paid for the entry to a residential care service-the residential care service ceases to be *certified.
(2) The *accommodation bond balance must be refunded to the care recipient in the way specified in the User Rights Principles.
(3) The *accommodation bond balance must be refunded:
(aa) if the care recipient dies-within 14 days after the day on which the approved provider is shown the probate of the will of the care recipient or letters of administration of the estate of the care recipient; or
(a) if the care recipient is to *enter another service to receive residential care:
(i) if the care recipient has notified the approved provider of the move more than 14 days before the day on which the approved provider ceased providing care to the care recipient-on the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care; or
(ii) if the care recipient so notified the approved provider within 14 days before the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care-within 14 days after the day on which the notice was given; or
(iii) if the care recipient did not notify the approved provider before the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care-within 14 days after the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care; or
(b) in any other case-within 14 days after the day on which the event referred to in paragraph (1)(b) or (c) (whichever is applicable) happened.

85But the obligations under Aged Care Act s 57-21 to provide refunds is one that lies upon ""the approved provider conducting the service"". In this case that is Plus 55. The real contest in this case is whether the legislation assists the plaintiffs to maintain any of their claims to relief against the Wikramanayakes, as distinct to their having claims to relief against the relevant approved provider, Plus 55. 

86I note that more detailed statutory provisions for the management of accommodation bonds for aged care facilities were introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament in the Aged Care (Bond Security) Act 2006, which did not commence until 31 May 2006, after the events relied upon in these proceedings.

The Plaintiffs' claims

87The plaintiffs/executrices claim from the Wikramanayakes the value of Mr and Mrs Donoghues' accommodation bonds. They advance three causes of action, or claims for relief: (1) a constructive trust requiring the Wikramanayakes to restore the funds; (2) an interference with the contractual relations created under the Resident Agreement between Plus 55 and the Donoghues; and (3) misleading and deceptive conduct under Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) s 52. Each of these claims is now outlined and analysed.

88These reasons initially seek to paraphrase the terms of the executrices' submissions in these three areas of claimed relief. But in each area the Wikramanayakes' submissions lead to disputes of fact and legal analysis. It is to each of those that these reasons now turn.

(1) Constructive Trust and Fiduciary Obligation

89The executrices submit that upon the payment of the Donoghues' bonds to Plus 55, they were entitled to have the bonds so held on their behalf refunded when they vacated Lavington Lodge. The plaintiffs contend that a trust or fiduciary relationship arose in respect of the Donoghues' accommodation bonds, by reason of the combined operation of the provisions of the Aged Care Act, Ch. 4 and the Resident Agreements the Donoghues made with Plus 55. 

90The executrices claim in their submissions that Plus 55, the Wikramanayakes, and their companies ""immediately had the benefit (or perceived benefit) which flowed from the payment of the Donoghues' bonds, which [the Wikramanayakes] intended to be applied towards the servicing of the NAB facility secured over the Lavington Lodge property and facility"". The executrices' argument proceeds, to quote their submissions, that the benefit so identified, ""is a link in the chain"" of the private dealings between Plus 55, Mr Smith, and the defendants, whereby upon payment of the Donoghues' bonds on 18 March 2005, the balance refundable to the Donoghues became subject to a constructive trust, whereby those funds could and should only be held for them to be refunded in accordance with the Aged Care Act, the Users Rights principles and the Resident Agreements"".

91The executrices' argue that once a constructive trust is established, neither the Wikramanayakes nor Wagga Road could deal with the refundable balance of the accommodation bonds ""other than for and on behalf of the Donoghues as required under the Aged Care Act"". The executrices argue that the accommodation bonds could only be dealt with for the benefit of the Donoghues, and that any provision such as the proviso to clause D7.01 in the Resident Agreement, which purports to restrict the return of the accommodation bond until a new Resident Agreement had been signed, was unlawful, and did not in fact restrict the Donoghues' rights to the return of the bonds.

92Although this argument was elaborated with some ingenuity by Mr Van Aalst, I do not accept it. Mr Van Aalst was faced with the difficulty of not being able to sue either the deregistered or worthless entities Plus 55 and Wagga Road. So he not unnaturally turned his attention to the Wikramanayakes. But I do not accept that any remedial constructive trust can be established against them in respect of the Donoghues' accommodation bonds. This is so for the following reasons.

93As a preliminary one part of the argument that Mr Van Aalst put on behalf of the executrices can be accepted - that the Wikramanayakes had a personal financial interest in ensuring that Wagga Road had sufficient funds to pay out the NAB. The Wikramanayakes were guarantors of Wagga Road's obligations to the NAB and would be liable if it defaulted to the bank. But all this shows in my view is that the Wikramanayakes were strongly motivated to have Wagga Road enforce its contract with Plus 55 to transfer accommodation bonds received onto Wagga Road. But the correspondence between the parties shows they had this motivation in any event.

94Mr Van Aalst somewhat narrowed this claim for relief in argument at the trial, accepting as he really had to on the facts, that the Wikramanayakes had not themselves actually received any accommodation bonds from the Donoghues. The case principally put was that Plus 55 either owed a fiduciary duty to the Donoghues upon receipt of the accommodation bonds in March 2005 or actually held them on trust for the Donoghues. It was said that Plus 55 breached that fiduciary or trust obligation when responding to Wagga Road's call for the transfer of the accommodation bonds to Wagga Road. It can be accepted for the sake of argument in Mr Van Aalst's favour (although the Wikramanayakes disputed this) that Plus 55 did hold the accommodation bonds on trust for the Donoghues. This claim for relief fails on other grounds.

95The plaintiffs founded their case on Barnes v Addy (1874) LR9 ChApp 244 (""Barnes v Addy"") principles. Persons receiving trust property that they know was trust property with knowledge it was being misapplied may be liable in constructive trust on the first limb of Barnes v Addy, and persons assisting with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of trustees may be liable in constructive trust on the second limb of Barnes v Addy: see Consul Developments Pty Ltd v DPP Estates Pty Ltd (1975) 132 CLR 373 at 397 and United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International Pty Limited [1983] 2 NSWLR 157 and (1984) 156 CLR 41. Here it was accepted that the Wikramanayakes had not received the accommodation bonds, so a constructive trust liability would only arise under the second limb. 

96But a second limb Barnes v Addy case was not clearly pleaded against the Wikramanayakes. Mr Bolster on behalf of the defendants took the point that it was not pleaded, and I agree that he is correct. This is a matter on which clear pleading would have been required so that the Wikramanayakes were on notice of the precise dishonest knowledge that was alleged against them, so as to constitute their Barnes v Addy second limb liability.

97The pleading fell short of that. Prayer three of the relief claims sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' accommodation bonds paid to Plus 55 ""were held by Plus 55 on a constructive trust for and on behalf of the plaintiffs"". There was no claim for relief that sought declarations consistent with the second limb of Barnes v Addy. Moreover, after pleading the background facts the Further and Amended Statement of Claim paragraphs 15 and 16 really pleaded that the Wikramanayakes owed a fiduciary duty themselves directly to the Donoghues to ensure that the accommodation bonds were refunded to the Donoghues. This was not a Barnes v Addy second limb plea. It would be unfair in these circumstances to allow the Barnes v Addy second limb claim for relief to proceed against the defendants.

98But a Barnes v Addy second limb would have failed in any event. The Wikramanayakes did not know of any scheme by Plus 55 to breach its fiduciary duty to the Donoghues by transferring their accommodation bonds. The Wikramanayakes did not believe that they had obtained the Donoghues accommodation bonds, pursuant to Wagga Road's demands on Plus 55. They thought that the money that they received in March 2005 came from an investor, not from the Donoghues. They had no knowledge of any dishonesty on Plus 55's part in relation to the Donoghues' accommodation bonds, because they did not think they were receiving their accommodation bonds.

99The plaintiffs also contend that the Wikramanayakes must have been aware that the transfer of accommodation bonds was in breach of the basic rules set out under Aged Care Act Ch 57 that approved providers must not use accommodation bonds for purposes not related to providing aged care to care recipients, or that do not comply with the prudential requirements. But the fundamental problem with such a case is still that the Wikramanayakes did not know that the $200,000 they were receiving in March 2005 was an accommodation bond. They had no reason to suspect that the receipt of that money was a breach of the Aged Care Act at all.

100Nor did the Wikramanayakes owe the Donoghues' a fiduciary duty directly. The plaintiffs allege that the Wikramanayakes could exercise a power over Plus 55 adversely affecting the plaintiffs' entitlement to the refund of the balance of their accommodation bond. But in my view the critical feature of a fiduciary relationship is absent in this case. There is no evidence that the Wikramanayakes undertook or agreed to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of the Donoghues in the exercise of any commercial power or discretion that they had that could affect the accommodation bonds that the Donoghues had paid to Plus 55: Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41 per Mason J at 96-97. Indeed there was no communication between the Wikramanayakes and the Donoghues until well after the Donoghues paid their accommodation bonds and that was communication through their lawyers with the Donoghues making demands for a refund. Moreover the Wikramanayakes had caused Wagga Road to make commercial arrangements with Plus 55 without undertaking additional responsibility to the Donoghues. Nor does Aged Care Act Div 57 put persons such as Wagga Road or the Wikramanayakes dealing with approved care providers in the position of fiduciaries of residents of aged care facilities.

101It is not necessary on these findings for the Court to decide whether Plus 55 itself owed any fiduciary duties to the Donoghues, but in my view it is doubtful that they did. 

102For these reasons the plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty constructive claims fail.

(2) Interference with contractual relations. 

103The executrices next claim that the Wikramanayakes intended to induce or procure the breach of the Resident Agreements between Plus 55 and the Donoghues. In particular it is said that the Wikramanayakes interfered with the Donoghues' contractual rights to have the balance of their accommodation bonds refunded when they vacated Lavington Lodge.

104The executrices contend that the Wikramanayakes interfered with the essential condition in the Resident Agreement, clause D7.01(a), which provided for the Donoghues' entitlement to have the balance of their accommodation bonds refunded, once they vacated Lavington Lodge. The executrices argue that even though the Wikramanayakes were aware of the Donoghues' entitlement to a clause D7.01(a) refund, they allowed themselves to be persuaded by Mr Smith to enter the accommodation bond transfer agreement between Plus 55 and Wagga Road. 

105The executrices also contend that by the time the Donoghues paid their bonds in March 2005 the Wikramanayakes were so desperate to have the Donoghues' accommodation bonds and those of the other initial residents transferred to Wagga Road that they caused Wagga Road to demand them on 9 February 2005 (and in subsequent correspondence) ""without caring one way or another whether Plus 55 was entitled to transfer those bonds to Wagga Road"". Wagga Road wanted to discharge part of its liabilities to the NAB. The executrices say the Court should infer that between February and March 2005 when the Wikramanayakes knew that Mr Smith had misused other resident accommodation bonds to an amount of $500,000, they recklessly closed their eyes to the possible unlawfulness of their (the Wikramanayakes) claims to have Wagga Road use residents' accommodation bonds. The executrices cite the Verekers' letter of demand of 21 March 2005 and contend that Verekers were instructed ""that the defendants or their company were entitled to the Donoghues' bonds"". The executrices say that this was intentional blindness or recklessness towards the Donoghues' contractual rights under clause D7.01, not mere inadvertence or negligence and constituted the tort of interference with contractual relations.

106The parties were not in contest about the elements of the tort of inducing breach of contract or of the gravamen of the tort. The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia has concisely summarised these in Daebo Shipping Co Ltd v The Ship Go Start [2012] FCAFC 156 at [88] and [89], per Keane CJ, Rares and Besanko JJ:

88. The tort of inducing a breach of contract consists of the following elements:

(1) There must be a contract between the plaintiff (or applicant) and a third party;

(2) The defendant (or respondent) must know that such a contract exists;

(3) The defendant must know that if the third party does, or fails to do, a particular act, that conduct of the third party would be a breach of the contract; 

(4) The defendant must intend to induce or procure the third party to breach the contract by doing or failing to do that particular act;

(5) The breach must cause loss or damage to the plaintiff.

89. The gravamen of the tort is the defendant's intention to induce or procure the breach in the knowledge that such a breach will interfere with the plaintiffs' contractual rights: Allstate life Insurance co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1995] FCA 1368; (1995) 58 FCR 26 at 43A-C per Lindgren J with whom Lockhart and Tamberlin JJ agreed: Fightvision Pty Ltd v Onisforou (1999) 47 NSWLR 473 at 509-512 [159]-[171] per Sheller, Stein and Giles JJA; LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Roadvision Pty Ltd (2012) 199 FCR 204 at 212-216 [40]-[54] per Besanko J with whom Mansfield and Flick JJ agreed. As Lindgren J explained, the defendant must have ""a fairly good idea"" that the contract benefits another person in the relevant respect. He said that knowledge of the contract may be sufficient for the purpose of grounding the necessary intention to interfere with contractual rights, even though the defendant does not know the precise term that will be breached. Reckless indifference or wilful blindness can amount to knowledge for this purpose: Allstate 58 FCR at 43C-44F; Fightvision 47 NSWLR at 512 [171]; LED 199 FCR at 216 [54].

107Putting the plaintiffs' case into the language of Daebo Shipping, to make out this cause of action in tort the plaintiffs have taken on the burden of showing:

(1) that there is a contract between the Donoghues (who the plaintiffs represent as executrices) and Plus 55;

(2) that the Wikramanayakes know that such a contract exists;

(3) the Wikramanayakes must know that if Plus 55 fails to do a particular act - namely repaying the balance of the accommodation bonds to the Donoghues (or the plaintiffs) in accordance with clause D7.01 of the Resident Agreement - that act would be a breach of the Resident Agreement;

(4) the Wikramanayakes intended to induce or procure Plus 55 to breach the Resident Agreement by putting it out of Plus 55's capacity to do the act of repaying the accommodation bonds in accordance with clause D7.01; and

(5) the breach by Plus 55 must cause loss or damage to the executrices.

108The Wikramanayakes have persuasive answers to the plaintiffs' claim that they have committed the tort of interfering with contractual relations. The main difficulties for the plaintiffs lie in proving elements 4 and 5 

109Elements (1), (2) and (3). Element 1 is not in issue: there is a contract between Plus 55 and the residents of Lavington Lodge, the Resident Agreement. Although the Wikramanayakes dispute element 2, I find that it is made out. The Wikramanayakes were well aware that there was a standard Resident Agreement between Plus 55 and each resident. They had more than a ""fairly good idea"" of its terms. Their correspondence indicated that they wanted those Resident Agreement terms reproduced in Wagga Road's agreement with Plus 55. They knew in general terms from information they had received that the Donoghues were to become residents. It is a short step to infer, as I do, that the Wikramanayakes knew of the terms of the Donoghue's contract with Plus 55. But in my view they only knew of that in March 2005 after receiving information that the Donoghues had paid a deposit. The timing of this knowledge is important when analysing the Wikramanayakes' state of mind in relation to element 4 of the tort. 

110The contractual obligation, which Plus 55 might breach so as to constitute the tort, was Resident Agreement clause D7.01 - being Plus 55's obligation to repay the accommodation bonds. In my view the Wikramanayakes did know of this clause in a Resident Agreement that they had reason to believe existed with the Donoghues from March 2005.

111But the content of that clause D7.01 is important. And in relation to its content the plaintiffs have pleaded element 3 of the alleged tort of interference with contractual relations somewhat ambiguously. The alleged acts of the Wikramanayakes' wrongful interference (dealt with below in element 4) are said in Further Amended Statement of Claim paragraph 17 to be acts ""causing Plus 55 to breach its obligations to refund the balance of the plaintiffs' accommodation bonds under Schedule D in the Residential Care Agreements in contravention of s 57-21(1)(b)(i) in subdivision 57-G of the [Aged Care] Act"". Of course, Plus 55's obligation to refund the plaintiffs' accommodation bonds under the Resident Agreement clause D7.01 is different from its obligation to refund the bonds under Aged Care Act s 57-21(1)(b)(i). Plus 55's obligation under Resident Agreement clause D7.01 is one to pay only when a new resident enters the facility to replace the outgoing resident. Whereas, the statutory obligation under Aged Care Act s 57-21(1)(b)(i) is one to pay the accommodation bond balance back to the former resident merely if ""the care recipient ceases to be provided with residential care by the residential care service"" conducted by the approved provider. The crucial difference is that the obligation to repay arises: (1) under the Aged Care Act, on departure of the former resident from the facility; (2) and under clause D7.01, only when the new resident enters the facility. 

112The Aged Care Act statutory obligation on Plus 55 exists independently of contract. But that seems irrelevant to the plaintiffs' tortious claim for interference with the contractual relations in the Resident Agreement. The plaintiffs' Further Amended Statement of Claim only pleads the tort of interference with contractual relations. The pleading was not structured also to plead a cause of action in damages for contravention of the statute: cf Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd [1949] AC 398 at 407, Darling Island Stevedoring & Lighterage Co Ltd v Long (1957) 97 CLR 36, and Sovar v Henry Lane Pty Limited (1967) 116 CLR 397, at 405 (per Kitto J). And this was for good reason: such a statutory cause of action would not lie against the Wikramanayakes themselves, but would lie against the ""approved provider conducting the service"", which in this case was Plus 55. Any cause of action for damages for breach of Aged Care Act s 57-21 against the Wikramanayakes would also need to plead their actual role as accessories to Plus 55's alleged statutory contravention. In my view that is not how the plaintiffs have pleaded their case. Perhaps the pleader thought such a case would be too difficult to maintain against the Wikramanayakes as accessories. That may be right though the Court need not speculate as to this. But in these circumstances, the reference in the plaintiffs' pleading of the tort of interference with contractual relations to Aged Care Act s 57-21, seems to be mere surplusage. The only contractual obligation, which Plus 55 might conceivably have been breached to constitute the tort, was Resident Agreement clause D7.01. That therefore is how the Court will approach analysis of element 4 of the plaintiffs' claim in this tort.

113Element (4). The Further Amended Statement of Claim paragraph 17 identified the alleged acts of wrongful interference with the Donoghues' Resident Agreements as being: (1) Wagga Road entering into its contract with Plus 55 on terms giving it the right to call for the transfer of accommodation bonds that Plus 55 had received; and (2) then actually procuring Plus 55 to transfer the residents' accommodation bonds to Wagga Road. The plaintiffs allege that by both of these acts the Wikramanayakes intended to have Plus 55 breach its obligations to refund the accommodation bonds to the Donoghues. But there are several difficulties in the plaintiffs making out the relevant intent for this tort in relation to either of these allegedly wrongful acts.

114First, it was as early as April 2004 at the whiteboard meeting, or alternatively October 2004 when the lease agreement was signed (and many months before the Donoghues paid over their accommodation bonds and entered into their Resident Agreements in March 2005) that Wagga Road made its contract with Plus 55 to give Wagga Road the right to call for the transfer of accommodation bonds that Plus 55 received. I do not see how acts as early as this, and before the Donoghues' Resident Agreements were made, could show the necessary intent to procure a particular breach of a contract not yet in existence. 

115Secondly, Resident Agreement clause D7.01 contemplates (whether not that conformed to the Aged Care Act as it then stood) that the accommodation bonds would only be repayable to the Donoghues once a new resident had entered the facility and signed a new Resident Agreement with Plus 55. Thus looked at purely in contract, clause D7.01 contemplated that there would always be a source of funds to pay out the Donoghues as exiting residents. In these circumstances, I do not see how the conduct of Wagga Road asking for the Donoghues' accommodation bonds would procure Plus 55 to breach its contract with the Donoghues. There would always be a fresh accommodation bond to pay out the Donoghues, from the incoming residents, if not from elsewhere. And it is no answer to this particular deficiency in the plaintiffs' case for them to point to the Aged Care Act. The Aged Care Act does not itself change the contract the parties actually made; and the plaintiffs did not plead breach of statutory duty. 

116Thirdly, the Wikramanayakes were told that the $200,000 that Wagga Road received in March 2005 was money coming from an investor. I accept that they thought that is exactly what the funds were. They did not find out until much later that it was the Donoghues' accommodation bond money Wagga Road had received, not an investor's money. They did not ask for this sum of $200,000 as money due to them as having come from the Donoghues. I am not prepared to infer an intention on the Wikramanayakes' part to procure Plus 55 to breach its contract with the Donoghues by just asking for money, when the money they knew they had received they thought was from someone else. 

117Fourthly, it is important to focus on the time when the breach that the Wikramanayakes are alleged to be intending to procure is expected to occur. It cannot be said that either in making the Wagga Road-Plus 55 agreement or in demanding the Donoghues' bond that the Wikramanayakes must have known Plus 55 would breach clause D7.01 in the future. The Wikramanayakes would only have the requisite knowledge that such a breach would occur, if it were established that they were aware that Plus 55: (1) would have no other resources at the time of the expected repayment to honour its obligations to a particular resident under clause D7.01; and (2) would have no other way of realistically raising the funds to make the payment to the resident. 

118The executrices have not established this kind of knowledge in the Wikramanayakes. Indeed, it is inherently unlikely that the Wikramanayakes would have such knowledge. If a particular resident wanted to leave, such as for example the Donoghues in late 2005, it would be open to Wagga Road at the time to examine Plus 55's finances and to then decide whether or not to enforce the Plus 55-Wagga Road contract. Causing Wagga Road to contract with Plus 55 in October 2004, or asking for the Donoghues' bonds in about March 2005, fall well short of establishing what Wagga Road intended Plus 55 to do in October 2005 or later when, the Donoghues left, a new resident came in and Plus 55's repayment obligation to the Donoghues arose under clause D7.01. Wagga Road (and the Wikramanayakes) could then examine its own and Plus 55's overall resources to see what course would best be taken. Their conduct in asking for accommodation bonds is not obviously intended to preclude Plus 55 from taking available future measures to pay out the Donoghues. 

119Element (5). Finally I do not accept that the Wikramanayakes' conduct in contracting to receive or in just asking for accommodation bonds was what actually caused the Donoghues not to be paid. That result seems perfectly explicable on the evidence by the mutual general hostility between Wagga Road and Plus 55, leading as it did to litigation in 2007 and the deterioration in the financial position of both those companies. 

120In short, the tort of interference with contractual relations is not made out. 

(3) Trade Practices Act misleading and deceptive conduct

121The executrices say that the Wikramanayakes were knowingly involved in Wagga Road's misleading and deceptive conduct. The executrices say that Wagga Road's agreement with Plus 55 was such that Wagga Road and the Wikramanayakes must have expected that when the Donoghues entered their Resident Agreements on 18 March that the Donoghues' accommodation bond would be transferred to Wagga Road and used by Wagga Road to service its NAB facility.

122The executrices say that with this knowledge or expectation, that the Wikramanayakes refrained either from disclosing to the Donoghues or refrained from causing Wagga Road to disclose to the Donoghues that they were in a vulnerable position and may not have their bonds refunded to them in a timely manner in the future. The executrices contend that by failing to disclose to residents of Lavington Lodge the Wagga Road-Plus 55 accommodation bond or transfer arrangement, that Wagga Road contravened Trade Practices Act s 52, and that the Wikramanayakes were well aware of that contravention.

123The executrices' misleading and deceptive conduct case depends on two main circumstances: one, based on Plus 55's conduct up to March 2005; and the other based on what Wagga Road would soon have to do. First, by the time the Donoghues entered into the Resident Agreement on 18 March 2005, that the Wikramanayakes were aware that Plus 55, controlled as it was by Messrs Smith and James, had failed to account to Wagga Road for $500,000 of accommodation bonds. And so, Wagga Road and the Wikramanayakes were said to be conscious that present and future residents of Lavington Lodge were vulnerable to the loss of their accommodation bonds. After all, so the argument goes, if Wagga Road was having trouble getting an explanation from Plus 55 for what had happened to the accommodation bonds, it could be expected without more that present and future residents of Lavington Lodge would have similar problems.

124Secondly, because of Mr Smith's and Mr James' failure to account, the Wikramanayakes were very conscious, as their 9 February 2005 correspondence shows, that Wagga Road must soon act to enforce its rights against Plus 55 to have all accommodation bonds Plus 55 had received, paid over to it, in accordance with the Plus 55-Wagga Road agreement, so that the accommodation bonds could then be used to pay down Wagga Road's loan facility with the NAB. From this demand it is said that the Wikramanayakes must have been very well aware that the accommodation bonds would not be readily available in the future for the residents to call for them.

125These two circumstances are said to give rise to a reasonable expectation that before the Donoghues entered their Resident Agreement on 18 March 2005, the Wikramanayakes should have disclosed to the Donoghues that Wagga Road was asserting a right to have the accommodation bonds transferred from Plus 55, where the residents such as the Donoghues had lodged or were lodging them, over to Wagga Road. The executrices say that this disclosure should have been given to all the residents soon after the Wikramanayakes' 9 February 2005 letter and certainly before 18 March 2005.

126The authorities make clear, and the executrices accepted in argument, that it is inappropriate to speak in terms of a duty of disclosure. Rather the question is ""whether having regard to all the relevant circumstances, there had been conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive: Demagogue v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31 (""Demagogue"") at 32 per Black CJ, and see Commonwealth Bank v Mehta (1991) 23 NSWLR 84. The requirement to avoid misleading and deceptive conduct by speaking is expressed in terms of a reasonable expectation that the information in question would be disclosed rather than in terms of a duty of disclosure. In Demagogue, at 41, per Gummow J, expressed the applicable principle when agreeing with a statement of French J (as his Honour then was) in Kimberley NZI Finance Ltd v Torero Pty Limited (1989) ATPR (Digest) 46-054 at 53,195: 

If in a particular case silence would, as a matter of fact, constitute misleading or deceptive conduct, s 52 by virtue of its prohibition of such conduct imposes its own statutory duty to make disclosure. The cases in which silence may be so characterised are no doubt many and various and it would be dangerous to essay any principle by which they might be exhaustively defined. However, unless the circumstances are such as to give rise to the reasonable expectation that if some relevant fact exists it would be disclosed, it is difficult to see how mere silence could support the interference that the fact does not exist.

127The Wikramanayake's liability for misleading and deceptive conduct is said to be accessorial: that both, as directors of Wagga Road, were knowingly involved in Wagga Road's misleading and deceptive conduct in failing to provide further information to residents and specifically to the Donoghues. Although it is in dispute that accessorial liability is sufficiently pleaded, the Further Amended Statement of Claim is sufficient to make the nature of the Wikramanayakes' liability clear.

128What should have been disclosed? Reflecting the two elements above identified the executrices' case is that Wagga Road (and the Wikramanayakes) should have disclosed to residents that: Wagga Road was having problems in recovering accommodation bonds from Plus 55 and that Wagga Road's intention was to have all bonds transferred from Plus 55 and then used to satisfy Wagga Road's liabilities.

129The Wikramanayakes' have several persuasive answers to the misleading and deceptive conduct argument. First, the relationship between Wagga Road and the residents of Lavington Lodge and Plus 55 is not obviously one which calls for the disclosure which the plaintiffs have identified. Wagga Road is acting in the role of the lessor to Plus 55 and a financier of Plus 55's operations at Lavington Lodge. Wagga Road had no direct contractual relationship with any of the residents of Lavington Lodge. The evidence does not show that Wagga Road made any commitment directly to any resident about what would happen to accommodation bonds. Even if it be assumed that Wagga Road was aware that Plus 55 was not performing Plus 55's obligations to Wagga Road, that would not of itself raise in Wagga Road any obligation to correct misapprehensions that the residents might have about the way that Plus 55 was conducting its affairs. The residents of Lavington Lodge are Plus 55's customers. A financier or a lessor does not ordinarily have an obligation to tell the customers of the lessee/borrower's financial difficulties. Such a duty to disclose was put to Mr Wikramanayake, who colourfully expressed this idea in his answer, ""exactly, your Honour. I mean, my understanding, if two parties are in a commercial arrangement you can't use that knowledge to go out and bag somebody else's visit. Maybe I am looking at it too simplistically."" Thus, leaving aside the position of the Wikramanayakes, which is even more remote from the residents of Lavington Lodge than was Wagga Road, I do not see that the relationship of Wagga Road with the residents is one that in itself calls for action to correct a misleading impression being given by Plus 55. 

130Secondly, the suggested disclosure was unlikely to assist the residents of Lavington Lodge, if that is its objective. If what was to be disclosed was that Wagga Road was having trouble in ensuring Plus 55 accounted to it for accommodation bonds received, and was now seeking to ensure that bonds were paid over to it, it is certainly not obvious that all residents would want this information disclosed widely, so as to put Plus 55 and Lavington Lodge in a bad public light. It was probably in the financial interest of existing residents for Plus 55 to continue attracting future residents to the facility, so that existing residents could share the benefits of the increased economies of scale and reduced financial risk associated with the receipt of further accommodation bonds. If disclosure to new residents was perceived as ""bad news"" deterring future residents coming into Lavington Lodge, what should Wagga Road do? Should it risk potential financial harm to existing residents by disclosing this information? Should it risk potential financial harm to prospective residents by not disclosing? 

131Thirdly, part of the Wagga Road-Plus 55 arrangements had already been disclosed through the Resident Agreement Clause D7.01, which disclosure had made clear that existing residents would have their accommodation bonds reimbursed to them when bonds were received from future incoming residents. That clause itself signalled a degree of risk to persons becoming residents that should they wish to exit the facility in the future they may not get their accommodation bonds back either quickly or at all. Whilst this clause does not convey the full terms agreed between Wagga Road and Plus 55, it certainly conveys the risk of non-return of the bonds. Given this disclosure of a negative risk, it is questionable how much more disclosure was required. 

132Fourthly, the plaintiffs say that Messrs Smith and James may have misapplied the accommodation bonds that Wagga Road was entitled to receive. This is said to be information that should have been disclosed. But there are difficulties with the content of such a disclosure. So far as the Donoghues' bonds are concerned, they were in fact paid to Wagga Road, and were not misapplied, albeit misrepresented on receipt as the funds of an investor. In respect of accommodation bonds paid before the Donoghues came into Lavington Lodge, it is difficult to see why Wagga Road should risk Messrs Smith and James bringing an action for defamation against it on account of its public statements that they had misapplied funds.

133And the case for the other part of what the executrices say should have been disclosed - that the accommodation bonds were soon going to Wagga Road - has even less force. Assuming in the plaintiffs' favour, that it could be clearly established that Messrs Smith and James had misapplied some accommodation bonds to purposes unrelated to Lavington Lodge, then Wagga Road may actually have been a safer destination for the accommodation bonds than was Plus 55. It is difficult to see in those circumstances, why Wagga Road should disclose it was receiving the bonds. Wagga Road by then had substantial assets - it owned Lavington Lodge. And it was proposed to use any accommodation bonds it received to reduce its mortgage liabilities (as it did indeed with the Donoghues' accommodation bonds). 

134Fifthly, establishing a misleading and deceptive case against the Wikramanayakes is even more difficult than it is against Wagga Road. Wagga Road is not now sued in these proceedings. The Wikramanayakes are sued under Trade Practices Act 1974 s 75B, as the provision then stood, as accessories to Wagga Road's alleged misleading and deceptive conduct. Liability under the Fair Trading Act 1987 was not pleaded against them. A person will only be regarded as involved in a contravention sufficiently to attract s 75B if the person intentionally participated in the contravention, which requires actual rather than constructive knowledge of the essential matters that make up the contravention, together with a level of involvement, that may lead to a conclusion that a person had sufficient knowledge to be implicated in the contravention sufficiently to attract s 75B: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 (1985) 158 CLR 661 and Compaq Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Merry, Payes, Bunnett, Sharp, Bassat, Kras, Horman & Thomson (1998) 157 ALR 1. For the Wikramanayakes to know whether or not Wagga Road has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by reason of Wagga Road's failure to provide information to residents, the Wikramanayakes would need to know a great deal about what Plus 55 had or had not said to the residents. The evidence did not clearly establish that Mr and Mrs Wikramanayake had sufficient knowledge of the communication between Plus 55 and the residents of Lavington Lodge for the Wikramanayakes to know or even strongly suspect that a misleading impression had been left with residents. In my view the plaintiffs' case fell well short of establishing the necessary degree of knowledge on the Wikramanayakes' part, to make out a Yorke v Lucas case.

135Sixthly, reliance is a major difficulty for the plaintiffs' case. The plaintiffs must prove that Mr and Mrs Donoghue relied upon misleading and deceptive conduct in order to succeed. The two executrices were not the decision-makers who committed themselves to the Resident Agreement. Their parents would have been the natural sources of such evidence. The proceedings were commenced in 2010, some two years before Mrs Donoghues' death. No explanation is given as to why there is no evidence from her to support the inference of reliance on misleading and deceptive conduct. Mrs Donoghue could be expected to have been a decisive person: Mrs Briggs explained that her mother had business experience, had managed a hotel, and chose where she wanted to live in 2005. The absence of any evidence from the person who is said to have acted on the misleading conduct, at least to explain their decision-making processes, makes the Court cautious about inferring reliance. 

136And the inference of reliance in this case is a subtle one. The plaintiffs have to prove that Mr and Mrs Donoghue would not have proceeded had they known that Plus 55 had not accounted to Wagga Road for $500,000 and that Wagga Road wanted to enforce its rights to take the accommodation bonds. Yet, Mr Geddes had pressed advice upon Mr and Mrs Donoghue, recorded in his March 2005 letter of advice, that shows that the Donoghues were warned (paragraph 8) about there being risk that the accommodation bonds may not be repaid unless a new resident could be found to replace them. In the absence of any evidence from either Mrs Donoghue or Mr Geddes that the Donoghues were interested in the subject matter of what is now said not to have been disclosed to them. Mrs Ryan's evidence was that Mr Geddes' advice to her parents did not cover whether Plus 55 could dispose of or deal with the bonds and Mrs Ryan could not say to the best of her recollection that was a matter that concerned her mother. In these circumstances, I decline to draw the inference that either Mr or Mrs Donoghue relied upon misleading and deceptive conduct of the kind alleged. 

137Seventhly, looked at objectively with the knowledge that the Wikramanayakes had at the time, the urgency of the need to disclose information to the residents is not as obvious the plaintiffs now contend. In closing submissions Mr Van Aalst tended to suggest that Mr James and Smith had misappropriated $500,000 that had been received in accommodation bonds prior to the Donoghues' money being received. But the evidence does not go so far as to enable the Court to make any such finding. All that can be said is that Mr Smith and Mr James had failed to account to Wagga Road for accommodation bonds received. They had not admitted any misappropriation. Nor were they refusing ever to give an account. And it was certainly not clear to the Wikramanayakes that Messrs Smith and James had caused Plus 55 to pay the accommodation bonds away out of reach. One would have expected the Wikramanayakes' 9 February letter to have been even stronger if they had known such things. The Wikramanayakes were entitled to assume that the monies were still either with or within easy call of Plus 55. In a real sense the Wikramanayakes were therefore entitled to believe that the funds were closer to Plus 55 than they would have been had they actually been paid to Wagga Road. These circumstances somewhat reduce the urgency of Wagga Road or the Wikramanayakes coming to the rescue of the residents by disclosing more information to them. 

138Eighthly, it was suggested on behalf of the plaintiffs in final submissions that the Wikramanayakes should have disclosed to Mr and Mrs Donoghue that Plus 55 was in breach of the Aged Care Act by insisting in the proviso to clause D7.01 of the Resident Agreement that accommodation bonds would not be repaid until a new resident came into the facility. But there are two problems with the case so put. One, a breach of the Aged Care Act was not pleaded as part of the alleged non-disclosure. And, in any event, I do not infer that Mr and Mrs Wikramanayake were aware that clause D7.01 of the Resident Agreements was a breach of the Aged Care Act, even assuming that it was such a breach. Mr and Mrs Wikramanayake did not seem to the Court to be the kind of people who would have deliberately left themselves in breach of legislation, if they were aware of the breach. They were both practising accountants and struck the Court as both being fairly conservative and anxious not to jeopardise the value of the licence to conduct an aged care facility.

139Thus the plaintiffs' misleading and deceptive conduct case also fails.

Conclusion and Orders

140In the result each of the plaintiffs' causes of action fails. They have not been able to establish against the Wikramanayakes their constructive trust, interference with contractual relations, or misleading and deceptive conduct cases. The result therefore is that the plaintiffs' Further Amended Statement of Claim will be dismissed.

141Ordinarily costs would follow the event under Uniform Civil Procedure Rule r 42.1 ""unless it appears to the court that some other order should be made"". It may be that one or other party will seek a special costs order. But unless such an application is notified to my Associate by 2.00pm on Friday 23 August 2013, then the orders that the Court will make that day are: 

(1)Dismiss the Further Amended Statement of Claim; 

(2)Direct the parties to provide any submission that they are advised in relation to costs to the Court by 12 noon on Friday 23 August 2013; and 

(3)I note that the Court will make its costs decision in chambers without the need for any further appearance.

2762165,R v Ortiz [2013] NSWDC 282,"Sentence
1HIS HONOUR:  Armando Salinas Ortiz appears today for sentence in relation to two offences of accessory before the fact to robbery in company.  The first offence in time was committed on 30 May 2012.  It was particularised as happening at Killara, and the robbery in company was robbery in company, by persons unknown, of a man called Li Jun Wei of $200,000 worth of assorted jewellery.  I will outline the facts in relation to that matter.  
2The particulars of accessorial liability by reference to the charge are that he did, ""Incite, move, procure, counsel, hire and command the said persons"", although the liability of the prisoner is not that of the ""principal"" in the criminal scheme in which he was involved.  
3The second offence in time of accessory before the fact of robbery in command occurred at Haberfield on 12 June 2012.  The robbery in company was of two persons, Chi Ho So and Po Seng Choi of certain property, namely $750,000 worth of assorted jewellery, $20,000 in Australian currency, the property of Man King Jewellery Company Ltd of China, Chinese passports, a laptop computer and printer and a Rolex watch worth $6,000, the property of Po Seng Choi.  
4The particulars of accessorial liability are identical as to the first charge.  Again it is not the Crown case, nor could I conclude, that the prisoner was a principal in the planning and preparation, nor obviously the 'executive', of the offence given his plea to being an accessory before the fact.  
5I will deal with the facts of the matter and what flows from them in the context of other material in the case in a moment, but it goes without saying that having regard to the actual robberies in company and the very significant value of property that was stolen from particular people, that this is a serious example of accessorial liability before the fact to robbery in company, having regard to the ultimate crime that was committed.  
6Of course, as I will analyse in a moment, I cannot conclude that the prisoner knew precisely what property was to be taken in each case.  But it is clear that he must have known that there would be substantial property obtained given the degree of obvious planning that went into this, of which he was at least part, and given the fact, particularly in relation to the second charge, that he had already participated in the first count.  
7It is a matter of speculation of precisely what he knew of what occurred when the robbery in company occurred in May and what was actually stolen.  I cannot fill the gaps in the evidence with speculation.  But given his own admissions, so far as he is prepared to make admissions, he had contact with the same person in relation to the commission of both offences.  It seems to me completely beyond any understanding of human affairs, or any other excuse or explanation, that the prisoner was, on the second occasion he became an accessory before the fact, not aware of what in substance had occurred before.  
8At the end of the day it does not make any difference because he will be sentenced in accordance with the agreed facts, which very much point to the significance of his moral culpability.  It should be clearly understood, of course, that if the prisoner had been convicted of being a principal of these very serious offences, then the penalties to be imposed would have been very substantially greater than the penalties that I am imposing. 
9The prisoner at the time of the commission of the offences was, as I understand the matter, twenty-five years of age.  He was born on 14 January 1987, and thus at the beginning of 2012, on my calculation, would have turned twentyfive.  He came to Australia on 10 February 2012 with, as I understand it, some alias, because in the facts he is referred to as ""AKA Jorge Andre Prieto Torres(?)"", holding a Mexican passport, number G08316645, which he, as I would understand it, was not legally entitled to have.  
10He is a citizen of Columbia.  He has proffered the explanation, whether it is true or not I am unable to say, to a psychologist that Columbians find it difficult to come into Australia on visas.  Because of their country's reputation I assume, not that that matters at this point.  It is easier for a person from Columbia to come into Australia with a Mexican passport.  He thus, in reality, was not legally entitled to be in the country, having, I think to fairly put it, misled the Australian authorities as to his true identity and most importantly his true nationality.  
11The facts reveal that on 28 May 2012 an unknown person purchased a motor vehicle, which was a red/maroon Toyota Camry sedan from a private seller.  That registration number was WKY 519.  Another motor vehicle, which is described as having registration number VLY 731, was purchased on 30 May 2012, again by an unknown person, from a private seller in the Maroubra area.  As to the events of 30 May 2012 giving rise to the first count, the victim was in the Parramatta car park in his motor vehicle.  It is stated in the facts that the vehicle at 2.04pm, that I will shortly refer to as WKY, that is the red/maroon Toyota, entered the Westfield Shopping Centre.  The driver is unknown.  However, the front passenger was a coaccused, Horacio Javier Laguna Cantor, also known as Manuel Leonardo.  Whether this person is a Columbian or a person from Mexico, I am unable to say.  Whether this person was in Australia on the same false basis as the prisoner, I am unable to say. 
12One of the features of this case, although the prisoner of course always has a right to silence, is the prisoner has not sought to assist in any way to the filling of the gaps in the material before me.  I do not regard the version that he gave the psychologist as being a conscientious effort to fill in relevant gaps.  Many things are not referred to in that history he has given, as I will demonstrate. 
13The victim of the first robbery in company, Li Jun Wei was a businessman involved in the sale of jewellery, mainly in shopping centres, and the facts refer to him being in the Parramatta Shopping Centre up until about 4.07pm.  He had a suitcase on wheels which contained approximately $200,000 worth of assorted jewellery.  He was attending a number of jewellers in the centre, presumably to make sales.  For a period of hours CCTV footage captured the offender, in conjunction with the coaccused that I have named and another unknown male, following Mr Li around the centre.  The facts state that it appears on the CCTV that the offender is acting together with these persons and their surveillance activities.  The coaccused and unknown male on separate occasions follow Li into the male toilets of the centre. 
14The victim left Parramatta car park in his motor vehicle, followed by the vehicle WKY and the other vehicle VLY that I earlier mentioned had been purchased on 30 May.  A short time later those two vehicles were seen to enter the Rhodes Shopping Centre.  At 5.02pm the victim Li is observed to enter the Rhodes Shopping Centre car park lift.  The coaccused that I have referred to changed appearance, according to closed-circuit television.  This male was also observed to be wearing one headphone piece.  
15Whilst at Rhodes the victim, Mr Li, attended a jewellery store for the last sale of the day.  At about 5.46pm the coaccused and another male, seen earlier with the offender at Parramatta Westfield, exited the Rhodes car park lift.  Shortly before this the prisoner was observed waiting at the lift to the car park.  The victim Li entered that lift, along with the prisoner.  At 5.53pm Mr Li was observed exiting the lift and returning to his motor vehicle, but the prisoner did not exit the lift at this time.  
16Mr Li exited the Rhodes Shopping Centre car park at 6.13pm.  WKY left the car park, as did VLY.  The prisoner was not identified on CCTV footage at the Rhodes Shopping Centre after this time.  Mr Li drove to his residence in Killara, parked his car in a driveway.  He then heard a loud boom sound, whereby the driver's side window was smashed.  An unknown person reached into the vehicle and removed the keys from the vehicle's ignition.  This person commenced punching Li repeatedly to the face.  Li indicated this person had something partially covering his face.  This person was wearing darkcoloured gloves.  Then there was a second loud booming sound and at this point the victim realised the jewellery in the bag was being stolen by a second person.  When the rear vehicle window was smashed, Mr Li's assailant ceased punching him to the face and ran off.  
17Mr Li saw a darkcoloured vehicle some distance along the road on the Pacific Highway.  He suffered injuries to the corner of his eye, a cut to the left hand and pain in the back and shoulder area.  The estimated value of the stolen jewellery is $200,000.  On 6 June 2012 motor vehicle WKY 519 was located abandoned one street from the robbery.  
18The facts assert, and I quote them directly:
""By following the movements of the victim at Westfield Shopping Centre at Parramatta and then at Rhodes Shopping Centre and obtaining information of the movements of the victim, the offender assisted unknown persons by making them aware of the movements and the whereabouts of the victim, which facilitated the robbery to be committed upon the victim by the unknown persons.""
19It is conceded by the prosecution that the offender was not present at the scene at the time of the commission of the robbery.  The offender agrees that he knew the victim was a jewellery seller and that a robbery in company was to be committed against the victim by the persons unknown to the prosecution.  It is agreed by the prosecution and the offender, that the offender, whilst being aware that the victim would have in his possession assorted jewellery and cash at the time of the robbery, was unaware as to the exact amount or value of the jewellery or cash that was in fact robbed by the persons unknown to the prosecution. 
20It is clear from the extent of planning in relation to this matter and the time that it took to execute the crime, consistent with the overall degree of planning in relation to the offence, that the prisoner must have known that substantial property was to be taken.  In submissions counsel for the prisoner used the word ""significant"".  In this matter it would be a semantics, although ""substantial"" I think is sufficient for all purposes.
21So far as the second crime is concerned, it had a very similar modus operandi.  The victims attended Westfield at Burwood for selling jewellery and they arrived at Westfield in Burwood at about 12.30pm. Two motor vehicles were identified as following the victims into the car park, one was a goldcoloured Toyota Camry, registration AP 37 BK, and a bluecoloured Holden Commodore station wagon, with a registration number WTJ 691.  The victims entered the shopping centre at 12.58 pm.  CCTV footage captures the offender entering the shopping centre via the same entrance and wearing an earphone in his right ear.  At 1.07pm the offender is observed upon CCTV footage to exit the shopping centre and return to motor vehicle WTJ 691, that is the bluecoloured Holden Commodore station wagon.  
22At 1.44pm the victims left the Westfield store and returned to their vehicle.  They were followed by the vehicle with the registration AP 37 BK, that is the Toyota Camry.  They drove to Haberfield to a jewellery store.  When they stopped their vehicle the Toyota Camry, that is AP 37 BK, parked suddenly diagonally across their path.  Three persons got out of the vehicle and approached the victims.  A male described as ""skinny"", wearing a light blue hooded jumper, gloves, black reading glasses with cotton material covering his mouth, pointed a handgun at the victim passenger.  Another male person wearing a hooded jumper approached the victim driver and smashed the driver's side window with a handgun.  This male then pointed the gun at the driver.  The third male smashed the rear window of the victims' vehicle and stole two backpacks and a briefcase.  The backpacks contained $740,000 worth of assorted jewellery.  
23The man who pointed the gun at the victim passenger took the victim's Rolex wristwatch from him.  A laptop computer and printer that were in the car of the victims were also taken away.  The three unknown assailants returned to their vehicle and drove away.  The stolen property is as I have particularised from the charge.  Motor vehicle AP 37 BK was located abandoned near a nearby street.  Shards of glass were located in this vehicle as suspected as coming from the victims' vehicle.  
24The prisoner was arrested in the Ashfield area on 21 June 2012.  When he was taken to the police station he exercised his right to silence.  He was then charged for the matters before the Court.  He was subjected to forensic procedures.  The second motor vehicle which followed the victim's car at the Burwood Westfield car park, being the bluecoloured Holden Commodore sedan which the prisoner was seen in, was found abandoned in Alexandria on 8 August 2012 and subjected to a forensic examination.  The DNA profile of the offender was identified on the steering wheel and on other items. 
25The facts state:
""By following the movements of the victims at Westfield Shopping Centre at Burwood and obtaining information of the thereabouts of the victims, the offender assisted unknown persons to commit the robbery upon the victims by making them aware of the whereabouts of the victims.""
26It is conceded by the prosecution the offender was not present at the scene at the time of the commission of the robbery.  The offender agrees that he knew the victims were jewellery sellers and that a robbery in company was to be committed against the victims by the persons unknown in the prosecution.  It is agreed by the prosecution and the offender that the offender, whilst being aware that the victim would have in his possession assorted jewellery and cash at the time of the robbery, was unaware as to the exact amount of jewellery or cash that was in fact robbed by the persons unknown to the prosecution. 
27The offender maintains that he was unaware that any of the persons unknown to the prosecution who committed the robbery was going to be armed with any weapon at the time of committing the robbery, and the prosecution concedes that there is no evidence to establish that the offender had such knowledge about any weapons that the unknown persons carried. 
28In relation to that last matter, I assume that the offender asserts this through his counsel.  I am not aware of any version the prisoner has given other than the version he gave to the psychologist.  But, be that as it may, that is the state of the agreed facts, and as I said in relation to the first count the prisoner must have known that substantial property was to be stolen.  The exact amount of course he did not know, but he knew, as with the first charge, that the victim or victims intended for the robbery were jewellery salespeople and of course he had been involved in the previous robbery. 
29In relation to the criminal history of the prisoner, he has no relevant criminal convictions in Australia.  A finding of guilt for which he received an order under s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 appears on his record.  That is irrelevant.  I am informed as far as the prosecution is aware he has no convictions in Columbia or Mexico. 
30He has been in custody since his arrest on 21 June and the effective sentences will date from that date.  He did give evidence before this Court, as I have earlier mentioned.  He did not participate in an interview with police.  What has been tendered on his behalf is a report from a consultant forensic psychologist, Dr Peter Ashkar, dated 20 August 2013.
31I have been confronted in the course of submissions with some propositions about the evidentiary value of what is contained within the report which cannot be accepted.
32Firstly, I cannot accept the proposition that because the prisoner said something it must be accepted because there is no evidence to contradict it.  That general submission is, with respect, misconceived.  I am prepared to accept those matters that to my mind amount to admissions against interest and in that regard I accept the fact that the prisoner had contact with a Spanish speaking person who was commonly concerned with the commission, in one way or another, of both offences.  But as to the prisoner's account of what he was paid and how he was recruited, I cannot accept the version that he has given.
33In relation to that aspect of the matter, I do not accept the version he has given of his involvement in the offence beyond what is in the agreed facts for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the prisoner has never given a version before he gave the version to the psychologist.  He has not given any evidence to adopt the version given to the psychologist and been subject of the test of crossexamination.  What he has told the psychologist about the matter involves a bare minimum of information and there are many things that he has either chosen to, or not bothered to, provide information about.
34In relation to what the psychologist has recorded, I note para 8 of the report.  
""Mr Torres, his employer, instructed him to follow the first victim's car on 30 May 2012, which he did.  His employer also instructed him to follow the first victim through the Parramatta Shopping Centre on that day, which he did.  'They told me to keep an eye on him and follow him and report what he was doing on the phone.'""  
35I pause for a moment.  That is the account given as to his involvement on 30 May.  It says nothing about his presence at the other shopping centre, the Rhodes Shopping Centre on that occasion.  
36The only attributable account given by the prisoner in relation to the second robbery is, ""Mr Torres, his employer, instructed him to follow the second victim's car on 12 June 2012, which he did.""  That version is painfully inadequate in explaining what is set out in the facts which I have quoted.  There is no reference to the earpiece that is referred to in the facts, no reference to the prisoner's presence within the shopping centre.  The truth of the matter is that the version that the prison has given in relation to his involvement in this offending to the psychologist is very much of the category of ""confess and avoid.""  
37Of course, as I said earlier, I cannot fill gaps in the evidence conveniently left behind by the prisoner, with respect, with speculation.  But if the prisoner is asserting, as is counsel suggests, that his only involvement in this robbery was as part of his employment of being paid $500 per week to be a driver for an unknown person that the prisoner is not prepared to name, then I do not accept that account.  What is the truth of the matter, what he was paid, if anything, I cannot conclude in the absence of evidence.
38With regard to his personal circumstances, he has told the psychologist that he was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia.  He claimed a happy childhood.  He has five brothers between thirty-four and twenty-two.  He has two brothers living in the United States.  He has no family in Australia.  He says his parents are aged in their fifties.  His mother works at home and his father is a construction worker.  He claims that he is very close to his family and he misses them terribly, and he speaks to his mother on the telephone every day.  His parents are very sad and concerned about his legal situation.  He said that ""my mother has become ill because I am in gaol.  She is depressed, sad.  I call her and all she does is cry.""  He had a relationship with a woman in Australia.  That is now over.  He has no children.  Whether any of those details are true or not, I am unable to say.  They are uncontroversial.  They may be true.  It is impossible to judge the matter based upon a hearsay account that is untested.  
39No request has been made by the prisoner for a report from the Probation and Parole Service for any information he could provide to the Probation and Parole Service to be verified.  That is his right.
40He completed secondary school in Colombia he said in 2003 and entered university, studied for eighteen months but discontinued his studies in 2005, he said because of limited finances.  He made some money selling clothes sent to him by his brothers in the United States.  
41He claims not to use illicit substances.  He tried cannabis once but did not like it.  He reported occasional alcohol use, occasional binge drinking in social circumstances.  He denied having a problem with this substance.  So there is no background of drug addiction or dependency, alcohol addiction or dependency that is causally connected to the offending, nor is there any mental disability or mental illness.  He has no history of mental illness, he has no history of self-harming.  He has no medication of significance, apparently taking some medication for acne.  He has an aunt who has lupus.  
42The assessment of the psychologist, which of course is not a medical diagnosis, reflects upon reactive ""significant symptoms of anxiety and depression,"" but the psychologist, to be fair, says ""they are a normal response to his legal circumstances,"" although his mental state will need to be monitored.
43In relation to psychometric assessment, the report is unimpressive.  Paragraph 12 states: ""Abbreviated assessment of Mr Torres's non-verbal intellectual functioning placed him in the ""low average to average"" range of twenty-first percentile, ie better than twenty per cent of the population.""  Apart from the sparse detail of that passage, there is no other information beyond the footnote.  ""He completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence subtests, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale subtests.""  I am prepared to accept on the assessment that he is performing at what is described as ""better than twenty per cent of the population.""  I am not fully informed as to whether it is twenty per cent of the population of his profile or twenty per cent of the general population.  
44There was a submission made that he was in the lower level of intellectual functioning.  He is a long way away from having a psychological disability.  It was suggested that he was ""vulnerable"" because of what was described as his ""low intelligence.""  In the context of not being able to decide or know with any confidence what the true situation is as far as his involvement in the offence, I could not be satisfied that his supposed lower level of functioning which is, as I said, far away from borderline, contributed or not to his involvement in the commission of this offence.
45Certainly nothing in the evidence available, nor in any submission that was made, would cause the Court to consider those principles that are summarised in cases such as Hemsley and De La Rosa, where a mental disability might operate to diminish the weight to be given to general deterrence.  Although, of course, there are other considerations in such a case.  In any event none of those matters were adverted to, nor could they reasonably arise on the evidence.
46The prisoner did give an account to the psychologist that when he came to Australia he came here on a Mexican passport because it was ""very difficult to obtain an Australian visa on a Colombian passport"".  I must confess I find that all rather suspicious.  Of course, I am not sentencing the prisoner for being part of a drug cartel, or anything of the sort.  But I find it difficult to understand how he could come to Australia with an expectation of learning an English language when he did not speak any English at all, and only $3,000 in his pocket. 
47He said to the psychologist that he ""paid a deposit of $1,000 to enrol in an English language course, but was unable to commence the course until he paid the balance of $7,000"".  No evidence has been produced to support that assertion, it may be true, it may not be true.  
48He claimed that he looked for work quite constantly, but nobody was prepared to employ him without English.  He quickly started to run out of money.  Again this may be true, it may not be true.  I get back to the confident submission made that because the prisoner has made an assertion - I am bound to accept it.  One might have thought that some of the matters to which he adverted in his report could have been supported by at least some documentation.  But no documentation has come forward.
49Although I have considerable doubts about his version and I approach it with some circumspection, I am prepared to accept that the prisoner at the time of his involvement in these offences was in some financial difficulty.  These offences, as I have earlier pointed out, were well planned offences.  
50There were cars obtained that were subsequently abandoned.  There were people, including the prisoner at one stage, wearing ear pieces, there were a number of people involved.  The professionalism, and to some extent the cold hearted brutality of the commission of the offences, particularly the first offence, speak of the principles involved in the commission of the robberies being skilled professionals, certainly a far cry from amateurs.
51I am mindful of the fact the prisoner is pleading guilty as an accessory before the fact.  I am mindful of the fact that on the facts available to me I could not conclude that the prisoner was the principal planner of what occurred, he was a person obviously employed to perform a limited function to enable others, most importantly on the agreed facts, to carry out a robbery that he expected to be committed against people that he knew were selling jewellery.
52It is true, as a number of authorities have pointed out, that an accessory is not necessarily less culpable than a principal.  Sometimes an accessory can be more culpable than a principal, particularly where the accessory instigates and plans a particular crime (R v Norman, R v Olivieri [2007] NSWSC 142 at [30]).  
53There is no evidence upon which I could conclude that this prisoner instigated or planned these crimes.  He was, however, involved in the planning and obviously played an important role in providing information to others to enable them to commit the crime.  I have concluded the prisoner is not as culpable as those that actually committed the principal crime.  I have got no way of knowing whether, if put in the same position, the prisoner could have committed the principal crime.  He certainly by his plea has acknowledged that the principal crime was to be committed, and he did what is set out in the facts in the knowledge that that was to occur.  Thus, clearly he had an important role to play.  He is not as culpable without knowing the full facts in relation to co-offenders.  There is only one co-offender charged, as I understand it.
54As to the extent of any financial reward he was to receive I cannot say.  With respect I find the assertion that he made that involvement in these two robberies was part of some employment at $500 a week driving somebody around completely absurd.  In any event he has not chosen to give evidence about it, it cannot be tested.
55There are a number of authorities that deal with the circumspection that courts must exercise in dealing with histories that are given to psychologists.  On a number of occasions in this Court people turn up with psychological reports, they are tendered, sometimes over objection from the Crown, and bold assertions are made that one can act upon what is asserted by the prisoner in circumstances where the information provided by the prisoner is untested and not supported by other evidence that might otherwise be available.
56Of course, I have had regard to the conclusions of the psychologist.  They are conclusions that are not particularly revelatory.  Assuming for the moment even that the prisoner has told him the truth about his own personal circumstances, I would expect the prisoner to be experiencing significant symptoms of anxiety and depression as a reaction to his current situation, but in the absence of any history of mental illness it is clear that those aspects of the matter are related to his current situation, as the psychologist makes clear.
57In the course of submissions I discussed a number of matters with learned counsel for the prisoner.  In relation to the matters raised by counsel I accept ultimately on analysis that there are a number of matters about which one could be highly suspicious that are not established if they be matters in aggravation beyond reasonable doubt.  
58It is clear that his role in the planning of this matter was ""limited"".  Although I don't accept the submission of ""very limited"", whatever that could mean in the circumstances as I understand them from the agreed facts.  I have already pointed to the fact that I do not find that the prisoner was a principal in the planning and the execution of the robbery.
59Having said that of course, having regard to the facts, and the involvement of the prisoner, I am satisfied that the prisoner knew that these were planned criminal activities and that is, as such, an aggravating factor.  However, the facts speak for themselves for the precision and planning involved in the commission of these crimes.  
60The victims in each case were chosen at vulnerable moments when they least expected it.  They were clearly targeted.  They obviously - although I do not say that the prisoner knew this - were people that had been targeted some time before.  Obviously there was some knowledge available to somebody that these people were in the business of selling jewellery, and there was - if not by the prisoner before the event - an expectation by the principals that substantially valued property would be obtained, and clearly after the first robbery the principals would have known that to be so.
61I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that I can draw an inference at the very least that the prisoner committed the offence for financial gain.  On the other hand I point out that crimes such as this are always, as a matter of rule, committed for financial gain.  The prisoner is not a member of the Red Brigade, or some other political organisation committing serious robberies for political purposes.  The prisoner is committing this crime in league with others, at the direction of others, knowing that a robbery was to be committed, and it is clear that the robbery was not committed for, and the prisoner's involvement in the planning of it was not concerned with what could be called altruistic purposes.
62There is one other important aggravating factor that arises in relation to this matter and that is that there was substantial loss occasioned.  None of the property that has been stolen has been recovered.  I appreciate, of course, that others almost certainly were responsible for on-selling the jewellery or secreting it and the like, given what I have found as to be the prisoner's involvement in the planning.  But his knowledge of the fact that a robbery was to be conducted in the context of being an accessory before the fact contributed of course at least indirectly to the very, very substantial loss occasioned to both victims.  Whether they were insured or not, I do not know.  It does not matter.  It seems to me, and it is no criticism of the victims, that taking around Sydney that substantial amount of jewellery should involve the presence of a licensed armed guards.  
63With regard to mitigating factors there are few.  The prisoner was a person of good character I am prepared to conclude at least in relation to the first offence.  Admittedly he had not been convicted of anything by the time he committed the offence but he had already committed he knew the earlier offence, but I am prepared to accept he was a person generally of good character.  I also accept that he did not have a record of previous convictions.  However, in the circumstances of the matter, bereft of reliable information about this prospects or his background, I am unable to conclude that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation.  I note his age.  He is twenty-six or twenty-seven now, but that is the age of a mature person.  He did express regret to the psychologist and I have noted that but I could not conclude having regard to s 21A(3)(i) that the prisoner has demonstrated remorse because he has not provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions beyond the account he gave the psychologist which is painfully incomplete.  He has failed to provide any information that could lead to the identity of other people and he has not adequately in my view acknowledge the relevant loss or injury or damage suffered by the various victims.  
64The plea of guilty is a mitigating factor.  The prisoner however gets a discount of 25 percent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for each offence to represent the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton.  The submissions of his counsel I have averted to in the course of a number of the matters I have summarised.  I have taken into account all of the submissions she has made on his behalf.  I do not believe there is a need to particularly refer to any other matter. 
65The Crown in its submissions properly addressed the fact as it must be in this case that notwithstanding the criminal history of the prisoner, the crimes are of considerable seriousness and thus given the character of the robberies ultimately committed and the prisoner's role in them, general deterrence is an important consideration in sentencing.  Personal deterrence is also an important matter, although I appreciate the prisoner, when he has served his sentence, will be deported back to Columbia and will never be allowed to return to Australia unless he comes back on another false passport.  There is a need to denounce his conduct and to make him accountable for his actions.  There is a need notwithstanding the fact he is a foreign national and will be deported to promote his rehabilitation.  At the end of the day the purposes of sentencing that arise under s 3A and I have only mentioned some of them, are like signposts as was said in the decision of the High Court in Veen (No 2).  They were signposts that sometimes point in opposing directions.  I am mindful of the fact that I cannot conclude that the prisoner is part of organised criminal activity.  If the prisoner was recruited out of his financial difficulties it may mean that his capacity to rehabilitate himself in the future will be enhanced.  If the prisoner is a person with entrenched criminal proclivities, notwithstanding the absence of criminal history and has associates with entrenched criminal proclivities his progress or rehabilitation will be of course limited.
66In relation to s 3A I obviously thus have regard to that section.  Reference was made in the course of submissions to the guideline judgment of Henry, the guideline judgment of Court of Criminal Appeal was handed down in 1998 or 1999, it is reported at (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.  It has been held in a number of authorities that the Henry guideline is equally applicable to the offence of robbery in company, which has the same maximum penalty as the offence of armed robbery and I note authorities such as Murchie [1999] NSWCCA 424, Lesi [2004] NSWCCA 63 amongst others.  The decision of Stanley [2003] NSWCCA [233] held that the seven considerations enumerated by the learned Chief Justice in Henry, at [162], apply mutatis mutandis to the s 97 assault in robbery and assault with intent to rob offences.  The prisoner, I appreciate, is pleading guilty to being an accessory before the fact, but I have already dealt with that matter.  
67It is to be fairly said, by reference to the principal offence, given the prisoner's lesser moral culpability as I have identified, that the guideline if I could use that expression which his Honour settled upon in respect of the matter of sentences generally falling between four and five years, was concerned with offending a world away from the particular offences with which I am concerned.  The guideline was fixed as a guideline, not a tram line, by regard to a profile involving a young offender, using a weapon capable of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm.  I appreciate the prisoner had no knowledge of the use of weapons, with limited degree of planning, with small amount taken and a plea of guilty the significance of which is limited by a strong case, et cetera.  Of course one should bear in mind that Henry was decided before Thomson and Houlton.  A number of the observations there need to be considered in light of the subsequent guideline.  I appreciate the victims themselves were not ""vulnerable"" people.  They were business people who it must be said perhaps without being too critical, were foolish in not having adequate security protection.  I cannot understand how someone could be dragging over $700,000 worth of jewellery around Sydney and not have some form of security protection.  But, be that as it may, they are entitled to the protection of the law and the protection of the law requires for those found guilty of involvement in the robbery in due course condign punishment to be imposed.
68In relation to the guideline I have taken it into account.  I have made allowance for the prisoner's legal culpability as an accessory before the fact in the circumstances I have outlined.  
69But even making that allowance he has admitted to very substantial criminality within the context of he being less liable than others, including those that recruited him.
70In relation to this matter the principles set out in the High Court majority in Pearce v R [1998] 194 CLR 610 particularly at [45] arise.  I am required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence than by regard to the totality of the criminality determine the appropriate degree of concurrency and or accumulation.  Having regard to the sequence of events that the first offence was less serious than the second offence and that the prisoner having committed the second offence in the knowledge that he had already committed the first offence, I have determined that a greater sentence should be imposed for the second offence than the first offence, primarily for those reasons.  I have also considered that there must be some partial accumulation which is not disputed by the Crown or the defence.  
71The Crown has submitted quite properly that a term of fulltime custody must be imposed.  I have had regard to s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and clearly no other penalty but fulltime imprisonment must be imposed.  I have had regard to what has been put on behalf of the prisoner about his isolation from his family.  Courts of course are not required to express sympathy for this situation, but I certainly understand the difficulties for the prisoner.  Although they are very much self imposed.  But having said that this prisoner is not quite in the same category an offender who, for example, is knowingly involved in the importation of drugs and comes to the is country to commit crimes against its laws.  There is no evidence upon which I can conclude that the prisoner came to this country with a view to committing crime.  It may be correct to say that he came here to start a new life or to advance his life beyond some situation of deprivation in Columbia.  But, of course, as I have said earlier, one could not just act on the prisoner's say so of relevant matters when one realises how much information he has withheld of a material character in relation to his own offending.
72Having regard to Pearce principles I have determined as I have foreshadowed earlier that there should be some partial accumulation, in my view that should be the extent of eighteen months.  I have determined that the starting point of any sentence in relation to the first offence in time should be five years with a discount of 25 percent that sentence will be three years nine months and it will date from 21 June 2012.  In relation to the second offence in time the starting point is seven years with a discount of 25 percent.  On my calculation that amounts to a sentence of five years three months and that will date from 21 December 2013.  I shall move to the formal orders.  If you could stand up please Mr Ortiz.
73In relation to the offence committed in May 2012 you are convicted.  You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years nine months.  That sentence will date from 21 June 2012 and will expire on 20 March 2016.  I decline to fix a non-parole period in relation to that offence because that sentence will be absorbed by the sentence I impose in relation to the offence committed in June 2012.  
74In relation to that offence you are convicted.  You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years three months.  That will date from 21 December 2013.  On my calculation the balance of sentence will expire on 20 March 2019.  In relation to that sentence I fix a non-parole period of two years and six months.  That will date from 21 December 2013 and expire on 20 June 2016.  Thus the total sentence I impose is six years nine months with a non-parole period of four years all effectively dating from 21 June 2012.  
75I have made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The special circumstances are that the second sentence is partially accumulative upon the first and I am only required to fix a non-parole period for the second sentence.  I accept that you will need an extended period of supervision to adjust to community living.  I also accept in the context of fixing the appropriate penalties and the fixing of a non-parole period that this is your first time in prison custody.  You will suffer hardships in custody arising out of your lack of English, although that will improve over the years to come, and from being separated from your family and culture.  Of course, the law is that in relation to foreign nationals, who are to be deported as you will be, the Court is still required in sentencing you to fix a non-parole period and to give consideration to your non-parole period, as I would to an Australian citizen or any other person living in Australia where such consideration can be given on the evidence.  Thus, all things considered as I said I have made a finding of special circumstances which includes considerations of matters that go simply beyond the partial accumulation of sentence.
76Yes Mr Crown are there any technical matters from you?
77KANAKARATIVE:  No your Honour.
78HIS HONOUR:  Ms Mayne are there any technical matters from you?
79MAYNE:  No your Honour.
80KANAKARATIVE:  Yes your Honour, I agree.
81HIS HONOUR:  Mr Ortiz do you understand the length of the sentence?
82INTERPRETER:  Six years and nine months.
83HIS HONOUR:  Do you understand the length of the non-parole period, what is it?
84INTERPRETER:  No I don't.  
85HIS HONOUR:  Well it's four years effectively from 21 June 2012 the date you came into custody.  That means on 20 June 2016 you become eligible to be released to parole.  You may or may not be released to parole.  That will be a matter for the Parole Authority.  When you're released to parole you'll be taken to a detention centre, perhaps Villawood if it exists or some other place and in due course when the arrangements can be made you'll be put on a plane and flown back to your country of birth or origin I'm not sure.  
86Just one matter before I leave it.  I hadn't forgotten it but I read the statistics that were provided to me.  They're almost of no assistance.  They're concerned with a total of twenty-two cases of which seven involved terms of imprisonment.  Terms of imprisonment for five cases varied between twelve months and forty-two months for offenders convicted of aid and abet, accessory before robbery armed or in company.  I have no knowledge of the facts in relation to the various matters or the objective seriousness of those matters by comparison as the learned Chief Justice said in 1998 the value of statistics will vary but with score samples and without facts in relation to other offences they merely provide the very barest assistance and certainly these statistics are of no assistance in a real sense whatsoever.  The critical issue in this matter of course is the maximum penalty for the crime in question and assessment of the prisoner's responsibility within the range of conduct anticipated by the legislature.  The other matter I think I should advert to before I discharge the prisoner is the - no I think I've dealt with everything I need to deal with in the circumstances I'm confronted with.  Yes thank you very much Mr Ortiz.  Ma'am thank you very much for assisting us in this matter.  You're excused Mr Ortiz.  Do you want to speak to your client with the benefit of the interpreter?
87MAYNE:  With the benefit of the interpreter your Honour.
88HIS HONOUR:  Here or downstairs.
89MAYNE:  I don't know if the interpreter will come downstairs with me.

		20 February 2014",2013-08-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762184,R v Grogan (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1193,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Mr Smith, counsel for the accused, objected to three items of evidence that the Crown says is admissible pursuant to s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (maker unavailable hearsay).  I have given rulings on the objections.  These are my reasons for those rulings.
Background
2The Crown case is that the accused assaulted Mr Alan Henry in his home on 10 January 2012.  Mr Henry sustained significant head injuries from which he died a little over 3 months later. 
3Mr Henry lived by himself in a house in Gregson Street, Gloucester.  In mid-2010 he formed a friendship with Ms Natasha Slacke.  Ms Slacke lived in Port Stephens but would often travel to Gloucester and see Mr Henry.  She did chores for him and received payment in return.  In late 2010 or early 2011, Ms Slacke formed a relationship with the accused.  She continued with her trips to Gloucester to see Mr Henry but was accompanied by the accused.
4Mr Henry was hospitalised for about two weeks in mid-2011 to undergo eye surgery.  He returned home on 5 July 2011. The accused and Ms Slacke lived in his home while he was in hospital.  The Crown intends to adduce evidence to the effect that there was a big argument around this time and Mr Henry evicted the accused and Ms Slacke.  This argument was overheard by a neighbour.
Evidence of previous threats by the accused to bash the deceased
5Ms Marcia Northen was a close friend of Ms Lynne Cribb, Mr Henry's partner. Ms Cribb passed away in early 2010 but Ms Northen maintained a friendship with Mr Henry.  She visited him frequently.
6According to a statement made by Ms Northen on 21 March 2012, she visited Mr Henry at his home after he came home from hospital.  She set out in the statement certain conversations she had with him and observations she made in the house (certain property was missing).   Ms Northen then stated that ""after this incident"" (presumably the visit when he came home from hospital) she continued to visit Mr Henry.  The statement continued:
17.  Other times I would visit Alan, Alan would tell me how Jason [the accused] had been threatening to bash him over the phone.  Alan said to me a number of times, ""Jason is gunna come and bash me because Natasha has been staying with me.""  
7Later in the statement Ms Northen referred to an occasion ""about two months after Alan was assaulted"" when Mr Henry packed up the clothing and belongings of the accused and Ms Slacke that were within the house and put them on the veranda.  He also changed the lock to the front screen door.  In her evidence on the voir dire, Ms Northen corrected that portion of her statement by saying that ""two months after"" should be ""two months before"".  The correction makes sense.
8In paragraph 11 of her statement, Ms Northen placed the occasion of Mr Henry being in hospital as being ""a few months prior to Christmas 2011"".  She said in her evidence on the voir dire that the occasion of him packing up the clothing was about two weeks after he came home.  I referred earlier to the fact that Mr Henry came home following his discharge from hospital on 5 July 2011.
9Ms Northen said that she visited Mr Henry on the second day after his return from hospital.  It was then that he first told her of the accused having threatened to ""come and bash me because Natasha has been staying with me"".   The threat had been conveyed to Mr Henry in a telephone conversation.  But Ms Northen said that Mr Henry did not say on that occasion when the conversation had taken place.  But the next time Ms Northen visited Mr Henry he said that in a telephone conversation the previous day, the accused had repeated the threat.
10Ms Northen said that Mr Henry had told her of these threats ""a couple of times"" and that he had not elaborated upon the threats; she said, ""that's all he told me"".
11In cross-examination, Ms Northen agreed, in effect, that Mr Henry regularly consumed alcohol.  Some of the conversations she had when he spoke about the threats of a bashing from Jason occurred when he was intoxicated and some when he was sober; but more often when he was intoxicated. 
Submissions
12The Crown Prosecutor explained that the relevance of this evidence is that when the accused went to Mr Henry's home on 10 January 2012, it was not in the context of the two having an amicable relationship.  It was in the context of the accused knowing that he would not be welcome.  This was particularly relevant in the light of certain responses given by the accused in a police interview of 17 January 2012.  
13In that interview, the accused conceded that he went to Mr Henry's home at a time consistent with when the Crown alleges Mr Henry was assaulted.  He described a fairly amicable conversation; for example (Q. 97):
I just went up, I knocked on the door, I was talking to Al there, he said, ""Oh what are you doing here?""  I said, ""Oh, Tash [Natasha Slacke] is just down there at the car"".  I said, ""She's got Tigger [her dog]"".  I said, ""I've just come up here to see if you're home"". 
14He was asked how Mr Henry was at this time and he said (Q.105):
Oh, bubbly and like he normally is.
15The evidence of Ms Northen, and other evidence to be mentioned shortly, was said by the Crown Prosecutor to be relevant to show that the true situation was the opposite of what the accused portrayed to the police.  It should also be seen in the context of evidence that I have previously ruled admissible; evidence to the effect that immediately prior to going to the deceased's home the accused was in a state that could be described as hostile, volatile and aggressive.
16The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence was relevant and admissible pursuant to either of ss 65(2)(b) or (c) of the Evidence Act.  
65   Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available(2)  The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation: 
(b)  was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or
(c)  was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable
17The evidence was about a representation of an event that occurred a short time before the representation was made.  It was unlikely to be fabricated, regardless of whether Mr Henry was sober or intoxicated, particularly given that its substance had been repeated.  There was no advantage to Mr Henry in fabricating such an assertion.  Ms Northen was a confidante, a person to whom Mr Henry would logically confide in.  It was submitted that Ms Northen's evidence was reliable, something that enhanced the probative value of the evidence (cf R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228).  The probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice.
18Mr Smith submitted that the evidence was not at all clear about the timing of events such that it could be said that the ""shortly after"" aspect of s 65(2)(b) could be satisfied, and that the Crown bore the onus of proving this temporal requirement.  That may be so in relation to the first occasion Ms Northen spoke of but there was at least one subsequent occasion in which the representation was made the day after the occurrence of the fact asserted.
19It was also submitted that there could be no confidence that the representation was unlikely to be fabricated, given that it was made at a time when Mr Henry was in conflict with the accused who had been ejected from his house.  It was suggested that this had a bearing on both the question of possible fabrication and, in the context of s 65(2)(c), reliability.  Also relevant to both limbs of s 65(2) relied upon by the Crown was the question of Mr Henry being intoxicated at the time of making most of the representations to Ms Northen.
20There was a danger of unfair prejudice, if the jury accepted Ms Northen's evidence, in that they would reason that because the accused had threatened Mr Henry on a prior occasion, or occasions, he was more likely to have carried out such a threat on 10 January 2012.  But, Mr Smith submitted, there was a period of about 6 months between threats being made after Mr Henry came home from hospital and the accused had been in the vicinity of his home in that period and nothing untoward had happened.
21Moreover, the evidence carried with it vagueness as to time; Mr Henry could have been intoxicated; and he also could have been in a heightened emotional state, having ejected the accused and Ms Slacke from his home.
22Mr Smith submitted that he would be unable to test when the telephone conversations occurred; whether the deceased was intoxicated, and, if so, the degree to which he was; and the degree of animus he held towards the accused.  In other words, the Crown's contentions based upon the evidence were impossible to test and the jury would be unable to properly evaluate the worth of the evidence.  Accordingly, there was a risk that the jury could misuse the evidence by giving it more weight than it may properly deserve.
Determination
23The evidence is relevant and it does come within s 65(2)(b).  
24But its probative value is minimal, given the time that had elapsed between the making of the threats and the events of 10 January 2012.  In that time the accused had been in the vicinity of Mr Henry's home on a number of occasions and had done nothing to make good his threats.  In these circumstances, the threats could say very little about the accused's state of mind on 10 January 2012.
25With minimal probative value it takes very little in terms of unfair prejudice to tip the balance to the point where the evidence must be excluded.  I acknowledge that with maker unavailable hearsay there is always an inability for the opposing party to fully test the evidence.  That is the reason why there is provision in s 165 of the Evidence Act for a trial judge to warn the jury that such evidence may be unreliable.  But in this case it is difficult to determine just how unreliable the evidence may be.
26For these reasons I was satisfied the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence and so it had to be excluded. 
Evidence of what the deceased said about the accused shortly before the accused went to the deceased's home
27Senior Constable Broadley spoke with Mr Henry by telephone in a call initiated at 5.07pm on 10 January 2012.  The accused was at Mr Henry's home a very short time after that.  The conversation was concerned with whether Mr Henry was happy to have Ms Slacke stay with him.  Mr Henry told the officer:
Yeah that's fine, as long as her boyfriend's not with her.  He's an absolute arsehole and isn't welcome here.
28Mr Smith conceded the relevance of Mr Henry saying that the accused was not welcome but objected to the description of him being ""an absolute arsehole"".  No submission was made that the provisions of s 65 were not engaged; that is, it was not contended that the evidence was not theoretically admissible.
29But in relation to s 137 it was submitted that the call was just under 3 minutes in length and was mostly concerned with conversation between Ms Slacke and Mr Henry.  It was not known what was said in that part of the call.  This was moments after a violent argument had occurred between the accused and Ms Slacke at the Caltex service station in Gloucester (about 250 metres from Mr Henry's home) which was the reason for Senior Constable Broadley's attendance.  It was possible that Ms Slacke had told Mr Henry something about that incident and that Mr Henry had taken exception to the accused's conduct and that it was this that prompted his remark to Senior Constable Broadley.
30In my view, it matters not what prompted Mr Henry to say what he did.  The fact is that he was expressing in emphatic terms his opposition to the accused coming to his home.  The term ""absolute arsehole"" is obviously derogatory, but it emphasises how strident Mr Henry was in his attitude towards the accused.  This evidence should be available to the jury to compare with what the accused portrayed to the police as to Mr Henry's response to his attendance at the home a short time after the conversation with Senior Constable Broadley.  If the jury infer from what Mr Henry said to the officer that he would not welcome the accused in his home, they could also infer that if the accused arrived, unannounced, at his back door, the meeting of the two would have been far from amicable. Combining this with evidence that a very short time before going to Mr Henry's home the accused was in a hostile and aggressive state of mind, the jury may more readily accept the Crown's contention that violence ensued.
31I was not persuaded that any danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of this evidence.  Consequently I ruled that it was admissible.
Evidence of what the deceased's late brother told the police about the appearance of the deceased's home
32The deceased's brother, Mr Richard Henry, was at the deceased's home on the morning of 10 January 2012.  He left and caught a train to Sydney.  Sometime during the evening of 10 January 2012, the police secured the house as a crime scene.  It remained locked and was only accessed by investigating officers.  
33Mr Richard Henry inspected the home on 19 January 2012 at the request of the police.  He then made a statement to police in which he set out certain things that were not as they were on 10 January.  They included that a mirror was damaged; a teddy bear was on the floor in the rear sunroom which normally was sitting on an esky next to the back door; and there were a number of glasses lying on the dining table, one of which was broken.  
34Mr Richard Henry, sadly, has since passed away.  The Crown proposes to adduce evidence of what Mr Henry said in his statement of 19 January 2012.  
35The Crown Prosecutor referred to what the accused had told the police in his two interviews.  In the first, on 17 January 2012, he maintained that he spoke to Mr Henry at the back door and did not enter the house at all.  In the second, on 4 May 2012, he conceded that he did enter but only the rear sunroom.  But two of the three items in disarray noted by Mr Richard Henry were further inside the home and proximate to where Mr Henry was found lying on the floor.  This was said to be relevant in two respects.  First, that there was an incident involving violence in the home and it was not a case of Mr Henry having simply injured himself in a fall (as the co-accused Natasha Slacke sought to portray to police).  Secondly, that the accused must have gone further into the house and that what he said in his two interviews was untruthful.
36Mr Smith did not contend that the evidence was not theoretically admissible pursuant to s 65.  Again, the objection was based upon s 137.  It was submitted that the Crown could not exclude as a reasonable possibility that the three items came to be as they were seen by Mr Richard Henry as a result of activity after the alleged offence but not involving the accused.  The probative value was minimal and it was outweighed by the danger of the jury reasoning that the damage to the mirror, the state of the glasses on the dining table, and the knocking of the teddy bear off the esky and onto the floor were a result of something the accused did, in circumstances in which there was an alternative explanation.
37An alternative submission was that evidence concerning the mirror should be excluded because of the choice of words used by Mr Richard Henry in the last sentence of the following paragraph of the statement:
The entrance into the dining room/kitchen area from the lounge room is a square archway.  On the architrave to that entrance archway is a mirror with the NRL Balmain Tigers symbol etched into it.  Both Alan and I are Balmain supporters and I have seen that mirror many times.  I saw that the edge of the mirror where the frame is was broken away on the right hand side.  Again, this was not like that the last time that I saw it which would have been Tuesday.  I would have noticed if there was anything wrong with that mirror.
38I indicated at the time of argument that the evidence had modest probative value.  I remain of that view.  But I was not persuaded that there was a danger of unfair prejudice.  The matters raised by Mr Smith would be amenable to directions by me to ensure the evidence was not misused by the jury by giving it greater weight than it deserves.  For example, the terminology used by Mr Richard Henry, ""would have noticed"", could either indicate something less than definitive; or it could mean that the object was of such interest to the witness that he would necessarily have noticed any damage to it. The jury can use their commonsense in evaluating that type of issue.
39For these reasons I ruled that the evidence of what Mr Richard Henry said about his observations in the home of the deceased on 19 January 2012 were admissible.

2762187,R v Mulvihill [2013] NSWSC 1190,"Judgment

1PRICE J: Paul Darren Mulvihill (""the applicant"") applies for bail. He is charged with the murder of Rachelle Yeo, who died as a result of stab wounds to her neck and chest on 16 July 2012. The Crown opposes the bail application. Apart from the provisions of s 32 Bail Act 1978 which apply to all bail applications, the Bail Act provides that bail is not to be granted for an offence of murder unless the court is satisfied that exceptional circumstances justify the grant of bail. 

2Section 32(7) Bail Act provides that matters beyond those identified in s 32 which the court accepts as relevant may be considered when determining an application for bail to which s 9C relates.. 

Bail History 

3Before advancing further, it is convenient to mention that the applicant was granted bail on strict conditions by Davies J on 11 October 2012. His Honour considered that the applicant had demonstrated exceptional circumstances being a combination of the particular nature of the offence, the difficulty of the custodial conditions both for the preparation of the applicant's defence and the ability to deal with his family law proceedings and the stringency of the proposed bail conditions. His Honour assessed the strength of the Crown case to be ""a moderate to a moderately strong one"" on the available material.

4The applicant's bail was revoked on 21 January 2013 by Reiss LCM in the Local Court at Parramatta as he did not comply with a bail condition that required him to proceed directly to and from the reporting police station and arrive back at his bail residence within the prescribed time. 

5On 21 March 2013, Campbell J granted the applicant conditional bail. His Honour was in agreement with Davies J's assessment of the strength of the Crown case. However, the applicant's bail was revoked by Price LCM on 15 June 2013. It was contended that the applicant had breached two bail conditions. 

6The applicant admits that he breached his bail by sending an email to a third party intending its content to be conveyed to Guy Ellis, a Crown witness. The conditions of his bail prohibited indirect contact with any Crown witness. 

7The second alleged breach of bail is more controversial. A bail condition obliged the applicant to reside at his bail address and not elsewhere. The applicant's movement log revealed that between 5 and 6 June 2013, he was absent from his bail address from 5:45pm to 9:45am with an approved bail supervisor. The applicant says that he understood that he was complying with the conditions of his bail which permitted him to be absent from the bail residence at any time provided he was in the company of one or more approved supervisors. Mitchell Cavanagh, the applicant's solicitor, states in an affidavit sworn 22 August 2013 that he provided the applicant with advice that a residential condition (unlike a curfew) did not prohibit the applicant from occasionally being absent from the bail address provided he was in the company of an approved supervisor. 

8I will return to these issues at a later stage, as my task is not to determine whether the applicant's bail should have been revoked, but as bail has been refused by the magistrate, my obligation is to decide whether there are exceptional circumstances that justify the grant of bail. 

9The applicant submits that the court would find that there are exceptional circumstances and would grant him bail on the proposed stringent conditions that include 11 persons providing security in the total amount of $755,000.00, reporting twice daily to police, residence conditions that bear some resemblance to home detention, and the maintenance of a movement log. 

Relevant principle 

10Section 9C places a heavy onus on an applicant for a grant of bail on a charge of murder: see for example R v Connelly (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hoeben J, 16 February 2006, unreported); R v Pirini (Supreme Court of New South Wales, McClellan CJ at CL, 8 September 2009, unreported); R v Pirini (Supreme Court of New South Wales, James J, 20 April 2010, unreported). Exceptional circumstances may arise from one or more factors either singularly or combined: see Pirini (8 September 2009); R v Young [2006] NSWSC 1499; R v Jacobs [2008] NSWSC 417.

11In R v Young [2006] NSWSC 1499 Johnson J said at [20].

""It seems to me that exceptional circumstances may be found in a case by the coincidence of a number of features. These can include features subjective to the particular applicant, features which bear upon the nature of the alleged offence and features which emphasise that, absent this particular test, the applicant is otherwise a person who will answer bail."" 







The Crown case 

12The Crown submits that the strength of its case has been enhanced by the report of Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist, that was not before Davies J or Campbell J. The Crown argues that its case against the applicant is overwhelming. Mr Hamill SC who appeared for the applicant contended that the pathologist's report assists the applicant, who claims that he was acting in self-defence. 

13In a recorded conversation, the applicant told Queensland Police that he was in the deceased's unit when she approached him with a knife in her hands. He said that he overpowered her and that they both had hold of the knife when they fell to the ground and the knife went into the deceased. 

14Should self-defence be raised at the applicant's trial, the onus will be on the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing was not done by the applicant in self-defence. Having regard to the early stage of the proceedings it is inappropriate that analysis of the evidence is conducted in detail. It is sufficient to observe that when the circumstances relied upon by the Crown are viewed in combination, there is a strong likelihood that the Crown will satisfy a jury that the applicant was not acting in self-defence. 

15A brief summary of the principal circumstances relied upon by the Crown is as follows: 

(i) the termination by the deceased of her relationship with the 
applicant and her relocation to Sydney; 

(ii) after she moved to Sydney, the deceased had conversations with a number of persons that the applicant had been ""stalking"" and ""harassing"" her; 

(iii) the deceased told Geoffrey Allars on 13 June 2012 that the applicant had threatened that ""he would destroy her"";

(iv) the deceased's attendance at Dee Why Police Station on 5 July 2012 during which she told Constable Stephenson that the applicant ""became more hostile and made threats to her at work"", stating, ""He was going to take me down and ruin my life"";

(v) the evidence of the residents in the deceased's unit block of what they heard at approximately 9:15pm on 16 July 2012. Without detailing all of this evidence, Ms Faletoese recalled that she heard the female voice in the deceased's unit yell out, ""Call the police"". When asked by Ms Faletoese to open the door, the female voice said ""I can't, I can't open the door just call the police."" Ms Burrows recalled hearing a female screaming ""Oh my God. Oh my God"". Ms Burrows says that when Ms Faletoese asked for the door to be opened a male within the unit said, ""we're ok, everything is ok."" Ms Burrows said she heard muffled screams from the female and also heard the female say ""I can't get to the door."" Ms Burrows rang triple 0. It then fell silent within the unit;

(vi) the applicant's flight from the unit before police arrived;

(vii) the applicant's telephone call to his wife at 10:05pm in which he stated, ""She's gone"";

(viii) the booking by the applicant of the flight to Brisbane in the name of Guy Ellis, with the use of the credit card details provided by Mr Ellis; 

(ix) the autopsy findings that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds. One stab wound was on the right chest extending through the right lung, right ventricle and septum of the heart. The second stab wound was through the left side of the neck, extending through the internal jugular vein through the larynx;

(x) the opinion expressed by Dr Duflou at par 16 of his report that ""the constellation of injuries seen in this case are typical of an assailant causing stab wounds and incised wounds on the deceased, while the deceased is trying to fend off the assailant."" Although Dr Duflou could not exclude the possibility that one or more of the injuries sustained by the deceased could have been self-inflicted during the altercation, he opined (at par 16):

""...the multiplicity of locations on the body, the presence of defensive injuries on both hands, and the severity of the injuries overall would be extremely unusual for self-infliction during a struggle. I have not seen any confirmed examples of injuries approaching the appearances of these in about 30 years of forensic pathology practice.""

16On the other hand, I do not overlook Dr Duflou's observations on the injuries to the applicant's hands which provide some support for the applicant's case. Dr Duflou writes (at par 15):

""...These injuries could reasonably be defensive injuries, sustained in a similar way to those on the deceased. They could however also have been sustained by [the applicant] while he was stabbing with the knife or by contact with the broken crockery. It is also possible that all or some of these injuries were sustained after the altercation."" 

17The opinions expressed by Dr Duflou will not be considered by the jury in isolation but in combination with all of the other evidence in the case. The Crown also contends that there was some pre-planning by the applicant. The difficulty this argument faces is that upon the Crown case, the knife that was used to inflict the wounds upon the deceased, came from her home unit. 

18I conclude that the opinions expressed by Dr Duflou that were not before Davies J and Campbell J enhance the Crown case, but I do not conclude that the strength of the Crown case against the applicant is overwhelming. 

The interests of the applicant 

19Section 32(1)(b) Bail Act provides that in making a determination as to a grant of bail, the court is to have regard to ""the interests of the person, having regard only to:

(i) the period that the person may be obliged to spend in custody if bail is refused and the conditions under which the person would be held in custody, and

(ii) the needs of the person to be free to prepare for the person's appearance in court or to obtain legal advice or both, and 

(iii) the needs of the person to be free for any lawful purpose not mentioned in subparagraph (ii)...""

20The applicant's trial is listed to commence on 3 February 2014 and he has been in custody since 15 June 2013. The period of time that the applicant may be obliged to spend in custody if bail is refused is unexceptional. I take into account that the preparation for his trial may be made more difficult if he is not at liberty, but this is a matter that frequently faces persons charged with murder. 

21The applicant is presently self-represented in ongoing litigation before the Family Court of Australia, Brisbane Registry. The proceedings were listed for a conciliation conference on 23 August 2013. It appears that he has sought an adjournment. I give weight to the applicant's need to be at liberty to represent himself in the Family Court. 

22I take into account that the applicant has the offer of employment consulting to the pharmaceutical industry and his need to earn income to fund the legal representation of his choosing. 

23Section 32(1)(a) Bail Act obliges the court to consider the probability of whether or not the applicant will appear. He is charged with murder which carries with it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. Nevertheless, there is no suggestion that he is a flight risk. He has answered his bail when required and substantial security is offered by friends and work colleagues in the proposed bail conditions. 

24The court is required to consider the protection and welfare of the community having regard to those matters in s 32(1)(c)(i)-(vi) Bail Act. It is not likely that the applicant will commit any serious offences whilst on bail: s 32(c)(iv) Bail Act. He does not have a prior criminal record of any significance and as Davies J observed when granting bail on 11 October 2012, the circumstances of the present case arose out of a personal relationship. 

25I conclude that the applicant does not pose a threat to the community and is not a flight risk.

26When considering the protection and welfare of the community, the court is also to have regard to: 

""(ii) whether or not the person has failed, or has been arrested for an anticipated failure, to observe a reasonable bail condition previously imposed in respect of the offence, and 

(iii) the likelihood of the person interfering with evidence, witnesses or jurors..."" (s 32(c)(ii)-(iii) Bail Act). 

27I do not think for present purposes it is necessary to resolve whether the applicant was in breach of the bail granted by Campbell J (outlined at [7] above). It is plain the applicant did not think that he was in breach of his bail and was acting on legal advice. Mr Cavanagh's advice is understandable as there is a degree of tension between bail conditions 3 and 14. I do not consider that this matter reflects adversely on the applicant in any way.

28I turn to the admitted breach of sending the email to Mr Chapman with the intention of it being passed on to Mr Ellis, a Crown witness. In his affidavit, Mr Cavanagh discloses the applicant's instructions which include that he understood from conversations with Mr Chapman that Mr Ellis wanted, if permitted, to speak to him. He wished to make an application to the court to vary bail to permit communication with Mr Ellis and the email was sent with the hope that he could support such an application by communicating his consent to his solicitor's email address. 

29I am unable to understand how the applicant would not have appreciated that he was in breach of his bail by sending this email. The requirement to strictly comply with bail conditions has been emphasised by the judges of this court. His bail had been previously revoked by Reiss LCM when he failed to comply with a bail condition and Campbell J told the applicant that any breach would be considered a serious matter and would raise questions as to whether he could be counted on to comply with bail conditions. As a result of the breach, he has been in custody for over two months. 

30Although the applicant breached his bail in this way, there is no evidence that he did so for a nefarious purpose. The evidence of Mr Ellis appears to be confined to the telephone call during which the applicant asked for his credit card details. Furthermore, the applicant has not breached his bail by committing a criminal offence or by failing to report to police. Given the extraordinarily rigorous nature of his bail conditions, his overall adherence to conditional bail has been good. 

Decision 

31In all the circumstances, I am persuaded that the applicant has discharged the high onus of establishing exceptional circumstances arising from the combination of the following:

the finding that he poses no further threat to the community at this time;

he is not a flight risk;

his interest in being at liberty to represent himself in the Family Law proceedings; and, 

the high stringency of the bail conditions. 

Bail Conditions 

32In order to eliminate the uncertainty that surrounds the residence condition. I have added to the proposed bail conditions clause 3A which provides:

The accused is not to be absent from the bail address between the hours of 11pm and 7:45am for any reason apart from a medical emergency.

33In order to make clause 13 consistent with the residence condition, the hours have been amended to between 7:45am and 11pm.

2762190,R v Grogan (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1192,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Mr Smith, counsel for the accused, objected to the Crown leading evidence of three occasions upon which the accused ran away on the night of the alleged crime as evidence of ""flight"" from which the jury could draw a consciousness of guilt inference.  I ruled that the evidence was admissible for the following reasons.
2The accused is charged with the murder of Mr Alan Henry at Gloucester on 19 April 2012.  Mr Henry died on that date; the Crown says his death was caused by injuries he sustained when he was assaulted in his home by the accused on 10 January 2012.
3The accused and his partner (and co-accused) Natasha Slacke were living at Port Stephens.  Ms Slacke had befriended Mr Henry, a relatively old man who lived on his own in Gloucester.  She often attended his home and did chores for him in exchange for payment.  The accused sometimes accompanied her.
4On 10 January 2012, the accused and Ms Slacke travelled to Gloucester.  At about 4.30pm they were at the Caltex service station on the corner of Church and Philip Streets.  Witnesses observed them to be involved in a heated argument.  In the end, the accused left on foot.  It is the Crown case that he went to the deceased's home in Gregson Street, about 250 metres from the service station.
The first occasion of flight
5A neighbour of the deceased will give evidence of a man, the Crown says the accused, climbing over a fence and entering the backyard of the deceased's home.  Soon after this, at about 5.20pm, the neighbour heard loud noises, described as ""thuds"", from within the deceased's home.  The Crown says this was the deceased being assaulted.  About five or ten minutes later the neighbour saw the same man he had seen earlier, this time leaving the deceased's home by jumping over the back fence and entering the rear lane. 
6Senior Constable Broadley was driving in Gregson Street at around 5.30pm.  He turned right into Ravenshaw Street.  As he passed the laneway running behind the houses fronting on to Gregson Street he saw a man walking in the lane with something in his hands.  The officer stopped the police car and reversed back in order to look down the laneway.  He saw the man run from the laneway and into the rear yard of a house fronting on to Philip Street.  (Philip Street is parallel to Gregson Street with the lane in between.)   Senior Constable Broadley drove up the laneway but lost sight of the man.  A resident of the property the man had entered summoned the officer over and directed Senior Constable Broadley's attention to a laptop computer and peripheral cord on the ground in the backyard.  Subsequent investigation revealed that these belonged to Mr Henry.  The Crown case is that the accused assaulted Mr Henry and stole these items.
7Running away from the scene of the alleged crime is the first occasion of ""flight"".
The second occasion of flight
8Ms Slacke arrived at the deceased's home a short time later.  She entered via the front door.  She soon called 000 and an ambulance arrived a short time later.  The officers saw that Mr Henry had suffered significant head trauma.  Ms Slacke told them that she had found him on the floor and that he must have fallen. 
9The ambulance departed the scene with Mr Henry at 6.36pm.  A short time later, the next door neighbour again heard the distinctive sound of someone coming over the fence into the deceased's backyard.  He looked and saw that it was the same man he had seen earlier.  There is no dispute, in respect of this occasion, that this was the accused.  The man went to the back verandah of the deceased's home where the neighbour saw him speaking with Ms Slacke.  He heard the accused say, ""You can't back out now"".  The pair went inside.  The neighbour heard a great deal of noise from within.  It continued until police officers arrived at the front door.
10Senior Constables Broadley and Forrester had been alerted to the attendance of the ambulance at the deceased's home.  They went to the hospital and then went to the home.  While walking down the front path they heard a male and a female voice from inside and saw two figures in the lounge room.  The male moved quickly out of view.  They knocked on the front door, which was answered by Ms Slacke.  She delayed them by refusing entry.  One of the officers went around to the back door where he was met by Ms Slacke.  Eventually she allowed the officers to enter the house.  There was no sign of the accused.  There were signs of attempts having been made to clean up blood from the kitchen floor.
The third occasion of flight
11The officers left the house and went back to the hospital to make further inquiries.  From there they returned to Gregson Street where they went to the neighbour's home and had a conversation.  They then walked next door to the deceased's home.  They saw Ms Slacke exit via the front door and walk away down Gregson Street.  She was immediately followed by the accused.  Senior Constable Broadley recognised him as the man he had earlier seen in the rear laneway.  He called out to the accused, ""Jason, we need to speak with you"".  The accused did not turn around or acknowledge the officers but continued walking away.  He was called upon to stop a second time but he suddenly ran off around a corner into Barrington Street.   Senior Constable Forrester gave chase while Senior Constable Broadley ran back to their car.  By the time he drove into Barrington Street, Senior Constable Forrester was standing in the middle of the roadway looking into the shadows with his torch.  The pair drove around the area for a time but could not find the accused. 
A fourth occasion of flight
12There was also a fourth occasion the Crown was going to rely upon.  The accused and Ms Slacke left Gloucester the day after, that is 11 January 2012, and returned to Port Stephens.  At some stage that afternoon Detective Senior Constable Joshua Tynan rang the accused and, in a brief conversation, obtained his agreement to attend the Gloucester police station about an hour later.  The accused did not attend.  Ultimately, the accused was found to be in Taree where he was arrested on 17 January 2012.   In submissions, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that it was leaving Gloucester on 11 January 2012, knowing that the police wanted to speak to him, that was the feature of this evidence that the Crown sought to rely upon.  The problem is that Detective Tynan said in evidence on the voir dire that he did not know where the accused was at the time of the telephone conversation:  the accused might already have left Gloucester.  In terms of fleeing with the knowledge that police desired to speak to him, the lack of precision in this incidence adds little to the third occasion of ""flight"".  The inherent weakness of this evidence in supporting an inference of consciousness of guilt was acknowledged by the Crown Prosecutor and it was not pressed.
Submissions for the accused
13Mr Smith submitted that the evidence outlined above should be excluded upon the basis that a danger of unfair prejudice outweighed its probative value.
14In relation to the probative value of the evidence, it was submitted that it was somewhat odd that there were two occasions on which it is said that the accused returned to the scene of the alleged crime.
15The asserted prejudice arose from the fact that the accused has a substantial criminal record.  A copy of his record in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia was provided to me.  The history goes back to when the accused was aged 16 in 1987. The offences include matters of dishonesty, drugs, and violence.  The matters of violence include assault, assault police, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, wounding, and attempted armed robbery with actual violence.  There are multiple entries for many of these offences.  The history also discloses that the accused has been imprisoned on quite a number of occasions.
16The accused told police when interviewed on 17 January and 4 May 2012, in effect, that his flight was explicable on the basis that he has significant criminal history and that he was concerned about the police discriminating against him, as they had in the past, by falsely accusing him of crimes he had not committed.  By way of example, in the first interview he said:
Q54. You mentioned police are going to blame you, why do you think that?A. Oh, look, I'm, look at me life, look at me history, you know what I mean, I've been to gaol so many times for so long, I've just got out in '09 after four and a half, I mean, I get the blame no matter where I go for everything, it's just part of my friggin' life, I tell you.
17It was submitted that given this state of affairs, the accused was left with three options.  First, put nothing before the jury by way of alternative explanation for his flight.  Second, to put something in broad terms about his crimina history before the jury.  Third, to put or allow into evidence material like his response in the first interview just quoted.  The first option would leave the inference of consciousness of guilt for which the Crown contends unchallenged and virtually unassailable.  The second and third would involve disclosure of disreputable conduct unrelated to the offence alleged.  
18Another submission was concerned with the directions that I would give to the jury on this issue.  The usual direction speaks of the jury being satisfied that the conduct of the accused was explicable because he/she feared implication in relation to the commission of the offence for which he/she is on trial.  In this case, the offence charged is murder and there is the natural alternative of manslaughter.  But the Crown would not be able to argue that the ""flight"" was explicable on the basis that the accused feared implication in the commission of murder or manslaughter because the deceased did not die until three months later.  Mr Smith submitted that this would add a ""layer of complexity"" to the directions that would be given.
19I do not think the last point is of any significance.  Mr Smith candidly invited my attention to Penza and Di Maria v R [2013] NSWCCA 21.  There, at [190]-[191] per Hoeben CJ at CL, reference was made to the need for there to be a logical connection between the actions relied upon as evidencing a consciousness of guilt and the offence in respect of which that evidence is adduced.  There is a logical connection between flight from the crime scene (the first aspect) and flight from the police (each of the three aspects) and the conduct comprising elements of the offences for which the accused is being tried; that conduct being a violent assault of the deceased and the theft of his property.  I do not consider it especially relevant that the final element of the offence of murder (or manslaughter), the death of the accused, did not occur until some time after.
20In R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52, Simpson J, with the concurrence of Ipp JA and Adams J, held that evidence of flight was wrongly admitted.  It should have been excluded on the basis of the danger of unfair prejudice outweighing the probative value of the evidence.
21Mr Cook's trial was concerned with the alleged commission of an offence of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon with intent to have sexual intercourse.  Simpson J described (at [36]) the probative value of the evidence of flight as ""very high indeed"".  Mr Cooke's explanation for the flight allegedly involved revealing that he was the subject of an apprehended domestic violence order; that he breached that order; and that he had committed an assault. Her Honour said:
[32] ... The prejudice to the appellant is plain.  Not only would his explanation expose him as a person with a criminal record (the assault and the previous breach), it would also expose him as a person with a history of violence against women.  In the context of the charge he faced, that exposure would have particularly poignancy. 
22Her Honour referred to a number of authorities on the question of admissibility and use of evidence demonstrating consciousness of guilt.  She concluded:
[47] ... There is no general principle that, when the explanation for flight involves revealing other offences, the evidence should be rejected.  Indeed, it is part of the conventional direction in relation to evidence indicative of consciousness of guilt (whether of lies, or flight, or otherwise), that the jury be alerted to the possibility that the accused person has undertaken that course of conduct by reason of consciousness of guilt, not of the offence charged, but of some other offence or discreditable conduct.
23Ultimately, Simpson J concluded (at [48]) that the prejudicial effect of the evidence was unfair and that it outweighed the probative value.  This was because the appellant's response ""not only disclosed previous criminal offences, it disclosed criminal offences with a disturbingly close relationship to the offence with which he was charged"".
24It was necessary in Cook, if there was going to be any explanation for the conduct, for the accused to disclose to the jury prior offending of a similar nature to that which was alleged against him.  That is not necessarily the case here.   The accused might choose to disclose detail about his past offending, but that is more a matter of choice than necessity.   The essence of his explanation is that he had previous contact with police; he perceived that police discriminated against him; and that he feared being unjustly accused.
25It is not in every case that disclosure of other offending renders evidence from which an inference of consciousness of guilt may arise inadmissible on the basis of its probative value being outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  For example, in R v Taranto [1999] NSWCCA 396, the accused was being tried for an offence of wounding with intent to murder, alternatively, malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  After the incident in question, he stayed for some time with his brother at Sutherland, and when police attended his home at Kingswood on the day of his arrest he ran away and hid inside the roof space of a garage.
26There was an objection to the evidence based upon s 137 Evidence Act.  The accused's explanation for his ""flight"" was that he faced unrelated charges of goods in custody, possessing a prohibited drug and possessing an unlicensed pistol.  Also (and this was the explanation that was put before the jury) the reason for his desire to avoid apprehension was that he had been told that a person whom he believed was a police informer had told police that he was responsible for shooting the victim, and that ""his word would go stronger than my own"".  Further, he had received information which led him to believe that if the police found him there would be ""a shootout"". 
27The trial judge admitted the evidence, saying that it was a matter for Mr Taranto how he dealt with it and intimated that, if he chose to reveal the outstanding charges, any prejudice would be remedied by appropriate directions.  Because another ground of appeal was upheld and a new trial ordered, it was unnecessary for the ground relating to this aspect to be resolved.  However, Hidden J said (at [50]), for the benefit of the judge presiding at any retrial, that it had been open to the trial judge to have admitted the evidence.
28In the present case, the evidence in question has the potential to be highly probative of the accused acting in a way that demonstrates that he feared being implicated in the assault of Mr Henry and the theft of his property.  That is particularly so in relation to the first occasion relied upon by the Crown.   It would be open to the jury to consider Mr Smith's point about it being ""odd"" that the accused twice returned to the scene.  But against that, the Crown says that what is significant is that on each of those occasions, when the police arrived the accused again fled.
29I accept that there is a danger of unfair prejudice.  Careful directions will be needed to ensure that the jury do not misuse whatever evidence the accused chooses to adduce, or allows the Crown to adduce, by way of explanation for his conduct.  I am not persuaded that such danger as there is outweighs the probative value of the evidence.
30The evidence is admissible.

2762198,Milson v R (No 5) [2013] NSWDC 276,"Judgment


1On 19 July 2013 I allowed an appeal by Jason Milson against a conviction which had been recorded against him. The conviction was under s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 

2I allowed the appeal for reasons which I delivered this morning. There were two problems with the prosecution, both concerning the Court Attendance Notice. In my opinion the original Court Attendance Notice was void. The second problem was that a purported amendment of the Court Attendance Notice was outside the limitation period. 

3Mr Milson, through his solicitor Mr N A Felton, argues that now he has won his appeal, I should award him costs. Mr Felton points to s 70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). He says that the section provides two bases relevant to this case which would allow me to award costs in favour of his client. Section 70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that costs are not to be awarded in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside ""unless the appeal Court is satisfied"" of a number of alternative circumstances. 

4The circumstances relied upon by Mr Felton were two: the first was that provided for in cl (b) ""that the proceedings in the Local Court were initiated without reasonable cause"". The second was provided for in cl (d) ""that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award costs in favour of the appellant.""

5Mr Felton helpfully referred me to a number of authorities, including a judgment by Hall J in Halpin v Department of Gaming and Racing [2007] NSWSC 815. 

6The application for costs to be awarded against her client was opposed by Ms C Black who appeared for the respondent, the Director of Public Prosecutions. Hall J's judgment contains, with respect, a very helpful commentary on s 70. His Honour referred to authority at [57] which suggested that a proceeding would be instituted without reasonable cause if it had no real prospects of success, or was doomed to failure. Such a question is required to be determined as a matter of objective fact.

7Another authority referred to by Hall J suggested that one way of testing the question is to ask whether, upon the facts apparent to the applicant at the time of instituting the proceeding, ""there was no substantial prospect of success"". Hall J went on, himself, to say at [61] that the ""outcome of many proceedings turns upon the Court in question establishing the proper construction of statutory provisions and then applying them as so interpreted to the facts of a particular case."" Mr Felton argued that my finding or opinion that the Court Attendance Notice was originally invalid meant that the prosecution was doomed to failure. 

8Ms Black pointed out that Mr Milson consented to the amendment when it was made in the Local Court. In my judgment I expressed the opinion that - because the items of property in the charge had changed, and allegations were made in respect of fresh items and fresh charges after the limitation period had expired - the limitation period prevented the success of the prosecution. 

9To my mind that argument was not doomed to failure. Ms Black had argued in her written submissions that the ""amendment was made to the mere particularisation of property."" She went on to argue that it is ""not uncommon nor unusual for the prosecution to particularise more than one item of property in a charge and there has been no suggestion raised by the Appellant that the relevant CAN is duplicitous or that each item of property should have been subject to a separate CAN."" 

10It may well be that, on close analysis and after considering argument, such a position was not likely to succeed. But it was not, in my opinion, doomed to failure nor could it be said that there was no substantial prospects of success. 

11The original invalidity of the CAN depended upon an argument concerning the extent of the operation of the power of a Court to amend a defective initiating process. The power is provided by s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Mahoney JA, as his Honour then was, discussed the issue related to other legislation in Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1993) 32 NSWLR 501 at 517. I infer from his Honour's reasoning that the position of the authorities did not lead to an unquestionably clear conclusion on that question. To my mind the issue was arguable.

12Mr Felton argued that there were other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor which would make it just and reasonable for his client to receive his costs. He pointed to exhibit C1, which comprised email correspondence between Senior Counsel whom he had briefed for his client, Phillip Strickland SC, and Ms Black. The correspondence was exchanged on the evening before the proceedings commenced. Mr Strickland set out some of the authorities. 

13To my mind, the continued conduct of the proceedings after that exchange was not conduct such as to deprive the prosecutor of his costs. To my mind there was no conduct by the prosecutor which would make it just and reasonable to award costs in favour of Mr Milson. 

14For those reasons I reject the application by Mr Milson for his costs.

		10 February 2014",2013-08-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762199,Milson v R (No 3) [2013] NSWDC 269,"Judgment


1I will now give my reasons for the orders I made on 19 July 2013 dismissing appeals by Mr Milson against convictions for driving whilst disqualified and driving recklessly without stopping in a police pursuit.

2Mr Milson was charged with two offences. The first was driving whilst disqualified and the second was an offence involving a police pursuit. Both offences are said to have occurred on 6 January 2011. The first is said to have occurred between 8.20 am in the morning and 9.00 am. The second between 8.45 am and 9.00 am. 

3It is claimed by the prosecution that Mr Milson was riding a motorbike. The only issue is whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Milson was the rider. It is not in dispute that he was the registered owner of the motorbike and that he was at the relevant time disqualified from driving it. What is also not in dispute is that Mr Milson made a phone call to a person named Maria at 7.45 am that morning. He said in the phone call that he was coming over to her place. He was told to come in the back way and that the gate was unlocked. He was given directions to the back gate and a driveway off Chapman Street. He said that he would ""see you soon"".

4At around 8.00 am police were watching the unit of the woman named Maria on Chapman Street. They saw Mr Milson's motorbike down the driveway that provides access to the rear yard of Maria's unit. A short time afterwards they saw Mr Milson's motorbike being driven out of the driveway. They could not see the rider's face but they were able to say that the rider was ""of a large build, with black jacket and white coloured motorcycle helmet."" 

5I entertain no reasonable doubt that it was Mr Milson who rode his motorbike to Maria's unit after announcing his intention to do so. The contents of the telephone call appear to be spontaneous and not contrived to suggest that someone other than Mr Milson might be arriving. His motorbike arrived at the agreed point of access shortly after his announced intention to do just that. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution that Mr Milson is guilty of driving whilst disqualified on that occasion.

6So far as the second offence is concerned, the case for Mr Milson being involved in the police pursuit is largely circumstantial. There is a description of the rider as being ""of a large build"" which appears to be consistent with Mr Milson. Otherwise it is a circumstantial evidence. 

7There are two pieces of circumstantial evidence I need to deal with first. The first is evidence of a phone call made from Mr Milson's telephone at 8.48 am. It is made to a number which the prosecution says belongs to one Alan Garner. But Police Officer Quinn said in evidence that that police officer could not with certainty say that the phone call was made to Mr Garner. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the call was made to Mr Garner. 

8The second piece of circumstantial evidence concerns some words used by Mr Milson in a telephone call which he made to an unidentified man. The learned Magistrate decoded the words so that they were saying that Mr Milson just got chased and he needed to change his clothes. The words that were decoded were ""chased"" and ""clothes"". I do not myself decode those words. I do not, for the reasons put forward by Mr Strickland SC who appeared for Mr Milson, regard the decoding process as knowledge which is not reasonably open to question because it is common knowledge. I rely also on the passage in Haydon J's judgment in Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; (2007) 233 CLR 307 at 513 ([619]). 

9Putting aside those two pieces of evidence, the balance of the prosecution's case as argued by Ms C Black on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions is still very powerful. We know that a man of similar build to Mr Milson left Maria's house on Mr Milson's motorbike sometime after Mr Milson himself had arrived. The bike was ridden to Mr Garner's house in another street. We know that Mr Milson made a phone call to a number shortly before leaving Maria's place. We do not know whose number that is. But about a quarter of an hour later Mr Milson made another phone call to a man saying that he is ""at your house"". He reported to the man in some sort of code that something had happened and that he needs to ""get out of"" something. Previously he phoned a woman, Maria, at a number. Now he was phoning a man at another number saying that he was at the man's house. We know that Mr Milson said that his sister was not at home. His sister lived in Chapman Avenue. Five minutes later he made another phone call to a woman - there is no suggestion that it is Maria - and he needed her to ""jump in your mum's car and come and get me"". In addition, he needed some footwear. He was guarded in his responses to the woman and in explaining what was going on. 

10I have no difficulty in concluding that the only reasonable possibility is that it was Mr Milson on the motorbike and he reported the chase to a man and then asked a woman to pick him up from the suburb he was riding towards (when last sighted) and to provide him with footwear. 

11I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Mr Milson's guilt of the offence involving the police pursuit. 

12It is for those reasons that I made the orders which I did on 19 July 2013.

2762200,Milson v R (No 2) [2013] NSWDC 268,"Judgment

1These are my reasons for allowing an appeal by Jason Milson against sentences imposed on him on 8 January 2013 at Tweed Heads Local Court.  
2On that day Mr Milson received four prison sentences from Local Court Magistrate Dakin in respect of four domestic violence offences.  Mr Milson appealed from the sentences and I heard the appeals on 15 July 2013.  
3Two of the offences were committed in January 2011.  The first was committed on 20 January 2011 when the victim of the offence, Mr Milson's former partner, was at sport training.  The second offence was committed in the same month when Mr Milson knew that he was going into custody, and he saw his daughter. 
4Mr Milson had an apprehended domestic violence order against him.  The person who benefited from the order was his former partner.  On 20 January 2011 his former partner, whose name is Nicole Cantrill, had been to training in a sport that she engaged in.  She left the training with her coach.  She got a telephone call from Mr Milson saying ""Where are you?""  She said she was on her way home.  She was dropped home and saw that Mr Milson was standing in the driveway.  Mr Milson yelled out ""Who the fuck is that?""  Ms Cantrill told him that it was her coach.  Ms Cantrill entered the house and then went to get her and Mr Milson's daughter from Mr Milson's car.  Mr Milson had been looking after the little girl.  They engaged in an argument before parting company.  
5A week or two later, on 22 January 2011, Ms Cantrill was at her home with her two children.  One of them was the daughter that she shared with Mr Milson.  It was the early evening and the little girl was jumping on the trampoline when she said ""Dad, Dad"".  She jumped off the trampoline and ran over to where Mr Milson was standing on the driveway side of the fence.  Ms Cantrill saw him and correctly observed, because of the terms of the apprehended domestic violence order, ""You're not allowed here.""  Mr Milson said, ""I just want to give Mahley a hug and kiss before I go"".  Ms Cantrill picked up Mahley, their daughter, and allowed Mr Milson to give her a hug and a kiss.  He then left.
6As a result of the behaviour that I have described, Mr Milson was charged with contravening a prohibition or restriction in a domestic violence order.  They were both offences against s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW).  He was given good behaviour bonds under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), but later breached the bonds and received 4 month prison sentences instead of the bonds.  It is from those sentences that he appeals.
7The second pair of offences occurred a year and a half later on 24 July 2012 up in Tweed Heads.  Ms Cantrill went to visit her grandmother and when she was leaving she saw Mr Milson's car.  She was followed by that car and at one stage Mr Milson's car drove up beside her on the wrong side of the road.  She could see Jason Milson in the car.  They stopped at traffic lights and she again saw Jason Milson this time pointing at her.  At another stage she heard Jason Milson say ""You fucking dog, I'm gunna get you.""  Mr Milson's car was being driven by his girlfriend.  Ms Cantrill had her six year old son in the car for the whole time.  As a result of that behaviour, Mr Milson was again charged with contravening a prohibition or restriction in an apprehended domestic violence order.  That is an offence against s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act.  But this time he was also charged with a more serious offence of stalking or intimidating, intending to cause fear of physical or mental harm, an offence against s 13(1) of the same legislation.  
8The first incident, when Mr Milson was engaging with Ms Cantrill after she had finished her training was, in my opinion, no more than an argument in the context of dropping off a child after access.  I accept that it was Ms Cantrill who asked Mr Milson to look after the child, and the arrangement obviously involved him dropping her back.  Mr Milson gave evidence to that effect when he was called by his counsel, Mr P M Strickland SC.  That arrangement had the potential to lead to some dispute.  The arrangement itself is unchallenged in evidence.  I regard the objective seriousness of that offence as very low.  
9The second offence which involved him kissing and hugging his daughter was more than a technical breach but it occurred in very mitigating circumstances.  Mr Milson knew that he was going to go into custody.  His attention was focussed on his daughter rather than on Ms Cantrill and he did exactly what he said he would do.  He gave his daughter a hug and a kiss before leaving.  
10However the Tweed Heads offences were aggravated by Mr Milson being on good behaviour bonds for the earlier offences, and by having criminal convictions for those earlier offences.  Once again, although his behaviour was aggravated by those circumstances, the offences themselves were relatively low in objective gravity.  
11I propose to take no action in respect of the breaches of the bonds imposed as a result of the January 2011 offences.  
12However the Tweed Heads offences are another matter.  Although objectively relatively low in seriousness, they were committed when Mr Milson was on a good behaviour bond and he already had a criminal record for such behaviour.  The second offence is the more serious offence, and carries a significant maximum penalty.  
13In respect of the first offence, I regard the only appropriate penalty as one of imprisonment, and I would impose a sentence of 4 months imprisonment.  In respect of the second offence, I also regard the only appropriate penalty as imprisonment, and I would impose a sentence of 8 months imprisonment.  However, because of the circumstances in which the offences were committed, I propose to suspend the execution of both sentences under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
14Accordingly, I dispose of these four appeals against sentence by the following orders.  Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), I set aside the sentences imposed in respect of the offences committed in January 2011.  Instead of those sentences ...
HIS HONOUR:  good, I have made the formal orders.  Hopefully they were consistent, thank you for reminding me.  
15It is for the reasons that I have just announced that I made the orders which did.  I will just look at my orders made in respect of the other matter.  
BLACK:  Does your Honour require some assistance in relation to the orders made on the last occasion?HIS HONOUR:  I've got them in front of me, thanks Ms Black.  I set aside the conviction in respect to the Limitation Act matter, didn't I, or rather the limitation period?

		06 February 2014",2013-08-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762201,Milson v R (No 4) [2013] NSWDC 270,"Judgment

1Jason Milson was charged with a series of offences on 14 April 2011.  The charges were contained in a court attendance notice.  Charge 8 alleged that he had dealt with property suspected as being proceeds of crime.  That was an offence against s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  
2On 7 December 2011 the prosecution, with the consent of Mr Milson, amended charge number 8 so that the particulars of the property were more extensive.  Mr Milson was convicted of the offence and appeals against his conviction.  He claims through Mr P M Strickland SC, his counsel, that there are jurisdictional errors which render the amended court attendance notice invalid.  
3The respondent to the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions, represented by Ms C Black, argued that the court attendance notice was filed in time and then merely amended.  She pointed out that it was amended under s 20(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
4In my opinion, the court attendance notice which was filed by consent on 7 December 2011 was not an amendment, it was a fresh charge.  Never before had the prosecution alleged under s 193C of the Crimes Act an offence regarding a boat - formerly the allegation had been an offence under s 193B; or a bike - again formerly the allegation had been an offence under s 193B; or a television - again formerly the allegation had been in respect of an offence against s 193B.  
5Ms Black argued that the amendment was made to the mere particularisation of property.  She argued that it is not uncommon or unusual for the prosecution to particularise more than one item of property in a charge and there has been no suggestion raised by Mr Milson that the court attendance notice was duplicitous.  I do not accept those submissions because, as I said, there had never been allegations of an offence under s 193C of the Crimes Act in respect of a boat, a bike or a television which were all the subject of the fresh charge.
6It is common ground that the Court Attendance Notice filed on 7 December 2011 was filed outside the limitation period.  It has to be acknowledged that there had previously been an allegation made under s 193C of the Crimes Act of an offence regarding toy cars.  But still, in my opinion, the previous allegation was defective.  It was defective for the reasons set out by Mr Strickland SC in his written submissions at [15] of MFI 4 because it was a misstatement of the offence and could only be corrected by deleting an incorrect element - ""knowing that it was the proceeds of crime"" - and substituting another element - ""being property that there are reasonable grounds to suspect is proceeds of crime"".
7I accept Mr Strickland's submission, based upon the judgment of Mahoney JA  (as his Honour then was) in Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1993) 32 NSWLR 501 at 517, that s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act does not assist the prosecution by way of permitting an amendment.  His Honour said that the corresponding section under the Justices Act 1902 ""would offer no assistance if the defect lay in, for example, a mis-statement of the offence such that it could be corrected only by the deletion of the existing statement of it and the substitution of a corrected statement.""  His Honour referred to the judgment of Jordan CJ in Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 158 at 168 where the Chief Justice observed that a line of English authority regarding corresponding legislation did not apply ""if it appears that the information does not allege all the ingredients of the statutory offence"".
8Adopting Mahoney JA's terminology at 517 of Boral Gas I would regard the original Court Attendance Notice which alleged the offence in respect of toy cars correctly under s 193C of the Crimes Act as void as originally filed and it cannot be saved or amended under s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  It is now out of time.  
9Ms Black argued in her written submissions (which became MFI 5) that she can rely on s 16(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act because the particulars were necessarily implied in the short form of the offence.  However, I accept the submissions of Mr Strickland at [16] and [17] of his written submissions to the effect that the provision of s 175(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act was not complied with because the Court Attendance Notice filed on 7 December 2011 does not in any sense briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence.  It alleged a different offence.  
10It is for those reasons that on 19 July 2013 I made the orders allowing the appeal and setting aside the conviction.

2762203,MILSON v R [2013] NSWDC 267,"Judgment


1After I found Mr Jason Milson guilty of two driving offences, I heard the appeal against his sentence. He had been sentenced to prison by the Local Court magistrate. The two offences were driving whilst disqualified and an offence involving a reckless police pursuit. The learned magistrate had sentenced Mr Milson to 10 months imprisonment for the drive whilst disqualified and 12 months imprisonment for the reckless police pursuit. The effect of accumulation is that Mr Milson was sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment. He has appealed against that sentence. 

2Mr N A Felton, who appeared on Mr Milson's behalf, acknowledged that the sentence had to involve some form of custody but argued there was a question about whether that could be served within the community. Mr Felton was correct and realistic in acknowledging that his client had to face a sentence of imprisonment. It is another question as to whether it can be ordered to be served in the community.

3The offences were both committed on the same occasion, as Mr Felton pointed out. Mr Felton also pointed out the change in his client's personal circumstances since about 2006 when he ceased becoming addicted to heroin and started taking methadone. He has been in a relationship and has a baby who was born in April this year. Mr Felton argued that his client's life had changed dramatically and that a view was available that his client has reached a crossroads. He pointed out also that his client had spent some time on bail and had been reporting two or three times a week and then once a week from last year. He urged me to consider a referral for assessment for an intensive correction order. 

4On the other hand, Ms C Black who appeared for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, pointed to Mr Milson's criminal and traffic record. Mr Felton had to be realistic in acknowledging the impact of that record. Mr Milson has never held a driver's licence apart from a learner licence which he obtained back in the early 1990s. He has been convicted of no fewer than six offences of driving whilst disqualified from holding a licence. He has been given prison sentences in respect of those, one or two of which were ordered to be served by way of suspended sentence. He has spent time in custody before for this type of crime. 

5Ms Black pointed out - and Mr Felton acknowledged - that Mr Milson, at the time that he committed the two offences that I am sentencing him for, was on bail on an earlier charge of driving whilst disqualified. Ms Black argued that Mr Milson's criminal record, especially his traffic record, was such that it should be regarded as an aggravating factor in my sentencing consideration and emphasised the importance of specific deterrence and general deterrence as well. I think she is correct in that submission. I would also regard it as important to take into account the protection of the public from a person who rides without ever having obtained an official licence. 

6The driving whilst disqualified was a relatively straightforward offence. It was not a particularly serious example. He rode his motorbike across to a friend's place and then rode it away. However the police pursuit had to be terminated. The police pursuit occurred in circumstances where the traffic was busy because it was peak hour. 

7The real issue in this case is whether I can accede to Mr Felton's submission that his client should serve his prison sentence in some way other than in full-time custody. I cannot order that or allow that because of the seriousness of his driving record. He has had prison sentences before. He is a menace on the road, riding without proper training and indeed on this occasion forcing the police to pursue him. He reached speeds of up to and over 100 kilometres an hour in a 60 kilometre per hour speed zone. A person with his driving record cannot expect otherwise than a gaol sentence.

8When he was sentenced by the magistrate he received, as I said, 10 months for the driving whilst disqualified and 12 months for the police pursuit offence. I do not propose to impose sentences which are as high as that. I take into account the evidence which Mr Milson gave about the likelihood of him being in maximum security when he is in custody because included in his record is an offence of escape or attempted escape. He has also recently assumed additional family responsibilities and has, to his credit, changed his life around significantly in the last few years. In addition he has been the subject of bail conditions which required regular reporting.

9I regard an appropriate sentence for the driving whilst disqualified as one of 5 months imprisonment and I regard an appropriate sentence for the police pursuit offence as one of 6 months imprisonment. I think it is right to accumulate them to some extent and I would accumulate them by 3 months so that the overall sentence is 9 months imprisonment and I would fix a non-parole period of 5 months imprisonment. 

HIS HONOUR: Now, two things. One is the date from which I fix the sentence. There is some previous time in custody. Remember this is a fresh sentencing exercise.
FELTON: That's right. There was 2 months spent or 2 months taken into account by the learned magistrate when imposing the sentence for the driving whilst disqualified. My understanding, I haven't got that exhibit in front of me--
HIS HONOUR: I read that.
FELTON: --but it was a 12 month fixed term but 2 months taken into account so when the learned magistrate was doing the sentencing exercise it was effectively--
HIS HONOUR: Yes, he reduced it by 2 months. 
FELTON: Yes, that's right. So in terms of the start date, in my submission 2 months should be--
HIS HONOUR: I need to take that into account.
FELTON: Yes, that's right.
HIS HONOUR: Well I have in mind to backdate it by 2 months.
FELTON: Yes, thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Ms Black?
BLACK: Everything my friend has said is correct. Your Honour has referred to the learned magistrate's sentence as being a period of 10 months. That's initially how your Honour commenced the judgment. Perhaps - well the actual sentence imposed by the magistrate was in fact 12 months backdated, taking 2 months into account. Your Honour, my submission is that the sentence should start from today.
HIS HONOUR: I understand, yes. All right, I propose to backdate it. If you'd stand up Mr Milson now.

10In respect of the driving whilst disqualified offence I sentence you to 5 months imprisonment. That will commence on 28 June 2013 and expire on 27 November 2013. In respect of the offence involving the police pursuit I sentence you to 6 months imprisonment. That will commence on 28 September 2013 and will expire on 27 March 2014. I fix a non-parole period of 5 months which will commence on 28 June 2013 and will expire on 27 November, 2013. The first date upon which you will be - no, in a moment I will direct your release on 27 November 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: Now can I do what I just did, that is I have fixed two sentences and one non-parole period. I don't think I can. I think I've got to aggregate them. What do you think?
BLACK: I think your Honour has to either allocate the non-parole period to one of the particular sentences or make an order that it's an aggregate sentence.
HIS HONOUR: I think you're right.
FELTON: I agree with my friend, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right. 

11I propose to aggregate the two sentences. The sentence I would have imposed in respect of the driving whilst disqualified is 5 months. The sentence I would have imposed in respect of the police pursuit offence is 6 months. I would have accumulated them so that the overall sentence is 9 months. I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of the two offences of 9 months imprisonment. It commenced on 28 June 2013 and will expire on 27 March 2014. I fix a non-parole period of 5 months to commence 28 June 2013 and to expire 27 November 2013. 

12Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) I make an order directing the release of Mr Milson on parole on 27 November 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: Now any conditions of parole? Both of you have a think about it. I must say I'm not sure that he needs supervision. I don't know, what do you think, Ms--
BLACK: Well, your Honour, this touches on the point that I raised earlier that I'm not sure that Probation and Parole can offer any service to prevent Mr Milson from riding his motorcycle or driving a motor vehicle. 
HIS HONOUR: I think you're right. I think he just has to be on unsupervised parole and if he breaches the parole he knows the consequences.
BLACK: Unless, your Honour, of course has concerns about his drug use.
HIS HONOUR: I'm making it good behaviour. No, I'm not concerned - I mean the evidence is that he's - have you finished the methadone or are you still on methadone?
APPELLANT: Your Honour, I actually - when I was in custody in 2006 at Bathurst I was on methadone for two months and I haven't had nothing since.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, that's what I thought. Have a seat. No, I'm not concerned about that. I'll make it a general good behaviour one and the usual standard orders, conditions. Unless either of you thinks I should.
BLACK: Nothing comes to mind.
HIS HONOUR: I think he's got his hands full. He's got prospect of employment with the construction company DigSmart. He's got a partner and a little girl. He'll have his hands full when he comes out. 
FELTON: Yes, your Honour, I can't offer anything other than the Traffic Offenders Program but I don't think your Honour can make an order in respect of that. 
HIS HONOUR: Now have I made it difficult - I'm just looking at the Correctional Services officers - have I made it difficult now? Mr Milson will stay here for the time being. You're right. Good, thank you. 

13Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing the release of Mr Milson on parole on 27 November 2013. The conditions of the parole are these:
(1)That he be of good behaviour; 
(2)That he attend Court if he receives a notice to do so; 
(3)That he notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in his address.

HIS HONOUR: So Mr Milson I have effectively halved - well more than halved your sentence. I've taken into account the maximum security conditions and your family and the fact that you've been on bail. You have been very lucky. The prosecutor had some very good arguments for it being increased but it does seem to me that you've made a change in your ways but I have to send you to gaol because of what you did, I've got no choice. I wouldn't be discharging my duty if I didn't. So you'll go to gaol, you'll come out in November and then it's up to you. If what Mr Felton says is right and you've reached the crossroads then you can get on with your life with your partner and your daughter. It's up to you but you've got to do your time for what you did.
APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour, thank you.
HIS HONOUR: And the good behaviour you understand, if you breach that whilst you're on parole you're in trouble. You've got to turn up to court if you get a notice and you must let the Registrar of the Court know where you're living.
APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: All right, thank you. Good luck.
BLACK: Your Honour, there is just the final issue of the disqualification period. According to Mr Milson's RTA record he has been disqualified - the last disqualification period he received dated from 11 May 2014 for a period of 2 years. The legislation at the time Mr Milson was charged--
HIS HONOUR: Just a second, yes, we've got to deal with your disqualification, so just -
APPELLANT: Sorry, yep.
HIS HONOUR: No, no, just wait there.
BLACK: Your Honour, there's a 2 year disqualification period that attaches to the offence of driving whilst disqualified. 
HIS HONOUR: Do I need to make any orders or is that automatic? Does it follow from the statute?
BLACK: No, I think your Honour is required to make the order.
FELTON: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: You both agreed on the period. 
BLACK: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: What's the order I make?
FELTON: It's a period of two years to date from the--
BLACK: Expiration of the existing disqualification which is 11 May 2016 so the current disqualification period to commence for two years from 12 May 2016.

14Mr Milson will be disqualified from obtaining a driver licence for 2 years from 12 May 2016. 

HIS HONOUR: Is that right?
BLACK: Yes, your Honour.
FELTON: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Thanks Ms Black and thank you Mr Felton. Ms Black I normally - and I will now direct that transcript be taken of the three judgments I delivered and the sentences. They'll take a few weeks so you'll just have to rely on notes I guess but at some stage they will become available.
BLACK: Thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you both for your assistance.

2762217,R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195,"Judgment

1THE COURT: This is a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences imposed upon the Respondent, Philip Nguyen, for offences of manslaughter and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

2On 15 March 2013, the Respondent was sentenced for the manslaughter of William Crews to imprisonment for 9 years and 6 months, comprising a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 8 September 2010 and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. 

3On the charge of wounding William Crews with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the Respondent was sentenced to an entirely concurrent term of imprisonment of 6 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months to date from 8 September 2010 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months.

4Accordingly, the total effective sentence for both offences was imprisonment for 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years.

5The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s.18(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. There is no standard non-parole period prescribed for this offence. The maximum penalty for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is imprisonment for 25 years: s.33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. A standard non-parole period of 7 years is prescribed for this offence.

6In sentencing the Respondent for manslaughter, the sentencing Judge took into account, on a Form 1, an offence of possession of a prohibited firearm contrary to s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996. If prosecuted separately, this offence was punishable by imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years would apply.

Grounds of Appeal

7On 27 March 2013, the Crown filed a Notice of Appeal to this Court. The Crown relied upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a) Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the manslaughter offence.

(b) Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred in failing to sentence in accordance with the finding made as to the objective seriousness of the wounding with intent offence.

(c) Ground 3 - the sentencing Judge erred in the approach to the totality principle in determining that the overall criminality could be comprehended by the sentence for manslaughter.

(d) Ground 4 - the sentences are manifestly inadequate.

8In approaching the grounds of appeal, it should be kept in mind, as the sentencing Judge observed correctly, that the ""unusual, even unique, factual circumstances"" of the case presented the Court ""with a challenging sentencing exercise"": R v Nguyen [2013] NSWSC 197 at [70].

Facts of Offences

9Constable William Crews was a 26-year old member of the New South Wales Police Force at the time of his death on 8 September 2010. As will be seen, he was engaged in operational police activities as part of the lawful execution of a search warrant at the time of the tragic events on 8 September 2010.

10The sentencing Judge made factual findings for the purpose of sentence by reference to a Crown case summary agreed for that purpose. Her Honour recited at [9]-[17]:

""[9] In September 2010 the offender lived at a unit complex at Bankstown. He also had use of a garage numbered 8 in the basement car park to the complex.

[10] On 8 September 2010 Detective Senior Constable Roberts, attached to the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad, received information from a registered source as a consequence of which a search warrant was applied for in relation to the offender's residential unit and Garage 8. The warrant was issued later that day. Detective Senior Constable Roberts was the officer-in-charge of the execution of the warrant. Prior to the deployment of the police officers who were to assist in the execution of the warrant, Detective Senior Constable Roberts conducted a briefing which was attended by those officers, including Constable Crews.

[11] Of the eight police officers deployed to execute the warrant, three were in police uniform. The remaining officers, including Constable Crews and Detective Senior Constable Roberts, were in civilian clothes. Some or all of the officers were armed with police issue weapons. Constable Crews was armed, as was Detective Senior Constable Roberts. The operation was, however, deemed to be of low risk. It was not anticipated that there would be firearms in the offender's premises or at his disposal.

[12] Police arrived at the unit complex and effected entry at approximately 9 pm. Access was obtained with the assistance of a resident who directed police to Garage 8. The basement area was accessed through a closed door from inside the unit complex.

[13] Detective Senior Constable Roberts led the officers into the basement followed by Constable Crews. Detective Senior Constable Roberts was carrying a battering ram in the event that it was necessary to force entry to the garage. Constable Crews was carrying a folder containing the warrant and related documents. Another police officer gave directions to Garage 1 in the mistaken belief it was Garage 8.

[14] Earlier that day the offender was party to discussions in the garage area of the unit complex about a drug deal in which Tan Chung, an associate of the offender, was involved with three other men. These men also discussed an existing drug debt where Chung owed money to one of the men after that man had supplied him with drugs the previous day. The men left the garage shortly before police arrived. The offender and Chung remained. They were inside Garage 1, the door to which was open when police arrived. Three other men were inside Garage 8 behind a closed mesh door.

[15] Constable Crews and Detective Senior Constable Roberts walked towards Garage 1, mistakenly believing it was Garage 8. Other officers, also in civilian clothes, were close behind. Uniformed police were further behind, including the officer tasked with recording the execution of the search warrant. No officer had a firearm drawn. Police (including Constable Crews) signalled their approach to Garage 1 by announcing they were police a number of times.

[16] Detective Senior Constable Roberts then heard Constable Crews, who was the only police officer in front of him, yell out, 'Gun, he has a gun'. He then saw the offender walking out of Garage 1 in a crouched position holding a pistol which he was pointing in various directions, including in the direction of police. The offender then started moving towards the police. Police were unaware that Chung was hiding in Garage 1 or that there were other men in Garage 8.

[17] Constable Crews and Detective Senior Constable Roberts again identified themselves as police and directed the offender to put down the gun.""

11At this stage, according to the agreed facts, Detective Senior Constable Roberts was about four to five metres from the Respondent and Constable Crews was closer still. The garage area was well lit. The Respondent would have had a clear view of the approaching police officers, in particular, Constable Crews who was holding a folder of papers only. The sentencing Judge continued at [18]-[23]:

""[18] What followed was a sequence of five shots fired from three guns in the space of seconds. First, the offender discharged his pistol (later confirmed to be a Bryco Arms pistol loaded with .22 gauge ammunition) at Constable Crews which penetrated the soft tissue of his left upper arm. Constable Crews then discharged three shots in quick succession - effectively in the process of drawing his weapon after he had been shot by the offender. Ballistics later confirmed the shots fired by Constable Crews were discharged in random angulations to the ground. Detective Senior Constable Roberts, who had retreated with other police rearwards behind a side wall, then drew his weapon which he discharged at the offender. Ballistics later confirmed that the single shot from his weapon struck Constable Crews in the neck. This was a fatal wound. Detective Senior Constable Roberts told investigating police that the shot was not a carefully aimed shot, however, at the time he believed that his firearm was pointed at the offender who he was attempting to hit. All three weapons were later confirmed to be in working order.

[19] Immediately after Detective Senior Constable Roberts fired the shot he saw Constable Crews on the ground bleeding from the head. Constable Crews was later transferred to hospital by ambulance. Death was pronounced at 12.15 am the following morning.

[20] While Detective Senior Constable Roberts' attention was focused on the welfare of Constable Crews as he was lying prone in the open garage area, the other police officers maintained their position behind cover in the garage. Detective Senior Constable Roberts then saw the offender trying to use his firearm which appeared to be jammed, after which he picked up the battering ram from where it had been dropped and simulated its use as a gun by pointing it towards the officers, including Detective Senior Constable Roberts.

[21] The offender (and Chung) then retreated into the garage and eventually made their way to the offender's unit via a rear door. Police were not aware that the offender had left the basement and, believing he was still in the garage, made attempts to encourage him to surrender his firearm and present himself. When it was ultimately established that the offender was not in the basement, first aid was rendered to Constable Crews and the basement area was secured.

[22] Both in the garage after the shots were fired, on his way to the unit and once inside the unit the offender asserted repeatedly to Chung that the men were, what he describes as, 'fake police', and that he believed they thought he had money. Chung said he told the offender that the men were in fact police. The offender told his wife that someone was trying to break into the garage, and that he shot the man and he thought he was going to die. It is unclear whether he was aware that his shot had wounded the officer in the arm and unaware that the officer was shot a second time by someone else. Although this is an available inference it is irrelevant for sentencing purposes. It does, however, lend support to the Crown's submission that the atmosphere in the basement was infused with considerable tension and confusion, and that the exchange of shots were fired in very quick succession with Constable Crews falling to the ground injured in the process.

[23] The offender emptied the twelve bullets from the pistol and placed the magazine into the drain of the bathroom and placed the pistol on the veranda. At some stage he barricaded himself and the other occupants of the unit inside by placing furniture against the door. Police negotiators contacted him and negotiated his surrender. He was arrested and conveyed to Bankstown Police Station together with Chung and the other occupants of Garage 8 who were also arrested.""

12The sentencing Judge referred to matters raised by the Respondent in his recorded interview with police. The Respondent acknowledged that he was involved in a drug deal that evening. Her Honour said at [29]:

""The offender agreed to participate in a recorded interview after his arrest in the course of which he said that he and Chung went to the garage that evening to smoke some heroin. The offender said that at the time of the incident Chung was organising a drug deal involving eight ounces of cocaine. In the agreed facts it is said that the offender falsely claimed to police that he was not involved in the transaction from which I infer that the offender accepts that he was in fact involved. The extent of his involvement was not the subject of any further elaboration.""

13The Respondent told police of an attempted robbery some two weeks earlier and his obtaining of a firearm as a consequence. The sentencing Judge said at [30]:

""In the interview the offender told police that whilst he was inside the garage he heard a lot of people shouting and screaming and saw two men standing at the entrance to the front of the garage who he believed were there to rob him. Police later confirmed by enquiries independent of the offender and his family that approximately two weeks prior to the shooting he was the victim of an attempted robbery by two masked men armed with bats whilst he was in Garage 8. On that occasion the offender shouted at the men (apparently to ward them off) and they fled, leaving behind a mobile phone which police located during the search of the premises on 8 September 2010 and were able to trace. The offender reported to his wife that the robbers had cricket bats. He told police the robbers had knives. It is not in dispute that the offender obtained the pistol after this incident to protect himself in the event of another robbery. There is no evidence as to whether the robbers were looking for drugs or money or both.""

14Finally, the sentencing Judge recounted, at [31], the Respondent's earlier experience of police executing a search warrant:

""Although the offender also agreed that he was aware from a previous search warrant executed on his premises that police officers engaged in operations of that kind do not always wear police uniform, there is no evidence as to the circumstances in which the earlier warrant was applied for and executed, or when that occurred relative to the shooting.""

The Basis of the Respondent's Plea of Guilty to Manslaughter 

15The sentencing Judge recited the basis of the Respondent's plea of guilty to manslaughter at [32]-[34]:

""[32] For the purposes of the sentence proceedings it was the agreed position that the plea of guilty to manslaughter involves the offender accepting that he caused the death of Constable Crews despite the single shot he fired penetrating Constable Crews' upper arm and the fatal shot being fired by another police officer.

[33] The issue of causation was conceded by his acceptance of the proposition that the discharge of the pistol (which caused the wound the subject of the wounding charge) substantially contributed to the exchange of gunfire in the course of which Constable Crews was fatally shot by a fellow officer, and in circumstances where it was reasonably foreseeable that someone in the vicinity of an exchange of gun fire may be fatally (even if inadvertently) shot.

[34] The plea of guilty to manslaughter also entails the Crown accepting the reasonable possibility that the offender genuinely believed that it was necessary to shoot at the person who proved to be Constable Crews in order to defend himself (based as it was on his mistaken belief that the officer was someone who was intent on robbing him and someone who might have posed a serious risk to his safety). It also entails acceptance by the offender that a reasonable person in his position would not have considered that it was necessary to shoot that person in defence of himself or his property.""

16The Respondent's plea of guilty to the s.33(1)(a) offence was touched upon by the sentencing Judge at [35]:

""The plea of guilty to the charge of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm entails acceptance of the fact that the offender shot at Constable Crews intending to cause him grievous bodily harm and that he wounded him in the process. Given the offender's concession that his response to the presence of men he believed might rob or harm him was not reasonable, self-defence was not available as a defence to that charge.""

17The Crown's acceptance of the Respondent's plea of guilty to manslaughter upon the basis of excessive self-defence was a repeated theme of the sentencing proceedings. 

18In the course of oral submissions, the Senior Crown Prosecutor said (T21.36, 8 March 2013):

""So far as remorse is concerned, and what's in the presentence report, what we submit is this; he has restated to the parole officer that at the time of the offence he felt threatened and that he was going to be killed. That of course is the reason why this is not a murder charge, it's a manslaughter charge. So that is not, we would submit, a mitigating feature, it's the reason why it's a manslaughter charge.""

19The Crown written submissions on sentence included the following proposition (Further Crown Submissions on Sentence, 13 March 2013, page 1):

""The Crown points out that had the accused known that William Crews and the other men were in fact police officers, this would have been a murder case rather than manslaughter. The acceptance of the plea to manslaughter by the Crown is precisely because the accused did not know (or the Crown cannot prove that he did know) that the men were police.""

20At first instance and on appeal, Mr Ledinh, for the Respondent, did not challenge these Crown submissions nor seek to contradict the explanation as to the basis upon which the Respondent had pleaded guilty to manslaughter. As will be seen, this aspect is of significance to the first ground of appeal.

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances

21A presentence report was tendered on sentence, with that report providing the basis for findings made concerning the Respondent's subjective circumstances. In addition, the Respondent gave short evidence confined to an expression of remorse.

22The Respondent was born in Vietnam in 1955 and was aged 55 years at the time of the present offences. He is one of 13 children. He arrived in Australia as a refugee in 1978 and worked as a factory process worker and in manufacturing.

23The Respondent married in 1982 and had three children, aged between 15 and 26 years at the time of sentence. He and his wife divorced in 1996. 

24The Respondent married again in 2001, with his wife arriving from Vietnam in 2003. The Respondent informed the Probation and Parole officer that he had separated from his second wife after entering custody for these offences.

25The Respondent's first wife was murdered in 2001 and he thereafter assumed care for his children from that marriage.

26The Respondent's criminal history included appearances before the Dandenong Magistrates' Court in Victoria in 1999 on charges of theft, in relation to which he was ordered to perform 200 hours' community service and to pay compensation in the sum of $53,918.00. In 2003, the Respondent was sentenced in the Melbourne County Court to 18 months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, upon charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception and receiving stolen goods. In addition, he was ordered to pay compensation in the sum of $293,967.00. 

27On 17 July 2006, the Respondent was sentenced in the Sydney District Court on a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, to a term of imprisonment for three years commencing on 14 July 2006 with a non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 13 January 2008. 

28The Respondent had been a user of heroin and crystal methamphetamine from the time of his first wife's death in 2001 and was still using both drugs at the time of the offences. He had been directed by the Probation and Parole Service to address his drug use whilst on parole in 2008-2009, but without success. The presentence report recorded that the Respondent's ""overall response to supervision was considered to be superficial as he failed to attend any of the recommended programs, thus failing to address his offending behaviour"".

29The sentencing Judge did not find that there were favourable prospects of rehabilitation (at [63]). Although the Respondent had suffered a stroke in November 2012, the sentencing Judge concluded that neither his health nor his age indicated that his time in custody would be more onerous (at [64]). 

30The sentencing Judge declined to make a finding of special circumstances (at [66]).

31The sentencing Judge applied a 10 per cent discount to reflect the Respondent's pleas of guilty (at [10]).

32Her Honour accepted that there was an expression of remorse by the Respondent, but indicated that its weight as a mitigating factor, to a large extent, was overwhelmed by the collective weight of the aggravating features of the offences (at [65]).

Objective Seriousness, Concurrency and Totality

33For reasons to be considered in greater detail by reference to the first and second grounds of appeal, the sentencing Judge held that both offences were of significant objective seriousness. 

34After identification of the sentences which should attach to the individual offences, the sentencing Judge determined that the sentences should be entirely concurrent. This aspect has given rise to the third ground of appeal. 

Ground 1 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in the Assessment of the Objective Seriousness of the Manslaughter Offence

Submissions of the Parties

35The Crown accepted that the sentencing Judge had addressed correctly the pertinent features that informed the objective seriousness of the crime of manslaughter. However, challenge was made to the mechanism by which the sentencing Judge determined that this case did not fall within the worst case category.

36The Crown relied upon s.21A(2)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as a factor bearing upon the objective seriousness of the Respondent's offences. Section 21A(2)(a) provides:

""(2) Aggravating factors

The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

(a) the victim was a police officer, emergency services worker, correctional officer, judicial officer, council law enforcement officer, health worker, teacher, community worker, or other public official, exercising public or community functions and the offence arose because of the victim's occupation or voluntary work, ...""

37The sentencing Judge considered whether s.21A(2)(a) required knowledge or belief on the part of an offender that the victim fell within one of the nominated categories, in this case, a police officer exercising public functions with the offence arising because of the victim's occupation. 

38In reasoning which is not challenged in this Court, her Honour ruled that knowledge or belief that the victim fell into one of the designated categories was not essential to attract s.21A(2)(a), with that statutory aggravating factor capable of applying if it was reasonably foreseeable to the offender that the victim fell into such a category. The sentencing Judge said at [52]-[53]:

""[52] As I see it, accepting as I must that the offender might actually have believed that the police officers were robbers (indeed, even accepting that he actually held that belief), I am also entitled to find that he could equally have reasonably foreseen that men approaching him in the basement car park might not be robbers. This conclusion is open since it appears to have been conceded by him in the statement of agreed facts that he heard the men announce that they were police but because he thought they were robbers pretending to be police, he obtained his pistol and fired it at one of them without ascertaining whether they were in fact police.

[53] In the result, I propose to take into account s 21A(2)(a) as an aggravating factor in the assessment of objective seriousness, not because the offender knew or believed that Constable Crews was a police officer, but because he ought reasonably to have foreseen the possibility that he might be. Whilst the feature of aggravation put in this way is of slightly less weight than were he to have been actually aware that the man he shot at was a police officer, it does aggravate the objective seriousness of both offences to a significant degree.""

39In support of the first ground of appeal, the Crown contended that the sentencing Judge fell into error in the underlined portion of [57] set out hereunder:

""[57] In conclusion, I accept that the offender was unaware that Constable Crews was a police officer when he shot him and that, although he did not fire the shot that killed Constable Crews, he caused his death. I also accept that when he discharged the pistol that caused his death and the wounding he had a genuine belief (entirely misplaced) that he needed to defend himself against a perceived threat of harm. Notwithstanding those findings, the circumstances in which the offences were committed, including the aggravating factors to which I have referred, render both offences objectively serious. I am not persuaded, however, that either offence is in the worst category. It would have been otherwise were the offender to have shot at Constable Crews intending to inflict grievous bodily harm knowing or believing he was a police officer, or were he with that same state of awareness to have pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis that Constable Crews was killed by his unlawful and dangerous act in shooting at him.""

40The Crown submits that, to the extent that the sentencing Judge used the absence of knowledge or belief by the Respondent of the victim being a police officer as the basis to reduce the perceived seriousness of the offence of manslaughter, error was demonstrated. Had the Respondent known or believed that the victim was a police officer, the Crown submitted that he would not have been able legitimately to rely upon an entirely misplaced but genuine belief that he needed to act as he did to defend himself from a perceived harm. In these circumstances, the appropriate charge would have been murder rather than manslaughter.

41In approaching this issue in this way, the Crown submitted that the comparison of possible scenarios referred to at [57] of the remarks on sentence involved error in accordance with the principles in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 at 389. 

42To the extent that the sentencing Judge had evidently assessed the seriousness of the manslaughter offence by factoring in this distinction, it was submitted there would of necessity had been some mitigation of the assessment of objective seriousness. The apparent point of distinction introduced a hierarchy into the assessment between the two possible scenarios that operated in an impermissible way in favour of the Respondent. By factoring into the range of offending, a circumstance that was outside the scope of the offence, it was submitted that the sentencing Judge had reduced erroneously the objective seriousness of the manslaughter offence. 

43As a result, the Crown submitted that the Respondent's manslaughter offence was assessed as being at a lower level of objective seriousness than its true position.

44Submissions advanced for the Respondent did not seek to challenge this analysis, nor the suggested error which the Crown asserted had been revealed. Rather, the submission concentrated upon the discretionary nature of an assessment of objective seriousness.

Decision

45In imposing sentence, a Judge is entitled to consider all the conduct of the offender, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted conviction for a more serious offence: The Queen v De Simoni at 389 (Gibbs CJ).

46The sentencing proceedings were conducted upon the basis that what would otherwise have rendered the Respondent liable to conviction for murder ought be reduced to manslaughter as the Crown could not negative the Respondent's belief that his conduct was necessary to defend himself, although the conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them: s.421 Crimes Act 1900. In these circumstances, the Respondent was guilty of manslaughter and the Respondent's plea was approached upon this basis. 

47If the Respondent had known or believed that he was shooting at a police officer, the basis upon which he was rendered liable to conviction for manslaughter, and not murder, would have been removed.

48If the Respondent stood for sentence for the murder of a police officer exercising public functions with the offence arising because of the victim's occupation, the maximum penalty would have been imprisonment for life: s.19A(1), (3). A standard non-parole period of 25 years would have applied: s.54A(1); Item 1A, Table of Standard Non-Parole Periods, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The provision permitting a mandatory life sentence for the murder of a police officer contained in s.19B Crimes Act 1900 could not apply to the Respondent's case as it extends only to offences committed after 23 June 2011.

49Claims of breaches of the De Simoni principle occur from time to time in the context of the escalating statutory scheme for assault and wounding offences in the Crimes Act 1900, where it is said that a sentencing court has taken into account, as an aggravating factor, a circumstance that would warrant conviction for a more serious offence. A sentencing court is entitled to consider all the conduct of the offender, but cannot take into account, as an aggravating factor, circumstances which would have warranted conviction for a more serious offence: McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305; 198 A Crim R 549 at 557 [34]. 

50The De Simoni principle would be breached as well if, for example, the sentencing court took into account the absence of grievous bodily harm in assessing the objective seriousness of an offender for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

51The sentencing of offenders for public justice offences lying within the statutory hierarchy of offences contained in Part 7 Crimes Act 1900 has also given rise to breaches of the De Simoni principle: R v Mobbs [2005] NSWCCA 371 at [30]-[33]. This Court has held that in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence of influencing a witness under s.323(a) Crimes Act 1900, it was wrong to have regard to the absence of a feature (the absence of threats) which, if it were present, would constitute a different and more serious offence of threatening to cause injury or detriment to a person intending to influence a person as a witness contrary to s.322(a) Crimes Act 1900: R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128 at [66], [89]-[90].

52We are satisfied that error of this type has been demonstrated in this case. For the purpose of assessing the objective seriousness of the Respondent's crime of manslaughter, it was erroneous to have regard to the absence of a factor which, if it existed, would have rendered the Respondent guilty of murder. In this way, an extraneous or irrelevant consideration has affected the sentencing decision: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.

53An additional difficulty arises in the remarks on sentence at [57], where reference is made to a different approach being available if the Respondent had ""pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis that Constable Crews was killed by his unlawful and dangerous act in shooting at him"". This distinction had not been adverted to at the sentencing hearing. As mentioned in the course of argument before this Court (T3-4, 31 July 2013), it is difficult to see how the act of shooting at a police officer with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm could be characterised merely as an unlawful and dangerous act for the purpose of the law of manslaughter. This aspect is secondary to the Crown's principal complaint that a breach of the De Simoni principle has occurred in this case.

54The Crown has demonstrated error in the finding of reduced objective seriousness by reference to an impermissible factor. Accordingly, the first ground of appeal is made good.

Ground 2 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Failing to Sentence in Accordance With the Finding as to the Objective Seriousness of the Wounding With Intent Offence

Submissions of the Parties

55The sentencing Judge made a finding that the s.33(1)(a) offence (which carried a standard non-parole period of seven years) fell within the mid-range of offending. Her Honour said at [58]:

""To the extent that it is necessary to appoint the wounding charge within a range of offending because of the standard non-parole period that attaches to that offence, I am satisfied that it falls within the mid range of offending. Although the offender did not rely in submissions upon his mistaken belief that the police were robbers to ameliorate the seriousness of the wounding charge, it seems to me that some allowance should be made in the assessment of objective seriousness for that offence for the Crown's concession that his belief that the men were robbers was genuine (or that the Crown could not prove that it was not). Neither evidence nor submissions were directed to the nature of the wound and the extent of medical attention that would have been necessary to treat it. However, viewed from the limited perspective of the wound being to the inner aspect of Constable Crews' arm and measuring two millimetres in diameter, I am unable to conclude that the wound was serious. What justifies a finding of mid range offending is that a gun was used accompanied by an intention of causing grievous bodily harm, aggravated by the statutory factors to which I have referred.""

56The Crown did not seek to challenge this finding. Rather, the Crown submitted that it was difficult to reconcile the non-parole period and head sentence fixed for this offence with the finding of objective seriousness and other factors operating on sentence for this crime.

57In circumstances where there was a finding that the offence lay within the mid-range of offending, and where there was little operating subjectively in favour of the Respondent apart from the 10 per cent discount for his plea of guilty and a finding of remorse with limited effect, it was submitted that the fixing of a head sentence of six years and three months with a non-parole period of four years and nine months did not reflect the findings otherwise made by the sentencing Judge.

58The Crown noted that no finding of special circumstances had been made and thus no adjustment had been made to the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence.

59Whilst recognising the need to avoid erroneous reliance upon the standard non-parole period in breach of the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the Crown submitted that the significance of the standard non-parole period in this case was greater than in cases where an offender has a stronger subjective case, so that greater weight ought to have been placed upon the standard non-parole period as a statutory guidepost on sentence: AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 160 

60The Crown pointed to the judgment in Muldrock v The Queen at 132 [29], where the Court observed that the obligation to record reasons in s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required a sentencing Judge to identify the facts, matters and circumstances which the Judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached upon the appropriate sentence to be imposed. The Crown submitted that the remarks on sentence revealed a contrast between the myriad of factors to support the finding of mid-range offending with few factors which may dilute the significance of the standard non-parole period as a marker or guidepost on sentence. Viewed in this way, the Crown submitted that the sentencing discretion miscarried with respect to this offence with the sentence imposed being inconsistent with the finding of objective seriousness.

61The Respondent submitted that the sentence imposed for this offence lay within the proper exercise of discretion of the sentencing Judge and that no error had been demonstrated.

Decision

62In approaching this ground of appeal, it is necessary to keep in mind the confines of the permissible use of the standard non-parole period in view of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen. The standard non-parole period and the maximum sentence are two legislative guideposts, with the objective seriousness of an offence to be assessed wholly by reference to the nature of the offending: Muldrock v The Queen at 132 [27]. 

63There is force in the Crown submission that the standard non-parole period may be a more significant factor on sentence of an offender where there is little operating in the offender's favour on sentence. Its significance in a particular case may vary. In Muldrock v The Queen, it was said that the standard non-parole period said ""little about the appropriate sentence for this mentally retarded offender and this offence"": Muldrock v The Queen at 133 [32]. In other cases, its significance may well be greater: AB v R at [51]. The present case falls into the latter category.

64The Crown submission, in effect, is that greater weight should have been given in this case to the standard non-parole period attaching to the s.33(1)(a) offence.

65This Court has, on more than one occasion, expressed the need for caution where a ground of appeal seeks to challenge the weight that is given to a particular factor on sentence: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49; 219 A Crim R 550 at [25]. 

66It has been suggested that a ground asserting that a particular feature has not been given sufficient regard or sufficient weight by a sentencing Judge is, in truth, a particular of a ground asserting that the sentence is manifestly excessive (or inadequate), with the only way of testing the proposition being to examine the sentence ultimately imposed, with such an approach leading to consideration of the outcome, and not process: Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220 at [33] (Button J, Hoeben JA and Johnson J agreeing). 

67In this case, the finding of objective seriousness (mid-range offending), and the very limited nature of other matters to be taken into account as part of the instinctive synthesis, suggests error in the sentencing outcome given the non-parole period and head sentence imposed, where the statutory guideposts laid down a standard non-parole period of seven years and a maximum sentence of 25 years' imprisonment. 

68In a case such as this, it may be said that the standard non-parole period has greater significance, and that the reasons required under s.54B(4) should articulate a basis upon which the ultimate sentencing outcome may be understood in the context of these statutory guideposts. The reasons in this case do not assist in understanding the sentence imposed for the s.33(1)(a) offence against the finding of mid-range offending.

69A means of testing this ground of appeal is to look at the sentence ultimately imposed, in accordance with the approach suggested in Hanania v R. In this way, this ground of appeal overlaps with the claim of manifest inadequacy in the fourth ground.

70We prefer to approach this ground as a submission in support of the fourth ground. The ground does not require further separate consideration.
 

Ground 3 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in the Approach to the Totality Principle in Determining that the Overall Criminality Could be Comprehended by the Sentence for Manslaughter

Submissions of the Parties

71The Crown submitted to the sentencing Judge that there should be a measure of accumulation as between the two sentences. Her Honour rejected this submission, explaining the approach taken at [69]:

""After having given careful consideration to the principled approach in the authorities, I do not propose to order that the sentences be partially accumulated. I have come to that conclusion for the following reason. For sentencing purposes, I am invited to accept that the offender caused the death of the Constable Crews when the shot fired by Detective Senior Constable Roberts penetrated his neck and that, literally seconds before, the offender had inflicted a gunshot wound. Although the consequences of the offender's criminal act are different (in that the bullet he fired caused a wounding while the bullet he caused to be fired caused a death), the same criminal conduct is common to both offences. Detective Senior Constable Roberts has no criminal liability for firing the fatal shot. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the total criminality constituted by his offending can be comprehended by the sentence for the manslaughter, which I accept is the more serious offence by reason of the loss of life.""

72In this Court, the Crown submitted that error had been demonstrated and that this Court should proceed to resentence the Respondent, allowing for ""a modest degree of accumulation"" to reflect the different serious offending contained within the two offences. 

73The Crown submitted that there were two discrete offences committed that occurred as a result of interwoven but distinct acts. The Respondent fired at Constable Crews with intent to cause grievous bodily harm thereby causing a wound to his arm. This was a serious offence and this was complete once the wounding occurred. Within seconds, a number of further acts occurred, including Constable Crews firing three times and injuring no one and Detective Senior Constable Roberts firing once in the direction of the Respondent, but with the tragic result that Constable Crews was fatally shot in the neck. The sentencing Judge expressly found that Detective Senior Constable Roberts had no criminal liability for firing the fatal shot, so that it was the Respondent who bore the entire criminal liability for the shot that caused the death of Constable Crews. 

74The Crown submitted there were separate acts and separate consequences for which the Respondent was entirely responsible. To the extent that the sentencing Judge considered that the criminal conduct was common to both offences, the Crown submitted that her Honour omitted to acknowledge that there were in fact not just different consequences, but also different acts, albeit that Detective Senior Constable Roberts was responding to the same bullet being fired by the Respondent that caused the wounding.

75The Crown submitted that the nature and seriousness of the wounding offence were such that the sentence for manslaughter could not sufficiently comprehend the criminality involved in the s.33(1)(a) offence.

76It was submitted for the Respondent that the two offences formed part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, so that it was open to the sentencing Judge to impose entirely concurrent sentences in the circumstances of the case.

Decision

77Questions of concurrency and accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary: R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at 67 [7].

78Sentences are not to be made concurrent simply because of the similarity of the conduct or because it may be seen as part of the one course of criminal conduct. Rather, the question to be asked is - can the sentence for one offence encompass the criminality of all the offences?: R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [56]. 

79If the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentences ought to be concurrent, otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the totality of the two offences: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27]. If this is not the case, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is the risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so, regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality: Cahyadi v R at 47 [27]; R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38 at 48-49 [52].

80Public confidence in the administration of justice requires sentencing courts to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending: R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 164-165 [18].

81We accept the Crown's submission in support of this ground of appeal. Each of the Respondent's offences was a serious one carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment. The sentencing Judge determined that each offence was objectively serious. Although there was but a short period of time that passed between the offences, they were distinct offences caused by different bullets causing very different consequences. 

82We accept that the manslaughter offence was the more serious offence in the circumstances, which required a lengthier sentence having regard as well to the offence on the Form 1. 

83The nature and seriousness of the wounding offence was such that the sentence for manslaughter could not sufficiently comprehend the criminality involved in the s.33(1)(a) offence. A measure of accumulation was necessary.

84The Crown has made good the third ground of appeal.

Ground 4 - The Sentences Are Manifestly Inadequate

Submissions of the Parties

85The Crown submitted that the errors asserted in the first three grounds of appeal would feed in to the fourth ground of appeal, thereby fortifying a conclusion that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.

86Accepting the unusual circumstances of this case and the absence of other sentencing decisions which may assist the sentencing process, the Crown submitted that the circumstances of these offences were such that the sentences ultimately imposed were manifestly inadequate.

87The Crown submitted that the Respondent was in his garage area, having just been engaged in some capacity in a drug deal involving cocaine with other persons and that he was in possession of an unauthorised firearm. The offences occurred only about one year after the Respondent's parole period had expired on a sentence for supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The victim was a police officer acting in the execution of his duty. The sentencing Judge accepted that this was an aggravating feature for both offences. The victim's firearm was holstered. Due warning was rendered to the Respondent with the approaching police officers identifying themselves clearly as police. None were disguised. Within the range of scenarios of persons acting in misconceived self-defence, the Crown submitted that this must be regarded as a more serious example than that found by the sentencing Judge. 

88The Crown pointed to the need for the sentence on the manslaughter count to take into account as well the offence on the Form 1 which was independently serious.

89It was submitted for the Respondent that the Crown had not made good the claim of manifest inadequacy in the circumstances of the case.

Decision

90A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Court to be satisfied that the sentences imposed at first instance were unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].

91In this case, express errors have been established in accordance with the grounds of appeal which have been addressed. These findings may be called in aid by the Crown to support and explain how sentences were imposed which are said to be manifestly inadequate.

92The police officers in the present case, including Constable Crews, were acting in the lawful discharge of their duty to execute a search warrant on the premises in question. The police officers approached slowly and were not disguised. Detective Senior Constable Roberts was holding a battering ram. Constable Crews was holding a folder containing papers. The situation was markedly different to the Respondent's earlier experience where masked men had apparently approached holding cricket bats. Even then, the masked men fled when challenged by the Respondent. It was not unusual that police executing a search warrant were wearing plain clothes. The Respondent was aware from his own experience that police executing a search warrant may be dressed in plain clothes. 

93A loud announcement was made indicating that they were police and this was heard by the Respondent. The Respondent had just been involved in activities related to drug supply. He was carrying an unauthorised loaded firearm at that time and in that context. The Respondent crouched holding the pistol in the firing position. No police officer was holding a firearm at that time. The area was well lit. Constable Crews was less than four to five metres away from the Respondent, who would have had a clear vision of him holding only the folder of papers.

94Once again, police identified themselves and called upon the Respondent to drop his weapon. The Respondent chose to resort to immediate use of the firearm, shooting it at Constable Crews with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. What happened thereafter was entirely predictable, and involved understandable acts where police officers in the execution of their duty, having loudly and clearly announced their presence, came under fire from the Respondent in the manner which occurred.

95This was a most serious example of the crime of manslaughter. For reasons explained in the context of the first ground of appeal, the fact that the Respondent did not know or believe that the persons in the garage were police officers is not relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the manslaughter offence. 

96The sentencing Judge found that the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(a) operated as it was reasonably foreseeable that the persons were police officers (see [38] above). This approach is consistent with the common law principle that where an offender knows or ought to have known that the victim was discharging a public duty, such as a police officer acting in the execution of duty, this will operate as an aggravating factor on sentence and will attract as well considerations of specific and general deterrence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Arvanitidis [2008] VSCA 189; 202 A Crim R 300 at 314-315 [50]-[52]. 

97It was accepted by the Crown that the Respondent did not know that the men in the garage were police officers, as if he did there would be no excessive self-defence operating to render the charge of manslaughter appropriate in lieu of the charge of murder. That does not mean that it could not be taken into account that the Respondent ""ought to have known"" that the men were police officers. There is nothing inconsistent in taking this into account as an aggravating feature of the offence of manslaughter and it is worth reiterating that the approach of the sentencing Judge in finding that the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(a) applied because the Respondent ""ought reasonably to have foreseen the possibility"" that Constable Crews was a police officer was not challenged in this Court.

98This Court has emphasised the gravity of crimes committed against serving police officers and the need for specific and general deterrence in the imposition of sentences.

99In R v Hamilton (1993) 66 A Crim R 575, Gleeson CJ (Hunt CJ at CL and Ireland J agreeing) said at 581:

""... I should make it clear that offences against s 33B, which make it unlawful to use an offensive weapon or instrument with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, are regarded by the Court extremely seriously. It is incumbent upon the Court, in dealing with offences of this nature, to show an appropriate measure of support for police officers who undertake a difficult, dangerous and usually thankless task. The risks that were run by the police officers who were involved in the present case were substantial.""

100In Re Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 2 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 515; 137 A Crim R 196 at 203-204, Spigelman CJ (Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreeing) cited this passage from R v Hamilton. In the course of that judgment, Spigelman CJ said at 203 [22]:

""Offences involving assault of police officers in the execution of their duty are serious offences requiring a significant element of deterrence in the sentences to be imposed. The community is dependent to a substantial extent upon the courage of police officers for protection of lives, personal security and property. The Courts must support the police in the proper execution of their duties and must be seen to be supporting the police, and their authority in maintaining law and order, by the imposition of appropriate sentences in cases where assaults are committed against police.""
 
101The Chief Justice continued at 203-204 [26] and [28]:

""[26] As the facts of the cases summarised for the Court in the course of the present application indicate, significant risks are run by police officers throughout the State in the normal execution of their duties. The authority of the police, in the performance of their duties, must be supported by the courts. In cases involving assaults against police there is a need to give full weight to the objective of general deterrence and, accordingly, sentences at the high end of the scale, pertinent in the light of all the circumstances, are generally appropriate in such cases.

...

[28] The importance of supporting the police has been recognised by the Parliament in the recently enacted s21A, which identifies in s21A(2)(a), as the first of the list of aggravating factors, the fact that the victim was a police officer or one of a number of other persons performing public functions. This will be of significance for other offences against police, but the offence presently under consideration is, of course, specifically concerned with police.""

102These statements were made in the context of an application for a guideline judgment for the offence of assault police. The principles expressed are clearly apt to a case such as this, where greater violence is used (with fatal consequences) against a police officer in the execution of his duty.

103The sentencing Judge was referred to, and applied, the following statement by Spigelman CJ (Hidden and Buddin JJ agreeing) in R v Penisini [2004] NSWCCA 339 at [20]:

""The courts will, and do, give great weight to the protection of members of the police force by reason of the fact that in the course of their duties, they are called upon to place themselves in danger and do so for the benefit of the community at large. That is why the courts have always accepted that the fact that the victim was a police officer is a substantially aggravating factor.""

104These considerations are at the forefront of sentencing decisions for offences such as those committed by the Respondent. 

105The Form 1 offence of possession of a prohibited firearm, as the sentencing Judge acknowledged at [42]-[43] of the remarks on sentence, required greater weight to be given both to the need for personal deterrence and to the community's entitlement to exact retribution, and in that way to increase the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for the manslaughter offence: Re Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [39]-[42]. 

106Although no separate and distinct penalty may be imposed for the Form 1 offence, a ""longer, and in some cases significantly longer"" sentence may be imposed for the principal offence to which the Form 1 attaches, so as to demonstrate the greater need for personal deterrence and retribution: Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [22]-[23].

107In approaching the Form 1 matter in this case, it is necessary to keep in mind principles such as those summarised in R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43; 205 A Crim R 222 at 234 [73]:

""The legislature views possession of such an item seriously. The policy of the legislature evinced by the enactment of the offence in s 7(1) is to deter and punish possession of firearms per se: R v Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 at [14]. The courts must seek to implement the legislative policy to control the possession of firearms in the community 'by honest citizens and not simply to disarm the criminally minded' R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165 at [53]. As it happens, the Respondent was amongst the ranks of 'the criminally minded' through his drug supply activities.""

108It might be said that the present Respondent was also amongst the ranks of ""the criminally minded"", given the circumstances in which he chose to arm himself on this occasion.

109The fact that the pistol was loaded bore upon the seriousness of the Form 1 offence. The fact that the Respondent claimed that he possessed the loaded pistol for his own protection was not a matter of any real mitigation since the policy of the legislature was to act as a deterrent and to punish possession of a pistol per se. The rule of law, and the authority of courts, depend upon the proposition that persons do not, by illegal means, take their protection into their own hands: R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320-321 [88]. 

110Considerations such as these pointed to the seriousness of the Form 1 offence, so that the taking into account of that matter called for a significantly longer sentence being imposed for manslaughter. 

111The s.33(1)(a) offence was itself objectively grave, with the issue canvassed in the context of the second ground of appeal indicating that a lengthier sentence was warranted on that count.

112As noted earlier, the Respondent had little operating in his favour subjectively. The 10 per cent discount for his pleas of guilty and recognition of a measure of remorse operated in his favour. However, he could not claim the immaturity of youth as a factor in the commission of these offences. In his early 50s, he had served a period of imprisonment for a serious drug supply offence. He had recently completed his parole period. Having not been deterred from crime, he continued to be involved in drug activity and had armed himself, with the tragic and disastrous consequences which came to pass on the evening of 8 September 2010. 

113We are satisfied that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate so that the fourth ground of appeal has been made good.

Discretionary Factors and Resentencing

114If error was demonstrated, Mr Ledinh submitted that the Court, in the exercise of discretion, should not resentence the Respondent.

115It has been said that the primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons, so that this Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s.5D, had a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2]. This discretion may be exercised for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 24 [92], 25 [95], 33 [150].

116In support of the exercise of discretion, Mr Ledinh sought to emphasise the level of the Respondent's remorse. No affidavit or other evidentiary material was placed before the Court on the question of discretion or resentencing.

117We do not consider that there is any discretionary basis for this Court to decline to intervene and to resentence the Respondent. The issues ventilated in this appeal include matters of principle, and the conclusion has been reached that substantially different sentences ought be imposed upon the Respondent. It is in the interests of the administration of justice that the Court proceeds to resentence the Respondent.

118The objective gravity of the manslaughter offence is substantial and greater than that characterised by the sentencing Judge. There are limited subjective factors to be taken into account in the Respondent's favour. In addition, the nature and circumstances of the offence and the identity and occupation of the victim require a significant element of specific and general deterrence in the sentence to be passed. Further, the serious offence included on the Form 1 must be reflected in the sentence imposed. 

119For the offence of manslaughter, taking into account the Form 1 matter, and before application of the 10 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, a head sentence of 18 years' imprisonment is appropriate. 

120Allowing for the 10 per cent discount, the Respondent will be sentenced on this count to a term of imprisonment of 16 years and 2 months.

121For the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, before application of the 10 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, a sentence of imprisonment for 9 years is appropriate.

122Allowing for the 10 per cent discount (and with some rounding), the sentence imposed for the s.33(1)(a) offence will be one of imprisonment for 8 years and 1 month.

123Having regard to relevant principles with respect to accumulation, concurrency and totality, there ought be accumulation of 1 year. 

124Subject to what follows concerning the effect of accumulation, we agree with the conclusion of the sentencing Judge that special circumstances are not demonstrated in this case so as to warrant any adjustment of the ratio between the non-parole period and head sentence for each offence. 

125As a different view has been formed in this Court on the issue of accumulation, it is necessary to consider whether this additional factor warrants a finding of special circumstances and a modification in the statutory ratio: Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282; 217 A Crim R 151 at 157 [35]-[36]. 

126A minimum custodial component of 13 years is proposed against the overall effective sentence of 17 years and 2 months. That represents 74.7 per cent of the overall term. No finding of special circumstances is required. The sentences to be imposed upon the Respondent will see a significant period of conditional liberty being available upon the expiration of the effective non-parole period. In our view, no lesser effective non-parole period than one comprising 13 years is appropriate as the period of mandatory custody for these crimes having regard to all the purposes of punishment: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 717 [59]; Hejazi v R at 157 [36].

127The Respondent has been in custody since 8 September 2010 and it is appropriate that the first operative sentence date from that day. 

128The Court makes the following orders:

(a) Crown appeal allowed;

(b) sentences imposed in the Supreme Court on 15 March 2013 are quashed;

(c) in their place, 

(i) for the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 8 September 2010 and expiring on 7 September 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years and 1 month commencing on 8 September 2016 and expiring on 7 October 2018,

(ii) on the count of manslaughter, and taking into account the offence on the Form 1, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 8 September 2011 and expiring on 7 September 2023, with a balance of term of 4 years and 2 months commencing on 8 September 2023 and expiring on 7 November 2027,
 
(d) the earliest date upon which the Respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 8 September 2023.

2762221,Rundle v R [2013] NSWCCA 200,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 24 June 2011, following a six week jury trial in the District Court, the appellant was convicted of two counts on an indictment. He now appeals against the convictions. He does not seek leave to appeal against the non-custodial sentences subsequently imposed.

2Both counts on the indictment were laid under s 178BB(1) (since repealed) of the Crimes Act 1900. At the time the offences are alleged to have been committed, that sub-section provided as follows:

""178BB Obtaining money etc by false or misleading statements
(1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.""

3Each count alleged that the appellant, on or about 31 May 2004, with intent to obtain a financial advantage for Scots Church Development Pty Ltd [one of a group of companies of which the appellant was an employee], published a statement that he knew to be false or misleading in a material particular. Both charges arose out of a letter written by the appellant on 31 May 2004, which the Crown alleged contained two statements that were false or misleading in a material particular. The charges came to be referred to, respectively, as ""the mezzanine charge"" and ""the profit charge"". 

4The appellant did not give or call evidence. His response to the charges relied upon analysis of the extensive documentation in the Crown case. The appellant's case was and is that neither statement was, when properly read in the context of the voluminous correspondence and dealings that pre-dated the letter, proven to have been false or misleading, and that, even if either statement were to be so construed, it was not proven to have been false or misleading to the knowledge of the appellant. Critically important to the appellant's case is the context of previous correspondence and dealings between relevant participants.

5An issue also arises concerning the materiality of each of the two statements.

6The sole ground of appeal upon which the appellant relies is that the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. In order to deal with the ground, it is necessary to set out a good deal of background. A very large quantity of documentary material was in evidence.

Background

7In 2004, the appellant had for some time held the position of Chief Financial Controller of a group of companies known as ""The Westpoint Group"" (""Westpoint"") of which the principal was Mr Norman Carey. One of the companies in the group was Scots Church Development Pty Ltd (""SCD""). In July 2001 SCD purchased land in York Street, Sydney, on which stood a church (the Scots Church). SCD proposed to redevelop the site into a mixed commercial/residential complex to be called ""Portico"". From late 2002 Mr Luke Gregory was employed, on a contract basis, by Westpoint. His title was ""Senior Finance Manager"" or ""Senior Manager, Finance"" (T 424). 

8It was the task of the appellant and Mr Gregory to secure finance for the project. It was proposed that this be achieved by two means. The first was funds advanced by a financial institution, secured by first mortgage on the real estate. This was called ""senior debt"". In fact, $10 million had been advanced, by Colonial First State Investments Ltd and Perpetual Nominees (""Colonial/Perpetual""), for the purchase of the property. The second means of obtaining finance proposed was the raising of funds by invitation to the public to subscribe to an issue of fixed term promissory notes of not less than $50,000 each, which would be unsecured, but offered at an attractive interest rate. This was referred to as ""mezzanine debt"". Funds for mezzanine debt were to be raised by York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (""York Street Mezzanine""), a member of Westpoint, of which the appellant was secretary, and lent to SCD.

9In addition, Westpoint had contributed some funds. The $10 million purchase price incurred a GST of $865,000. The raising of the mezzanine funds, which commenced in 2002, incurred commissions payable to the fundraising agents, and interest which was payable monthly. There were also potential payments, known as ""kicker payments"" to be made in the event that SCD sought to extend the terms of the promissory notes. Other costs were also incurred in the preparation for the development, such as consultants' fees, council and other regulatory agency fees, and legal fees. These had been paid or were payable by SCD/Westpoint.

10It is necessary at this stage to set out a chronology of relevant events leading up to the letter of 31 May 2004, the foundation for the charges. 





Chronology

2002

11Some time before 30 June 2002 (see AB 762) SCD released an ""Information Memorandum"" (Ex C64), outlining its proposal to raise funds totalling $80 million for the Scots Church development. This was said to be made up of $60 million ""currently being arranged"" (senior debt), and $20 million by the issue of promissory notes (mezzanine debt). The Information Memorandum invited subscription to the promissory note issue. Although the document was not, and did not purport to be, a prospectus, it was at times referred to as such. 

12The invitation to investors was successful and significant sums were contributed by the members of the public.

13In late 2002 the appellant and Mr Gregory approached a number of lending institutions with a view to obtaining senior finance for the project. Eventually, at Mr Gregory's suggestion, the appellant made contact with Mr Brett Lennane of Capital Finance Australia Ltd (""CFAL""). CFAL was an unlisted public company based in NSW that provided commercial finance for property development and investment. It was a subsidiary of the Halifax Bank of Scotland plc (""HBoS""), which supervised CFAL's operations. Mr Lennane was the State Manager, Property and Finance in CFAL. He answered to Mr Rod O'Neill, the head of CFAL's Property and Finance Division. Ultimate decisions with respect to finance applications of the kind here in question lay with HBoS in Scotland. Mr Charles Maclaren was the Senior Director of Credit Risk in HBoS, and reviewed all finance applications from CFAL in Australia. 

14On 19 November 2002 a meeting took place between the appellant and Mr Lennane. What the appellant sought to do was have CFAL advance the sum of $70 million, $10 million of which would be applied towards discharging the existing debt to Colonial/Perpetual, which would then become incorporated in the single advance from CFAL. Following the meeting, Mr Lennane raised a number of queries about the proposal. 

15As a consequence, on 25 November 2002, the appellant wrote to Mr Lennane, answering various of those questions, and attaching what he called a ""Static Analysis"" which, he said, he believed provided ""an accurate estimate of the current project feasibility for the project"" (Ex D14, italics added).

The ""Static Analysis"" was the first of a number of documents of similar format. It will be necessary in due course to have regard to some of the later like documents.

16Essentially, in the Static Analysis, the appellant attempted to demonstrate to Mr Lennane how the project would be funded, if CFAL acceded to the finance application. The important issue for CFAL at that time was the relative contributions of SCD/Westpoint to the costs of the project - that is, of the total anticipated cost of the project, what would be funded by ""debt"" (that is, from the CFAL loan, assuming that it eventuated) and what would be funded by ""equity"" (that is, by SCD/Westpoint). The Static Analysis showed that the appellant proposed that cost items such as GST on the acquisition costs (purchase), construction costs of $11.7 million, consultants' fees and various others, would be paid by SCD/Westpoint. To be paid out of any CFAL loan was the $10 million acquisition (purchase) price, $53 million plus construction costs and contingencies, and interest of $5.4 million - a total of $70 million (an increase on the $10 million that had been signalled as borrowings in the Information Memorandum). It seems reasonably plain that ""Equity"" to be provided by SCD/Westpoint included the funds raised by mezzanine debt.

17The Static Analysis showed that the total anticipated costs for the project were $93 million, of which $23 million would be contributed by SCD/Westpoint, and that costs of $20 million had already been paid or were payable. That figure included $1.6 million of the total anticipated construction costs of $65 million, $11.7 million of which were attributed to equity - ie to be paid by SCD/Westpoint.

18On 27 November Mr Lennane replied (Ex C61), pointing out that the Static Analysis break up of costs was substantially different to ""the last break up"" (which is not in evidence), and observing that the issue was important ""as it has implications for viability"". He also said:

""Two of our primary issues are subscription of equity and 'cost to complete'. We need to be clear on these matters, for example you say in your break up that you will fund $11.7m of construction costs, but at close you have only funded $1.6m meaning that we have an immediate cost to complete problem of $10.1m.""

He invited the appellant to call to discuss the matter further.

19In December 2002 the appellant made a PowerPoint presentation to Mr Lennane, with a document entitled ""Scots Church Development 'Portico' Capital Finance"" (Ex D13, AB 885-924). The presentation provided information to Mr Lennane concerning the proposal to develop. It named the builder as ""Broad Constructions"". It included one page headed ""Agreed Project Cost Budget"" and another headed ""Agreed Project Profit Budget"". (The word ""Agreed"" in each of these documents represented an aspiration on the part of the appellant and SCD/Westpoint. Mr Lennane made it clear in his evidence that, at that point, he had not reached any agreement as to the provision of a facility, nor, if any facility were granted, to what costs of the project it would be directed.) The Cost Budget replicated the Static Analysis (part of Ex D14). This made clear that the funding sought from CFAL was $70 million (consistently with the Static Analysis, but inconsistently with the Information Memorandum).

20On 6 December Mr Lennane sent to the directors of SCD (marked for the attention of the appellant and Mr Gregory) an ""indicative offer"", which was non-binding, but stated the terms on which CFAL may be prepared to provide a loan facility (Ex C38). The facility amount specified was $71,172,000, of which $1,172,000 was attributable to GST. A number of ""special conditions"" were identified. One of these was nomination of a builder approved by CFAL. Another was that the development proceed in accordance with an attached ""Equity/Facility Table"". The attached ""Equity/Facility Table"" was in similar format to the Static Analysis and the ""Agreed Project Cost Budget"", although the line items were not identical, and the amounts varied. However, it is clear that the document was designed, like the Static Analysis, to identify individual costs of the project, and to identify those to be paid by SCD/Westpoint (""Equity""), and those to be paid out of any loan funds advanced (""Facility"").

21Thereafter was a considerable volume of correspondence and interchange between the appellant and Mr Gregory on behalf of SCD/Westpoint, and Mr Lennane on behalf of CFAL. I will attempt to confine references to those communications which have significance for the purpose of the single ground of appeal. That, however, involves a substantial amount of the correspondence.

22On 16 December Mr Lennane sought further information (Ex C39) to which Mr Gregory (after consultation with the appellant) replied (Ex C41). One of the questions raised by Mr Lennane concerned how the mezzanine finance had been raised.

23On 20 December Mr Gregory emailed Mr Lennane (copied to the appellant) confirming that SCD was ""not drawing out profit from the front end"", and itemising ""costs incurred to date or paid prior to financial close"", a total of $22.4 million (Ex C71). (The evidence explained ""financial close"" to be the date of draw down of any loan fund made available.) The denial that SCD or Westpoint were ""drawing out profit from the front end"" anticipated a suspicion expressed in writing two days later by Mr O'Neil (Ex C63), and may well have reflected some discussion between the appellant, Mr Gregory and Mr Lennane.

24On the same day (20 December), Mr Lennane (or somebody in CFAL) prepared a ""Project Analysis"" (Ex D15). (In his oral evidence, Mr Lennane described this as ""a very complicated cash flow development feasibility model"" (T 659/20).) This document, consisting of five pages, contained, inter alia, a list of ""Detailed Costs"", a ""Project Outcome"", and an Equity/Facility Table that appeared under a heading ""CFAL Loan Structure"", and a ""CFAL Risk/Reward Analysis"". 

25Mr Lennane submitted the application to Mr O'Neill, who raised a number of queries and concerns about the proposal (Ex C63). He drew attention to the discrepancy in the amount stated in the ""prospectus"" (the Information Memorandum) as being raised by way of senior debt ($60 million), and the amount stated in the application ($71 million). He noted that the promissory notes were repayable on 31 March 2004, but that the anticipated completion date of the project was August 2004, meaning that the moneys repayable on the promissory notes would be due prior to completion (and, therefore, presumably, receipt of revenue). He asked if CFAL was in any way at risk (even ""reputational risk"") if the ""prospectus"" was false or incorrect or ""materially at odds with project fundamentals"". In respect of this last query, he required a ""formal reply"".

26Mr O'Neill commented adversely on another Westpoint project in Melbourne, and required information about it. He noted that Mr Lennane's summary of SCD's 2002 accounts was ""at odds with the rest of the numbers"" and asked about specific items. He specifically asked where the interest costs (for the mezzanine finance, which he estimated to be $4 million) was coming from, as those costs were not reflected in any of the ""numbers presented"". 

27He expressed the suspicion mentioned above that SCD/Westpoint were taking ""up front cash"" out of mezzanine funds.



2003

28As a consequence of Mr O'Neill's concerns, Mr Lennane took advice from solicitors (Gadens) and, on their advice, proposed that a special condition be incorporated into any loan agreement, in the following terms:

""CFAL is to be satisfied that the mezzanine finance of $20m supported by the promissory notes is upon terms and conditions satisfactory including satisfactory expiry dates of the notes (or other evidence of ability to repay on expiry date) and that all documentation relating to the promissory notes including any information memorandum and supplementary memorandum is also acceptable.""

29In respect of Mr O'Neill's concern about discrepancies between the accounts and other information, Mr Lennane on 7 January (Ex C66) advised Mr O'Neill:

""The accounts reflect the project costs to balance date and the impact of the Promissory Notes receipts on both sides of the Balance Sheet. The client's Financial Controller did advise me that, at balance date, the Note issue was oversubscribed and that surplus funds had been returned/reapplied towards other projects.""

30In respect of Mr O'Neill's expressed suspicion that SCD/Westpoint were siphoning off mezzanine funds, Mr Lennane proposed adding another special condition, in the following terms;

""The Project Auditor is to verify to the satisfaction of Director, Property that project costs of $22.1m (refer below) have been incurred by the Borrower prior to the Initial Advance (refer equity/facility table), and that those costs are not included in remaining project costs as set out in the equity/facility table ...""

(The word ""incurred"", referred to in the proposed special condition above, was crossed out and replaced by the handwritten word ""expended"".)

Mr Lennane then set out a list of costs totalling $22.1 million. This list appears to have been drawn from the list of costs provided by Mr Gregory in December 2002 (Ex C71), with minor deletions, and some rounding of the figures. 

31On 8 January, Mr Lennane prepared a ""Credit Application Report"" for HBoS (Ex C67). It included, under the heading ""Trading Highlights"", the following:

""The assets and liabilities of the company [SCD] relate solely to the subject project, comprising site costs other inventories and related funding. Mezzanine funds of $27m were raised to year-end and since balance date the surplus ($7m) has been repaid and rolled into other Westpoint Group ventures. The funds are currently reflected as inventories in the balance sheet. In accounting terms, the company made a small profit for the year ...""

Under the heading ""Initial Funding $1.722m"", Mr Lennane wrote:

""Colonial First State and Perpetual Nominees provided funding to purchase the site and meet subsequent expenses. These liabilities will be replaced by funds from CFAL's loan facility and $20m of mezzanine debt that [SCD] raised through a prospectus, to be secured by a second mortgage over the site and due for repayment after completion of the project.""

[There followed a list of costs, including, by way of example, land and acquisition costs of $10.9 million, legal fees and so forth, totalling $22.1 million.]

32Mr Lennane attached as an annexure special conditions he proposed in the event that the loan was approved. This included the following:

""1. The following conditions must be complied with before the initial advance is made. 

(a) ...

(b) The Project Auditor is to verify to the satisfaction of Director, Property that project costs of $22.1m (refer below) have been expended by the Borrower prior to the Initial Advance (refer Equity/Facility Table), and that those costs are not included in the remaining project costs as set out in the Equity/Facility Table:

[There followed the list of costs set out previously under 'Initial Funding'.]

(c) CFAL is to be satisfied that the mezzanine finance of $20m supported by the promissory notes is upon terms and conditions satisfactory including satisfactory expiry dates of the notes (or other evidence of ability to repay on expiry date) and that all documentation relating to the promissory notes including any information memorandum and supplementary memorandum is also acceptable."" 

33There was then a series of emails (Ex D9), commencing 8 January 2003, in which Mr Lennane sought, and the appellant and/or Mr Gregory supplied, further information. Mr Lennane told the appellant:

""The base issue is the mezzanine finance and how it then affects Scots financials.""

He noted that the notes issue had been oversubscribed by $7 million and that some funds had been returned and ""rolled"" into other ventures.

34On 10 January the appellant replied. He advised that the current expiry date of the majority of the promissory notes on issue was March 2004. He wrote of a program to extend the expiry date of notes in the event of delays. In respect of the oversubscription issue, he wrote:

""3. The funds raised pursuant to the York Street Mezzanine raise have been received progressively over the last 12-18 months. The rollover process explained above has been used recently to roll investors into similar mezzanine investments with our other projects which has and will continue to address any oversubscription."" [C42]

35On 10 January the appellant again emailed Mr Lennane (Ex D9) saying, inter alia:

""1. The list of costs incurred to date sent to you by Luke [Gregory] on 20 December 2002 which totalled $22,394,322 represents a subset of the costs shown in the balance sheet as at 30 June 2002 under the heading inventories. The difference relates primarily to costs incurred in relation to the mezzanine raising (upfront commissions plus interest paid) as well as the profit recognised for the year to 30 June 2002 of $3.2m ...""

The ""list of costs"" to which he referred was the list of costs contained in Mr Gregory's email to Mr Lennane on 20 December (Ex C71).

36On 14 January, on behalf of CFAL, Mr Lennane wrote to the directors of SCD offering a loan facility in the amount of $71,172,000 (Ex C43) (of which $1,172,000 was GST provision) on stated terms and conditions (Ex C43). Special conditions specified included conditions as set out in the draft of Mr Lennane [C67] - ie 1(b) (satisfactory verification that costs of $22.1 million had been expended, and were not included in the remaining project costs) and 1(c) (ie satisfactory verification that the mezzanine funds of $20 million had been issued on satisfactory terms). Attached to the letter of offer was an ""Equity/Facility Table"", giving estimates of how the funds advanced were to be expended, and what was to be contributed by ""Equity"", but reserving the right to vary or depart from that programme. 

37A condition of the offer was that the initial advance under the facility be drawn within 90 days of the date of offer, failing which the offer would lapse (unless other agreement was reached with CFAL) [C43].

38On 28 January SCD accepted the offer (Ex C70). 

39On 30 April Mr Gregory wrote to Mr Carey and the appellant setting out a revised funding strategy for the project (Ex C45).

40No draw down having been made within 90 days of the offer by CFAL, in accordance with the specified terms and conditions, the offer lapsed.

41On 30 June, acting as secretary of York Street Mezzanine, the appellant wrote to the directors of SCD advising that the balance of the loan owing by SCD to York Street Mezzanine was $39,326,190 and that the loan was interest bearing and unsecured. He made no mention of any proposal to redirect funds in excess of the $20 million initially proposed, and subject of advice to CFAL (Ex C59).

42SCD's June 2003 accounts showed Work in Progress to the value of $54,626,192. Since the sole purpose of SCD was the development of the church and the construction of the Portico project, this amount had to be referable to that project. That contrasted starkly with the incurred costs shown in CFAL's letters of offer (Ex C43), and Mr Gregory's list of incurred costs as at December 2002 (Ex C71) - respectively, $22.1 million and $22.394 million.

2004

43On 23 January, the appellant, in his capacity as Chief Financial Controller of Westpoint, wrote to Mr Lennane seeking to reactivate the loan application (Ex C46, T 653). He advised that, since the approval of finance had been given, the project had progressed significantly and ""Westpoint Constructions"" had taken over from Broad Constructions the responsibility for delivery (ie as builder) and had commenced early works. He also advised that Westpoint Constructions had undertaken a complete revision of the programme and pricing which had resulted in changes to the timing and cost, in such a way as to affect information previously provided to CFAL which formed the basis for the original finance approval. He attached a Revised Project Cash Flow which showed that it was anticipated that $57,457,495 was needed to complete the project, and that, on completion, SCD would hold as cash $26,230,075, a return on the project of 30.43 percent. He also provided a revised Equity/Facility Table. He identified various changes in the figures previously supplied. He asked for confirmation that CFAL would accept the revised Equity/Facility Table for the purpose of permitting drawdown of the loan facility previously approved (Ex C46).

44On 17 February Mr Lennane recommended that, notwithstanding substantial delays in the project, CFAL accept and approve the appointment of Westpoint Constructions as the substitute builder, and otherwise approve the loan in the same terms as previously (Ex C72). By this time, however, the amount of costs expended by SCD/Westpoint mentioned in proposed special condition 1(b) was $32.6 million (see Ex C49).

45On 24 February (Ex D5) the appellant prepared answers to further queries of Mr Lennane, which included the following:

""A number of the costs included in the 30 June 2003 Work in Progress balance represent 'soft' costs not included in the makeup of the equity required by the finance approval. Costs in this category include mezzanine debt raising and interest costs, previous 'land' debt establishment fees and interest, marketing and project management costs. In addition, in accordance with accounting standards as signed off by our auditors, the Work in Progress balance includes an accrual of project profit which is recognised on a percentage of completion basis. 

The important point to note here is that once the project is completed, taking account of timing differences and profit accruals, the profit per the revised cash flow given to CFAL on 23 January 2004 and the overall project profit (excluding equity/mezzanine costs) disclosed in the accounts of Scots Church Development Ltd will be the same.

The other important point to note is that as set out in the revised Cash Flow project given to CFAL on 23 January 2004, costs to complete as at 31 December 2003 were $57.5m which will be independently certified by CFAL's quantity surveyor ensuring that there are always sufficient funds remaining in the facility limit to complete the project""

These answers were an explanation for the discrepancy between the costs incurred shown in Mr Gregory's letter of December ($22.394 million) and CFAL's information in January as compared with what appeared in the June 2003 accounts ($54.6 million). They were forwarded by Mr Gregory to Mr Lennane.

46On 25 February Mr Lennane sent Mr Gregory a facsimile (Ex D8) which commenced:

""Following are a preliminary summary of the project's outcome and an equity/facility table, which are based on my initial understanding of the information provided to date. Please contact me after you have reviewed the summary and table."" (bold added) 

This was followed by two tables. The first was headed ""Project Outcome"", showing projected revenue of $109,288,000, a total project cost of $89,203,000, and a profit of $20,085,000, or 23 percent of total cost. The second table was a ""Proposed Equity/Facility Table"" which included costs under various categories, apportioned as to Equity and Facility. The list included items such acquisition costs, and construction, similar to previous lists of the same kind, and also ""Other Costs"". Mr Lennane placed an asterisk against this entry. 

47Handwritten on the document was a note to Mr Gregory in the following terms:

""Luke, this is the outstanding item to be clarified. Also though, I would like an update of development costs to date. Refer Condition 1(b) as discussed.""

The reference to ""Condition 1(b)"" was a reference to the Special Condition contained in the letter of offer, requiring that the Project Auditor verify, to the satisfaction of CFAL, that project costs of $22.1 million had been expended by Westpoint prior to the initial advance and were not included in the remaining costs set out in the Equity/Facility Table.

48Mr Lennane's oral evidence about this Equity/Facility Table was that it was ""cut and pasted"" from CFAL's Project Analysis, an earlier example of which is D15. (The Project Analysis from which this Table was taken was not in evidence.) Mr Lennane said that the Project Outcome section, also cut and pasted into the document (Ex D8), was irrelevant to the purpose of his then communication with Mr Gregory, and was included by inadvertence.

49On 27 February Mr Lennane prepared a fresh Credit Application Report (Ex C73) for HBoS. Included in this report, under the heading ""Trading Highlights"", was the following:

""The assets and liabilities of the company relate solely to the subject project. Assets substantially comprise the cost of the site ($10m), capitalised development costs ($30.7m, including 'construction' expenditure, project soft costs and internal management fees), borrowing costs ($9.6m) and profit recognised to date in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards ($4.3m). Debt is made up of first mortgage site funding $12.5m and mezzanine funding of $39.3m. Surplus mezzanine funding was to be rolled over into other Westpoint ventures but remains on foot because of project delays. These delays have had a significant effect on project profits, however they have no impact on project viability from this point forward ... 

He then provided a list of project costs totalling $32.6 million. Mr Lennane recommended approval of the revised proposal.

50It is to be observed that mezzanine funding had almost doubled, from $20 million in 2002-2003, to $39.3 million, from the previous such report.

51On 27 February Mr Lennane wrote to Mr Rogers (head of the CFAL Credit Risk Department) (Ex C74), answering questions raised by Mr Maclaren. He advised that the outstanding debt to York Street Mezzanine was $39.3 million (as at 30 June 2003), and that the cost to complete the project at present, ""but ignoring the $16m construction progress made ..."" was $69.705 million.

52On 3 March Mr Lennane reported (Ex C75) to HBoS on the updated finance application made by SCD. He included a section headed ""Viability"", under which he appears to have forecast a profit (or surplus), of $4.35 million. He arrived at this figure by deducting the CFAL debt ($71 million) and mezzanine debt ($39.33 million) from anticipated gross revenue ($113.684 million net of GST). However, he noted that that figure ignored several identified ""profit items"". These appear to represent amounts paid or payable between different Westpoint companies (eg the builder's profit component, the Westpoint building company having taken over the construction) that would on completion of the project, sound in profit to Westpoint. He made the following observation:

""2(b) When we first looked at this deal the project returns were obviously better and there is no question that delays and other issues ... have eroded the returns. However, last year we received a substantial establishment fee for the deal and we have a prima facie obligation to continue to support the client notwithstanding the reduced project returns, but only on the basis that our risk position is acceptable. In this regard our maximum exposure of $71.2m is supported by back end equity of $42.5m, which is supported by a largely presold project with sound physical fundamentals."" (bold in original) 

53On 10 March SCD sought to refinance the mezzanine debt. A new Information Memorandum was published which showed the then current mezzanine funding as $30 million. The appellant sent this to Mr Tony Hazell, a finance broker with whom Westpoint was dealing, with a view to refinancing (T 467) (Ex C47, AB 581).

54At some time in March 2004, and notwithstanding Mr Lennane's support, HBoS rejected SCD's application (see Ex C48). During March or April, on the evidence of Mr Gregory, he had discussions with the appellant. Mr Gregory's evidence was that the appellant said, with respect to the mezzanine funding:

""... something like 'Look, we can't tell Capital [CFAL] that we're above 40 million, because that's going to cause them some concerns. I'm concerned that they won't fund the project. So we'll need to consider a strategy around keeping it at 40 million and rolling out investors'."" (T 474)

Although, in cross-examination, this evidence was touched upon (T 527-8), Mr Gregory's account of the communication was not directly challenged, and no contradictory evidence was called.

55Notwithstanding that rejection, at some stage in or prior to May 2004 SCD renewed its application for finance from CFAL. That application also was supported by Mr Lennane.

56Mr Lennane proposed special conditions in similar terms to those previously recommended, with a variation to special condition (b) so that the mezzanine finance level referred to was $39.3 million (Ex C76). 

57On 13 April a Westpoint internal document (Ex C2) showed that the then current level of mezzanine subscription for York Street Mezzanine was $40 million, of which $10.9 million represented ""Agreed Rollovers Currently in Progress"".

58On 11 May the ""Summary of Position"" (Ex C3) showed for York Street Mezzanine a total investment of $40 million, with ""Agreed Rollovers Currently in Progress"" at $15.1 million. The corresponding document for 18 May (Ex C4) continued to show York Street Mezzanine subscriptions as $40 million with ""Agreed Rollovers Currently in Progress"" at $16 million.

59On 19 May a ""Project Reporting Summary"" (Ex C14) of Westpoint projects was prepared. It contained a detailed Profit and Loss Analysis of all then current Westpoint projects. It showed actual mezzanine costs for York Street Mezzanine as at that date of $60.9 million, a total project cost of $125.8 million, net end value of $112.4 million and an overall loss of $13.4 million (AB 305). Also contained in the document was a project profit and loss table, showing a similar anticipated loss (AB 308) and a page entitled ""Internal Cash Flow Impact on Westpoint Group), also showing a negative anticipated cash flow of $13.4 million. The appellant's initials appear on the distribution list (T 111-114).

60On 26 May a Funds Report (Ex C55) prepared with respect to the various companies under the Westpoint umbrella showed ""York St"" promissory notes to have reached a level of $61,317,169. Almost $4 million of these had been subscribed since the beginning of 4 May.

61On 27 May, in response to a request by Mr Gregory, Mr Patrick Nguyen, an accountant within Westpoint, provided a detailed list of investors holding promissory notes in York Street Mezzanine as at 26 May 2004, with an expiry date of 30 November 2005. These were to the value of $43,852,780.26 (Ex D7).

62On 28 May a (Westpoint) Group Treasury and Cash Flow Report (Ex C24) showed that promissory notes totalling $61,629,169 had been issued by York Street Mezzanine (ie the level of mezzanine debt for SCD was $61,629,169). This was one of a series of documents issued on a weekly basis within Westpoint. It revealed an intention to ""roll"" $21.1 million of these funds from York Street Mezzanine to another Westpoint project. The report also showed an anticipated loss on the project of $9,891,439.

63On 28 May Mr Nguyen wrote to Mr Gregory in the following terms:

""Further to the spreadsheet that I had provided to you on Wednesday, please find attached a revised copy. 

Grant has requested that we remove the most recent investors from the list (30 November 05 expiry  balance as at 26 May 2004) to achieve an investor balance of approximately $39,330,730.""

Grant Dodd was the person in Westpoint to whom Mr Nguyen reported. Mr Nguyen gave evidence that towards the end of May in 2004, Mr Dodd asked him to provide a list of all investment in York Street Mezzanine. Mr Nguyen did so. The list showed a total of $61 million. Mr Dodd then instructed him to remove some investors, which Mr Nguyen did, so that the list showed an investment of about $40 million. Mr Dodd then asked him to remove some more names, to bring the figure down ""to just below 40"". Mr Dodd told Mr Nguyen to remove the names of those who had most recently invested. Mr Nguyen did so, and emailed the list to Mr Gregory. 

64On the same day Mr Gregory forwarded the email to the appellant, asking which of them was to forward it on (presumably to CFAL). The new spreadsheet showed investor funding of the mezzanine debt at $39,321,780.26 (Ex C35). 

65Mr Lennane prepared another Credit Application Report (Ex C76). It repeated the paragraph from the previous (February 2004, Ex C73) report under ""Trading Highlights"" that referred to the ""surplus mezzanine funding"" (ie mezzanine funding in excess of $39.3 million). The table of costs that followed now totalled $38.5 million.

66On 31 May the appellant's secretary, acting on his instructions, sent the letter the subject of the charges, with the attachment (Ex C1). The letter was in the following terms:

""Dear Brett,

SCOTS CHURCH - RESPONSE TO RECENT QUERIES

I refer to the telephone conversation with Luke Gregory and myself on Friday, 28 May 2004. During the conversation you raised a number of queries which you sought answers to, in order for you to finalise and submit the revised credit submission to Scotland for the senior debt financing of the above mentioned project. These queries, together with answers are outlined below.

1. Reconciliation of project costs to date

[There followed a table showing that project costs to the date of the letter totalled $38.5 million, and that these costs had been fully funded as at that date. The costs referred to included land and acquisition, legal fees, project management fees, marketing costs, and others.]

...

2. Mezzanine finance from York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd

Please refer to the letter annexed as Attachment 1 from York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd which details a current listing of promissory notes on issue with their relevant expiry date. Please note that the earliest date of expiry is currently 30 November 2005.

[Attachment 1 was headed ""York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd - Investor Listing as at 31 May 2004"". It extended over eight and a half pages, in tabular form, containing columns for ""Investor name"", ""PCode"" (presumably postcode), location of investor, ""Funds invested"", and ""Expiry date"". The investors' names were, in fact, deleted and the words ""Withheld due to Privacy"" inserted. The ""Funds Invested"" column showed a variety of amounts, from $50,000, to $500,000. The ""Expiry"" date in each case was 30 November 2005. The total investment shown was $39,321,780.]

3. Reconciliation of project costs to 30 June 2003 financial statements

Based on our discussions, I understand there are two components to this query ... The second component of your query is whether the project is still profitable. The answer to this question is that the project is definitely still profitable, and based on the most recent forecast to the end of the project we expect the project to achieve a profit of over $13m as per the following analysis:

[There followed another table, containing identified items and costs forecast for each item on completion of the project. This showed a projected revenue of $119.1 million, and project expenses of $105.2 million, with a ""forecast project profit"" of $13.9 million.]

I trust the above satisfactorily answers your queries. Should you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact either Luke Gregory or myself."" (italics added)

67On 8 June Mr O'Neill submitted a very positive report to HBoS (Ex C77) concerning the updated report.

68On 16 June Mr Lennane sent to Mr Maclaren at HBoS International a spreadsheet prepared by either the appellant or one his staff, headed:

""SCOTS CHURCH PROJECT - PROFIT & FUNDING ANALYSIS""

It contained a list of ""Project Expenses"". With one minor exception, this replicated the ""Project Table"" provided by the appellant on 31 May (Ex C1). The document finished with the entry ""Project Costs to be Funded"" totalling $102.2 million. It forecast a net project profit of $13.9 million.

69On 21 June the credit application was approved by letter of offer (Ex C51) with special conditions again presupposing mezzanine finance of $39.3 million. Advances began in August.

The Crown case

70It was the Crown case that the letter of 31 May contained two statements, each of which was, to the knowledge of the appellant, false or misleading in a material particular. These were (i) that the mezzanine debt level was, as at the date of the letter, $39.3 million (as shown on the table that constituted the attachment); and (ii) the statement that the project was ""definitely still profitable"" and was expected to yield a profit in excess of $13 million. The first of these was the ""mezzanine statement"" that gave rise to the ""mezzanine charge"". On the Crown case, the statement concerning mezzanine investor funding significantly understated the level of mezzanine debt, which was, as at 26 May 2004, in excess of $61 million (Ex C55, AB 670), and was therefore false and misleading. It was further the Crown case that the expenses associated with the project exceeded the projected revenue so that the project was not, and was known to the appellant not to be, profitable. On the Crown case therefore, the ""profit statement"" was, and was to the knowledge of the appellant, false and misleading. 

The mezzanine charge

The Crown case

71The basis upon which the Crown puts its case with respect to the mezzanine charge can be stated with relative simplicity and brevity. It is that:


the Table annexed to the letter of 31 May 2004 clearly conveyed that, as at the date of the letter, the level of mezzanine debt (or promissory note debt) was $39,321,780. Particular emphasis was placed by the Crown upon the word ""current"" and the heading to the Table, showing ""Investor listing as at 31 May 2004"";


the true position, as revealed by Westpoint documents (Ex C55, Ex C14) was that, at that date, mezzanine debt was in excess of $60 million;


the appellant, as Chief Financial Controller of Westpoint, was privy to those documents and therefore well aware of the true position concerning the level of mezzanine debt;


the evidence of Mr Nguyen concerning directions to him to revise the list of mezzanine investors (see above [63]-[65]) is evidence from which an inference could be drawn that he knew and intended that the information conveyed would be false and misleading;


similarly, the evidence of Mr Gregory concerning the conversation in which the appellant categorically stated his intention of not informing CFAL of the true position was also evidence that demonstrated clearly that the information conveyed was false and misleading, and that the appellant knew that to be the case;


it was therefore false and misleading for the appellant to convey to CFAL that the mezzanine debt was, as at 31 May 2004, under $40 million.

The appellant's case

72The appellant's case with respect to the mezzanine charge relied upon the evidence that there had been an acknowledged oversubscription of the promissory note issue, and that a program was in place to ""rollover"", into other Westpoint projects, the excess; and that the word ""current"", as used in the letter of 31 May, ought to be read as ""current as at the time of (proposed) settlement or draw down of loan"".

73The written submissions provided on behalf of the appellant included the following:

""107 ...
(i) the letter [of 31 May] stated that the attached list of promissory note holders was a 'current' listing. The uncontroverted evidence at trial was that in the context of a commercial loan application, current referred to the position as at the time of settlement/draw down.""

No transcript reference was included in this submission.

74The submissions also characterised the evidence of Mr Gregory about the conversation with the appellant as ""unacceptable and unreliable"".

Consideration

75I have been unable to locate any evidence to the effect of the submission extracted above. Mr Gregory was cross-examined (T 524-5). This cross-examination was directed to an entirely differently document - Ex C47, in March 2004, regarding the0 finance proposal. In that context, Mr Gregory accepted that the word ""current"" represented ""a future based position"", a ""current funding plan"". 

76There is no basis upon which Mr Gregory's evidence of the conversation with the appellant ought to be discarded as ""unacceptable and unreliable"". He was not directly challenged on that evidence. The nearest the cross-examination came to challenging his assertion lay in drawing attention to its omission from statements he had made during the course of the investigation and preparation for the trial. In the absence of any evidence about what issues were discussed, or what he was asked to turn his mind to, there is no reason to draw adverse inferences from any such omission.

77The evidence is damning. It establishes, in my opinion conclusively, that the appellant did falsify the mezzanine funding figures.

78Further, it is necessary to appreciate the context in which the letter of 31 May was written. It was a final, almost desperate, attempt by Westpoint to secure large scale funding from CFAL. The reference to ""current listing"" cannot reasonably be read as a reference to anything other than the position as at the date of the letter. The heading of the Table is unequivocal - ""Investor listing as at 31 May 2004"".

79Had the position been as is now contended on behalf of the appellant, it would have been a very simple matter to have shown the actual mezzanine borrowings as at the date of the letter, and included reference to the proposed ""rollover programme"".

80In my opinion there was ample evidence on which the jury could find that this charge was proved, and, for my own part, I am amply satisfied that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The profit charge

The Crown case

81In the first instance, the basis on which the Crown puts its case with respect to the profit charge can also be stated with relative simplicity and brevity. It is that, in ordinary and generally accepted language, ""profit"" is what remains after the total costs of a project are deducted from the total revenue of the project. The Crown contention was:


that that was the way in which the words ""profitable"" and ""profit"" were used by the appellant in the letter of 31 May, and the way in which the calculation of profit was made by him for the purpose of that letter;


that the documentary evidence (that is, Westpoint's own records, especially Ex C14) established that as at the date of the letter, Westpoint recognised that the project would make a loss; 


that the appellant, as Chief Financial Controller of Westpoint, was privy to those records and therefore well aware that a loss was anticipated; and 


that it was therefore false or misleading to say that the project was still profitable (with a profit of over $13 million anticipated).

82Both at trial and on appeal the Crown placed heavy reliance upon Ex C14. This was a Westpoint ""Project Reporting Summary"" dated 19 May 2004, covering various Westpoint projects then under way. The summary relevant to SCD showed a forecast revenue of $112,393,791, with total costs of $125,801,778, and a forecast loss of $13,407,987. 

83Exhibit C14 was the last of a series of such reports issued, usually fortnightly, commencing (so far as the evidence goes) with a report dated 7 January 2004 (Ex C7) showing a then projected loss of almost $10 million. Each successive report (Ex C8 - Ex C13) showed an increase in the projected loss.

84Also relevant was Ex C24, a Westpoint weekly group treasury and cash flow report dated 28 May 2004. It predicted a shortfall, after ""total project outflows"" were deducted from anticipated total revenue, of just under $10 million.

85On that simple analysis, the Crown argued, the appellant's statement in the letter of 31 May 2004 (Ex C1), that the project was ""definitely still profitable"" and expected to achieve a profit of $13.9 million, was demonstrably false and misleading.




The appellant's case

86The appellant's case with respect to the profit charge cannot be stated so simply or concisely. In short, it was that the appellant and Mr Gregory, representing Westpoint, and Mr Lennane, representing CFAL, had, throughout their negotiations, dealt with one another on the common understanding that profit was to be measured, not by the simple expedient of deducting total costs from total revenue, but by deducting only certain costs from revenue, and that this approach permeated the whole of the communications between the two organisations, and can be discerned, in particular, from the various documents in which project costs were itemised. Invariably omitted from those lists was a category of costs labelled ""sunk"" costs or ""soft"" costs. 

87The appellant argued, in respect of the ""profit statement"", that there existed different legitimate accounting methods for calculating profit, and that the course of correspondence and dealings demonstrates that he and Mr Lennane took a common approach to the method used. The two alternative methods can be shortly stated in this way:

(i) ""profit"" is determined by deducting the total costs of the project from the total revenue derived ie profit = revenue - total costs. (This is the method of calculation which the Crown contends is correct);

(ii) ""profit"" is determined by deducting only certain specific costs of the project, and excluding certain other costs - called ""sunk"" costs or ""soft"" costs ie profit = revenue - specific costs only. (This was the method of calculation the appellant contends to be correct. It will be considered in more detail below.)

For the moment, it is sufficient to note that, in general, the costs said to have been excluded were the costs of raising the mezzanine finance (commissions paid to agents and interest payable to investors and potential costs to be incurred in the event that it became necessary to provide an incentive to investors to defer redemption of their promissory notes) and interest costs already incurred with respect to the original loan from Colonial/Perpetual.

88Senior counsel for the appellant pointed to a number of documents which, he argued, gave rise to the inference that he and Mr Lennane proceeded on a common understanding of what was meant by ""profit"" in the context of what SCD/Westpoint could expect to make on the project. 

89The starting point of the appellant's submission was that a number of costs had been incurred prior to his approach to CFAL, some of which were ongoing, and that this was clearly known to CFAL, or at least to Mr Lennane. These costs included the establishment and interest costs associated with the Colonial/Perpetual loan facility, agents' commissions in raising the mezzanine finance, and interest on the mezzanine finance (calculated by Mr O'Neill to be $4 million), and the potential additional costs of extending the terms of the promissory notes constituting the mezzanine debt. 

90Senior counsel for the appellant pointed to a number of the documents which have been outlined above. These were:


Ex D14 (25 November 2002, the Static Analysis);


Ex D13 (December 2002, the Power Point presentation containing a project cost budget);


Ex D15 (20 December 2002, the CFAL ""Project Analysis"");


Ex C46 (23 January 2004, the Revised Project Cash Flow provided by the appellant in support of the reactivated finance application);


Ex D8 (25 February 2004, the CFAL facsimile containing an Equity/Facility Table drawn from a project analysis of the kind seen in Ex D15).

Each of these documents contained a list of accumulated and/or anticipated costs of the project. Nowhere to be found in any of those lists was any reference to the costs mentioned above. This applies equally to lists prepared by Mr Lennane, or CFAL, as to those prepared by the appellant or his colleagues in SCD/Westpoint. Cross-examination of Mr Lennane was directed to establishing that he was aware that such costs had been incurred. 

91Senior counsel also referred to a further three documents. These were:


Ex D9: the email from the appellant to Mr Lennane of 10 January 2003, in which, in response to a query from Mr Lennane, he explained an apparent discrepancy between the costs of the project shown in the SCD 2002 accounts (in excess of $45 million) and the costs itemised in Ex C71 (Mr Gregory's December 2002 letter to Mr Lennane). The explanation given by the appellant was that these costs: 

""... represent a subset of the costs ... the difference relates primarily to costs incurred in relation to the mezzanine raising (upfront commissions plus interest paid) as well as the profit recognised ..."";


Ex D10: the email dated 25 February 2004, in which Mr Gregory agreed with the funding table set out in Mr Lennane's email (Ex D8) of the same date; and


Ex C75: an internal CFAL facsimile (3 March 2004), in which Mr Lennane analysed the ""viability"" of the project. This he did by assuming revenue of $113,684 million (taken from information provided by the appellant) and deducting the proposed CFAL debt of $70 million net of GST, and mezzanine debt of $39.33 million. That calculation left $4.35 million. Mr Lennane added that the calculation ignored certain ""profit"" items that would enhance the viability of the project to Westpoint. (These were items such as the Westpoint Constructions profit costs, which would, in the end, benefit Westpoint (ie the Westpoint Group).)

Consideration

92A good deal of the factual material relied upon by the appellant is incontrovertible. Two aspects of the correspondence in particular make it clear that the appellant did not conceal the existence of some additional costs. These are Ex D9, the email to Mr Lennane of 10 January 2003 explaining the discrepancy between the list of ""Costs incurred to date"" sent by Mr Gregory on 20 December 2002 (Ex C71) and what appeared in the 2002 SCD accounts, describing Mr Gregory's list as ""a subset of costs"", and explicitly attributing the difference to the costs of raising mezzanine finance (as well as accounting policies within SCD).

93The other was the email of 24 February 2004 (Ex D5) in which the appellant referred to ""soft"" costs ""not included in the make up of the equity required for finance approval"".

94Thus, it may be accepted that the appellant was not then engaging in any deceptive practice with respect to the mezzanine costs. But those documents, and the inquiries they were directed to answering, were not concerned with questions of profitability.

95However, that is far from determinative of the issues. The first issue is whether the appellant's statement to CFAL that the project was ""definitely still profitable"", was false or misleading. (I leave materiality to a later point in these reasons.)

96The various documents called ""Equity/Facility Table"", sometimes referred to as ""funding tables"", were concerned with the apportionment of costs of the project between SCD/Westpoint and CFAL. For example the Equity/Facility Table in the letter of offer of 14 January 2003 (Ex C43) opened with the words:

""The following table contains estimates of how the funds are to be expended on the Development. This table is an indication only of how the Development will be funded. It imposes no obligation on CFAL to fund in accordance with the table.""

97Of particular importance to CFAL was clarity on what SCD/Westpoint was to contribute by way of ""equity"". This was clear as early as 27 November 2002, where Mr Lennane wrote to the appellant saying: ""Two of our primary issues are subscription of equity and 'cost to complete'. We need to be clear on these matters"" (Ex C61). It was also made clear by the incorporation of special condition 1(b) in the letter of offer. It is not to the point that Mr Lennane was aware that additional costs had been incurred in the raising of mezzanine funds, or in the initial borrowing from Colonial/Perpetual. 

98One difficulty with the approach taken on behalf of the appellant is that nowhere was any attempt made to specify what costs were included in ""soft"" or ""sunk"" costs, or what characterised or defined particular cost items as ""soft"" or ""sunk"" costs. In his evidence in chief, Mr Gregory threw some (although modest) light on the question: (T 441) he spoke of costs that had, in the initial stages, been paid by Westpoint, for preparatory work - initial design work, by way of example. He said:

""... the confusion here can be what the bank, in this case Capital Finance, would be prepared to lend against, what costs they're lending to and are happy to pay, versus other costs which we generally define as 'soft costs', or equity provided by the owner that goes into the construction. So there's a bit of room for negotiation with the financier on that basis, but typically the financier would only fund 'hard costs', which are costs of the land, and claims against the fixed price building contract."" (T 441/5-10)

and, 

""Typically all the costs under the Facility for the most part are hard costs. The confusion might be arising around other costs. I can't recall exactly what that $1.3 million comprised, but there may have been an interpretation that that might have been soft, but, you know, clearly Capital were happy to fund that component."" (T 442/45)

99In his opening submissions (T 12 December 2012, p 10/20-30) senior counsel for the appellant appeared to define ""soft"" costs as:

""... interest repayments for the first senior lender, interest in the past on the mezzanine, commissions on the mezzanine.""

100This means that there is no clear rationale for the omission of any of the costs that had, in fact, been incurred. It means that Mr Lennane and CFAL, although it is true that they (Mr Lennane at least) knew of additional costs, were in the dark as to what they were for, or their quantum.

101More importantly, however, the emphasis in the communications was on what it was proposed would be funded by SCD/Westpoint, and what would be funded by the CFAL facility, if it eventuated. The various funding tables do not disclose projected profit. It is true that, in some of the documents, anticipated ""profit"" is mentioned - for example, in the PowerPoint presentation (Ex D13), in CFAL's Project Analysis (Ex D15), and in SCD's Revised Project Cash Flow (Ex C46). This was invariably incidental to the main purpose for which each of those documents was created and used.

102The appellant relied heavily on Mr Lennane's facsimile of 25 February 2004 (Ex D8), which contained a ""Project Outcome"" table (showing a projected profit of more than $20 million) and a ""Proposed Equity/Facility Table"". Three things diminish the importance that is sought to be placed on the reference to ""profit"". Mr Lennane gave evidence that that part of the facsimile had been included inadvertently. (I have some reservations about that evidence: the introductory part of the communication expressly refers to the Project Outcome as being included.) The second is that Mr Lennane made his purpose in sending the message plain - he wanted Mr Gregory to identify the ""Other Costs"" mentioned in the table, and to provide an ""update of development costs to date"". The third is that Mr Lennane made it plain that, in compiling the document (which was itself drawn from another internal CFAL document) he relied on information provided to him by the appellant (or SCD/Westpoint).

103No evidence was identified that indicated that, at any time prior to the conversation of 28 May 2004, referred to in the letter of 31 May, the project profit was a focus of discussion between Mr Lennane and the appellant, or a determinative factor in CFAL's consideration of SCD's finance application. It cannot, therefore, be the case that the appellant and Mr Lennane proceeded on a common understanding of what or how profit was to be calculated, and that certain project expenses were to be excluded from the calculation.

104There is in my mind another matter of some significance. There was in evidence no contemporaneous note of the conversation of 28 May, and neither Mr Gregory nor Mr Lennane had any clear recollection of the conversation. The only evidence of what Mr Lennane had asked on that occasion is to be found in the appellant's letter of 31 May, written only three days later. What he then perceived he had been asked was ""whether the project is still profitable"". That is, it was the appellant who articulated the question that he then proceeded to answer. This was a question that was different from any that had previously been the subject of discussion or attention. He answered it unequivocally.

105This Court was not referred to the oral evidence of any witness who acknowledged that, in the context of the discussions and negotiations, ""profit"" might have a meaning different from that ordinarily attributed to it - that is, what remains after all costs have been deducted from all revenue.

106In my opinion, the Crown established, to the criminal standard, that the profit statement was false and misleading.

107The next issue is whether the profit statement was, to the knowledge of the appellant, false or misleading.

108The analysis above applies equally to that question. The appellant was initially involved in the negotiations with CFAL. He himself participated in the majority of the communications and he closely supervised those in which he was not a direct participant. The clear inference is that he was well aware of the purpose of the funding tables, and equally well aware of the different issues raised by the question of profitability. There was no evidence to undermine that clear inference.

Materiality 

109Submissions on behalf of the appellant also raised the question of materiality. The submission was two pronged - first, that the Crown had not established that either statement was false or misleading in a material particular, and, second, even if it were, the Crown had not established that the appellant knew of its materiality.

110In respect of the first, the submission was made that the ultimate determination on Westpoint's loan application lay with Mr Gordon Grieve, in HBoS, to whom (it was said) profit to Westpoint was ""apparently irrelevant"". Reference was made to Ex C80, an email from Mr Grieve to Mr Maclaren, dated 17 June 2004, in which he gave conditional support for the loan - but made no mention of profit.

111I do not draw from the absence of any reference to profit that the issue was irrelevant to Mr Grieve. Far more important is that the letter of 31 May begins with reference to the issues on which Mr Lennane had sought clarification - one of which was profit. It is apparent from early communications that CFAL and HBoS were concerned not to be seen to be involving themselves in an unsuccessful venture. They were conscious of ""reputational damage"" that might result.

112In my opinion, the profit statement was clearly material.

113In framing the letter as he did, the appellant plainly knew of the materiality of the issue to CFAL and HBoS.

114Similarly, the mezzanine statement was material. The course of correspondence shows clearly that CFAL was interested to understand the breakdown of the financing of the project or what SCD/Westpoint was contributing, and what CFAL was asked to contribute.

115Its materiality is sufficiently established in the first paragraph of the letter of 31 May - the appellant was responding directly to queries made of him by Mr Lennane. It cannot have been other than material. It is not to the point that, as preferred lender, CFAL's position was protected by its mortgage over the real estate. Mr Lennane, representing CFAL, had asked a question in the context of the application for finance. It was not for the appellant, and it is not for this Court, to ask why CFAL wanted that information.

116In my opinion the sole ground of appeal raised in relation to each count fails.

117The order I propose is that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.

118FULLERTON J: I have read the draft judgment of Simpson J and the consideration her Honour has given to the first ground of appeal in relation to the mezzanine charge. I agree that it was open to the jury to find that charge proved beyond reasonable doubt and that the appeal, so far as it concerns that count, should be dismissed.

119However, after giving the necessary separate consideration to the profit charge and for the reasons which follow, I am of the view that the evidence led at trial concerning that charge, in particular the lengthy course of communication between officers of CFAL and Westpoint in the negotiations that preceded the issue of Ex C1 (and some of the correspondence that followed it), left open the reasonable possibility that the profit statement was not to the knowledge of the appellant false or misleading and, for that reason, the appeal should be allowed in respect of that charge. 

120I gratefully adopt Simpson J's summary of the facts including the chronology of relevant events at [1]-[69] of her Honour's judgment. I also adopt the nomenclature her Honour used when referring to and analysing the complex accounting records and the related and voluminous business records of both Westpoint and CFAL tendered at trial. 

121In my focus on the profit charge however, I have found it necessary to refer in greater detail to some of the documents upon which senior counsel for the appellant placed reliance, both at trial and on the appeal. It is principally by reference to those documents, and the evidence from a number of witnesses about them, that I have come to the view that there is a reasonable possibility that the appellant's reference to ""profit"" and ""profitability"" in the profit statement was not as those terms or concepts are understood in common business parlance, namely profit = revenue less total project costs - the underlying premise in the Crown case at trial - but a reference to the way those terms were used from time to time in the course of the negotiations and dealings between CFAL and Westpoint, namely profit = revenue less specific project costs - the appellant's case - and that the verdict on the profit charge cannot stand for that reason. 

122The profit statement in Ex C1, particularised in the profit charge as being false and misleading to the knowledge of the appellant, is as follows: 

... the project is definitely still profitable, and based on the most recent forecast to the end of the project we expect the project to achieve a profit of over $13m as per the following analysis:

123It was the Crown case that, properly understood, the reference ""the recent forecast to the end of the project"" in the profit statement could bear no other meaning than a reference to Ex C14, one in a succession of profit and loss reports, issued by Westpoint on a fortnightly basis throughout the course of negotiations and showing a progressive increase in the predicted project loss (see Ex C8 - Ex C14) and a projected loss of $13.9 million within a week of the appellant making the profit statement. 

124Counsel for the appellant submitted that the analysis in Ex C14, as with the profit and loss reports generally, was undertaken by Westpoint for its internal accounting purposes only and that it was not an analysis with which CFAL was concerned when considering whether, as lenders, they would extend finance to complete the project. He submitted that ""profitability"" from CFAL's perspective was understood to mean the ""viability or feasibility"" of the project on a ""risk for reward"" basis, their primary focus as lenders being whether the project would generate a project surplus sufficient for the senior debt of $70 million to be discharged on completion of the project, irrespective of whether from Westpoint's perspective there would be a profit (to them) from the project. 

125If the references to ""profit"" and ""profitability"" in the profit statement might reasonably be viewed in the way contended for by the appellant, it follows that Ex C14 was neither determinative of the question whether the profit statement was false and misleading nor of any significant weight on that question. On the other hand, it seems to me to follow that if the references to ""profit"" and ""profitability"" in the profit statement were as contended for by the Crown (there being no reasonable possibility on all of the evidence of any other construction) then the appellant's knowledge of the projected project loss to Westpoint in Ex C14 contrasted with his treatment of the figures in Ex C1 was of overwhelming weight in proof of guilt.

126CFAL's focus on a ""risk for reward"" analysis of the project is supported by Ex C75, a facsimile of 3 March 2004 sent by Mr Lennane to Mr O'Neill where, after referring to what Mr Lennane describes as the ""Scots Church and Westpoint Constructions accounts"", he identifies the following matters under the subheading ""Viability"":

""(a) For simplicity the difference between GR [gross revenue] net of GST and CFAL and Mezz debt at 30 June 2003 is $4.35m ($113.684m - $70m (net of GST provision) - $39.33m). This ignores the following ""profit"" items:
i)Payments for procurement, and building & development services of $11.535m recorded in the accounts (note 17).

ii)Profit recognised to date of $4.288m (note 6). Greg, while this is a non-cash item it is still a profit that will become a cash item once the Mezz facility is repaid.

iii)Builder's profit component of preliminaries budget.

iv)Construction contingency of $3m, which will become profit if costs are sufficiently controlled.

v)Return of a $1m security deposit relating, I believe, to the State Rail situation.""

127Mr Lennane was referred to ""profit"" in items (i) - (v) in his evidence. Despite some ambiguity in his evidence as to whether the analytical exercise involved in considering these factors would reveal a ""profit"" or a ""surplus"" (having used one term when asked questions by the Crown and another when asked questions by defence counsel) in cross-examination at T890 he agreed these were items which should be added to the viability of the project because they would be ""added back"" to ""work out the profit"". He went on to say:

""When we first looked at this deal the project returns were obviously better and there is no question that delays and other issues (eg State Rail) have eroded the returns. However, last year we received a substantial establishment fee for the deal and we have a prima facie obligation to continue to support the client notwithstanding the reduced project returns, but only on the basis that our risk position is acceptable. In this regard our maximum exposure of $71.2m is supported by back-end equity of $42.5m, which is supported by a largely presold project with sound physical fundamentals.""

128In the same facsimile he concluded by saying:

""While I appreciate there are some concerns with this deal on the grounds of viability, the deal still stacks up for CFAL on a risk for reward basis."" 

129A not dissimilar analysis was undertaken by Mr O'Neill (Head of the Property Finance Division of CFAL) on 8 June 2004 in Ex C77, an internal memorandum sent to officers in the credit risk management division of HBOS International and copied to Mr MacLaren as Senior Director for credit risk management. In that memorandum Mr O'Neill also spoke of the fact that certified pre-sales of the units in the project represented ""120% debt cover"" and that with construction 35 per cent complete it had passed beyond the ""critical risk phase"" which was (from CFAL's perpective) ""...almost too good to be true"". He went on to say, ""I can't recall putting up a fully priced project finance deal that has been de-risked to the extent that this one has"". 

130He also agreed in cross-examination that the various matters he alluded to in Ex C77 were the important features under consideration in a credit risk sense and that there was nothing in the memorandum that referred to ""profit"" in the sense contended for by the Crown. 

131In the cross-examination of Mr O'Neill at T846-7, and after counsel had taken him to Ex C73 (the February 2004 Credit Funding Application), he was invited to confirm that with the projected project revenue at $113 million as at February 2004, and with the senior debt to CFAL assumed to be at $71 million and total mezzanine debt funding (again as at that date) $39 million (that figure representing a layer between Westpoint's equity and the proposed senior debt funding), he ""...always saw [the] facility protected by something like 40-odd million in project surplus"" as a buffer between CFAL's exposure and gross revenue. 

132Accepting that Mr MacLaren and other Crown witnesses (including Mr Lennane and Mr O'Neill) were interested in Westpoint's profit prediction as negotiations progressed (see in particular Mr MacLaren's evidence in chief at T994 where he made it clear that HBOS had ""no appetite for loss-making projects""), and even if they had applied the formula profit = total revenue less total project costs for that purpose (the accounting approach taken in Westpoint's profit and loss reports), that did not, in my view, make out the Crown case on the profit charge to the criminal standard. Not only was there no document produced by CFAL which calculated profit for credit approval purposes on that basis, it was also conceded by some of the Crown witnesses (including Mr MacLaren) that there was another legitimate way of looking at or assessing the issue of ""profit"" in a commercial banking context, namely by excluding particular project expenses in the calculation of a project surplus/profit. 

133To my understanding the phrase ""soft costs"" or ""sunk costs"", being the costs excluded for this purpose, is simply a shorthand way to describe a past cost that is ignored as not adding value to the project when an assessment is made for the purposes of forecasting a profit figure. My understanding is drawn principally from the evidence of Mr Lennane at T725-6 where, in the course of being cross-examined by defence counsel as to the apparent contradiction between his evidence for the Crown at trial and his statements to ASIC officers when he was initially questioned about Ex C1 some years earlier:

""Q. Then you're asked this question, the same page. I just want to read out a little passage, and then I'll come back and ask you some questions about it, all right?
A. Okay.

Q. 
""Q. Do you consider it relevant in a loan application to you that they've made representations that it's a project that's going to run a $13 million profit?
A. I don't really understand the time that's passed here. I don't know what costs. It says that there have been some costs incurred, but I don't necessarily understand what those costs are. I mean, to my way of thinking, if they present to me information the valuation says the land is worth a certain amount of money, I suppose some developers would see the profit as being the profit they make from that point forward, not necessarily reflecting previous costs, you know, perhaps viewing them as sunk costs.""
A. Right.

Q. You are telling ASIC yourself what I've just read out, and you mention sunk costs, and you mention that some developers look at profit from that point forward. I'll keep going. Perhaps they didn't like the answer, and they say:
""Q. Again, take it step by step. From representations made to you as of that point in February 2004 from Westpoint that a project is going to make a $13 million profit, it would appear from the memos that that's a factor that you passed on to the credit risk team.
A. That would appear to be what they've told me the profit would be at that time.

Q. And it's fair to say that you've accepted it on that basis.""

They're telling you must have thought, ""A. I don't recall the information that led up to, you know, the provision of that number."" That's correct, isn't it?
A. That I don't recall the lead up or ...

Q. Those questions and answers - firstly you agree that they're the questions and answers that you were asked?
A. Yes.

Q. First of all, going back, you talk about how some developers regard profit. Then you say sunk costs, and when you say sunk costs, you're talking about something that doesn't add value to the project, aren't you?
A. That would be what I'd call soft cost, not a sunk cost. Sunk cost is something that's simply spent.

Q. In the past.
A. Yes.""
(Emphasis added)

134Again, as the appellant's counsel submitted and not without force, if the most that emerges from Mr Lennane's evidence is that he misunderstood, or did not fully appreciate the basis upon which issues of profit and surplus might be calculated for different accounting purposes from the different perspectives of lender and developer, and this misunderstanding underpinned his communication with other CFAL officers through to Mr MacLaren, this does not advance the Crown case that the appellant's profit statement was knowingly false and misleading.

135""Sunk"" or ""soft costs"" was also the subject of express mention in Ex D5, an email sent by the appellant to Mr Gregory in February 2004 in response to a number of queries Mr Lennane had raised with Mr Gregory, the answer to which was then forwarded to Mr Lennane. 

136The appellant placed considerable reliance on Ex D5, together with Ex D8, Ex D9 and Ex D10. As to the first of these documents in time, namely the email from the appellant to Mr Gregory on 10 January 2003 which was then forwarded to Mr Lennane on the same date (Ex D9) in answer to the questions raised by him, the appellant's counsel submitted that in the explanation for a difference in a list of costs incurred on the project to date and sent to CFAL (which apparently totalled $22.3 million) and a much lower figure in the costs shown in the balance sheet of Westpoint at 30 June 2002, the appellant gave the following explanation: 

""The list of costs incurred to date sent to you by Luke [Mr Gregory]...represents a subset of the costs shown in the balance sheet...under the heading inventories. The difference relates primarily to costs incurred in relation to the mezzanine raising (upfront commissions plus interest paid) as well as the profit recognised for the year to 30 June 2002 of $3.2m...""

This, it was submitted, made patent that the costs of the project between the two accounting approaches was different because in the one forwarded to CFAL not all costs were included and, specifically, costs in relation to raising the mezzanine debt were not included.

137When negotiations between the parties resumed in early 2004, a number of additional queries were raised by CFAL as reflected in Ex D4 and Ex D5. The appellant's counsel submitted that if there were doubt up until that time as to the accounting methodology being used by Westpoint (even after Ex D9 was sent), this correspondence addressed it specifically. Significantly, the explanation for the difference in figures in the funding table attached to the CFAL January 2003 letter of offer (Ex C43), representing costs funded by Westpoint's equity and a greater figure shown in the notes to the accounts of Westpoint, was explained as follows:

""● A number of the costs included in the 30 June 2003 Work in Progress balance represent ""soft"" costs not included in the make up of the equity required by the finance approval. Costs in this category include mezzanine debt raising and interest costs, previous 'land' debt establishment fees and interest, marketing and project management costs. In addition, in accordance with accounting standards as signed off by our auditors, the work in progress balance includes an accrual of project profit which is recognized on a percentage of completion basis.

The important point to note here is that once the project is completed, taking account of timing differences and profit accruals, the profit per the revised cashflow given to CFAL on 23 January 2004 and the overall project profit (excluding equity/mezzanine costs) disclosed in the accounts of Scots Church Development Limited will be the same.""
(Emphasis added)

138The following day, after receiving the explanation bearing upon the costs figures in Ex D5, Mr Lennane sent a facsimile to Mr Gregory (Ex D8) which contained an Equity/Facility table in the same format as Ex D15 - a project analysis prepared by CFAL for the purposes of considering the application for finance in 2002 which, as counsel emphasised in submissions, adopted a formula for the calculation of profit of the very kind contended for by the appellant. Specifically, it did not include the costs identified in Ex D5, identified as including ""mezzanine debt raising and interest costs, previous 'land' debt establishment fees and interest, marketing and project management costs"". 

139The Crown accepted that the accounting approach of excluding some project costs (in particular mezzanine debt and associated costs) was employed in the course of negotiations, as reflected in various documents called ""Equity/Facility Tables"", but submitted that it was directed to allowing CFAL to verify the amount of equity Westpoint had contributed or would contribute to the project, together with allowing for an appreciation of how the funds CFAL advanced under the facility would be expended and how the draw down on those funds would be timed relative to completion of the project, not to a calculation of the ""profit"" that would be generated from the project. 

140The Crown also submitted that Ex D8 was not concerned with an analysis of profit properly so described, but as part of CFAL's indicative offer and that it was, in any event, the result of different documents having been cut and pasted together which, according to Mr Lennane's evidence at T763-65, while accurate for some purposes, misrepresented the effect of the document. (I agree with Simpson J's reservations about that explanation at [102] of her Honour's judgment.)

141Counsel for the appellant submitted that the analysis revealed in both documents, separated in time by some months, showed a consistent approach by the parties to the assessment of ""total project costs"", in the sense that relevant future costs are those which are factored or assessed against future revenue and that other past costs (well known to CFAL, including mezzanine interest and upfront sales commissions - see Mr Lennane's cross-examination at T720) were ignored for the purposes of assessing total project cost. 

142On my own analysis, a comparison between the analysis undertaken on Ex C14 and the analysis in Ex C1 shows some similarities in the accounting approach to the calculation of ""profit"" but also significant differences: 

(a) Both concern a forecasted profit on completion of the project. 

(b) Both refer to the projected revenue from the sale of the apartments and revenue net of commission and GST. (While the projected revenue on Ex C14 as at 19 May 2004 is assessed at $112.3 million and on Ex C1 it is $119.1 million, this would appear to be accounted for by an increase in revenue by retail sales over the intervening twelve days - but nothing turns on this.) 

(c) Under the subheading ""Project Expenses"" on Ex C1 is a line item entitled ""Design and Construct"" reported at $65 million and a separate line item ""Land Purchase and Incidentals"" at $12.6 million. On Ex C14 is a line item ""Total D &C"" (design and construction) at $65.2 million and development of the land, including its purchase and incidentals at $13.4 million. (Again, nothing appears to turn on the discrepancy.) 

NB Those items which are common to both Ex C1 and Ex C14 are ""rates and taxes"", ""project management costs"", ""marketing and advertising"", ""DA expenditure"", ""display unit"", ""heritage floorspace"" and ""interest bank/senior debt"". Ex C1 also makes an allowance of $1 million for sundry project expenses with no corresponding line item on C14 - this would also appear to be immaterial. 

(d) The critical distinction between the two documents is that on Ex C14 there is a separate line item altogether entitled ""Other"" - (being other project ""costs"") - which include some but not all of the balance of the project ""expenses"" on Ex C1. 


The following items, listed as ""Other Costs"" on Ex C14, are NOT included on Ex C1 as identifiable line items (I exclude reference to interest (Vendor/Bridging Finance) of $4 million for present purposes since it appears to be irrelevant to the competing analyses or accounting methodologies in issue at the trial):





Sales commission (upfront)

3.1 million


Mezzanine raising costs

12.1 million


Interest (Mezzanine + Kicker)

17.9 million


Total

33.1 million


However, on Ex C1 there is included as the last item under the subheading of ""project expenses"" an item entitled ""Mezzanine Financing Costs"" reported at $19.2 million. This is the only line item on Ex C1 referable to costs associated with the mezzanine debt. In reliance on Mr Gregory's evidence, the appellant's counsel submitted that this is explained on the basis that mezzanine financing costs reported at $19.2 million on Ex C1 relate not to past costs associated with raising the mezzanine debt (for which Westpoint was responsible) but an allowance for costs associated with financing the mezzanine debt as a forward estimate. The Crown submitted that this accounting method resulted in an understatement of the total amount attributable to that debt by $13.9 million (that is, $33.1 million less $19.2 million) and that this had the related effect of falsely overstating profit (in the sense contended for by the Crown). 


In contrast, as is obvious on Ex C14, there are two line items referable to the same subject matter - a line item of ""Mezzanine Raising Costs"" reported at $12.1 million and ""Interest (Mezzanine + Kicker)"" at $17.9 million. It is only the latter on Ex C14 that makes any allowance for forward costing projects and which is fixed at $5 million (that is, actual cost at $12.9 million plus projected costs at $5 million). In Ex C85, an email from Mr Lennane to Mr MacLaren on 16 June 2004 attaching a document headed ""Profit and Funding Analysis"" prepared by the appellant, it would appear that the line item ""Mezzanine Financing Costs"" at $19.2 million (a repetition of the same line item in the analysis of ""Forecast Project Profit"" in Ex C1) is expressed to include an allowance of $6 million for the servicing of the mezzanine interest through to the end of the project. That would tend to suggest that mezzanine raising costs at $12.1 million as at the date of Ex C14 were all past costs and, on the appellant's case, of no interest to CFAL in the calculation of a project surplus. 

143Where Simpson J regarded it as significant that there was no contemporaneous note of the conversation of 28 May 2004 which led to the drafting and forwarding of Ex C1, and that neither Mr Gregory or Mr Lennane had any clear recollection of the conversation in which the question of ""profit"" was raised, I do not see that this casts any light on the question whether, assuming that the appellant was asked whether the ""project was still profitable"", that ""profit"" was being used in the sense contended for by the Crown. What is of significance is that when Mr Lennane was reporting to HBOS on the viability of the project in March 2004 in Ex C75, he was aware that the outstanding and significant interest on the mezzanine debt was excluded as a cost item from his own calculations, being something that he conceded he did not consider relevant at that time (T666). It is difficult to see how there can be an attribution of dishonest behaviour to the appellant in May 2004 while Mr Lennane was excluding the same cost items in his own cost analysis in March 2004. 

144In further support of the appellant's case on the appeal counsel submitted that on any review of the voluminous material CFAL was furnished with from time to time over the course of their extended negotiations with Westpoint, they could have been in no doubt (and in fact were in no doubt) that there would be little if any profit for Westpoint on the project after they had recovered their equity, and that the appellant's assertion that the project is ""still profitable"" must be (or might reasonably be) taken to refer to other considerations. I consider that there is force in that submission. (See Ex C75 and Ex C85 and the cross-examination of Mr O'Neill at T852-854 where he conceded that from the prospective of Westpoint the project was going to generate a loss and the cross-examination of Mr MacLaren at T1005-1008 to the same effect). 

145In the result, and despite the fact that there was no document which declared, in terms, that the approach to the calculation as profit = revenue less specific project costs was adopted by the appellant on behalf of Westpoint on the one hand and Mr Lennane from CFAL on the other, and despite the fact that Mr Lennane gave evidence that he understood ""profit"" in Ex C1 in the way contended for by the Crown, I am satisfied that the evidence allows for the drawing of a reasonable inference that in various of the dealings between Westpoint and CFAL, ultimately culminating in the correspondence that was Ex C1, that this was an approach which they both considered appropriate, or, at the very least, one that the Crown was unable to exclude may possibly have informed discussions about ""profit"" and ""profitability"" in May/June 2004 including, critically, in Ex C1 such that the profit statement could not be proved to be false and misleading to the knowledge of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 

146DAVIES J: I have read the draft judgments of Simpson J and Fullerton J. I agree with Simpson J's judgment in respect of both counts. 

147In deference to the view expressed by Fullerton J I wish to note a few matters that I consider significant in agreeing with Simpson J that the profit ground is made out.

148First, as Simpson J has pointed at [105] there was no evidence of any witness who accepted that ""profit"" might have a meaning different from that ordinarily attributed to it. Significantly, Mr MacLaren's evidence was to the contrary. In the passage referred to by Fullerton J at [144] where Mr MacLaren was being cross-examined about exhibit C85 this exchange occurred:

Q. So in fact the 12.8 figure - the methodology is okay that he's employed, isn't it, as far as - one way of working out profit, as I said, is you take away, ultimately, the 70 million loan. That's all spent, that's a cost. The 40 million is all spent, that's a cost. So you can work out a profit figure that way if you want to, right? 
A. That's no (sic) the way I would work it. (emphasis added)

149Mr MacLaren's view was significant because it was he who ultimately made the decision on the loan application and it was to him, and perhaps others in Scotland, to whom the information in the letter of 31 May 2004, or the letter itself, would ultimately go - a matter known to the Appellant as expressed in the first paragraph of the letter. 

150Secondly, as Simpson J says at [103], there was no indication prior to the conversation on 28 May 2004 that led to the writing of the letter of 31 May 2004 that project profit was a focus of discussion between Mr Lennane and the Appellant although, as the word ""still"" makes clear in what must have been the question (""whether the project is still profitable""), there had been passing reference to it in some of the documents, exhibits D8 and D15 being some examples. 

151It was a concern of Mr MacLaren as he made clear in his evidence at T993 - 994. He there explained his reasons for not wishing to be involved in a loss-making project. It was also a matter of importance for Mr O'Neill as he explained at T 804. That may very well have been the reason the question was asked in the conversation of 28 May.

152The significant thing in this regard is that the Appellant knew that the queries raised in the conversation of 28 May were raised in the context of the submission of the credit application to Scotland. His answer was unqualified particularly by reference to any prior understanding of the way it was contended on his behalf that he and Mr Lennane had used the term in their oral and written exchanges prior to that time. 

153Thirdly, Fullerton J suggests at [126] that CFAL's focus was on risk for reward. The Appellant contended in this regard that CFAL's only concern was to ensure that its debt was repaid. However, in 2002 when this application for finance was first being considered Mr O'Neil sent a fax to Mr Lennane on 22 December 2002 expressing his concerns about the deal and the project where he said:

Is CFAL in any way at risk (even reputational risk) if the prospectus is false/incorrect or materially at odds with project fundamentals?

154That fax went on to note his suspicions that Westpoint were taking some upfront cash and that there was double counting in Mr Lennane's reconciliation in the funding table. 

155That concern, when considered with both Mr MacLaren's and Mr O'Neill's evidence of not wanting to be involved in a loss-making project generally, is strong evidence against CFAL's only being concerned that it would be repaid its loan, something that was very likely in any event given the way the funding for the project was structured.

156Noting the test as stated in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 I consider upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty in relation to both counts.

2762222,R v Karl HERDEN and Iga SOSINSKA [2013] NSWDC 219,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

HIS HONOUR: Mr Herden and Ms Sosinska, you probably know the routine. I have got to talk about your case in what we call my remarks on sentence. I have got to say what you did and look at the arguments that have been put for you and then I announce your sentences at the end and you will have to wait till then. Some judges tell you in advance. I do not, because I want you to listen to what I am saying. 

1I am having to sentence Karl Anthony Herden and Iga Agata Sosinska for a serious crime. I have a lot of information about them personally. They have had two lives as ordinary people but had particular challenges as young people. In both cases they had to deal with some significant trauma. One of the ways of coping with those challenges and trauma was the use of illegal drugs and alcohol. But things did not improve and they became addicted to more potent drugs and the addictions gripped them both. They did not know each other as young people but now they are a couple. They committed the crime that I am sentencing them for together. 

2Their lives before this crime are reflected in their criminal records. Each of them have committed offences of petty crime dealt with in the Local Court but now they have committed a more serious offence which I have to deal with in the District Court. They bashed and robbed a man who was doing no more than withdrawing some money from an ATM. They therefore transferred or imposed upon him some measure of trauma. 

3The crime that I am sentencing each of them for is called robbery in company. It is a serious crime. It is made into a crime by s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. 

4I need to say something briefly about what happened. A man went to an ATM in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst to withdraw some money. It was a busy Saturday evening. Ms Sosinska sidled up next to him and tried to grab the money from him. All it was was $60. She was unsuccessful in getting the money and the man tried to get away. Mr Herden was with her. He was standing back a little. Ms Sosinska in the meantime chased the victim. Mr Herden joined in. The victim was tackled, punched and the money was taken. I do not need to find who exactly delivered the punch. To my mind the offence was initiated by Ms Sosinska but then Mr Herden joined in. 

5Ms Sosinska pleaded guilty to the charge of robbery but that was not accepted by the Crown who proceeded with the charge of robbery in company against both. The trial proceeded before me and a jury and on 13 June 2013 the jury returned verdicts of guilty of robbery in company in respect of both of the offenders. 

6It is important for a judge to say something about the personal circumstances of an offender in addition to the details of the crime. I have some material about each of Mr Herden and Ms Sosinska. 

7I will start with Mr Herden. Mr Herden is 37. He has a criminal record. In fact he has been dealt with by the District Court before for an aggravated enter a dwelling in company. He was given a 2 year prison sentence for that crime. Otherwise his offences have been petty crime dealt with by the Local Court but the crimes included one assault and one assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

8There is a report from a clinical and forensic psychologist named Mark Milic about Mr Herden. He noted the trauma which Mr Herden faced as a child which included the suicide of a brother and the death of his grandfather when he was an adult but reasonably young. When he was still in year 11 at school his mother died. 

9He has done various kinds of jobs and his longest job was as a cleaner for three years. He has two sons who are about eight and about ten and is presently in a relationship with Ms Sosinska who is not the mother of those boys. He has taken in the past marijuana, amphetamines, heroin and the amphetamines included ice. He has spent time in hospital with an episode of marijuana induced psychosis. To his credit he overcame his heroin addiction with the help of methadone, but relapsed using ice amphetamines. 

10He is interested in pursuing some vocational training. Mark Milic thought that Mr Herden ""articulated realistic plans to improve his work skills and gain access to his two children."" Mr Milic thought that Mr Herden ""would benefit from drug relapse prevention counselling."" 

11Ms Sosinska is 34. Her criminal history includes petty crime dealt with in various Local Courts. There was one common assault in 2009. She has had a lot of leniency extended to her, perhaps I should say opportunities. She has been given the benefit of various good behaviour bonds but resorts to petty crime such as shoplifting and goods in custody. She has breached bonds and spent time in gaol. She also has a conviction for the Federal offence of knowingly obtaining a payment which was not payable. In fact, significantly, Ms Sosinska was on parole when she committed this offence. She had been released only about a week earlier on parole for a driving offence when she committed this offence. She had to serve the balance of that parole and I will say something more about that later. The commission of the offence that I am sentencing her for was the only reason for the revocation of her parole. 

12There is a pre-sentence report prepared by the Silverwater Community Corrections Unit concerning Ms Sosinska. It referred to the fact that she has a son who is about 11. It referred to some trauma in her childhood when she says that she was sexually assaulted by the relative of a friend of hers. She was only about 12 years old. She in fact left school at year 12. She has undertaken various types of casual employment and has also taken government benefits. She has also undertaken work whilst in custody.

13Ms Sosinska started drinking alcohol when she was 12 and started using cannabis the following year. She linked that to the claim that she had been sexually assaulted. She began to experiment with ecstasy and amphetamines and LSD. This was when she was a teenager. She remained a cannabis user but had also become addicted to heroin by the time she was 19. She obviously needed a lot of money to support her habit which is reflected in her criminal record.

14To her credit, this year she completed a 3 month residential drug and alcohol program at Guthrie House. As the pre-sentence report said her ""positive urinalysis in June 2013 for 'Xanax' would indicate that the offender struggles with illicit drug use and appears to have unresolved emotional and drug abuse issues."" She had been using drugs on the day that she committed the offence that I am sentencing her for. She is being treated with anti-anxiety medication by Justice Health whilst she is in custody. She said that she experiences symptoms of anxiety, depression and paranoia and she copes with these, when her life is not in control, by the use of illicit drugs. The author of the report thought that Ms Sosinska ""appears to have insight into her personal and drug related issues, however, she struggles to address her longstanding reliance on illicit drugs."" 

15Ms Sosinska's mother lives in Poland and she has a family friend but her main relationship is with her co-offender, Mr Herden. She expressed some empathy for the victim of the offence. There were some recommendations for referral to various rehabilitation programs. 

16There is a psychological report which has been prepared regarding Ms Sosinska by a forensic psychologist Caroline Hare. Ms Hare noted the same history which I have already referred to, including Ms Sosinska's reliance on and descent into illegal drugs in order to cope with her emotional challenges. Her son was from a previous partner and she was in a violent relationship with him. Ms Hare thought that Ms Sosinska should have ""ongoing close monitoring of her mental health needs, and development and helpful and healthy coping strategies"". She thought that it was positive that Ms Sosinska had engaged in rehabilitation and individual therapy after this offence and thought that she would benefit from further therapy. She needed some relapse prevention interventions. 

17There is a report from a psychologist whom Ms Sosinska saw a couple of years ago, Tom Gross, who noted the struggles that she has and issues with custody of her son. 

18Mr M Crawford-Fish who appeared as counsel for Ms Sosinska on her trial and also in the sentence proceedings tendered a number of certificates and documents pointing to Ms Sosinska's education. There was also a note from a drug and alcohol worker at Leichhardt Women's Community Health Centre which noted that Ms Sosinska had in fact attended for a drug and alcohol counselling assessment before she was returned into custody. 

19Mr Herden has been in custody since 15 June 2012 on this offence only and I will date the sentence from then. 

20Ms Sosinska's history of custody is a little more complex. As I said, she committed this offence when she was only about a week into her parole for another offence. That parole was revoked from 20 July 2012. Mr Crawford-Fish drew my attention to the judgment of Simpson J with whom the other judges agreed in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58 about whether or not a sentence should be backdated somewhat when the only reason for the revocation of the parole was the offence which the sentencer is about to impose. It was acknowledged that sometimes of course an offender may get a further allowance of parole. On the other hand Simpson J expressed the view that that may not be appropriate where an offender has committed another offence within a short time of being released on to parole - that is certainly the case here - and when an offender has a relatively short period of parole - that is certainly the case here. In the circumstances I propose to make an allowance of 7 days in respect of the balance of parole. 

21Looking at exhibit B which is the Crown sentence summary, it indicates that the calculation of time spent in custody regarding this offence is 148 days up to 9 August 2013 when I heard sentence submissions. I propose to add another 21 days to that so that it becomes an allowance of 169 days and I will add the 7 days for the balance of the parole and backdate the sentence by 176 days so that it will commence on 6 March 2013. 

22I was reminded by Mr K N Magnus who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions in the sentence proceedings of the principles which relate to the sentencing of persons convicted of offences against s 97 of the Crimes Act. 

23Both Mr Crawford-Fish and Mr B Rowe (who appeared for Mr Herden) emphasised the fact that the robbery was obviously spontaneous and unplanned. I accept that submission. I accept Mr Crawford-Fish's submission that his client is showing positive signs and has made some significant steps towards her rehabilitation. I do note that the offence in this case involved some violence and also that in Ms Sosinska's case she was on conditional liberty when she committed the offence. There are, I accept from both counsel, special circumstances for adjusting the usual ratio between a non-parole period and a head sentence. Normally a non-parole period would be 75 per cent of a head sentence but in each case I will reduce the non-parole period. 

24Mr Magnus drew my attention of course to the Court of Criminal Appeal's guideline judgment about armed robbery which applies to robbery in company in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R 149. Drug taking is not an excuse for this sort of crime. In fact the impression one gets is that most of these armed robberies are committed by persons who are addicted to drugs. But the community cannot tolerate people assaulting and robbing its own members in order to supply themselves with their illicit drugs. The guideline judgment suggests a range of 4 to 5 years as a sentence. That of course assumed a plea of guilty. In this case there was a trial and no plea of guilty. I accept that the offence was in the lower third of objective seriousness for this kind of offence. On the other hand the maximum is 20 years imprisonment. 

25I had in mind that an appropriate sentence for each offender would be in the range of 5 years imprisonment. However I was provided with the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission which became MFI 28. It is apparent from those statistics that for all offenders only 24 per cent received a sentence of 4 years or greater and I am going to take that into account as a factor. I am not confident that I am right in taking that into account but I also bear in mind the efforts of each of the offenders to deal with their drug problems. 

26I regard an appropriate sentence for Ms Sosinska as one of 4 years imprisonment. Normally a non-parole period for that sentence would be one of 3 imprisonment but I propose to reduce the non-parole period to 2 years imprisonment. The special circumstances are the support that she will need in the community for her rehabilitation efforts. Backdated to 6 March 2013 her sentence will expire on 5 March 2017 and her non-parole period will expire on 5 March 2015. 

27I propose to impose a sentence on Mr Herden which is slightly less than that of Ms Sosinska. It will be 3 years and 9 months. That is because there was not present in his case the aggravating feature of the offence being committed whilst on parole. Mr Herden's sentence of 3 years and 9 months will commence on 15 June 2012 and will expire on 14 March 2016. I propose to fix a non-parole period in respect of Mr Herden of 1 year and 10 months which will commence on 15 June 2012 and will expire on 14 April 2014. 

HIS HONOUR: All right, Mr Herden, if you would stand up. 

28Mr Herden, I sentence you to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months. The non-parole period is 1 year and 10 months. It commenced when you went into custody on 15 June 2012 and it will expire on 14 April 2014. The balance is 1 year and 11 months commencing on 15 April 2014 and expiring on 14 June 2016. The first date on which you are eligible for parole will be next year, 14 April 2014. Have a seat.

29Ms Sosinska, I sentence you to 4 years imprisonment. That sentence will commence on 6 March 2013 and it will expire on 5 March 2017. I fix a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 6 March 2013 and expiring on 5 March 2015. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 5 March 2015. If you would have a seat.

HIS HONOUR: Now take your time and do the calculations to make sure I have it right.
ROWE: Your Honour, in relation to Mr Herden, I thought your Honour gave a balance of 1 year and 11 months commencing on 15 April 2014. I'm not renowned for my mathematical ability or even arithmetic but I think that would be 14 March 2016. 
HIS HONOUR: I should have said 14 March 2016. You are right.
ROWE: Thank you, your Honour, I might have misheard your Honour. 

30So to make it clear, Mr Herden's sentence is 3 years and 9 months. The non-parole period is 1 year and 10 months. The sentence commenced on 15 June 2012. The sentence expires overall 14 March 2016. The non-parole period expires 14 April 2014.

ROWE: Thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Does that make sense?
ROWE: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Crawford-Fish?
CRAWFORD-FISH: Your Honour, I agree with the figures.
HIS HONOUR: Ms Kelly, it seems right?
KELLY: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Now I need very briefly to explain to each offender. Is there anything else that I need to do? And I don't fix the release because they're both over 3 years. Now one thing is that you might get instructions on, both of them have a psychological report, a couple in Ms Sosinska's case. The Corrective Services authorities who classify prisoners say that such reports are very helpful to them in the classification and my associate can send those today or tomorrow but will not - some people don't want that sort of material floating around so if you would get instructions.
ROWE: My client has no objection to that, your Honour, thank you.
CRAWFORD-FISH: Yes, Ms Sosinska would be grateful that that be done.
HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Crawford-Fish, thanks Mr Rowe. Now I'm just stating the obvious but I have to explain it to you. Ms Sosinska, you've received a 4 year sentence. It's backdated to take into account the time you've spent in custody and I've given you a week for the balance of parole as well. So it started back on 6 March 2013 and the overall sentence will expire 5 March 2017, so you're still under sentence until then. I have specified a non-parole period of 2 years so that you'll be eligible for parole on 5 March 2015, do you understand that? Whether you get parole, as you know, is up to the Parole Board, not me.
Mr Herden, your sentence is 3 months less because Ms Sosinska was on parole when she committed the offence, you weren't. So your overall sentence is 3 years and 9 months. I've backdated it to when you first went into custody last year on 15 June. It therefore expires overall on 14 March 2016. You're under sentence until then. Your non-parole period is 1 year and 10 months and that will expire on 14 April next year when you'll be eligible for parole and, as you know, whether you get parole is up to the Parole Authority. 
Anything else from anyone? 
ROWE: Nothing, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Crawford-Fish?
CRAWFORD-FISH: Your Honour, I tendered certificates on sentence and I'm not sure of the exhibit number but I wondered whether I could substitute copies of those certificates and have the original certificates returned.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, I think that is right. Yes, I think what we'll do is if you provide the copies for a start. The court officer will take the copies. You also provided working copies and I've been working from those and what we'll do is my associate will retrieve the originals from the court file, I will mark the copies as the exhibit - is that okay, Ms Kelly?
KELLY: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: And my associate will send back to you in the document exchange the originals. Is that satisfactory?
CRAWFORD-FISH: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Anything else?
CRAWFORD-FISH: No, your Honour.

		03 September 2013",2013-08-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762231,Baker v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 329,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  On 9 March 2012 Cyril Brett Baker (the applicant) was convicted and fined $1,168 and disqualified from holding a driver's licence for 12 months.  These penalties were imposed for four offences which took place in mid-2011 (the date or dates are not identified in the papers before this Court), for failing or refusing to undergo a breath test, refusing to produce a licence and state his name, exceeding the speed limit by more than 10km per hour, and failing or refusing to undergo a breath analysis.
2The applicant had rights of appeal pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), but on 24 April 2012 he sought judicial review of the judgment and orders of the Local Court pursuant to ss 69 and 69B of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).  An amended summons was filed on 14 May 2012.  That summons was listed for hearing on 31 January 2013 before Latham J in the Common Law Division.  On 7 February 2013 she dismissed the amended summons with costs: Baker v New South Wales Police [2013] NSWSC 57.
3The present proceeding is an application for leave to appeal from that judgment.  Leave to appeal was refused at the hearing of the application.  The reasons for that order are as follows.
Commencement of proceedings in this Court4On 26 February 2013 the applicant filed a notice of intention to appeal, from the judgment of the primary judge.  On 30 April 2013 he filed a summons seeking leave to appeal.
5The respondent named in the proceedings initially was the ""NSW Police Force"".  That body is established by s 4 of the Police Act 1990 (NSW) but is not an individual or a body corporate capable of being sued in that name.  The proceedings against the applicant were probably the subject of an information (court attendance notice) issued by a police officer, although that does not appear from the papers.  The appropriate respondent was the officer who was the informant in the Local Court.  It is sufficient to name the Attorney General for New South Wales.  Because the arguments foreshadowed by the applicant purported to raise a constitutional issue, notices were issued under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to the Attorneys of the Commonwealth and the various States.  The Attorney General for New South Wales was joined on his application in response to that notice.
6The Crown Solicitor filed a ""response"" to the application for leave to appeal which asserted that neither the notice of intention to appeal nor the summons was served within time.  A copy of the white folder, including the notice and the summons were said to have been served on the Attorney on 30 April 2013.  The Crown Solicitor submitted that an extension of time was required and should be refused because the proposed appeal lacked merit.
7While it is true that there is no evidence that the documents had been filed in a timely fashion, there was no evidence that they had not.  Accordingly, to the extent that it is necessary to extend time the applicant should have an extension of time until 30 April 2013.  
Grounds of appeal - right to a jury8The gravamen of the applicant's complaint in the Court below was that he had an ""inalienable right to trial by jury and the lawful judgment of my equals that has been guaranteed forever by Magna Carta 1215, the Confirmation of Charters 1297, the Petition of Rights 1627, the Habeas Corpus Act 1640 (to Abolish the Star Chamber) and the Bill of Rights 1689 which are entrenched common law in Australia"".  He also claimed damages in the amount of $250,000 for breach of the Habeas Corpus Act 1640.
9The primary judge noted that the offences for which he had been brought before the Local Court were offences against the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW) and the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW).  The primary judge further noted that the applicant had sought to invoke s 80 of the Constitution, which provides (in part) that ""[t]he trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury ..."".  The applicant was not charged with an offence against any law of the Commonwealth, which is a different juristic entity from the State.  Section 80 was irrelevant.  For that incontrovertible proposition, the primary judge cited authority, namely Byrnes v The Queen [1999] HCA 38; 199 CLR 1 at [70] (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ).  
10The applicant also sought to rely upon the various Imperial statutes to which reference has been made above.  The operation of those statutes (to the extent that they are relevant) depends upon the effect of the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW).  Those Imperial enactments not set out in the First Schedule to the 1969 Act (which were abolished) and those enactments which are set out in the Third Schedule (none of which are presently relevant) remain in force, except to the extent that they have been affected by any State Act: s 6(b); Galea v New South Wales Egg Corporation [1989] NSWCA 81 at p 6(20)-(35).  
11As the primary judge explained, the charges were properly dealt with as summary offences pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 6(1)(c).  They were to be dealt with in the Local Court: Criminal Procedure Act, s 7(1).  The Local Court was properly constituted by a magistrate to hear and determine such proceedings: Local Court Act 2007 (NSW), s 8.  Accordingly, the applicant had no right to a trial by jury.  (It is not necessary to explore the fallacious proposition that he had a right to trial by jury under the Imperial Acts upon which he sought to rely.)  
Jurisdiction12The applicant also alleged he had a right to trial by jury of the judicial review proceedings heard by Latham J, a proposition which she rejected.   There was no error in the primary judge's conclusion that, as a single judge of the Court, she had jurisdiction to determine the judicial review proceedings (pursuant to ss 40 and 53 of the Supreme Court Act) and that, in the absence of an order otherwise, the proceedings were to be heard without a jury (pursuant to s 85(1) of that Act): at [19].  Indeed, there can be no jury trial in civil proceedings in this State (other than defamation proceedings) unless the court is affirmatively satisfied that ""the interests of justice require a trial by jury"": s 85(2)(b).
13The court could not in any event have been so satisfied.  Proceedings for prerogative relief were not traditionally heard by a judge with a jury.  The conventional role of a jury is to determine facts and none were in issue in this case.
14The summons seeking leave to appeal from the judgment of the primary judge stated that it was brought under s 101 of the Supreme Court Act.  That was correct: leave was required pursuant to s 101(2)(r).  In the course of submissions, the applicant claimed that he had a right of appeal without leave, as a ""common law right"".  That was not correct: there is no common law right of appeal. 
Validity of Judicial Appointments15Mr Baker contends that the primary judge was not lawfully appointed to the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court Act is not lawful ""due to not ever receiving valid Royal Assent"".  The basis for that contention was that the Governor of New South Wales, who gave assent to that legislation, was not validly appointed by ""Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second as there have been no Orders from the Privy Council creating that office"": summary of argument [10], [20].
16The primary judge rejected the challenge to the validity of her appointment.  She said, correctly, that the Privy Council does not appoint the Governor of New South Wales: [27].   Prior to 1987, the Governor of New South Wales was appointed by Commission issued under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet, pursuant to Letters Patent constituting the Office of Governor of the State of NSW.  Since 1987, the Governor of New South Wales is appointed ""by Commission under Her Majesty's Sign Manual and the Public Seal of the State"": Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), s 9A, and see generally, A Twomey, The Constitution of New South Wales (Federation Press, 2004), 118, 146, 607-618.
Conclusion17The grounds upon which the applicant sought to appeal from the decision of the primary judge were all untenable.  For these reasons leave to appeal was refused at the hearing of the application. The Court should direct that the Attorney General be named as the respondent.  The Attorney did not seek costs.
18In addition to the order already made dismissing the application, the Court makes the following further orders:
(1) Direct that the Attorney General be named as the respondent.
(2) To the extent that it is necessary, extend the time for service of the notice of intention to appeal and the summons seeking leave to appeal until 30 April 2013.

2762241,Office of State Revenue v El Kazzi (No. 2) [2013] NSWLC 19,"Judgment

Background
1The accused (""the applicant"") is charged with offences arising out of alleged false statements relating to an application for the First Home Owners Grant and related stamp duty exemption and also to false statements made to officers of the Office of State Revenue (""OSR"") during an investigation into her grant and stamp duty exemption. Additionally, there are offences relating to the failure to comply with conditions of the grant and stamp duty exemption. 

2On 28 June 2012 the OSR commenced these proceedings by the issue of ten Court Attendance Notices (""the CANs""). The applicant has entered a plea of not guilty but seeks a permanent stay of the proceedings on a number of grounds and objects to the form of the CANs on the grounds of duplicity.

3On 12 August 2013 the Court delivered reasons refusing the applicant's permanent stay application: Office of State Revenue v El Kazzi (No. 1) [2013] NSWLC 18. These reasons deal with the remaining issue of whether CAN Sequences 1 and 4-10 are duplicitous.

Relevant principles concerning the Rule against Duplicity
4In S v The Queen [1989] HCA 66; (1989) 168 CLR 266 Gaudron and McHugh JJ at [5]-[6] explained the basis of the rule against duplicity as:
5. The rule against duplicitous counts in an indictment originated as early as the seventeenth century... It may be... that the rule grew out of the strict formalities associated with criminal pleadings at a time when the difference between misdemeanour and felony was the difference between life and death. However, the rule against duplicitous counts has, for a very long time, rested on other considerations. One important consideration is the orderly administration of criminal justice. There are a number of aspects to this consideration: a court must know what charge it is entertaining in order to ensure that evidence is properly admitted, and in order to instruct the jury properly as to the law to be applied; in the event of conviction, a court must know the offence for which the defendant is to be punished; and the record must show of what offence a person has been acquitted or convicted in order for that person to avail himself or herself, if the need should arise, of a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict...

6. The rule against duplicitous counts has also long rested upon a basic consideration of fairness, namely, that an accused should know what case he or she has to meet. See, for example, R. v. Robe, at p 999 (p 994 of ER) where it was said ""this is so general a charge, that it is impossible any man can prepare to defend himself on this prosecution ... "". See also R. v. Hollond, per Lord Kenyon C.J. at p 623 (p 348 of ER); R. v. North (1825) 6 Dowl & Ry 143, at p 146 (28 RR 538, at p 541); R. v. Morley, at pp 224-225 (p 654 of ER); and Cotterill v. Lempriere, per Lord Esher M.R. at p 639...

5In Chapman v R [2013] NSWCCA 91 Adamson J, with Hebden CJ at CL and Davies J agreeing, succinctly stated the object of the rule against duplicity to be that at [19]: 
The object of the rule against duplicity has always been that there should be no uncertainty as to the offence charged: Chief Constable of Norfolk v Clayton [1983] 2 AC 473. The rule against duplicity prohibits a single count in an indictment charging a person with the commission of more than one offence: S v The Queen at 280-281 per Toohey J, citing Archbold, Pleading, Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases, 43 ed (1988), page 46. 
The Court said at [25] that this involves an analysis of:
25. The cases draw a distinction, for the purpose of determining whether a count in an indictment is bad for duplicity, between alternative factual bases of liability on the one hand and alternative legal formulations of liability based on the same or substantially the same facts: R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; 110 A Crim R 198 (Cramp) at [65] per Barr J, Sully and Ireland JJ agreeing.

6In Romeyko v Samuels (1972) 2 SASR 529; (1972) 19 FLR 322, Bray CJ said in the case of statutory offences that:
The true distinction, broadly speaking, it seems to me, is between a statute which penalises one or more acts, in which case, two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several such characteristics.

7Of both binding and persuasive authority in the interpretation of the s 178BB, s 192G, s 55(a) and s 44(1)(a) offences in this matter is the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Giam v R [1999] NSWCCA 53; (1999) 104 A Crim R 416, where the Court (Spigelman CJ, with Abadee and Adams JJ agreeing), held that s 178BB created but a singular offence for ""any statement... in a material particular"". At [16]-[20] Spigelman CJ said:
16 It was submitted in this case, as it was in Walsh v Tattersall, that s8(b) of the Interpretations Act 1987 stating that the use of the singular will include the plural may be applicable in this case, so that the word ""statement"" in s178BB of the Crimes Act shall be understood to mean ""statements"". In my view that submission should not be accepted.
17 The first reason for that is this is a criminal statute and it should be construed strictly. The second reason is that the word immediately preceding the word ""statement"" is the word ""any"", which points to a degree of singularity. Thirdly, the conclusion is reinforced by the crucial sub-element of the same element in the section, namely the definition of the nature of the statement. The statement has to be a statement which a person knows to be false or misleading ""in a material particular"", or which is in fact false or misleading ""in a material particular"" and which is ""made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or false or misleading"", again, ""in a material particular"".
18 The reference to the definite article in these crucial references to ""material particularity"" is such as to identify the fact that a single statement is being referred to on the proper construction of s178BB.
19 There is a category of cases in which a single statement can be constituted from more than one utterance or representation. Indeed, the second of the two statements in the charges under consideration in this case, namely whether or not a person had authority to enter into a contract, is characteristically a ""statement"" which can be so described. It is a ""statement"" which on many occasions is an inference to be drawn from a number of utterances and a course of conduct.
20 In Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 662 Gleeson CJ said:
""As King CJ observed in R v Traino (1987) 45 SASR 473 in the context of perjury, a number of utterances made on oath by an individual concerning a given subject may or may not, depending upon the circumstances, constitute a single false statement or a number of false statements or, of course, a number of statements some of which are false and some of which are not. Each false statement involves a separate crime of perjury. Considerations of commonsense and fairness enter into a judgment on the question of how many statements ought to be taken to have resulted from a number of utterances.""

The parties' arguments
8The applicant's submission is that as the various statutory provisions create a singular offence then it is impermissible to charge more than one prohibited act in the one CAN. 

9The prosecutor responds in a general way to say that the applicant's submissions are misconceived. The prosecutor relies upon a number of authorities where it was held, in relation to somewhat analogous offences, that there was no duplicity in charging one offence although a number of false particulars were involved as there could be falsity in one or many respects in a statement. 

10The nature of the statutory offences in this context is dealt with below.

CAN Sequences 1, 6 and 8
11 The prosecutor avers in each of these Sequences the following particulars of factual liability:
(1)CAN Sequence 1 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900:

Statement:
On 23 September 2008 the defendant signed an application form under the First Home Owner Grant Act 2000 and was successful in obtaining a grant under that Act in the amount of $7000.

False or misleading particulars:
The application form signed by the defendant contained the following statements which were false or misleading:

1. In response to the question: ""Are any of the applicants or their spouse/partner(s) related to or associated with the vendor or builder?"" the defendant ticked box marked ""No"".

2. In response to the prompt: ""Date when occupation as a principal place of residence commenced or is intended to commence (if not known please estimate)"" the defendant entered the date: ""03/09/2008"".

(2)CAN Sequence 6 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900:

Statement:
On 15 February 2010 the defendant signed a First Home Benefits Residency Confirmation Statutory Declaration attaching a signed statement and the following documents addressed to the defendant:

a. RTA driver licence renewal notice dated 24 March 2009;
b. Tru Energy gas account issued 17 February 2009;
c. Tru Energy electricity account issued 14 February 2009

False or misleading particulars:
The statutory declaration signed by the defendant contained the following statements that were false or misleading:

1. ""Yes, I occupied the property for the period shown below: I started residing in the property on 12/2008 and I stopped living in the property on 7/2009"".

2. In response to the question: ""Did all the purchasers live in the property during this period?"" the defendant ticked the box ""Yes"".

The statement signed by the defendant attached to the statutory declaration contained the following statement:

""Please be advised that [the property] is my Principal place of Residency.""

(3)CAN Sequence 8 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 192G(b) of the Crimes Act 1900:

Statement:
The defendant signed a First Home Benefits Objection to an Assessment or Decision form attaching a signed statement and supporting documents as follows:
1. ASIC Company Name Search for Direct Flow Plumbing Services Pty Limited.
2. Letter from L'Yvonne's Hair Studio dated 1 June 2009.
3. Australian Business Register search for Adam Barba.
4. Australian Business Register search for Grace El Kazzi.
5. Letter to Grace El Kazzi from Khourys and Associates dated 4 May 2010.
6. Letter to Adam Barba from Khourys and Associates dated 4 May 2010.""

False or misleading in a material particular:
The attachment to the First Home Benefits Objection to an Assessment or Decision form signed by the defendant contained the following material particulars which were false or misleading:

1. ""The plan was to move into the property straight after the wedding December 2008 to start our new life in our new home"".

2. ""So late February the tenant moved in with us renting the 2 out of three bedrooms"".

3. ""we decided to move back to my parents house with my husband so my Mum help me with my pregnancy especially the first 3 month. Intention was to move back to our unit as soon as things settle down in health & work"".

4. ""we were forced to share the unit to help in servicing the loan"".

5. ""Our intention from day one to be our principal place of residency.""

12The statutory offences at the time were as follows:
178BB Obtaining money etc by false or misleading statements
(1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
...

192G Intention to defraud by false or misleading statement
A person who dishonestly makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) that is false or misleading in a material particular with the intention of: 
(a) obtaining property belonging to another, or
(b) obtaining a financial advantage or causing a financial disadvantage,
is guilty of an offence. 
Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years.

Determination
13The Court accepts the applicant's submission that CANs 1 (two statements), 6 (three statements) and 8 (five statements) all aver more than one statement which are also similarly alleged to be false or misleading in a material particular and are duplicitous. Further, as CAN 8 also avers those statements were for the purpose of obtaining both the stamp duty exemption and the grant, it avers two separate financial advantages and consequently is also duplicitous. 

14Insofar as CANs 1 and 6 are concerned, the Court must follow the decision in Giam v R in determining that these CANs are duplicitous. Section 178BB was repealed and replaced by s 192G on 22 February 2010. An analysis of s192G reveals that the only material difference now is that an element of the offence of ""dishonestly"" has been added but otherwise the words ""any statement... in a material particular"" remain. On the proper construction of s 192G the Court concludes that CAN 8 is also duplicitous following the reasoning in Giam v R.

CAN Sequences 4 and 10
15CAN Sequence 4 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 55(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1996:

Statement:
On 15 February 2010 the defendant signed a First Home Benefits Residency Confirmation Statutory Declaration attaching a signed statement and the following documents addressed to the defendant:

a) RTA driver licence renewal notice dated 24 March 2009;
b) Tru Energy gas account issued 17 February 2009;
c) Tru Energy electricity account issued 14 February 2009

To a Taxation Officer:
The declaration and attached statement and attached documents were sent by the defendant to Margaux Perrone at the Office of State Revenue Compliance Branch.

False or misleading particulars:
The statutory declaration signed by the defendant contained the following statements that were false or misleading:

1. ""Yes, I occupied the property for the period shown below: I started residing in the property on 12/2008 and I stopped living in the property on 7/2009"".

2. In response to the question: ""Did all the purchasers live in the property during this period?"", the defendant ticked the box ""Yes"".

The statement signed by the defendant attached to the statutory declaration contained the following statement:

""Please be advised that [the property] is my Principal place of Residency.""

16CAN Sequence 10 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 55(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1996.

Statement:
The defendant signed a First Home Benefits Objection to an Assessment or Decision form attaching a signed statement and supporting documents as follows:
1. ASIC Company Name Search for Direct Flow Plumbing Services Pty Limited.
2. Letter from L'Yvonne's Hair Studio dated 1 June 2009.
3. Australian Business Register search for Adam Barba.
4. Australian Business Register search for Grace El Kazzi.
5. Letter to Grace El Kazzi from Khourys and Associates dated 4 May 2010.
6. Letter to Adam Barba from Khourys and Associates dated 4 May 2010.

False or misleading in a material particular:

The attachment to the First Home Benefits Objection to an Assessment or Decision form signed by the defendant contained the following material particulars which were false or misleading:

1. ""The plan was to move into the property straight after the wedding December 2008 to start our new life in our new home"".

2. ""So late February the tenant moved in with us renting the 2 out of three bedrooms"".

3. ""we decided to move back to my parents house with my husband so my Mum help me with my pregnancy especially the first 3 month. Intention was to move back to our unit as soon as things settle down in health & work"".

4. ""we were forced to share the unit to help in servicing the loan"".

5. ""Our intention from day one to be our principal place of residency.""

17The statutory offence at the time was:
55 Knowingly giving false or misleading information
A person must not: 
(a) make a statement, orally or in writing, to a tax officer, or
(b) give information, orally or in writing, to a tax officer,
knowing that it is false or misleading in a material particular. 
Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.

Determination
18The Court accepts the applicant's submission that CANs 4 (three statements) and 10 (five statements) all aver more than one statement, which are also similarly alleged to be false or misleading in a material particular, and are duplicitous. The applicant also submits that as CAN 4 also avers those statements were made in two different documents (the First Home Benefits Residency Confirmation Statutory Declaration and a separate statement) it is also duplicitous. As the Court does not have those documents before it at this stage it is not in a position to determine this further objection. 

19Insofar as s 55(a) also uses the words ""a statement... in a material particular"" in the singular then, a fortiori, on the proper construction of s 55(a) the Court concludes that CANs 4 and 10 are also duplicitous following the reasoning in Giam v R.

CAN Sequences 5 and 9
20CAN Sequence 5 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 44(1)(a) of the First Home Owner Grant Act 2000:
Statement:
On 15 February 2010 the defendant signed a First Home Benefits Residency Confirmation Statutory Declaration attaching a signed statement and the following documents addressed to the defendant:

a) RTA driver licence renewal notice dated 24 March 2009;
b) Tru Energy gas account issued 17 February 2009;
c) Tru Energy electricity account issued 14 February 2009

False or misleading in a material particular:

The statutory declaration signed by the defendant contained the following statements that were false or misleading:

1. ""Yes, I occupied the property for the period shown below: I started residing in the property on 12/2008 and I stopped living in the property on 7/2009"".

2. In response to the question: ""Did all the purchasers live in the property during this period?"" the defendant ticked the box ""Yes"".

The statement signed by the defendant attached to the statutory declaration contained the following statement:

""Please be advised that [the property] is my Principal place of Residency.""

21CAN Sequence 9 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 44(1)(a) of the FHOG Act
Statement:
The defendant signed a First Home Benefits Objection to an Assessment or Decision form attaching a signed statement and supporting documents as follows:
1. ASIC Company Name Search for Direct Flow Plumbing Services Pty Limited.
2. Letter from L'Yvonne's Hair Studio dated 1 June 2009.
3. Australian Business Register search for Adam Barba.
4. Australian Business Register search for Grace El Kazzi.
5. Letter to Grace El Kazzi from Khourys and Associates dated 4 May 2010.
6. Letter to Adam Barba from Khourys and Associates dated 4 May 2010.

False or misleading in a material particular:
The attachment to the First Home Benefits Objection to an Assessment or Decision form signed by the defendant contained the following material particulars which were false or misleading:

1. ""The plan was to move into the property straight after the wedding December 2008 to start our new life in our new home"".

2. ""So late February the tenant moved in with us renting the 2 out of three bedrooms"".

3. ""we decided to move back to my parents house with my husband so my Mum help me with my pregnancy especially the first 3 month. Intention was to move back to our unit as soon as things settle down in health & work"".

4. ""we were forced to share the unit to help in servicing the loan"".

5. ""Our intention from day one to be our principal place of residency.""

22 The statutory offence at the time was:
44 Knowingly giving false or misleading information
(1) A person must not: 
(a) make a statement, orally or in writing, to an authorised officer, or
(b) give information, orally or in writing, to an authorised officer,
knowing that it is false or misleading in a material particular. 
Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.
(2) A person must not, in or in relation to an application for a first home owner grant, make a statement or give any information knowing that it is false or misleading in a material particular. 
Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.

Determination
23The Court accepts the applicant's submission that CANs 5 (three statements) and 9 (five statements) all aver more than one statement, which are also similarly alleged to be false or misleading in a material particular, and are duplicitous. Again, the applicant submits that as CAN 5 also avers those statements were made in two different documents (the First Home Benefits Residency Confirmation Statutory Declaration and a separate statement) it is also duplicitous. As the Court does not have those documents before it at this stage it is not in a position to determine this further objection. 

24Insofar as s 44(1)(a) also uses the words ""a statement... in a material particular"" both in the singular then, a fortiori, on the proper construction of s 44(1)(a) the Court concludes that CANs 5 and 9 are also duplicitous following the reasoning in Giam v R.

CAN Sequence 7
25CAN Sequence 7 avers the following ""Short Particulars"" alleging a breach of s 25A of the Oaths Act 1900:
Statutory Declaration:
On 15 February 2010 the defendant wilfully and corruptly declared a First Home Benefits Residency Confirmation Statutory Declaration attaching a signed statement and the following documents addressed to the defendant:

RTA driver licence renewal notice dated 24 March 2009;
Tru Energy gas account issued 17 February 2009;
Tru Energy electricity account issued 14 February 2009

Knowing the declaration to be untrue in a material particular:
The defendant declared the statutory declaration knowing it to contain the following untrue material particulars:

""Yes, I occupied the property for the period shown below: I started residing in the property on 12/2008 and I stopped living in the property on 7/2009"".

In response to the question: ""Did all the purchasers live in the property during this period?"" the defendant ticked the box ""Yes"".

The statement signed by the defendant attached to the statutory declaration contained the following statement:

""Please be advised that [the property] is my Principal place of Residency.""

26The statutory offence at the time was:
25A False declaration for material benefit
In all cases where by this Part, or under the authority thereof, or by virtue of any power or authority hereby given, a declaration: 
(a) is substituted in lieu of an oath or affidavit, or
(b) is directed or authorised to be made and subscribed, although not substituted in lieu of an oath or affidavit,
any person who wilfully and corruptly makes and subscribes any such declaration, knowing the same to be untrue in any material particular, and who derives or attempts to derive a material benefit as a consequence of the untrue particular is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years.

27The false declaration provision in s 25A prohibits an offence of "" wilfully and corruptly makes and subscribes any such declaration, ... in any material particular"" and not to ""a material particular"" as is found in both s 178BB and s 44(1)(a). Further, s 25A focuses on the declaration itself as a whole unlike s 178BB and s 44(1)(a), which refer to ""any statement"" evincing an intention to deal with the declaration as a whole providing it is false in ""any material particular"" (the Court's emphasis). 

28On the proper construction of s 25A there is but one act prohibited although it may have more than one false characteristic: Romeyko v Samuels; Giam v R at [20].

The consequences of the determination that the CANs are duplicitous
29The prosecutor in its written submissions has foreshadowed that in the event of the Court coming to the view that the CANs are duplicitous it will take the following course:
(a)Regarding CAN Sequences 4 and 10 (s 55(a) Taxation Administration Act 1996 offences) it will make an election of the particulars relied upon under s 16 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986; see Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467; [1938] ALR 104; Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656; 48 A Crim R 16.
(b)Regarding CAN Sequence 1 (s 178BB Crimes Act 1900 offence) it will file two separate charges; in relation to Sequence 6 (s 178BB Crimes Act 1900 offence) it will file three separate charges; and, in relation to Sequence 8 (s 192G(b) Crimes Act 1900 offence) it will file ten separate charges. The prosecutor further foreshadows that in the event the Court accepts the applicant's argument that Sequence 6 is also duplicitous because it alleges two financial advantages (the grant and the stamp duty exemption) it will file instead six separate charges.

30The applicant responds that in the event the prosecutor adopts the 
course foreshadowed the Court will need to have careful regard to s 21(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which provides:
21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 
(1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.

31The difficulty with the applicant's submission is that until the form of the election is known the court is not in a position to determine whether it amounts to an amendment within the meaning of s 21 or to no more than a variance between the form of the CAN and the evidence adduced within the meaning of s 16(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In the ""Description of Offence"" in the CANs the offences are otherwise averred in general terms and appear to comply with s 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It is the ""Short Particulars"" of each offence that on the face of the CANs offend the rule against duplicity. 

32If the election were to be an amendment the applicant submits that there is no ""merits of the case"" (s 21(1)) allowing the amendment for the following reasons:
(a)The CANS are defective and oppressive, in their particulars and their multiplicity.
(b)There has been considerable delay, unexplained, in bringing these charges. The grants and exemptions relate to 2008. The proceedings did not commence until late August 2012.
(c)If an amendment is granted, there would be further considerable delay, and expense to the applicant.
(d)The principle of finality and economical and expeditious justice, which governs the conduct of Local Court proceedings, would be undermined.
(e)As the applicant has paid back the original grant and significant penalties, specific and general deterrence principles have been met.

33The court notes that it has already determined a number of these objections in its reasons for refusing the permanent stay application. Some of these objections are no more than submissions at this stage as there is no election or new charges let alone any evidence before the court of ""further considerable delay, and expense to the applicant"" which may or may not ensue. It may be, for instance, that no further evidence will be required or the abandonment of some of the particulars by election will shorten the length of the evidence as it currently stands and reduce the hearing time and any further delay. The applicant may well be advantaged forensically as well as the peril she may ultimately face. Any relevant prejudice and injustice can only be dealt with if and when that situation was to arise.

34In relation to any further charges that may be laid as foreshadowed by the prosecutor the provisions of s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 may or may not apply. Whether the applicant's objections referred to above actually are relevant can only be determined if that situation were to arise. If it does then it may be that some of those objections about ""the merits of the case"" will arise in a wider sense beyond the terms of s 21.

		20 January 2014",2013-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2762242,In the matter of Gap Constructions Pty Limited [2013] NSWSC 1262,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings were commenced on 17 June 2011.  Since then they have had a long and tortured interlocutory history in both this Court and the Court of Appeal.  It is unnecessary for me to set out that history in any particular detail.
2For present purposes it is sufficient that I note that the active parties remaining in these proceedings are the plaintiff, the third defendant Mr Bosganas and his corporate vehicle the second defendant.
3On 18 January 2012 Mr Bosganas was charged with a number of criminal offences.  It is common ground between the parties that the subject matter of the present civil proceedings and the subject matter of the criminal charges against Mr Bosganas is, for all intents and purposes, identical.
4There are before the Court today two notices of motion.  The first is a motion filed on behalf of Mr Bosganas for orders that these proceedings be stayed until the finalisation of the criminal proceedings against him in the District Court.  Those proceedings were, on 31 May 2013, fixed for hearing in the District Court commencing on 8 October 2013.  Having regard to the possibility that the criminal trial will take some 10 weeks, Mr Bosganas's motion proposes that these proceedings then be adjourned for further directions to 4 December 2013.
5The plaintiff filed a motion on 8 August 2013 which is responsive to Mr Bosganas's motion.  I give it that description because on 30 May 2013, Rein J, on Mr Bosganas's application, ordered the plaintiff to provide security for costs in these proceedings in the sum of $100,000.  That security has been provided by the plaintiff.  By its motion filed on 8 August 2013 the plaintiff seeks orders that, if the proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the criminal prosecution, the $100,000 which the plaintiff has provided by way of security and any interest accrued thereon be returned to the first plaintiff.  In doing so, the plaintiff does not cavil with the order for security.  Rather, the plaintiff submits that the financial burden, such as it is, for the plaintiff represented by the cost of having provided the security ought to be suspended for the duration of any stay of these proceedings while the criminal proceedings run their course.
6The principles to be applied in relation to an application for a stay of civil proceedings pending resolution of criminal proceedings which involve the same subject matter were set out by Wooton J in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 at paragraphs 206-207: 
I approach the decision of this matter with the following guidelines:
(a) Prima facie a plaintiff is entitled to have his action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the court (Rochfort v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd at 19);
(b) It is a grave matter to interfere with this entitlement by a stay of proceedings, which requires justification on proper grounds (ibid);
(c) The burden is on the defendant in a civil action to show that it is just and convenient that the plaintiff's ordinary rights should be interfered with (Jefferson v Bhetcha at 905);
(d) Neither an accused (ibid) nor the Crown (Rochfort v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd at 21) are entitled as of right to have a civil proceeding stayed because of a pending or possible criminal proceeding;
(e) The court's task is one of ""the balancing of justice between the parties"" (Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha at 904), taking account of all relevant factors (ibid at 905);
(f) Each case must be judged on its own merits, and it would be wrong and undesirable to attempt to define in the abstract what are the relevant factors (ibid at 905);
(g) One factor to take into account where there are pending or possible criminal proceedings is what is sometimes referred to as the accused's ""right of silence"", and the reasons why that right, under the law as it stands, is a right of a defendant in a criminal proceeding (ibid at 904). I return to this subject below;
(h) However, the so-called ""right of silence"" does not extend to give such a defendant as a matter of right the same protection in contemporaneous civil proceedings. The plaintiff in a civil action is not debarred from pursuing action in accordance with the normal rules merely because to do so would, or might, result in the defendant, if he wished to defend the action, having to disclose, in resisting an application for summary judgment, in the pleading of his defence, or by way of discovery or otherwise, what his defence is likely to be in the criminal proceeding (ibid at 904-5);
(i) The court should consider whether there is a real and not merely notional danger of injustice in the criminal proceedings (ibid at 905);
(j) In this regard factors which may be relevant include:
(i)  the possibility of publicity that might reach and influence jurors in the civil proceedings (ibid at 905);(ii)  the proximity of the criminal hearing (ibid at 905);(iii)  the possibility of miscarriage of justice eg by disclosure of a defence enabling the fabrication of evidence by prosecution witnesses, or interference with defence witnesses (ibid at 905);(iv)  the burden on the defendant of preparing for both sets of proceedings concurrently (Beecee Group v Barton);(v)  whether the defendant has already disclosed his defence to the allegations (Caesar v Somner at 932; Re Saltergate Insurance Co Ltd at 736);(vi)  the conduct of the defendant, including his own prior invocation of civil process when it suited him (cf Re Saltergate Insurance Co Ltd at 735-6); 
(k) The effect on the plaintiff must also be considered and weighed against the effect on the defendant. In this connection I suggest below that it may be relevant to consider the nature of the defendant's obligation to the plaintiff;
(l) In an appropriate case the proceedings may be allowed to proceed to a certain stage, eg, setting down for trial, and then stayed Beecee Group v Barton [sic]).
7Having regard to those principles, Mr Bosganas relies on certain particular matters in support of his application for a stay.
8First, these proceedings are at the stage where the plaintiff has filed its evidence and the next logical step would be for an order to be made for Mr Bosganas to file his evidence in defence.  It is submitted on behalf of Mr Bosganas that between now and the criminal hearing in October and, obviously enough, during the hearing itself, his attention and that of his legal advisers will be fully focused on dealing with the criminal prosecution.  That is undoubtedly a relevant factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion to stay civil proceedings.
9Second, it is submitted on behalf of Mr Bosganas that the period of the stay, as matters presently stand, is likely to be relatively short when measured against the already lengthy history of these proceedings in this Court.  It is said that insofar as there may be some prejudice to the plaintiff by the delay in the prosecution of the civil proceedings, given the matter has been on foot since 2011, a delay of a few months until December is not sufficient to negative what might otherwise be a favourable exercise of the discretion for Mr Bosganas to have these proceedings stayed.
10A third matter to which the Court's attention has been drawn relates to two affidavits that were ordered to be filed and served, but were never read, in relation to an earlier aspect of these proceedings.  The evidence before me discloses that those affidavits, which apparently were only ever served on the plaintiff's solicitors, found their way into the police brief of evidence in the criminal proceedings.  The police apparently are unable to account for how they received those affidavits.
11Prima facie, the provision of those affidavits to the police by someone, the inference which I am asked to draw is that that someone was a person acting for or on behalf of the plaintiff (but I make no finding to that effect), raises the spectre of a possible breach of the implied undertaking most recently considered by the High Court in Hearne v Street (2008) 235 CLR 125; (2008) 248 ALR 609; (2008) 82 ALJR 1 259; [2008] HCA 36. 
12It is not necessary for me in this application, nor do I have sufficient evidence, to determine finally whether such a breach occurred.  Nevertheless, the prospect of evidence filed by a defendant in civil proceedings being used against that defendant in criminal proceedings (where the defendant enjoys a right of silence) is also a relevant factor for the Court in considering whether or not to stay civil proceedings pending a criminal trial.  It is sufficient for present purposes that I am satisfied, by reason of the overlap of facts between the civil and criminal proceedings and the possibility that there has been a breach of the implied undertaking, that there is an appreciable risk of forensic disadvantage to Mr Bosganas in the criminal proceedings if orders were made requiring him to file his evidence in these proceedings in the next few weeks.
13Against these considerations, the plaintiff draws attention to what has been described as a change of position which Mr Bosganas made in about October of last year.  It is necessary that I explain that further.  
14It is common ground that in January 2012 Mr Bosganas filed a notice of motion which sought security for costs, stay of a contempt motion that was then extant and also for a stay of the proceedings generally pending resolution of the criminal charges against him.  Various parts of that motion have been dealt with at different times in the history of these proceedings.  No formal order was made for a stay of these proceedings based upon the motion filed on 25 January 2012.  
15Nevertheless, the plaintiff submits that between about February and October 2012 the parties agreed, at least de facto, for a stay to remain in place.  The change of position, as alleged by the plaintiff, came by a letter from Mr Bosganas's solicitor to the plaintiff's solicitors on 18 October 2012 in the following terms: 
There were initially discussions about staying these proceedings until the criminal proceedings brought against Mr Bosganas were finalised.  
In view of the changed circumstances in the criminal proceedings brought against Mr Bosganas and in these proceedings, we are of the view that there should be no stay and on the next occasion we will be seeking directions that the Plaintiff file its evidence within a reasonable time and that there be further directions as to the running of this matter.
Whilst there were discussions about staying the proceedings, our counsel's recollection and our recollection is that no such orders were made.
16As a result of Mr Bosganas's solicitor re-agitating the progress of the matter, orders were made for the filing of evidence.  The plaintiff did in fact in January of this year file its evidence in these proceedings.  Other interlocutory distractions, including the argument before Rein J for security for costs, meant that compliance with any earlier order for Mr Bosganas to file his evidence fell by the wayside.
17The plaintiff submits that in those circumstances, i.e. an apparent stay of some months agreed between the parties and then resiled from, Mr Bosganas ought not be allowed to change his position again and have the benefit of a stay of these proceedings.
18The difficulty with this submission is that I am not satisfied on the evidence that there was in fact an agreement between the parties that resulted in a practical stay of the proceedings between February and October.  Rather, the impression I have of the evidence is that while a stay was certainly on the cards in January 2012 flowing from Mr Bosganas's motion, the proceedings simply seem not to have been prosecuted for reasons that are not apparent.  In the first instance that is a matter that I would lay at the feet of the plaintiff, who has first responsibility for the progress of the litigation.  The plaintiff is unable to point to any evidence to explain why it apparently ceased to agitate for progress in the matter during a large part of 2012.
19I am therefore not satisfied that the supposed earlier stay is in fact something which would weigh against the exercise of the Court's discretion in favour of Mr Bosganas' application.  Nor is there anything else in the evidence or submissions of the plaintiff that would persuade me that it is inappropriate, in circumstances where both principle and practicality suggest that Mr Bosganas ought have a stay, that that result should not follow.  I therefore propose to order a stay of the proceedings pending resolution of the criminal charges against Mr Bosganas.
20That then brings me to the question of the plaintiff's responsive motion asking for, in effect, a suspension of the effect of the order for security for costs.  The plaintiff relies upon the well-recognised proposition that interlocutory orders of the Court should remain in place unless one side or the other is able to point to a relevant change in circumstances from those which applied at the time the interlocutory order was made.  The change in circumstances must, in my view, have some logical relationship with the facts and circumstances that gave rise to or underpinned the making of whatever interlocutory order is subsequently sought to be varied.
21As I understand the plaintiff's submissions, the essential change in circumstance relied upon is the stay that I propose to order.  I do not think that circumstance is a change that logically or necessarily relates to the matters which gave rise to the order for security.  I say this, in particular, because the judgment of Rein J (30 May 2013) at paragraph 23 makes it clear that the order for security which his Honour then made was calculated by reference to, and intended to give Mr Bosganas security for, costs orders that had already been made in his favour against the plaintiff.  If the order for security in fact related to future costs, then the staying of these proceedings may have had, or may have satisfied the necessity for, a logical connection between that order and the change in circumstance.
22However, I do not see how the fact that these proceedings are to be stayed for some months changes anything that relates to his Honour's decision to order security for costs in Mr Bosganas's favour in respect of costs orders of which he already had the benefit.  He will continue to have the benefit of those orders whether or not these proceedings are stayed.  In those circumstances I do not see why he should be deprived of the benefit of an order for security, and of the security itself that has now been provided, because these proceedings will be stayed for a few months.
23The other matter which tells against the relief sought by the plaintiff is the absence of evidence that the costs associated with providing the security are a source of any particular hardship or difficulty for the plaintiff.  No submission was made by the plaintiff that there was any special hardship that it would suffer by having to continue to provide the security.
24The Court's orders are: 
(1)These proceedings are stayed until further order.
(2)The plaintiff's notice of motion filed 8 August 2013 is dismissed.
(3)Grant liberty to any party to apply on seven days' notice to the registrar.
(4)The plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of and incidental to the defendant's motion filed 30 July 2013.
(5)The plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of and incidental to the plaintiff's motion filed 8 August 2013.
(6)List the proceedings for directions before the Registrar on 4 December 2013.

2762272,Athos v R [2013] NSWCCA 205,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with Price J. 

2JOHNSON J: I agree with Price J. 

3PRICE J: Nicholas Athos, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Marien DCJ (the judge) in the District Court at Sydney on 25 October 2012. 

4The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to seven charges. Charge 1 was an offence of possession of a pistol, namely a Smith and Wesson revolver, not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit, contrary to s 7 Firearms Act 1996; charges 2 and 3 were each an offence of possession of a prohibited firearm, namely a bolt gun, not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit, contrary to s 7 Firearms Act; charge 4 was an offence of possession of a prohibited weapon, namely handcuffs, without being authorised to do so by a permit, contrary to s 7 Weapons Prohibition Act 1998; charges 5 and 6 were each an offence of possession of a prohibited weapon, namely a detachable firearm magazine, without being authorised to do so by a permit, contrary to s 7 Weapons Prohibition Act; and charge 7 was an offence of possession of a prohibited weapon, namely a silencer, contrary to s 7 Weapons Prohibition Act. 

5The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act is 14 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment has been prescribed. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act is also 14 years imprisonment with a 3 year standard non-parole period. 

6The judge was asked to take into account on sentence eight matters that had been placed on a Form 1. These matters were: 

Possession of a barrel for a prohibited weapon without being authorised to do so by licence or permit, contrary to s 58(2) Firearms Act. 

Three charges of possessing a barrel for a firearm without being authorised to do so by a licence or permit, contrary to s 58(1) Firearms Act; 

Possession of ammunition without holding a licence, permit or authority, contrary to s 65(3) Firearms Act; 

Having in his possession property, namely a GPS unit, reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained, contrary to s 527C(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900; and

Two charges of being in possession of a prohibited drug, namely an unspecified quantity of methylamphetamine and unspecified quantity of cannabis, each contrary to s 10(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

7The applicant was sentenced as follows: 

Charge 4 (handcuffs): sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 5 May 2011 and expiring on 4 May 2012. 

Charge 7 (silencer): sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months, commencing on 5 May 2011 and expiring on 4 November 2012.

Charges 5 and 6 (magazines): sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 5 November 2011 and expiring on 4 November 2013. 

Charges 2 and 3 (bolt guns): sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 5 May 2012 and expiring on 4 May 2014. 

Charge 1 (revolver)
including matters on Form 1: sentenced to 5 years imprisonment commencing on 5 May 2012 and expiring on 4 May 2017, with a non-parole period of 3 years expiring on 4 May 2015. 

8As a result of partial accumulation and concurrence, the total effective sentence was 6 years commencing on 5 May 2011 and expiring on 4 May 2017 with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 5 May 2011 and expiring on 4 May 2015. The earliest date that the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is 4 May 2015. 

9The judge had discounted the sentence by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. His Honour found special circumstances permitting a variation in the statutory ratio between the total sentence and non-parole period being that the applicant was serving his first custodial sentence, a part of which was to be served in protective custody and his psychological state. 

The Grounds of Appeal 

10The notice of appeal identifies four grounds: 

Ground 1: His Honour erred in holding that, due to the nature of the 
offences, the applicant's prior good character was not to be accorded as great a weight as may be afforded for other offences. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in finding that, in the case of all of the offences, the objective seriousness fell within the upper range, because of, inter alia, the quantity of items involved. 

Ground 3: In concluding that the Court could not make a finding that the applicant had favourable prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour erred in giving conclusive weight to the finding that the applicant had not given truthful evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding his offending.

Ground 4: The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentences imposed upon the co-offender, Tuhukava.

Facts

11An agreed statement of facts was tendered which the judge recounted in his remarks on sentence (ROS 3-5):

""...during February and March 2011 Queensland police were electronically monitoring the co-offender, Matahiva Tuhukava, in relation to his possession and use of an iPhone stolen during the course of an armed robbery in February 2011 in Queensland. Shortly after, the offender before me, Mr Athos, moved from Queensland to New South Wales. On 22 March 2011 the co-offender Tuhukava attended Miranda Police Station to hand himself in to police in relation to unrelated matters and he was remanded in custody.
On 24 March 2011 Tuhukava telephoned the offender from custody. The offender informed Tuhukava that an associate, Michael Urbiztondo, was going to Queensland to collect him and drive him down to New South Wales as he was relocating back to New South Wales. The offender told Tuhukava the reason for this was because he had ""a lot of shit to put in the car"" and that he could not take it by plane. The offender then resided with his grandparents in Miranda, being a suburb of Sydney.


On 27 March 2011 Urbiztondo drove the offender down from Queensland to New South Wales. The offender brought firearms and ammunition with him. The New South Wales police were then alerted and commenced monitoring the offender Tuhukava, Urbiztondo and the man William Siryani. At about 6.42pm that day Tuhukava telephoned the offender who was with Urbiztondo at the time. When Tuhukava asked the offender about the bag containing firearms the offender asked, ""Which one?"" Tuhukava replied, ""My one"". The offender confirmed he had brought it. Tuhukava then told Urbiztondo that he was going to grab the bag for ""something"". At 9.09pm the offender telephoned the co-offender referring to him as ""Usi"" and confirming meeting the next day.

At 10.40am on Thursday 5 May 2011 surveillance police observed the co-offender leave his residence and take a taxi to the Mug Shots Café attached to the Speedway service station on Captain Cook Drive, Caringbah. There the co-offender Tuhukava met Urbiztondo and the man Siryani. The cafe was owned by Siryani and operated by Urbiztondo. 

At 11.06am Tuhukava telephoned the offender and spoke in what the facts describe as 'Pig Latin'. He asked the offender, ""You know what we were talking to you the other day, yeah, can you bring it down to where we are, the akbay (slang for bag) of the ungdrays (slang for guns)."" After the offender confirmed he would come, Tuhukava sent him a text saying, ""All the bags please, everything, thanks Malaka"". The offender replied, ""There's only one bag, chief"" and Tuhukava replied, ""Okay"".

At 12 noon the offender was driven to the café by his grandfather. He took two bags out of the car and walked into the café carrying the bags. Tuhukava and Urbiztondo were inside the café at the time and Siryani was outside by the car wash. The offender placed the two bags on the floor near the counter and went behind the counter to make himself a drink. The police then entered the café and identified themselves.

When the offender was asked what was in the bags he admitted the bags contained guns and ammunition that he had brought down from Queensland. Inside a blue bag police located a radio, earpiece and a Navman GPS, an unloaded 38 special calibre Smith and Wesson revolver without a serial number and documents identifying the offender. Inside a black and red bagpolice located ninety-six rounds of thirty-eight special ammunition, forty-eight rounds of 9 millimetre ammunition, forty-two rounds of twenty-five auto ammunition, forty-six rounds of thirty-eight auto ammunition, 133 rounds of 40 calibre ammunition, 643 rounds of 22 calibre ammunition, ninety-one rounds of 45 auto ammunition, two magazine holders with two empty magazines for a .40 Smith and Wesson, a firearm holster, a firearm cleaning kit, handcuffs, two single shot pen pistols without serial numbers, .22 short/long rifle barrel, two 32 calibre barrels from a single shot pen pistol without serial numbers that could be fitted to the pen pistols that were located, and a .22 long rifle calibre barrel.

The offender, Tuhukava and Siryani were arrested. Urbiztondo was arrested on 10 May 2011. The offender agreed to participate in a recorded interview with the police. In this ERISP he admitted possession of the firearms and ammunition and admitted he brought them down from Queensland about five weeks prior. I shall in these reasons refer in more detail to what the offender said in that interview with the police.

In a search warrant executed where the offender was residing with hisgrandparents, police located a box containing twenty-five rounds of 12 gauge buckshot live cartridges, four .22 calibre live ammunition, one .22 calibre used round, four .38 calibre live rounds and a barrel capable of being used as a firearm silencer.""

12In a tendered expert's certificate, Matthew Bolton, a ballistics investigator, found that the .38 special calibre Smith and Wesson six chamber revolver was in working order and capable of propelling a projectile that could inflict a lethal wound upon a human being. The two bolt guns were also found to be in working order and were capable of inflicting a lethal wound upon a human being. 

The applicant's record of interview 

13On the day of his arrest, the applicant entered into a record of interview with police. It is only necessary to refer to those parts of the interview that bear upon the grounds of appeal. 

14The applicant told police that he had collected the bags (containing the firearms and ammunition) from the National Park near Grays Point that morning. He had buried the bags about a month or five weeks previously, which was about a couple of days after he returned from Queensland. 

15The record of interview includes the following questions and answers (Q&A 172-174): 

""Q172 And what were you told when you grabbed it like, when you were given the firearm and the contents, what were you told? 
A. I wasn't told anything, just, it's none of my business.

Q173. Why would someone give you a firearm?
A. Because I'm a reliable bloke.""

16The applicant said that he was given the firearm in New South Wales in 2008 and had it since that time. He declined to tell the police how the firearm got to Queensland and where he had stored it. 

The applicant's evidence before the judge 

17In his evidence before the judge, the applicant said that he had the .38 revolver for five weeks and the red bag with the ammunition, handcuffs and gun cleaning kit for close to 12 months. He said that a firearm was not a dangerous weapon if it is ""in the hands of good people, only when it's in the hands of irresponsible people can damage be done"" (T13/09/12 T4 L33-34). He said he was very reckless in not taking into consideration where the items would have ended up down the track. The applicant gave the following evidence in answer to questions from the judge
(T13/09/12 T4 L44-50, T5 L1-25):

""Q. Mr Athos, where did you think they were going to go? You've said on a number of occasions I think to the psychologist and to the probation officer that you were just - you were holding them for someone, you were a custodian of these firearms?
A. Yes. Yes, your Honour. 

Q. Well that means you are going to pass them on to someone? 
A. Yes.

Q. Who were you going to pass them on to?
A. I can't really say, your Honour, because I fear for my safety, and that's always been the case. 

Q. Are they persons with criminal backgrounds, is that why you fear for your safety? I am not asking you who they are, I'm simply saying is that the reason that you fear for your safety, that they are people with criminal backgrounds?
A. Yes.

Q. Well then if you're going to give these firearms to someone with a criminal background what did you think was going to happen with them? 
A. That's where I was reckless, your Honour, I didn't think that far ahead. I didn't think it was my business. 

Q. Are you seriously saying to me that you didn't think that far ahead, that if you give these firearms and ammunition to people with criminal backgrounds that you didn't think about what might happen, where they might end up, that they could be used in criminal activity? You didn't think of that?
A. No, that's where I was reckless, your Honour. 

Q. What did you think they were going to do with them, polish them and clean them?
A. I didn't think that far I'm sorry."" 

18In cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, the applicant said that he knew that the firearms and ammunition were prohibited items. He denied that he was receiving any benefit for holding onto these items in order to deliver them to someone. It was his evidence that ""[i]t was just a foolish favour"" (T13/09/12 T9 L45-48). On this topic, the applicant gave the following further evidence (at T13/09/12 T11 L5-14):

""Q And yet you were prepared to just hand over a bag full of firearms and ammunition to a person who you knew had a criminal history of assaults, do you agree with that?
A. I do, because I was reckless. 

Q. It's more than reckless, you were actually a party to acts of violence - or potential acts of violence and aggression, you'd agree with that?
A, I do, but I don't think it's fair to be persecuted for an offence I had no knowledge of, if there was an offence to begin with, that was going to be committed."" 

19A report dated 14 June 2012 from Sam Borenstein, a clinical psychologist, was placed before the judge. Mr Borenstein reported that the applicant told him that he was given the guns to mind, they were in his house, and he was holding onto them for someone. Mr Borenstein recounted that the applicant denied ""knowing what the weapons might be used for. [The applicant] states that he became caught up in events and he acted as a delivery person"" (AB 166). 

Some findings by the judge 

20During submissions, the applicant's counsel informed the judge he had been instructed that the applicant did not bury the items in the National Park, but had said that he had to protect his grandfather from being implicated as the weapons and ammunition were kept by the applicant at his grandfather's home. 

21The judge placed little weight on the applicant's account in the ERISP noting that the applicant ""admitted to police that he lied about certain matters in the interview but it is very unclear from the interview as to which matters he was saying he was lying about"" (ROS 9). His Honour observed that whilst the applicant continued to assert in his sworn evidence that ""he was merely a custodian of these firearms, prohibited weapons, and an enormous quantity of ammunition, he agreed that he intended to pass them on to persons who he knew had criminal backgrounds. Indeed, in his cross-examination by the Crown, he agreed that he knew that the co-offender Tuhukava, who he was handing the weapons to, had a criminal record for assaults"" (ROS 10).

22His Honour was unable to accept the applicant's assertion ""that he did not consider that by handing over what he agreed was an arsenal of weapons and ammunition to men who he knew had criminal backgrounds, that these items might be used in criminal activity"" (ROS 11). His Honour did not accept that the applicant's role was merely as a custodian of these weapons and his possession of them was nothing more than a foolish favour. Given his findings as to the lack of credibility of the applicant both in his ERISP and in his evidence, his Honour was unable to determine what were the true circumstances in which the applicant came to be in possession of the weapons and ammunition. The judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant would have been fully aware that by handing over the weapons and ammunition to these associates with criminal backgrounds, as he intended to do, that there was a real chance that these weapons would be used in criminal activity. 

Personal Circumstances 

23The applicant was born on 21 March 1985 and was 27 years old when sentenced. He did not have any criminal antecedents. 

24When referring to the applicant's background, Mr Borenstein stated in his report that he had treated the applicant as a child on a referral from the Family Law Court who held concerns about the applicant's psychological state as a result of his parent's separation and changed living circumstances. The applicant was raised predominantly by his father. Mr Borenstein reported that the applicant had responded favourably to counselling. 

25He left school midway through Year 11 and took up a traineeship in hospitality for six months. He had worked at various jobs including as a bicycle courier for Australia Post and in a call centre for Taxis Combined. Mr Borenstein noted that the applicant has a long-standing history of depressed mood, anxiety and panic which dates to childhood. The applicant's current diagnosis, Mr Borenstein opined, is that of Chronic Adjustment Disorder with mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. 

26The psychologist expressed the following opinion as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation (at AB 167): 

""[The applicant's] prospect for rehabilitation is sound. He impressed as highly motivated to ensure the type of behaviour which brought him to prison is never repeated. He has a definite plan, and is party to a very supportive relationship, very different from those of the past, 'this one's a good girl'. 

[The applicant] appreciates and understands the seriousness of his offences. [The applicant] insists he was the custodian of the weapons, 
and had no idea of how they were intended to be used.""

27Mr Borenstein stated that with further counselling the likelihood of the offending being repeated was extremely low. 

28Sapfo Sakis, the applicant's girlfriend, told the judge that the applicant was a sweet, caring person. They had been planning to buy a house together and to get married. She said that the applicant had the support of his family. 

29A Probation and Parole report was tendered in which the author of the report noted that the applicant has a long history of depression and anxiety with associated panic attacks. The author observed that the applicant accepted responsibility for his offending behaviour, but ""continues to be guarded with respect to some details of the current offences and did not provide an explanation, which clarifies his involvement in the possession of numerous weapons, other than his actions were 'naïve and stupid'"" (AB 154).

Ground 1: His Honour erred in holding that, due to the nature of the offences, the applicant's prior good character was not to be accorded as great a weight as may be afforded for other offences. 

30The applicant submitted that the judge erred in giving reduced weight to the applicant's prior good character. The Court's attention was drawn to the following passage in the judge's remarks on sentence (ROS 20): 

""The [applicant] has no criminal record. Whilst that entitles him to leniency, the weight to be given to his prior good character for offences of this kind is not, in my view, to be accorded as great a weight as may be afforded for other offences. This is because a person of prior good character is less likely to come under the notice of police and, therefore, it might be expected less likely to be detected by police in possession of firearms and prohibited weapons. But he is entitled to a reduction in the sentence that I would otherwise impose upon him because of his prior good character."" 

31It was contended that his Honour's conclusion that good character might be used by persons to enable weapons to be transported was purely speculative. The applicant argued that there was no material to suggest that persons, in general, let alone the applicant, are selected to transport firearms, because of a lack of a criminal record. The applicant's reason on the evidence that he was selected for his role was because he was ""a reliable bloke"" (ROS 7). In the absence of evidence that either the applicant or Tuhukava exploited the applicant's good character, it was submitted that his Honour erred in giving reduced importance to the applicant's good character. 

32In oral submissions, the applicant argued that the judge had erred by stating there was a general principle that less weight is to be afforded to good character for offences of possession of firearms and prohibited weapons. The applicant accepted that this argument would be diminished if the judge had given less weight to the applicant's good character for reasons based on the evidence. 

33The Crown submitted that it was within the judge's discretion to determine the weight to be given to evidence of good character. The Crown referred to the objective seriousness of the offences and to general deterrence being an important factor. The Crown reminded the Court that a complaint about the attribution of weight to a particular sentencing factor does not ordinarily give rise to an error that enlivens appellate intervention. 

34In oral submissions, the Crown contended that the judge's finding related to the case and his findings of fact in relation to the applicant. It was appropriate to give less weight to good character in the circumstances of the applicant. 

Decision 

35The lack of a record of previous convictions and good character are identified in ss 21A(3)(e)-(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as mitigating factors that a sentencing judge is obliged to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence. If an offender is a person of good character, the weight to be given to that factor is a matter for the sentencing judge and may vary according to all the circumstances including the nature of the offence: Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267; (2001) 118 A Crim R 538 [25], [143]. 

36There are certain categories of offences where it has been held that limited weight may be given to good character. These offences include:


Child pornography offences (R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at [64]);
White-collar crime (Gent at [59]);
Drink driving offences (Application by the Attorney General under section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) [2004] NSWCCA 303; (2004) 61 NSWLR 305);
Drug couriers (R v Leroy (1984) 2 NSWLR 441 at 446-447);
Federal drug importation offences to which s 16A(2)(m) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) has application (Gent at [56]); and, 
Child sex offences (Ryan at [34]).

37It appears from the reference in the passage quoted at [30] above to ""the weight to be given to his prior good character for offences of this kind is not...to be accorded as great a weight as may be afforded for other offences"", that the focus of his Honour's determination was on the type of the offence and not on all the circumstances of the offending. The possession of a prohibited firearm is not an offence that the courts have said that an offender's good character will have less significance than in other crimes. However, the category of offence is not closed. In Gent, Johnson J observed at [61]: 

""An analysis of the authorities supports the Crown contention that there is no closed category of offences in relation to which courts have said that less weight should be given on sentence to evidence of prior good character.""

38The rationale behind extending less weight to good character in certain categories of offence was discussed by Howie J in R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527 at [21] - [22]: 

""It is unnecessary for the purposes of determining this appeal to consider the circumstances in which a court may legitimately determine that it will give less weight to prior good character as a mitigating factor. Generally speaking such a situation might arise where general deterrence is important, the particular offence before the court is serious and it is one frequently committed by persons of good character. Another situation may be where the prior good character of the offender has enabled him or her to gain a position where the particular offence can be committed. 

Less weight might also be given to prior good character in a case where there is a pattern of repeat offending over a significant period of time. That will frequently be the case in child sexual assault offences because such offences are often committed during a period of an ongoing relationship between the offender and the complainant. But that was not this case.""

39It is inarguable that offences involving the possession of prohibited firearms are serious and general deterrence has an important role to play. As Johnson J observed in R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43; (2011) 205 A Crim R 222 at [73]:

""The legislature views possession of such an item seriously. The policy of the legislature evinced by the enactment of the offence in s. 7(1) is to deter and punish possession of firearms ..."" 

40On the question whether such an offence is frequently committed by persons of good character, the Crown cited R v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348 in which the sentencing judge referred to the identification by police of a systematic trade in illegal firearms from the general area of northern New South Wales and Queensland and then observed that it seemed to him that there was a group of people who would not ordinarily commit other crimes but had a blind spot of dangerous proportions when it came to dealing in firearms. The offender had pleaded guilty to two charges of selling unauthorised pistols contrary to s 51(1A) Firearms Act. Spigelman CJ at [56] considered that the sentencing judge ""was drawing on his own experience, and the evidence in the particular case, that persons of otherwise good character became involved in offences of this type because of their attitude to firearms."" The Chief Justice went on to say at [57]:

""Nothing in his Honour's remarks on sentence suggested that this material was relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. The references were of significance in the sentencing exercise because they put the applicant's reliance on his good character in its proper context. That was perfectly appropriate. Persons who would not offend in other ways would commit this crime because they did not believe that such conduct should be criminal. That does not work for drug users. It does not work for arms traders.""

41It seems to me that Howard is not a strong basis for accepting as a general principle that offences involving prohibited firearms are frequently committed by persons of good character. The observations of the sentencing judge were drawn from his experience of persons of a rural background and people who have a keen interest in firearms, together with the evidence in the case. No other authorities were brought to our attention where this Court has observed that such offences are rarely committed by people who have a criminal history or that these offences are predominately committed by persons who otherwise have a clear criminal record. 

42In any event, the judge's reason in the present case for limiting the weight to be afforded to prior good character was found not on the attitude of such persons to firearms, but on the expectation that because of their lack of a prior record, they are less likely to attract the attention of police. His Honour's reasoning is similar to the approach adopted in Leroy for drug couriers where Street CJ said (at p 446-447): 

""This Court and other criminal courts have said on many occasions that, in the drug traffic in particular, the circumstances that the accused person has a clear earlier record will have less significance than in other fields of crime. Very frequently, those selected to play some part in the chain of drug trafficking, as the appellant plainly enough was, are selected because their records, their past and their lifestyles are not such as to attract suspicion. It is this in particular which has led the courts to take in the case of drug trafficking a view which does not involve the same degree of leniency being extended to first offenders.""

43I do not think that there is sufficient material before this Court to enable a finding that the existence of good character places a person in a position where he is more likely to be selected to be the possessor of a prohibited firearm. Indeed, the facts of the present case do not permit such a finding. The applicant's explanation in the ERISP for being given a firearm was because he was a ""reliable bloke"" (Q&A 173). There is a difference between being a person of good character and a reliable one. Good character does not necessarily connote reliability. 

44In my opinion, there is not a sufficient basis for concluding that offences of possession of prohibited firearms are committed frequently by persons of otherwise good character. I am not persuaded that such a crime falls within the category of offence where less weight is afforded to prior good character. 

45I am satisfied that the judge erred when he gave less weight to the applicant's good character because he was charged with offences involving the possession of prohibited firearms. It would have been perfectly acceptable for the judge to consider the question of the weight to be given to the applicant's good character in all the circumstances of the offending but, in my respectful opinion, the error occurred when the reduction in weight was tethered to the type of offence.

46I would uphold the first ground of appeal. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in finding that, in the case of all of the 
offences, the objective seriousness fell within the upper range, because of, inter alia, the quantity of items involved. 

47The focus of the applicant's complaint is upon the remarks made by the judge that are italicised in the passage below (ROS 15-16):

""In my view, all of the offences for which the [applicant] is to be sentenced today fall in the upper range of objective seriousness for offences of their kind. I reach that view on the basis of my findings that the offender would have been fully aware that these weapons and prohibited items might be used in criminal activities. And I also reach this view on the quantity of the items involved."" (italics added) 

48The applicant submitted that the number of items was not material to the objective seriousness of the individual offences, but rather to the total criminality, which is to be taken into account at a subsequent stage of the sentencing process. It was contended that although the judge had not expressly alluded to s 21A(2)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, his Honour fell into the kind of error identified in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; (2005) 65 NSWLR 740. The applicant argued that the appropriate method is to consider the relevance of the number of prohibited items as part of the process of determining the level of concurrency or accumulation. 

49The Crown put to the Court that ""'...the quantity of the items involved' was mentioned within the context of the judge making findings as to the applicant's knowledge and foresight as to how the firearms and weapons might have been used"" (CWS para 15). The Crown pointed out that the judge's remarks had made no reference to s 21A(2)(m) and his Honour had specifically referred to the appropriate principles when sentencing for multiple offences. It was the Crown's further contention that, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, the judge was entitled to take into account the quantity of prohibited items in the applicant's possession. 

Decision 

50I do not consider that the judge's remarks as to the quantity of items can be confined to his assessment of the applicant's knowledge of the future use of the prohibited items as his Honour had earlier said (at ROS 12): 

""But I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender would have been fully aware that by handing over the weapons and ammunition to these associates with criminal backgrounds, as he intended to do, that there was a real chance that these weapons would be used in criminal activity. This finding together with the quantity of weapons and prohibited items and ammunition found, makes the objective seriousness of these offences to be extremely high."" (italics added) 

51A fair reading of the sentencing remarks reveals that his Honour took into account the quantity of prohibited items in his assessment that all of the offences fell within the upper range of objective seriousness. It seems to me that it is unnecessary to deal with the applicant's argument that is founded on s 21A(2)(m) as his Honour neither mentioned the section nor am I persuaded that he had it in mind when he assessed the seriousness of the offences. 

52In my opinion, the answer to the applicant's complaint is to be found in the application by the judge of the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. As he was sentencing the applicant for more than one offence, his Honour expressly noted that he was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality. However, in my respectful opinion, his Honour did not bear in mind that in fixing an appropriate sentence for an offence, he should not have regard to the other offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced. As this Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme, Hislop JJ) explained in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 at [39]:

""In Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] the High Court made it clear that a sentence should be appropriate for the offence for which it is imposed. It is a corollary that no sentence should reflect criminality extending beyond the particular offence to which it relates..."" (italics added) 

53Although the applicant was found to be in possession of a quantity of firearms, ammunition, magazines and a silencer, he was charged with seven separate offences. Eight matters had been included on a Form 1. His Honour could not use the quantity of all of the prohibited items as a factor in determining that an individual offence fell within the upper range of objective seriousness. However, when carrying out the task mandated by Pearce, his Honour was obliged to have regard to the fact that the applicant was being sentenced for multiple offences and ensure that the ultimate sentence was appropriate to the totality of the applicant's offending (which included the quantity of prohibited items in his possession) and his personal circumstances. 

54This Court has emphasised that where there is a challenge to a sentencing judge's characterisation of objective seriousness of an offence, the question is whether the particular characterisation which the sentencing judge gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to him: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 per Spigelman CJ at [37]. Ground 2 challenged the judge's characterisation of the objective seriousness of the individual offences. In my opinion, that challenge fails. Notwithstanding the error I have identified, each individual offence was otherwise objectively serious and the judge's characterisation of the individual offences as falling within the upper range of objective seriousness was open to him. The unchallenged finding by the judge that the applicant was aware that by handing over the weapons and ammunition to associates with criminal backgrounds, there was a real chance that these weapons would be used in criminal activity substantially enhanced the objective seriousness of each offence and placed the offence in the upper range of objective seriousness. 

55The judge said (at ROS 16):

""The criminality of the offender's conduct in this case may best be described in terms that through his actions he was seeking to effectively facilitate the proliferation of these weapons and prohibited items amongst criminals. That may not have been his actual intended purpose but as I say he would have been fully aware that by handing over these weapons and prohibited items to these men, that these items may well be proliferated amongst criminals and be used in criminal activities. This is criminal conduct in my view of a high order.""

56His Honour's observations are consistent with Cooper v R [2005] NSWCCA 428 and R v Najam [2008] NSWCCA 32 to which he referred in his sentencing remarks. The protection of the community from criminals armed with firearms must be recognised by regarding the knowledge of an offender that prohibited weapons are to be handed over to persons with criminal backgrounds as a substantially aggravating factor. 

57I would reject Ground 2 of the appeal. 

Ground 3: In concluding that the Court could not make a finding that the 
applicant had favourable prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour erred in giving conclusive weight to the finding that the applicant had not given truthful evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding his offending. 

58The applicant complains that having rejected his account that he was merely holding the items for other persons and had not given consideration as to what might happen to the weapons in the future, the judge erred by failing to give any consideration whatsoever to the remainder of the applicant's subjective case. It was submitted that the judge also gave no weight to the views expressed by Mr Borenstein and his Honour was not entitled to dismiss the opinions expressed by the psychologist who had significant prior experience with the applicant and had not been required for cross-examination. 

59The Crown submitted that the judge, having heard and seen the applicant give evidence was entitled to arrive at the finding that he did. It was, the Crown said, within his Honour's discretion to find that the applicant did not have good prospects of rehabilitation and no error was demonstrated. 

Decision 

60Section 21(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires the Court to take into account as a mitigating factor that the ""offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise."" The applicant bears the onus of establishing this factor of mitigation on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270. 

61I have referred at [13]-[22] above to the applicant's record of interview, his evidence in the sentencing proceedings, his account to Mr Borenstein and the judge's credit findings. It is evident that his Honour gave careful consideration to Mr Borenstein's favourable opinion as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation: (see [26] - [27] above) but did not accept it. The judge said (at ROS 18-19): 

""These opinions as expressed by Mr Borenstein, particularly that he has sound prospects of rehabilitation, are, however, based upon the apparent acceptance by Mr Borenstein of the [applicant's] assertion that he was merely the custodian of the weapons and that he had no idea how they were intended to be used. As I have said I do not accept that assertion by the [applicant].

The offender was clearly not being frank and truthful with the police in his interview and in my view he was not being entirely frank and truthful in his evidence before me nor with Mr Borenstein...

Further, given my finding that [applicant] was not frank and truthful in his evidence before me I am unable to find that he is genuinely remorseful for his serious criminal offence. In that regard it is to be noted that he pleaded guilty in the face of what can only be described as an overwhelming Crown case. He was caught red handed in possession of these weapons and prohibited items. Nor am I able to find that he has favourable prospects of rehabilitation. How can I make any determination about his prospects of rehabilitation when I have found that he was not frank and truthful in his evidence before me as to the circumstances surrounding his criminal behaviour?""

62An important factor in assessing an offender's prospects of rehabilitation will sometimes be whether he has been truthful about his offending. Here the judge found that the applicant had neither been honest with him nor Mr Borenstein. This lack of honesty provided sufficient reason for his Honour not to accept the psychologist's opinions as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, notwithstanding Mr Borenstein's professional experience with the applicant as a child. 

63In reality the applicant's complaint is that the judge did not give sufficient weight to the psychologist's views and to the evidence of family support when assessing his prospects of rehabilitation. As has often been said by this Court, the circumstances in which matters of weight in the exercise of a judge's sentencing discretion will justify intervention are narrowly confined: Gebara v R [2012] NSWCCA 107; R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. It was clearly open to the judge not to be satisfied on the evidence before him that the applicant did have favourable prospects of rehabilitation. 

64I would reject Ground 3 of the appeal. 

Ground 4: The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentences imposed upon the co-offender, Tuhukava 

65It was submitted that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance, both in respect of the individual sentences as well as the overall sentence imposed on the co-offender Tuhukava. The applicant pointed to a marked difference in the subjective cases between the co-offenders. The applicant had received a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas, whereas Tuhukava's utilitarian discount was 20 per cent. The applicant was a man of previous good character whereas Tuhukava had numerous convictions for violence and had been previously sentenced to imprisonment. The applicant complained that despite the applicant's more positive subjective case, the sentences imposed for charges 2 to 6 were identical, with identical accumulation. 

66Furthermore, particular reference was made to Tuhukava's plea to the offence contrary to s 115 Crimes Act whereby he admitted that he intended to use the .38 Smith and Wesson pistol in criminal activity. Tuhukava was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years for this offence, but this sentence was made wholly concurrent with the possession offence contrary to s 7 Firearms Act. The applicant submitted that despite the difference in both the subjective and (albeit in a limited fashion) objective cases, the difference between the sentences imposed, is almost entirely accounted for by the different utilitarian values of the pleas of guilty. 

67The Crown argued that the judge had given careful consideration when sentencing Tuhukava to the parity between the co-offenders and the level of parity between them was not such that the applicant could establish a marked disparity.

69A marked disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders of a degree of kind which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance is required before appellate intervention: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295. The applicant must show that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard the applicant's grievance as justified: R v llbay [2000] NSWCCA 251; R v Kollas and Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491. The plurality (French CJ, Crennan, and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 said at [31]:

""...The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.""

70The judge sentenced both the applicant and Tuhukava. When he sentenced Tuhukava on 1 February 2013, he noted that the principle of parity was relevant and cited Green v The Queen. His Honour assiduously noted that there were a number of differences in the respective cases but elaborated upon five matters (Tuhukava ROS 17-18). 

(i) The applicant's utilitarian discount for the pleas of guilty was 25 per cent, whereas the allowance for Tuhukava was 20 per cent. 

(ii) The applicant had no prior criminal convictions, whereas Tuhukava had prior convictions for numerous offences of violence. His Honour had earlier in his remarks recited these prior convictions which included ""sentences of imprisonment in 2009 for use of an offensive weapon, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, armed with intent to commit an indictable offence"" (Tuhukava ROS 16-17). 

(iii) Tuhukava was charged with an offence contrary to s 115 Crimes Act whereas the applicant was not. The judge accepted the Crown case that Tuhukava was armed with weapons with intent to commit an indictable offence involving the forced entry into premises by kicking in a door or other point of entry. The judge proceeded on the basis that the indictable offence intended to be committed involved the intentional destruction or damage to property contrary to s 195(1)(a) Crimes Act which carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment (Tuhukava ROS 7). Tuhukava was also sentenced for an offence of possessing proceeds of crime being an Apple iPhone contrary to s 193B(3) Crimes Act, whereas the applicant was not. On the other hand, the applicant was sentenced for the possession of a silencer, which was a charge that Tuhukava did not face. A further distinction was that eight matters on a Form 1 were taken into account when the applicant was sentenced for possessing the .38 special calibre Smith and Wesson pistol, whereas there were no Form 1 matters taken into account when Tuhukava was sentenced for this offence. 

(iv) The applicant did give evidence during the proceedings on sentence but Tuhukava did not. The judge was unable to find the applicant to be genuinely remorseful or that he had favourable prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour accepted that Tuhukava ""to some degree"" was remorseful but was guarded in his assessment of Tuhukava's prospects for rehabilitation. 

(v) The judge was unable to make findings as to the true circumstances the applicant came into possession of the firearms and prohibited items, but ""was satisfied that he was not a mere naïve custodian of these items"" (Tuhukava ROS 19). Tuhukava acknowledged by his plea to count 1 that he was to use a pistol in criminal activity. 

71His Honour said (at Tuhukava ROS 19):

""...I have determined, considering all of the relevant factors, the objective seriousness of the offences, the subjective case of the offender and taking into account the principles of parity that I should impose a sentence of imprisonment on the offender which will comprise both a non-parole period and a total sentence which will be one year longer that (sic) the sentence I imposed upon [the applicant].""

72The judge found special circumstances. The total effective sentence was 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. Given the discount of 20 per cent for the plea of guilty, the undiscounted starting point of Tuhukava's sentence was 9 years 9 months whereas the undiscounted starting point of the applicant's sentence was 8 years. In the case of the applicant, the overall ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence is 66.6 per cent. In Tuhukava's case, the overall ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence is 71.4 per cent. 

73Other than the applicant's unblemished record, there was not much difference in the subjective circumstances of the co-offenders. Both were young men but Tuhukava was 3 years younger. Two reports from psychiatrists were tendered on behalf of Tuhukava. He was diagnosed by Dr Nielssen with panic disorder, agoraphobia in remission, substance abuse disorder in remission with a possible underlying psychotic illness. As previously recounted, Mr Borenstein considered that the applicant had a Chronic Adjustment Disorder with mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. The judge was unable to find in Tuhukava's case, that his mental state at the time of the commission of the offences reduced his moral culpability. In the case of the applicant, his Honour was unable to determine whether his psychological state had any part to play in the offending.

74Although it is true that for charges 2 to 6, the sentences imposed were identical with identical accumulation, I am not persuaded that there is a marked disparity in the total effective sentences. The matters of difference identified by the judge justify the sentences that were imposed.

75I would reject Ground 4 of the appeal. 

Intervention?

76Although I would uphold the first ground of appeal, I am not satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In my opinion, no lesser sentence is warranted. 

77It is important to mention that the Crown drew to the Court's attention that the judge had imposed fixed terms of imprisonment for charges 2 to 7 which is contrary to statute. As these are offences for which a standard non-parole period has been prescribed, his Honour was obliged to set a non-parole period for each of these charges. As there is no ground of appeal that complains of error by the judge in imposing fixed terms and the sentences are not to be quashed or varied, there is no basis for the Court to intervene and re-sentence the applicant for charges 2 to 7: Hristovksi v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 per Johnson J at [64] - [65].

78I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

2762273,Maraache v R [2013] NSWCCA 199,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA: The applicant, Mr Walid Maraache, has applied for leave to appeal against his conviction, on 8 February 2012, on a charge of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence of assault with intent to rob, in circumstances of aggravation, being in company, and of special aggravation, being armed with a dangerous weapon. The charge was brought under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 

2Mr Maraache seeks leave to appeal on the basis that the trial judge failed to put his case to the jury properly. Leave is required because, under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, no direction given by the judge presiding at a trial is, without the leave of the Court, to be allowed as a ground of appeal, unless objection to the direction was taken at the trial by the party appealing. No objection was taken on behalf of Mr Maraache at the trial. 

The Trial

3On 1 February 2012, Mr Maraache pleaded not guilty before a District Court judge and a jury to a charge that, on 27 May 2010, at St Andrews in New South Wales, he broke and entered a dwelling house and committed a serious indictable offence therein, namely the assault of Ms Lydia Pavicin with intent to rob her, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he was in the company of four other persons, and in circumstances of special aggravation, namely that he was armed with a dangerous weapon, being a firearm. 

4Mr Suhail Mohammed was to have stood trial together with Mr Maraache on 30 January 2012 and the two were arraigned together before a jury. However, the Crown accepted a plea from Mr Mohammed to an alternative charge in the indictment, that of being an accessory after the fact to a specially aggravated break and enter to commit a serious indictable offence under s 349(2) of the Crimes Act. That plea was accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment so far as it concerns Mr Mohammed. 

5On the evening of the offence, CJB, a juvenile, was staying at his father's house in St Andrews (CJB's house). At the trial, Mr Mohammed and four juveniles, who were involved in the commission of the offence, gave evidence on behalf of the Crown. Their evidence was that, shortly before the offence was committed, Mr Maraache, Mr Mohammed and one of the juveniles drove to another house at St Andrews (Lydia's house) to establish its location. They then returned to CJB's house. At 12:30am on 27 May 2012, two motorcars drove to Lydia's house. Mr Mohammed drove one car (Mr Mohammed's car). Mr Simon King drove another car (Mr King's car), in which Mr Maraache travelled as a front seat passenger. Also in Mr King's car, in the back seat, was the juvenile who had been on the earlier trip. Three other juveniles were passengers in Mr Mohammed's car. 

6Ms Pavicin and her four children were in Lydia's house at the time. When the cars arrived at Lydia's house, the juveniles alighted from the two cars and two of them knocked on the front door. Ms Pavicin opened the door and then closed it. She immediately telephoned ""000"". As she did so, the juveniles gained entry to the house by forcing the front door and the back door. They demanded money from Ms Pavicin, assaulted her and ripped the telephone cable from the wall, before leaving the house and going back to the cars. 

7The police attended in response to the ""000"" call. Mr Mohammed and the passengers in his car were arrested. The juvenile who had travelled in Mr King's car returned to that car. Mr King then reversed the car rapidly and the police lost sight of it. However, about 5 kilometres from Lydia's house, the occupants of Mr King's car, Mr Maraache, Mr King and the juvenile, were arrested. A firearm was found in the boot of Mr King's car. 

8The Crown case was that all of the occupants of the cars went to Lydia's house to execute a home invasion with a firearm. It was common ground at the trial that Mr Maraache was a passenger in the front seat of one of the cars that travelled to Lydia's house. It was also common ground that he remained in the car throughout the commission of the offence. However, the Crown case was that Mr Maraache had been involved in the planning of the offence. The real issue in the trial was the truth of that single discrete factual matter. 

9There was no dispute as to where Mr Maraache was physically located during the commission of the offence. Mr Maraache gave evidence that he was an innocent bystander, while the Crown witnesses, Mr Maraache's alleged co-offenders, contended that Mr Maraache had planned the offence even though he remained in the car. The resolution of that single discrete factual matter depended on the jury's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. If the jury accepted Mr Maraache's evidence that he was not involved in the planning of the offence, then the jury would find him not guilty. If the jury accepted the evidence of Mr Maraache's alleged co-offenders called by the Crown, that Mr Maraache planned the offence, then the jury would find him guilty. Against that background, I shall summarise the evidence given by the Crown witnesses.

10CJB was 17 years old at the time of the offence. The police spoke to CJB about a week after the offence. In evidence, CJB made a number of statements about what he said to the police at that time and what the police said to him. He said that the police told him that he would be charged if he did not make a statement. He said that he lied to the police as to whether some of the individuals concerned were involved in the planning of the home invasions. He said that he also lied when he told police that it was Mr Maraache who had brought up the idea of the home invasion of Lydia's house. He said that it was true that Mr Maraache had brought up the idea of a home invasion, but that Mr Maraache did not mention Lydia's house in particular. 

11In cross-examination, it was suggested to CJB that he was giving evidence against Mr Maraache because he wanted to obtain a discount when he was due to be sentenced in relation to other offences. CJB explained his previous lies by saying that another co-offender, Mr Anaterea Tamapua, known by the name Tera, asked him to lie and that he did so partially out of fear of Mr Tamapua. The sentencing judge noted that, at the time of sentencing of Mr Maraache, Mr Tamapua was in prison for the crime of murder.

12CJB gave evidence that, on the night in question, he invited some of his friends to his house to watch a rugby league match. A number of people arrived at CJB's house, including Mr Maraache, Mr Mohammed and his girlfriend, Mr Tamapua, Mr Ricky Tan and four juveniles, namely, QJ, JT, AJS and BT. CJB said that Mr Maraache brought up the idea of a home invasion and was one of the main persons talking about it. Instead of watching the rugby league match, they sat at the back of the house talking. CJB said that Mr Maraache asked if they knew any drug dealers in the area. QJ said he knew a drug dealer called Lydia who lived down the road and had ""heaps of money"". 

13BT, another of the juveniles involved in the offence, was aged 17 at the time of the offence. He had been dealt with and sentenced before Mr Maraache's trial. He gave an undertaking to give evidence at the trial of Mr Maraache and received a discount of 15% on the sentence imposed for the offence and on sentences for other offences to which he pleaded guilty. 

14BT said that, during the afternoon leading up to the night of the offence, he visited Mr Tamapua's house at Claymore, where he saw Mr Maraache and others, including Mr Tamapua and AJS. BT had known Mr Maraache for about 4 or 5 months at that stage. BT said there was a conversation in which Mr Maraache and Mr Tamapua were discussing an ""ice dealer that [they] were going to run in on"". That apparently meant going to the ice dealer's house and committing a home invasion so as to obtain ""the ice"". 

15BT said that, during the afternoon at Mr Tamapua's house, one of the others present showed BT a firearm and another of those present identified a lady who was a drug dealer and who might have ""about two kilos of ice"". The firearm was placed in the boot of Mr Mohammed's car. They then drove to CJB's house. When they arrived there, CJB told them that ""there was two kilos"" in Lydia's house. He said that Mr Maraache was then involved in conversation with various of those present at CJB's house as to what role they were to take. BT was told that he was to hold the firearm. They then drove to Lydia's house, which was only about two minutes' drive from CJB's house, and returned shortly afterwards. After they returned to CJB's house, there was a discussion about how they would get into Lydia's house. 

16AJS, another juvenile involved in the offence, was 16 years old at the time of the offence. He gave an undertaking to give evidence at the trial of Mr Maraache and received a 15% discount on his sentence for doing so. AJS said in evidence that he went to Mr Tamapua's house at Claymore with BT and Mr Maraache. He heard Mr Maraache having a discussion about a home invasion. Those involved were talking about a drug dealer from the Campbelltown area. Mr Maraache told BT that he was to carry the firearm. AJS had previously seen a firearm in the back of the boot of Mr Mohammed's car. AJS said that Mr Tamapua removed the firearm from the car and took it inside the house. That firearm was used in the commission of the offence. 

17During cross-examination, it was suggested to AJS that, when the police first spoke to him about the offence, he said nothing about the involvement of Mr Maraache and that it was only in his second statement that he incriminated Mr Maraache. AJS said that Mr Maraache was always involved in the home invasion and that, in his first statement to the police, he said nothing about anyone else being involved either. He said that his earlier statement related only to his own involvement. 

18It was also suggested to AJS in cross-examination that, when they went to locate Lydia's house, Mr Maraache was not in the car with him. AJS disagreed. Counsel for Mr Maraache suggested that the only discussion that took place about a drug dealer in the presence of Mr Maraache was Mr Tan (Ricky) saying that a drug dealer owed him money. AJS said that he did not remember that. 

19Mr King pleaded guilty in relation to his involvement in the offence and was sentenced on the basis of being an accessory after the fact. He gave an undertaking to give evidence at Mr Maraache's trial and received some benefit for agreeing to do so. Mr King said in evidence that he did not know that a home invasion was to take place until he saw the others enter Lydia's house. He said that he was not aware of the existence of a firearm until the persons ran from the house and returned to the cars. He said that his role was to help leaving the crime scene. 

20Mr King said in evidence that, on the day of the offence, he was with a friend who received a telephone call asking the friend to pick up some people. Mr King said that they picked up two passengers whom he did not know, drove to CJB's house and then to Lydia's house. At CJB's house, Mr King said that his friend and the two passengers left the vehicle, while he remained inside the vehicle. Then, one person jumped into the front passenger seat and another into the back seat. He said he did not know who those persons were. He heard someone outside say ""pop the boot"". He opened the car boot and, a couple of seconds later, the boot was closed. The passenger in the back seat told him to drive and follow the car in front of him. Mr King said that he drove about 150 to 200 metres to Lydia's house and stopped the car in front of Lydia's house. The back seat passenger then alighted from Mr King's car, and three or four other persons alighted from the other car. They all walked up to the front door of Lydia's house. The passenger in the front seat remained with Mr King and did not get out of the car. 

21Mr King's evidence was that he did not watch what was happening until he heard someone screaming. He looked over and saw that the person at the front door of Lydia's house had ripped open the screen door and kicked in the front door. He saw three persons enter the house and close the door. He said that the person in the front passenger seat next to him did not say anything or talk to him while the door was being kicked down. 

22Mr King said that, after a few minutes, the persons came running out of Lydia's house. One of them jumped into the back seat of his car. He thought it was the same person who had been in the back seat when he drove the car to the house. He saw the others get into the car in front, at which point the police arrived. The police pulled up in front of the first vehicle with firearms drawn. The passenger in the back seat started yelling ""fucking drive, fucking drive"". Mr King stated the car and began driving.

23In the course of cross-examination, Mr King agreed that the person in the front seat next to him asked for a cigarette while they were waiting and that he gave him one. He denied that the front seat passenger said to him ""What are you doing? Relax, stop"" or that the passenger said to him ""What are you worried about? Relax"". He also denied that the front seat passenger said to him ""Stop, man. Didn't you see the police?"" or ""Listen, man, you're going to kill us"" or ""Listen, man, stop, pull over. You've got nothing to worry about"". However, he agreed that the passenger said ""You didn't do nothing wrong. We were just sitting in the car"".

24Mr Mohammed pleaded guilty to the offence and gave an undertaking to give evidence at the trial of Mr Maraache. He received a 15 per cent discount on the sentence as a consequence. He gave evidence that he was the driver of the other motor vehicle into which offenders ran after leaving Lydia's house. He started to drive away but was boxed in between the police car and Mr King's car. 

25Mr Mohammed said that he had met Mr Maraache some months before the day of the offence. He was frequently asked to drive Mr Maraache to places because he had a driver's licence and motor vehicle. He said that, during the day before the offence was committed, he received a number of text messages and phone calls from Mr Maraache. On the evening in question, he and a friend went to Mr Tamapua's house in Claymore. Mr Maraache, AJS and BT were there. Others arrived later. 

26During the evening, while sitting in the sitting room, he heard Mr Maraache talking about doing a home invasion and about a drug dealer in the Campbelltown area. He said that Mr Maraache was instructing BT on what to do and heard mention of the word ""gun"", but he did not see one at that time. He said that, Mr Maraache made a number of telephone calls to organise a number of persons to come to be involved in the home invasion. Mr Mohammed then drove Mr Maraache, BT and AJS to CJB's house in St Andrews. 

27Later, Mr Maraache and several others asked to have Mr Mohammed to drive past Lydia's house. Mr Maraache said words to the effect ""it looks good"". They then returned to CJB's house. Another car was parked behind his car. Several people came out and Mr Maraache directed people where to go in each car. Mr Mohammed saw that one of them was carrying something wrapped in a white cloth, which was placed in the other car. Several people entered his car, including AJS. At that point, he realised that a home invasion was about to occur. He said that he did not want to drive the vehicle. The others declined to do so. He asked Mr Maraache, but Mr Maraache said he did not want to drive and that he was going to be in the other car. 

28Mr Mohammed said that Mr Maraache then went to the other car and sat in the front seat and BT entered the back seat. Both cars then drove to Lydia's house. The persons in his car alighted and he waited in his vehicle outside the front of Lydia's house. After the others ran from the house, he was prevented from driving off by the police. 

29In the course of cross-examination, it was suggested to Mr Mohammed that he had incriminated Mr Maraache so that he would not be charged with the more serious offence and that he was concerned about going to prison. He said that, when he heard the talk about a home invasion, he did not ask about what was happening because he felt intimidated by Mr Maraache and Mr Tamapua. He disagreed, when it was put to him, that Mr Maraache was not in the car with him when they went to check out Lydia's house the first time. In cross-examination, he adhered to his evidence that Mr Maraache was present during the discussion about a home invasion. He said ""Wally was in the middle, he was the one that was talking about it"". 

30In addition to the evidence of those witnesses, the Crown relied on several telephone intercepts. The intercepts were of telephone conversations made to or from a mobile telephone number that Mr Maraache accepted belonged to him. The telephone conversations took place on 26 May 2010 at 1.50pm, 5.06pm and 5.15pm. The Crown relied on the telephone conversations as corroborative support for the evidence given by the other witnesses that Mr Maraache was directly involved in organising the home invasion.

31In the conversation at 1.50pm, Mr Maraache said the following: 

""Mate, we've got a job tonight. That's it. It's raining, it's the best time ... we don't have to speed, just cruise""

32During the call at 5.06pm, the following exchange occurred: 

Mr Maraache: Telal called me for the job.

Other: Yeah?

Mr Maraache: Yeah, two hours, maybe the same one I still got ...

Other: Sweet, sweet. Which one?

Mr Maraache: The Frank one, the two kilos of - of the ice.

Other: The ice?

Mr Maraache: Yeah, the two kilos.

Other: Oh, yeah, okay, no worries. Okay we'll talk about that later.

Mr Maraache: Okay, Habibe, we'll talk about it after we've finished that.

33The exchange at 5.15pm was as follows: 

Other: Wally

Mr Maraache: Yeah, Tera.

Other: Hey, Wally ...

Mr Maraache: Yeah.

Other: ... I'm going to go look at this drug dealer, okay?

Mr Maraache: What do you want to do?

Other: I'm going to go look at this drug dealer.

Mr Maraache: I can't hear nothing, Tera ... where are you going?

Other: I'm - my cousin's going to show me a drug dealer ... 

Mr Maraache: Yeah.

Other: Okay? And I'll come back, okay? 

34In addition, an SMS message was sent from Mr Maraache's mobile telephone, at 3.25pm on 26 May 2010, in the following terms:

""Kevin we need ur car is it okay, okay why u bro we got a drug deala today plz let me know"" 

Police Interview of Mr Maraache

35Following his arrest, the police interviewed Mr Maraache. In the interview he said that, on the night in question, he was with his wife until 11:30pm, when he dropped her off at a McDonalds restaurant and returned home with his mate and had a shower. In the record of the interview, Mr Maraache is recorded as referring to his mate as ""Shahil"", which must be a reference to Suhail, and thus to Mr Mohammed. He said that he was going to meet with Mr Mohammed's cousin and went to his house. There was a person there who said there was a drug dealer who owed him some money and that he wanted to go to collect his money. All the boys left the house and asked him whether he wanted to go with them. He said that he jumped into the car with a driver who he had never seen before and whose name he did not know. He said that his mate, Mr Mohammed, parked the car in the front and he sat with the driver in the other car. 

36Mr Maraache said that he sat there for between four and four and a half minutes. The first conversation with the driver was when he asked the driver whether he had a cigarette, because he left his pack at Mr Mohammed's cousin's house. There was only one cigarette in the driver's pack and Mr Maraache took the cigarette and smoked it. He told the driver that he would give the driver his full pack that he had left at the other house and the driver said that was all right.

37While Mr Maraache was having the cigarette, he was laughing. The driver asked him what was wrong and he said that he was just laughing at what the boys were doing. They were all jumping and all of a sudden he saw the boys kicking the door and going in and he asked what they were doing. All of a sudden, the boys were running and his mate Benny jumped in the car. The police arrived and pulled over in front of the other car, saying to get out of the car. The driver of the car containing Mr Maraache started reversing. Mr Maraache asked what he was doing, told him to relax and to stop, asked him what he was worried about and told him not to reverse. The driver told Mr Maraache to relax and that he knew what he was doing. Mr Maraache asked the driver where he was going, told him to stop and asked him whether he did not see the police, and again told him to stop.

Evidence of Mr Maraache at Trial

38Mr Maraache gave evidence at the trial. He said that he was at Mr Tamapua's house at Claymore when he received a telephone call from his girlfriend asking him to bring her some food. At that time, Mr Mohammed arrived at the house. Mr Maraache asked Mr Mohammed if he could take him. They went in Mr Mohammed's car and went back to Mr Tamapua's house at about 9:30pm. He said that when he arrived back he had a shower. There were several people at the house. Somebody said that they were going to watch a football game and asked Mr Maraache whether he wanted to go to see Mr Mohammed's cousin. He agreed to go with them to Mr Mohammed's cousin's place. Mr Maraache went with Mr Mohammed. There were several of them in Mr Mohammed's car and it took them about 5 minutes to get there.

39Mr Maraache's evidence was that, at some stage, another person, who was called Ricky, arrived at the house and there was a conversation among some of them there. Ricky told the boys that there was someone that owed him money and he wanted to get his money. Mr Maraache thought Ricky was showing off, or making it up or lying. Mr Maraache said he went outside to have a cigarette and when he came back, BT asked him if he wanted to come. They all went outside and Mr Maraache agreed to go with them. He asked ""why are we going to go with them?"" and was told they were ""just going up the road"". He then said ""[a]ll right, I'll come"" and got into Simon King's car. He said that he had not known Mr King before that evening. 

40Mr Maraache's said in evidence that, when he jumped into Mr King's car, he did not have any knowledge of what was intended to be done at the house in St Andrews. He said that, before he got into the car with Mr King, there had not been any conversation with any of the boys who were planning a home invasion. When they left the house, he understood that they were going to somebody's house for Ricky to get his money. Mr Maraache was in Mr King's car and he saw Mr Mohammed's car leaving at about the same time with some of the other boys in the car, who had been at the house. They drove for about 2 minutes. When Mr King's car stopped, the person in the back seat left the car. Mr Mohammed's car was parked in front of Mr King's car, in which Mr Maraache was sitting. He said that the people who got out of Mr Mohammed's car went and knocked on the door of Lydia's house. He saw Ricky knocking on the door.

41Mr Maraache said that, next, he turned to Mr King and asked him about a cigarette. Mr King said that he only had one cigarette left and Mr Maraache promised him that he would get some when they went back to Mr Mohammed's cousin's house, where he left his packet of cigarettes. While Mr Maraache was having his cigarette, he looked towards where the people were going, knocking on the door. He saw his friends jumping all over the place and started laughing. Mr King asked him why he was laughing and he said that he replied ""look at them they're jumping all over the place"". Mr Maraache said that, at that time, he did not have any idea that the people going to the house were in the process of committing a home invasion. 

42Mr Maraache then said that after he saw them jumping around, he saw the door open and somebody put a head out but he could not tell who it was. He said Ricky was at the front door and he could see that they pushed the door and he saw a women screaming in the house. He said he was stunned by what was going on. He saw them all push in and he heard the woman scream for a short period, and after that the screaming stopped. After a minute, they left the house and came outside running. 

43Mr Maraache said that BT got into Mr King's car, in which Mr Maraache was sitting, and sat in the back passenger seat. When the people ran out of the house, Mr King turned on the car and began reversing. While he was reversing, Mr Maraache saw a police car coming from the back, blocking Mr Mohammed's car. He saw a police officer holding a firearm at the boys in Mr Mohammed's car and telling them to get out of the car. 

44Mr King was reversing his car and Mr Maraache asked him what he was doing and why he did not stop. Mr Maraache told him to stop a couple of times. He asked him why he was running or what he was doing. Mr Maraache said that it took him a couple of minutes to convince Mr King to stop and pull over to the side, because it was raining and they were all going to die if he kept going at that speed. Mr King said a couple of times that he knew what he was doing. He eventually stopped and the police arrived and they were arrested. 

45Mr Maraache said that at no time during the evening did he seek to provide any assistance or guidance or allocate roles to any of the persons involved in the commission of the home invasion. He said that he did not see anybody with a firearm. He said that he did not see anyone put a firearm in the boot of the vehicle in which he was sitting. 

46Mr Maraache said in cross-examination that the telephone conversations related to meeting some girlfriends and they used code words to hide the meeting from their wives. He said that the reference in the conversation to Talal calling him for a job was an Arabic reference for talking about a girl. However, he accepted that the word ""Talal"" was an Arabic first name. Mr Maraache said that the reference during the telephone conversation to ""two kilos of ice"" was a reference to the fact that when he and the person he was speaking to first saw the two girls, they were both smoking ice. He said that the reference had nothing to do with drugs, apart from the fact that the girls had been smoking it. He said that ""Frank"" was a reference to a restaurant in Liverpool called ""The Frank"". However, he could not provide any specific details as to the location of the restaurant. 

47Mr Maraache also said in cross-examination that he did not recollect sending the SMS message. He said that, if he sent it, it was a reference to going to pick up some drugs for Mr Tamapua, who was on parole and who was not allowed to take drugs. He said that that message had nothing to do with a home invasion. 

Addresses and Summing Up

48The defence case at the trial was that Mr Maraache had no involvement whatsoever with the offence charged and that the witnesses called by the Crown were not telling the truth. The case was that the witnesses were endeavouring to implicate him falsely, so as to minimise their criminality and justify the various sentencing discounts awarded by reason of their pleas of guilty to the offence with which they were charged. 

49In his address to the jury, counsel for Mr Maraache emphasised that it was not for him to persuade them that it was more likely that Mr Maraache was telling the truth. He said that it was not a case of choosing between two competing versions of the relevant events. Rather, the onus of proof rested at all times on the Crown. Counsel for Mr Maraache said that the fact that Mr Maraache participated in an interview and the fact that he chose to give evidence did not shift the burden of proof onto him and that the Crown at all times must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 

50Counsel for Mr Maraache said that another way of giving Mr Maraache the benefit of the doubt was that, if the jury believed that it was reasonably possible that a group of young men decided, for whatever reasons and perhaps for their own individual benefit, to point the finger at an innocent man because they believed that it was in their individual interests to do so, despite his innocence, then the jury would find Mr Maraache not guilty. Counsel for Mr Maraache said that there was only one civilian witness who had not been proven to be a liar and that was Mr Maraache. Counsel for Mr Maraache said that, when the police arrested Mr Maraache he had his right to silence, but he chose to speak to the police and participate in an interview and then decided to give evidence before the jury. Counsel for Mr Maraache asked at what point in Mr Maraache's evidence did the Crown prove that he had told a proven lie. Counsel for Mr Maraache submitted to the jury that the bottom line was that, despite rigorous cross-examination by the Crown, Mr Maraache had not been proved in any respect to be a deliberate liar, compared with the other witnesses. 

51In the Crown's address to the jury, reference was made to the telephone recordings, particularly of a conversation between Mr Maraache and Mr Tamapua in which Mr Maraache said that ""Talal"" had called him for the job, ""the 2 kilos of ice"". The Crown asserted that not only did Mr Maraache know about the job involving ""2 kilos of ice"" but that the telephone conversation strongly suggested that he needed to organise things with Mr Tamapua in order to do it. The Crown's position was that the reference to ""2 kilos of ice"" was absolutely critical and, in fact, was probably the most important piece of evidence in the whole trial.

52The Crown then referred to the evidence of BJ that, when he was shown the firearm, they were talking about ""the house, the ice dealer and, yeah, at the time we were told that there was 2 kilos of ice"". The Crown asserted that it could not possibly be a coincidence or a fabrication for BJ to have said that, in circumstances where Mr Maraache spoke to Mr Tamapua on the telephone about ""a job involving 2 kilos of ice"", BJ was not a party to that telephone conversation between Mr Maraache and Mr Tamapua and BJ had not been shown that phone material, which was restricted, before giving his evidence. The Crown said that the only way that BJ could possibly have known anything about the job involving ""2 kilos of ice"" is that that is what he was told to expect at Lydia's house. The Crown referred to BJ's evidence that Mr Maraache was one of the organisers and the fact that the words ""2 kilos of ice"" were the very words used by the accused in the telephone conversation a few hours earlier.

53Counsel for Mr Maraache emphasised that ""a very central point"" made by the Crown was a conversation earlier in the day about ""2 kilos of ice"". He referred to the telephone intercepts, in which mention was made of ""2 kilos of ice"", and pointed out that Ms Pavicin gave evidence that during the home invasion there was no mention of drugs by anyone, let alone ""2 kilos of ice"". He said that, if it had been the central purpose and goal of the home invasion to obtain drugs, one would expect that somebody would have said to Ms Pavicin that they knew that she had ""2 kilos of ice"" and that it is peculiar that there was no mention at all. 

54The trial judge quite properly gave a warning to the jury that the facts of the case are for the jury and the jury alone, because the jury are the sole judges of the facts. His Honour said that he had nothing to do with the facts or the jury's decision in relation to them. He emphasised that he had nothing to do with what evidence was to be accepted by the jury as being truthful or what evidence was to be rejected as being untruthful. He told the jury that he had nothing to do with what weight the jury might give to any one particular part of the evidence and what inferences the jury should draw from the evidence. 

55The trial judge also emphasised that he did not propose to try to persuade the jury one way or the other and that that was not his job. His Honour pointed out that, when he came to a particular issue, he may suggest that there was no real dispute as to that issue. However, his Honour said that the jury could reject any view that he expressed, if it did not accord with their own independent assessment of the evidence.

56The trial judge told the jury that they were bound to accept the principles of law that he gave them and were bound to apply those principles to the facts of the case as the jury found the facts to be. His Honour told them that it was for them to assess the various witnesses and to decide whether they were telling the truth. His Honour told the jury that they had heard addresses from counsel for the Crown and counsel for Mr Maraache and that they would consider the submissions that had been made in the addresses and give them such weight as the jury thought fit. His Honour said that he did not propose to try to persuade the jury one way or the other and that that was not his job. His Honour said that counsel had referred the jury to those parts of the evidence that they considered important and that it was necessary for the jury, in deliberating, to consider all of the evidence and not only the evidence to which his Honour may refer them or to which they might have been referred by counsel. 

57The trial judge directed the jury that a person charged with a criminal offence is presumed to be innocent unless and until the Crown persuades the jury that the person is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour said that the fact that Mr Maraache had given evidence before the jury did not alter the burden of proof and that Mr Maraache did not have to prove that his version was true. Rather, the Crown must satisfy the jury that the account given by Mr Maraache should not be accepted as a version of events that could reasonably be true.

58The trial judge told the jury that Mr Maraache had given evidence in answer to the case led by the Crown and that that evidence was essentially consistent with what he had said in the electronically recorded interview made on the morning after the home invasion. His Honour said that, if, having considered that evidence and the submissions of both counsel in relation to it, the jury accepted Mr Maraache's evidence then they must acquit him and bring in a verdict of not guilty. His Honour said that there was no obligation on Mr Maraache to persuade the jury to accept his evidence. His Honour said that the jury did not have to believe that Mr Maraache was telling the truth before he was entitled to be acquitted. His Honour said that if, at the end of the jury's deliberations, the jury found that there was a reasonable possibility that the version presented by the defence were true, then the Crown would have failed to persuade the jury of Mr Maraache's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

59Later, the trial judge said the offence consisted of seven elements but that it was not in issue that elements 2 - 7 had occurred. Rather, the essential argument in the case was whether the accused had participated in a joint criminal enterprise involving the armed home invasion and the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt the accused's participation in a joint criminal enterprise. 

60Later, the trial judge said ""I remind you that it is the Crown case that not merely was [Mr Maraache] present in one of the cars used as a getaway during the armed home invasion but also that [Mr Maraache] actively was involved in planning and arranging this home invasion"". That statement by the trial judge outlining the Crown case also implicitly outlines the defence case. The essential proposition of the defence case was that Mr Maraache was merely present in a getaway car used in an armed home invasion. Put another way, the defence case was simply the negative of the Crown case: that he was not actively involved in planning and arranging the home invasion. 

61The trial judge pointed out that the Crown relied on evidence from the other witnesses who were involved in the crime. His Honour referred to a direction about drawing inferences and said that one could speculate as to what Mr Maraache may have been doing in the getaway car, if the jury did not accept what Mr Maraache himself said about it. Thus, his Honour said, the jury could speculate, for example, that the role of Mr Maraache may have been to keep control of Mr King so as to make sure that he did not drive off. However, his Honour said, that was speculation. His Honour said that the jury ""can draw inferences but there are other inferences that can be drawn"". 

62The trial judge then said ""the Crown case is based not merely on his presence in one of the getaway cars but in [sic] actually planning part, if not all, of this joint criminal enterprise"". Again, in putting the Crown case in that way, his Honour was also stating the essential positive proposition of the defence case: that Mr Maraache was merely present in one of the getaway cars and had nothing to do with the planning of the offence. The additional proposition was the Crown's contention that Mr Maraache had an active planning role. Mr Maraache, of course, contended for the negative version of that proposition, that he had no such role. His Honour said that the jury needed to have regard to the evidence given by the other witnesses to establish the role of Mr Maraache in the joint criminal enterprise. 

63Later, the trial judge returned to the issue of participation in the crime, as opposed to mere presence at the scene, in relation to the sixth element of the offence: that the offenders were in the company of each other. His Honour said that it was not sufficient that another person merely be present when a crime is committed. Instead, that other person had to participate in the offence, or at least encourage or assist the person who did carry out the offence. His Honour stated that the jury would be comfortably satisfied that at least AJS, BT, JT, Mr King and QJ were in company. Then, his Honour posed the question for the jury: ""The question for you is, was the accused part of the joint criminal enterprise?"". It is significant that the defence case on the point was simply the negative of the Crown case: that Mr Maraache was not part of the joint criminal enterprise and did not plan it.

64When the summing up was complete, the jury had available to them a transcript of the interview of Mr Maraache by the police. They had also seen a video of that interview. The trial judge also directed that the jury be informed that they were entitled to ask to have the video of the interview and the voice intercepts played and replayed as often as they liked, though it would require the jury to come back into the courtroom to do so. 

65At no stage did counsel for Mr Maraache object or make any complaint about the direction given by the trial judge to the jury. At no stage was any application made for a further direction to be given to the jury concerning the case advanced at the trial on behalf of Mr Maraache. 

Relevant Principles

66Under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court may, notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that a point raised by an appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal, if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Because of the fundamental nature of the requirement that, in a summing up in a jury trial, the defence case be put to the jury, if the defence case is not sufficiently put to the jury not only will it be appropriate to grant leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules for that omission to be a ground of appeal, notwithstanding the absence of objection by the party seeking to appeal, it may also be inappropriate to apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act by finding that there is not a substantial miscarriage of justice (El-Jalkh v R [2009] NSWCCA 139 at [153]-[154] (El-Jalkh)). 

67The Crown accepts that, if the Court comes to the view that the defence case was not sufficiently put to the jury, it would find that Mr Maraache did not have a fair trial. Nevertheless, the Crown contends that the fact that no complaint was made on behalf of Mr Maraache at the trial augurs against making such a finding, even if that lack of complaint be irrelevant as to whether leave should be granted under rule 4. 

68The fundamental task of a trial judge is to ensure a fair trial. That involves not only instructing the jury about the law but also extends to identifying the issues, relating the law to those issues and assisting the jury to understand how it is that the accused may be guilty of the offence charged on the indictment. It also requires that the trial judge explain why the accused asserts that his guilt has not been established beyond reasonable doubt and to give any directions that call for a particular explanation or caution. The jury must be given to understand the case that the defence has attempted to make out, including any matter that is properly open that the jury might find for the accused (R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76] (Meher)).

69Even if a trial judge expresses opinions on matters of fact that are favourable to the prosecution case, it does not necessarily follow that the summing up is unbalanced. However, while the opinions of the trial judge on issues of fact can be of great assistance to the jury, it is very important that the jury be told that they are not bound by the opinions of the trial judge and that they are not relieved of the responsibility for forming their own views (Broadhurst v R [1964] AC 441 at 464). 

70An accused is entitled to have a trial according to law. A trial according to law includes, as an essential prerequisite, that the trial judge has put the defence of the accused to the jury fairly, cogently and with clarity. The weaker the defence, the more essential it is for the defence, such as it is, to be put to the jury, so that the jury can consider it in the light of the Crown's case and evaluate it, as part of their assessment, together with the Crown evidence, to see whether the Crown has discharged its onus of proof. It is not sufficient for a trial judge simply to say to the jury, in effect, you have heard what has been said on behalf of an accused by his counsel. The trial judge must lend the weight of the judge's judicial position and authority to the case for the accused being put before the jury (Meher at [84]). 

71Even if the prosecution case is a potentially strong one, there may nevertheless be critical issues for the jury to decide, which go directly to the proof of the charges made against an accused. It is important that there be a balance in the summing up and that the defence case be properly put to the jury. Even where the trial judge carefully and correctly identifies the issues and gives impeccable directions on the law, including directions that go to the onus and standard of proof and to the elements of the offences charged, a summing up may nevertheless be unbalanced, such that a miscarriage of justice occurs. If a summing up is heavily directed in favour of the Crown, and little attention is given to the defence case, there may be a miscarriage of justice (Meher at [147]-[151]).

72Where the single issue in a trial is whether the Crown had proved that the accused was party to a conspiracy that had admittedly come into existence, and the trial judge identifies that issue for the jury and directs the jury that it would not be sufficient for the Crown to prove merely that the accused had acquired knowledge of the existence of the conspiracy, the trial judge may nevertheless fail to perform the essential function of putting the defence case on the issue of whether the Crown had proved that the accused was a party to a conspiracy. The trial judge must do more, by way of putting the defence case, than tell the jury that counsel for the accused had made submissions that the jury should not accept the Crown's evidence, that the objective evidence was capable of an interpretation other than that urged by the Crown and that the jury should find that the accused's evidence was reasonably possibly true. The trial judge should refer to specific parts of the oral evidence, or of recorded conversations, making such references to the evidence as would be required to enable the jury properly to understand the defence case (El-Jalkh at [148] - [149]). A trial judge is not relieved of the requirement of putting matters to the jury because they have already been put by defence counsel or because they might have seemed obvious or because they might have seemed to difficult to accept (El-Jalkh at [152]). 

73In a criminal trial, a trial judge is bound to direct the jury as to any principle of law or rule of practice applicable to the case, and a misdirection or non-direction on such a matter will usually mean that the trial has miscarried. However, matters of fact and the arguments in relation to them are in a different category. A trial judge is not bound to discuss all the evidence or to analyse all the conflicts in the evidence and, by itself, the failure of a trial judge to do so does not mean that there has been any miscarriage of justice. Nevertheless, the requirement of fairness means, ordinarily, that the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury. However, that requirement does not oblige the trial judge to put to the jury every argument put forward for the accused.

74Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence. If, having regard to the complexity of the factual issues for the jury to determine, the trial judge has not put the defence case adequately, such that the jury may misunderstand or not understand it, then the jury will not be in a position where they can properly act as judges of the facts and thus there will be a miscarriage of justice. The idea of a summing up is to present for the jury the issues of fact that they have to determine (R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105). Consequently, the way in which the case was conducted and the inherent complexity of the factual issues to be determined necessarily bear on the extent to which the judge is bound to comment on, or discuss, the evidence. Discussion or comment that is justified or required in one case may be neither required nor justified when a similar case is conducted in a different way (Domican v R [1992] HCA 13; (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 560-561). 

The Question on the Appeal

75Mr Maraache contends that the trial judge failed to put his case adequately to the jury and that that failure deprived him of a chance of acquittal. He says that it does not matter that counsel for Mr Maraache had just finished his address to the jury or that his version of the circumstances was simple to understand. What matters, he says, is that the failure of the trial judge to refer to his account resulted in his not receiving a fair trial. 

76Mr Maraache also points to the example given by the trial judge concerning the drawing of inferences. He says that the example given by his Honour was an argument in support of the Crown case and was not put by the Crown. 

77An essential consideration is whether there was a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the summing up in a significant way or that the jury might not have returned a verdict of guilty had his Honour directed their attention to the version of events advanced by Mr Maraache. The question is whether there was a real risk that any failure to do so resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 

78While it was necessary for the trial judge to remind the jury of the case that Mr Maraache sought to make, it was not necessary that his Honour refer to each of the various points sought to be made on behalf of Mr Maraache. It is no part of the function of a trial judge to repeat all of the arguments and submissions advanced by counsel, unless there are particular parts of the evidence that require a warning by the trial judge or the assistance of the trial judge, if the jury is to have a proper understanding of dangers, difficulties and limitations inherent in the evidence. 

79The defence offered by Mr Maraache in the trial was simple and straightforward. He denied that he had taken part in any organisation or planning in relation to the offence. He denied that he knew that the offence was to be committed. The jury saw the electronic record of his interview by the police and a transcript of the interview was available to them. There is no prospect that the jury was under any misapprehension as to the defence advanced by Mr Maraache at the trial. Mr Maraache's case was that he was sitting in the getaway car but did not know about the home invasion and was not involved in planning it. The Crown case was that he was sitting in the getaway car and did know about the home invasion and was involved in planning it. The essential factual matter for the jury to determine was simple and discrete. The Crown case and the defence case were two sides of the same coin and the jury must have understood that to be the factual question for them to decide.

80The Crown relied on the evidence of co-offenders and CJB. Their evidence was that Mr Maraache planned the offence and organised the roles that each would play. There were two competing versions. The real issue at the trial was credibility. The jury received fair and appropriate directions as to the care with which they were to assess the Crown witnesses. 

81No complaint was made at the trial about the directions given to the jury. No complaint was made on the appeal about the directions, save for the assertion that his Honour did not adequately put Mr Maraache's defence. His Honour referred to the fact that the evidence given by Mr Maraache was consistent with the statements made in his interview by the police shortly after the offence. 

82It may be that a reasonable conclusion is that there can have been no real prospect that the jury did not understand the stance adopted by Mr Maraache. Counsel for Mr Maraache, who finished addressing the jury shortly before his Honour began summing up, emphasised that Mr Maraache was an innocent bystander. The summing up was not a lengthy one. 

83However, the requirement for the case of the accused to be put to the jury by the trial judge is a fundamental requirement of a fair trial. The trial judge did not tell the jury that the defence advanced by Mr Maraache was that he did not know about the proposed home invasion but believed that they were visiting Lydia's house to collect money that was owing to one of the others. The jury may have disbelieved that version of events. However, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to tell the jury that that was Mr Maraache's answer to the charges made against him.

84On the hearing of the appeal, the Crown did not advance contentions that, notwithstanding the failure on the part of the trial judge to state the defence case to the jury, there was nevertheless a fair trial. As I have indicated, the Crown conceded that, if the Court be of the view that the defence case was not sufficiently put the jury, it would conclude that Mr Maraache did not have a fair trial. The Crown also accepted that, if the defence case were not sufficiently put to the jury, the lack of complaint should not trigger the operation of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules and that leave to appeal should be granted.

Conclusion

85It follows that leave to appeal should be granted. The appeal should be allowed. The convicted should be quashed and a new trial ordered.

86FULLERTON and SCHMIDT JJ: We have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of Emmett JA and agree with the orders his Honour proposes. 

87We gratefully adopt his Honour's analysis of the evidence and the issues in dispute at trial, and his Honour's summary of the course of proceedings at trial, but would wish to add the following references to the evidence and the following reasons for joining with his Honour in the orders he proposes.

88The applicant's counsel accepted that after the jury had retired to consider their verdict, there was no application by defence counsel that the jury be referred to the evidence relied upon by the applicant on the single issue the trial judge had identified for their consideration, namely, whether the Crown had proved the applicant's participation in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the offence charged on the indictment. Nor did the trial judge summarise or even refer to defence counsel's closing submissions concerning that evidence. Counsel also accepted that in these circumstances leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was required. 

89The Crown submitted that the approach of defence counsel might tend to suggest that in the atmosphere of the trial there was no perceived unfairness by reason of his Honour having made no reference to the applicant's evidence or his counsel's arguments about the evidence. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the trial judge's obligation to put the defence case was a mainstay of a fair trial regardless of any request for redirections by trial counsel, and that the failure of the trial judge in this case to put the case fairly, or at all, meant the conviction should be quashed and a retrial ordered. 

90The Crown accepted that if after reviewing the summing up, including the content and length of counsel's addresses, we were to conclude that the trial judge had not sufficiently put the applicant's case and, for that reason, there was a real risk that a miscarriage of justice has been occasioned, Rule 4 would have no application. She also accepted that were we of that view it would be inappropriate that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act be applied. 

91The applicant submitted that the following features of the defence case, drawn from both the applicant's record of interview with police on his arrest and the evidence he gave at trial, which was largely coincident with that account, should have been the subject of direction by the trial judge. 

92During the interview with police the applicant stated:

(a) While visiting a friend's house, one of the men who was present, a man he did not know particularly well, asked them all to accompany him to a drug dealer's house because the man was owed some money. The applicant agreed to go.

(b) He was a passenger in a car driven by a man he did not know. He remained in the car while the other men, excluding the driver, got out. He shared a cigarette with the driver for several minutes.

(c) He saw the men kicking in the door of the house and then entering the house after which they ran back to the car. BT (one of the men who had entered the house) got into the car and the driver reversed down the road and left.

(d) He asked the driver to stop when the police appeared but the driver told him to relax as he knew what he was doing.

(e) He had no knowledge that the home invasion was to occur and no knowledge of what happened when the men went into the house.

93His evidence at trial was:

(a) He did not know that there was a conversation recorded on his telephone about someone procuring guns the day before the home invasion. He said that he had given the phone to someone to use as they had no telephone credit. Similarly, he had no knowledge of who might have sent a text message from his telephone the afternoon before the home invasion saying ""Kevin, we need your car, is it okay with you bro, we got a drug dealer tonight, please let me know"".

(b) An intercepted telephone call, relied upon by the Crown as a conversation concerning the home invasion by the reference to ""two kilos of ice"" which was expected to be in the house, was in fact a code the applicant used when arranging to meet some women to disguise the meeting from his wife.

(c) On the afternoon of 26 May 2010 he was invited to a friend's house to watch a football game.

(d) He had no knowledge of and did not see a rifle or a taser whilst at the friend's house. Whilst there he was invited by a man named Ricky to go to a drug dealer's house so that Ricky could pick up some money he was owed. He originally refused to go, but when everybody else decided to go he changed his mind.

(e) He did not know the home invasion was planned and was surprised when he saw the men forcing their way into the house.

94The summing up extended over 20 pages. Apart from a reference in general terms to the applicant's defence, when the trial judge directed the jury as to the elements of the offence, and aside from directions given in standard terms that the jury were the sole judges of the facts; that they had to assess what evidence they accepted as being truthful and what evidence should be rejected as being untruthful; that any views which he might express upon questions of fact were to be ignored; and that they should consider all of the evidence, the Crown was not able to point to any part of the summing up in which his Honour had put the accused's case to the jury. The only reference his Honour made to the evidence in the defence case was as follows: 

The accused has given evidence in answer to the case led by the Crown. It is, essentially, consistent with what he said in the electronically recorded interview made on the morning after the home invasion.

He made no mention at all of the content of either of the closing addresses of counsel. 

95The trial judge reminded the jury of the Crown case in the context of directing them as to the constituent elements of the offence. Then, after warning the jury about the potential unreliability of the evidence given by each of the co-offenders (about which no exception is taken), and before asking the jury to retire to consider their verdict, his Honour said:

Ladies and gentlemen, I can sum up the facts to you but I would keep you here for probably the rest of the day and part of tomorrow. Remember that what you are concerned about is whether the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt each of the 7 essential elements in the case. The Crown does not have to prove beyond reasonable doubt who went in what car for example, or who did what at Lydia P Chen's house or whether Benny did what Lydia P Chin said he did. All you have to decide beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the crime and you must consider whether the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt each of the 7 principal elements.

96On the appeal, the Crown submitted that it could not be gainsaid that either the brevity with which his Honour dealt with the evidence in the defence case, or the fact that he did not refer to the content of closing arguments of counsel, undermined the adequacy of the summing up which was in all other respects well structured and concise and which identified, with precision and clarity, the issue for the jury to resolve. She submitted that the applicant's case was simple and that the jury could have been under no misapprehension as to the basis upon which he defended the charge or the evidence upon which he relied in doing so. She submitted that in these circumstances there was no obligation on the trial judge to refer to the evidence, or even to analyse the conflicts in the evidence. She also submitted that when the summing up was read as a whole any risk that the deficiencies relied upon by the applicant were productive of such unfairness as to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice, in the sense that the jury might not have returned a verdict of guilty or that he lost a real chance of an acquittal (TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124), was not made out. The Crown pointed out that both counsel had addressed the jury at length and that the trial judge reminded the jury that it was necessary for the jury to consider all the evidence, not only the evidence referred to by counsel and the evidence to which he might later refer. 

97The applicant's counsel submitted, and in our view with considerable force, that the complaint about the adequacy of a trial judge's directions concerning the defence case under consideration in El-Jalkh v R [2009] NSWCCA 139 (being one of the grounds upon which the conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered), were analogous to this case. El-Jalkh was also described as a ""single issue case"". The appellant's counsel in that case submitted to the jury both in opening and closing that there was no dispute that there was a conspiracy to import drugs, the only question was whether the Crown could prove that the appellant was party to that conspiracy. In the present case, it was not in issue that there had been a home invasion, the question was whether the applicant participated in the joint criminal enterprise which had that as its objective. This, in turn, depended on the jury accepting the evidence of the co-offenders, to the effect that the applicant had planned the home invasion and organised the roles each would play, (including that he would stay outside in the car) and rejecting his denial of any such involvement. 

98In El-Jalkh the trial judge did not summarise the appellant's evidence and made only a passing reference to the recorded conversations relied upon by the Crown, and only then in the context of counsel's submissions. Although James J considered (at [139]-[144]) that, having regard to the operation of s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act, it was open to the trial judge to form the view that a general summary of the evidence of the recorded conversations was not necessary, he went on to hold at [151] that the trial judge should have put to the jury at least some of the explanations proffered by the appellant about those conversations, in order to discharge his obligation to make sufficient references to the evidence to enable the jury to properly understand the defence case in the context of the issue or issues in the trial. 

99In the present case, and despite what might be thought to be an implausible explanation by the applicant for a number of incriminating telephone conversations, in our view the trial judge was obliged to remind the jury of what the applicant claimed was the real explanation for his reference to ""two kilos of ice"" (see [152] of El-Jalkh) and that he was not the person talking about having given his phone to someone else to use. 

100In El-Jalkh, James J went on to observe at [148] that what the trial judge did by way of putting the defence case to the jury was not refer to any specific parts of the oral evidence, but rather to remind them that the appellant's counsel had submitted that they should not accept the evidence of a Crown witness; that the objective evidence was capable of an interpretation other than that urged by the Crown; and, further, that the jury should find the appellant's evidence was reasonably possibly true. His Honour then said at [149]:

In my opinion, the trial judge failed to perform the essential function of putting the defence case on the issue of whether the Crown had proved that the appellant was a party to the conspiracy, including making such references to the evidence as would be required to enable the jury properly to understand the defence case. Even though defence counsel had completed his closing address only on the morning of the day on which the trial judge gave most of the summing-up, the trial judge was required, on his own authority as the trial judge, to put the principal arguments for the accused. The references in the summing-up to the arguments for the accused and to the evidence need not have been lengthy or discursive.

101In R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 Wood CJ at CL referred with approval to the judgment of Isaacs J in R v Tomazos (Court of Criminal Appeal, 6 August 1979, unreported) where his Honour said: 

... A trial according to law includes as an essential prerequisite that the trial judge has put fairly, cogently and with clarity to the jury the accused's defence. The weaker the defence the more essential it is for his defence such as it is to be put to the jury so that they can consider it in the light of the Crown case and evaluate it as part of their assessment together with the Crown evidence to see whether the Crown has discharged its onus of proof.
It can properly be said that the accused fairly lost a chance of acquittal because his case was never put to the jury by the trial judge. It is completely insufficient for a trial judge simply to say to the jury in effect, ""Well, you have heard all that has been said on behalf of the accused by his counsel; it is unnecessary for me to say anything more"". The trial judge must lend the weight of his judicial position and authority to putting before the jury himself the case for the accused.

102We are of the opinion that even if it might fairly be said that the applicant's case was not compelling, he was entitled to have the trial judge refer the jury to how his defence was advanced in the context of the evidence upon which he relied (particularly since the Crown case and the evidence on which the Crown relied was addressed in the summing up), and that a miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by his failure to do so.

2762289,Bejanov v R [2013] NSWCCA 207,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with Button J.

2R A HULME J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J: On 10 February 2012, his Honour Judge Knox SC sentenced Alexander Bejanov (""the applicant"") in the District Court of New South Wales for a number of offences to do with the unlawful sale and possession of firearms and ammunition. Six offences were substantively before his Honour by way of a notice of committal, and seven were placed on a Form 1 pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999

4The total head sentence imposed was imprisonment for 7 years with a total non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. Three grounds were originally notified; in light of the concession of the Crown that error had been established with regard to the first two grounds and this Court must resentence, counsel for the applicant accepted at the hearing that the submissions and evidence that underpinned the third ground should be taken into account on resentence, rather than as a discrete ground requiring determination.

Objective features

6These were very straightforward. On 2 February 2010, the applicant met with an undercover police officer in a shopping centre car park. There the applicant sold the officer two firearms. The first was a Marlin brand .44 calibre rifle with a telescopic sight. The second was a 12 gauge pump action shotgun. Associated ammunition was also sold. The total purchase price was $7,000 in cash.

7Between that date and 22 March 2010, there were conversations between the applicant and the operative in which the applicant said that he was searching for more firearms that he could sell. No further sales took place.

8On 12 May 2010, a search warrant was executed at the home of the applicant. There the police located a second 12 gauge pump action shotgun. They also located a .22 calibre rifle with a box magazine and telescopic sight. Also found were assorted ammunition, some air rifle pellets, and a can of capsicum spray.

9All firearms and ammunition were in working order and therefore lethal. The other items were free from defect.

10As I have said, the matter was dealt with in the District Court by way of a notice of committal and a single Form 1. I shall proceed to detail the substantive matters first.

11Sequence 1 was an offence of selling a prohibited firearm that related to the sale of the 12 gauge shotgun on 2 February 2010. Pursuant to s 51(2A) of the Firearms Act 1996, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it was subject to a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

12Sequence 9 was an offence of possessing a prohibited firearm without a permit. It related to the second pump action shotgun located on 12 May 2010. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. It was also subject to a standard non-parole period of 3 years.

13Sequence 13 was an offence of possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit. It related to the capsicum spray located on 12 May 2010. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 14 years. It was also subject to a standard non-parole period of 3 years. 

14Sequence 14 was an offence of selling an unregistered prohibited firearm. It was another offence that related to the sale of the first 12 gauge shotgun on 2 February 2010. Pursuant to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.

15Sequence 16 was an offence of possessing an unregistered prohibited firearm. It related to the possession of the .22 calibre rifle that was located on 12 May 2010. Pursuant to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.

16The sixth and final charge that was substantively before his Honour was sequence 17. That was an offence of possessing an unauthorised prohibited weapon. It also related to the possession of the .22 calibre rifle on 12 May 2010. Pursuant to s 7(1) the Firearms Act, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. It was also subject to a standard non-parole period of 3 years.

17I turn to discuss the seven offences contained on the Form 1. The applicant asked that they be taken into account when he was sentenced with regard to sequence 1, that is the sale of the first 12 gauge shotgun on 2 February 2010.

18The first charge on the Form 1 was selling a firearm, pursuant to s 51(2) of the Firearms Act. It related to the sale of the .44 calibre rifle with telescopic sight to the undercover operative on 2 February 2010. When dealt with on indictment, such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.

19The second charge on the Form 1 related to the selling of the ammunition to the undercover operative on 2 February 2010. The charge was brought pursuant to s 65(1) of the Firearms Act. The offence is wholly summary, and is punishable by a fine. 

20The third charge on the Form 1 was possession of ammunition without holding a licence or permit. It related to the ammunition located on 12 May 2010. It was brought pursuant to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act, and is also a wholly summary offence punishable by a fine.

21The fourth charge on the Form 1 related to the 12 gauge pump action shotgun located on 12 May 2010. It was a charge of not keeping a firearm safely, and was brought pursuant to s 39(1)(a) of the Firearms Act. It is a wholly summary offence, and has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years and a fine or both.

22The fifth charge on the Form 1 was founded on the selling of the Marlin brand .44 calibre rifle with telescopic sight on 2 February 2010. It was brought pursuant to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act. It has a maximum penalty when dealt with on indictment of imprisonment for 10 years.

23The sixth charge on the Form 1 related to the possession of the 12 gauge pump action shotgun on 12 May 2010. That charge of possessing an unregistered firearm was brought pursuant to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act. The offence when dealt with on indictment has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.

24The seventh and final charge on the Form 1 was of not keeping a firearm safely. It related to the possession of the .22 calibre rifle located on 12 May 2010. It was brought pursuant to s 39(1)(a) of the Firearms Act. It is a wholly summary offence and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years and a fine or both. 

25I interpolate to say that the assignment of charges to the notice of committal and the Form 1 was idiosyncratic and apt to confuse. It can be seen that the sale of the .44 rifle on 2 February 2010 did not appear on the notice of committal, but merely on the Form 1. Conversely, sequences 1 and 14 on the notice of committal (each of which related to the sale of the first shotgun on 2 February 2010) and sequences 16 and 17 (each of which related to the possession of the .22 rifle on 12 May 2010) possessed a very substantial degree of evidential overlap. That overlap, with regard to the latter two sequences, led his Honour into an error about which there is no dispute between the parties. 

26In my opinion, it would have been preferable for the most serious count with regard to each of the four firearms (two sold on 2 February 2010, and two possessed on 12 May 2010) to have appeared on the substantive document. All of the other charges to do with firearms, and the charges to do with the capsicum spray and the ammunition, could have appeared on two or more Form 1 documents. The Form 1 documents should have been logically attached to the most relevant substantive offence. Some charges could perhaps have been dispensed with entirely. 

Subjective aspects

27The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court, and received a discount for the utilitarian value of that plea of 25 per cent. Neither party impugns that discount in this Court.

28The applicant claimed that he had found all of the firearms on the beach, and that the ammunition and capsicum spray had been found by him at a construction site. Those preposterous exculpatory stories were rejected by his Honour. His Honour found that there had been no cooperation on the part of the applicant with regard to the true source of the weapons.

29The applicant had a single conviction on his criminal record. Importantly, it was for possessing an unauthorised firearm in the form of a pistol in March 2001. On the other hand, it was accepted in the proceedings on sentence that it was in truth a starting pistol, and the matter had been disposed of in the Local Court by way of a fine in the sum of $500.

30Aged 38 as at the date of sentence, the applicant is of Russian background. He has been involved in businesses to do with trucking and hire cars. His mother has not been in good health, and the applicant had been of assistance to her in that regard.

31By far the most emphasised subjective feature in the proceedings on sentence was the health of the applicant himself. The evidence was that he was suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia, and that condition is chronic and life-threatening. There was a dispute between his treating doctor and doctors of Justice Health as to the sufficiency and competence of the treatment he was receiving for that condition whilst in custody bail refused. His treating doctor gave detailed evidence to the effect that, if his regime of drug treatment was not carefully implemented and monitored, the only alternative would be a bone marrow transplant, a potentially life-threatening procedure.

32In the remarks on sentence, his Honour found that the treatment that the applicant would receive in custody would ""not be optimal"", and could not replicate the standard of care that would be available to the applicant in the community. But his Honour rejected any suggestion that the medical condition of the applicant could, or should, lead to an alteration in the form of sentence. In other words, his Honour was clear that a substantial period of full-time imprisonment had to be imposed. Nor did his Honour make a finding of ""significant hardship"" accruing to the applicant in custody as a result of his illness. However, his Honour did remark that the medical condition of the applicant would be taken into account with regard to the length of the non-parole period, and the finding of special circumstances.

Structure of sentences imposed

33A diagram annexed to this judgment sets out the sentencing structure in a readily comprehensible form.

34With regard to sequence 1, a head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months to date from 15 December 2011 was imposed. The non-parole period expires on 14 September 2015.

35Although his Honour clearly stated that his Honour's intention was that the non-parole period for sequence 1 would be 66 per cent of the head sentence, it can be seen that it was, in fact, 75 per cent of the head sentence. 

36With regard to sequence 9, a head sentence of 4 years 2 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months to date from 15 June 2013 was imposed. That non-parole period expires on 14 December 2015. In other words, it extends the non-parole period of sequence 1 by 3 months.

37With regard to sequence 13, a head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 15 March 2014 was imposed. The non-parole period expires on 14 March 2016. It extends the non-parole period of sequence 9 by 3 months.

38With regard to sequence 14, a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years to date from 15 December 2011 and expire on 14 December 2013 was imposed. It can be seen that that fixed term is wholly concurrent with the non-parole period for sequence 1.

39With regard to sequence 16, a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years to commence on 15 December 2011 and expire on 14 December 2013 was imposed. Again, it can be seen that that fixed term is wholly concurrent with the non-parole period of sequence 1, and also completely concurrent with the fixed term for sequence 14.

40With regard to sequence 17, his Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. That sentence commenced on 15 December 2013. Again, that non-parole period, which expires on 14 June 2016, extends the total non-parole period by 3 months. 

41It is immediately noteworthy that that sentence is therefore completely cumulative upon the fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years imposed for sequence 16 with regard to the possession of the very same firearm, namely the .22 calibre rifle.

42As I have indicated, a total sentence of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was imposed. Clearly, special circumstances were found that permitted a variation in the statutory ratio between the total head sentence and the total non-parole period to 64 per cent. If that is not been the case, the total non-parole period would have been 5 years 3 months.

Grounds of appeal

Ground one

""1.(a) The discount provided to the applicant for the utilitarian benefit of his plea of guilty on sequence 1 was erroneously calculated.

(b) The consequential imposition of a non-parole period for sequence 1, based on 66% of the head sentence, was erroneously calculated.

(c) The commencement dates for the sentences imposed on sequences 9, 13 and 17 were all consequently erroneous.""

43In short, the applicant submitted that a mathematical error had been made by his Honour in calculating the head sentence imposed with regard to sequence 1, after reduction by way of the application of the 25 per cent discount to the starting point head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years 3 months. The Crown conceded that such an error has occurred.

44In light of the concession of the Crown, I consider that this part of ground one should be accepted. It is noteworthy that, towards the end of the remarks on sentence, his Honour actually adjourned so that the parties could assist the court by checking all figures with regard to the sentences that his Honour intended to impose. Unfortunately, that assistance was not forthcoming.

45The second part of ground one is founded on the proposition that the non-parole period should be commensurately reduced, not only to reflect the reduction in the head sentence, but also to give effect to the stated intention of his Honour that the non-parole period be no more than 66 per cent of the head sentence. Again, in light of the concurring position of the Crown with regard to both of those propositions, I consider that those submissions should be accepted.

46If the error had not occurred, applying a 25 per cent discount to the starting point of his Honour of 6 years 3 months (75 months) would have resulted in a head sentence of 4 years 8 months, not 5 years. Maintaining the ratio to which his Honour originally referred, namely 66 per cent, the resulting non-parole period would be 3 years and 1 month. 

47The final part of ground one simply submits that the non-parole periods of sequences 9, 13 and 17 should each continue to extend the non-parole period of sequence 1 by a cumulative increment of 3 months after the reduction of that non-parole period, as his Honour intended. Again, the Crown did not gainsay that proposition. I consider that that proposition is made out as well.

48Clearly, s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is engaged, in light of material error having been established. I will come to discuss the resentencing exercise later, including the taking into account of evidence that was placed before this Court but was not available at first instance. 

49But at the least I consider that sequence 1 should be reduced in the way for which the applicant contends, both with regard to the head sentence and non-parole period, and that the commencement dates of sequences 9, 13 and 17, should be the subject of ancillary adjustment.

Ground two

""2. His Honour erred regarding the sentences imposed for offences 16 and 17 in that:

(a) The sentence for sequence 17 was entirely accumulated on the sentence for sequence 16.

(b) The sentence for sequence 17 is manifestly excessive.""

50The first submission of the applicant can be stated shortly. As I have said, sequence 16 and sequence 17 pertained to one and the same firearm. Sequence 16 was founded on the fact that the .22 rifle located on 12 May 2010 was unregistered and prohibited. Sequence 17 focused upon the fact that it was unauthorised and prohibited. And yet the sentence for sequence 17 is wholly cumulative upon the sentence for sequence 16. Again, the Crown accepted that the ground has merit. 

51Whilst it is true that a very wide discretion is conferred upon judges at first instance with regard to questions of accumulation and concurrence (see R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, and most recently discussed in R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195), I consider that this ground should be upheld as well. There should have been, in my respectful opinion, a substantial degree of concurrency between the sentences for sequence 16 and sequence 17. As I have said, the assignment of offences between the notice of committal and the Form 1 did little to make the position clear to his Honour. 

52The applicant also submitted that the sentence for sequence 17 is manifestly excessive. A comparison was drawn between the sentence imposed for that offence and the sentence imposed for sequence 1.

53It is one thing to say that there should have been substantial concurrence between the sentence for sequence 16 and the sentence for sequence 17. It is another thing to say that a head sentence of 5 years, in the context of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, is manifestly excessive, even taking into account the fact that a 25 per cent discount had been applied. And it is not easy to accept that a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months is manifestly excessive, in light of the applicability of a standard non-parole period of imprisonment 3 years.

54I regard the head sentence imposed for sequence 17 as stern. However I am not persuaded that either the head sentence or the non-parole period is manifestly excessive.

Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912

55Material errors having been established, it is incumbent upon this Court to resentence if satisfied that a lesser sentence or sentences is warranted in law.

56A number of affidavits were received on resentence. They show that the treating doctor of the applicant continues to consider that his treatment in custody is markedly deficient. To the contrary, the doctors of Justice Health state that they are doing all they can in light of the realities of incarceration, and that they do not accept that the treatment and management of the applicant is incompetent or inappropriate. The applicant has deposed in an affidavit to the difficulties that he has experienced in custody as a result of his illness, and his general efforts to proceed with his rehabilitation.

57I do not consider that this Court is in a position definitively to resolve the controversy about the details of the treatment of the applicant. But as a general matter, the fact is that it will often be the case that medical treatment of prisoners in custody is unable to replicate that which is available in the community. For example, a chronically ill offender who is accustomed to staying in frequent contact with his or her treating doctor by way of mobile phone will be unable to do so when incarcerated. Treatment of medical conditions in custody must simply be as good as the exigencies and realities of the situation permit.

58Turning to this particular case, I accept that the health of the applicant is compromised to some degree by his being in custody. I also accept that his time in custody has been and will be more worrisome and onerous as a result of his illness. It is well established that those factors can be taken into account in sentencing: see R v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395 and R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186; (2011) 216 A Crim R 152.

59I am satisfied that a lesser total head sentence and total non-parole period than that imposed by his Honour is warranted in law. 

60Having said that, a substantial period of imprisonment was and is inevitable for these offences. As his Honour said in the remarks on sentence, to seek to disseminate lethal weapons into the community for profit is a profoundly antisocial offence: see Troung v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [66], and the decisions of this Court referred to at [64].

61Counsel for the applicant submitted that an appropriate total head sentence would be imprisonment for 6 years with a total non-parole period in the order of 3 years.

62The Crown in this Court was reluctant to ""get into numbers"", though it was submitted that the mathematically corrected sentence with regard to sequence 1 was ""about right"".

63At one stage I thought that it would be easier to impose an aggregate sentence, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The transitional provisions permit that course, because the pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court on 21 April 2011, thereby post-dating the commencement of this section on 14 March 2011: see Sch 2 [62] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. On reflection, however, I consider that the better and more convenient course is simply to make the adjustments to the sentencing structure created by his Honour that I have discussed, and to do so with a result that I consider appropriate on all of the evidence, including that tendered on resentence. 

64The orders that I propose will result in a total head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a total non-parole period of 3 years 7 months. The ratio will be slightly reduced from 64 per cent (the ratio created by his Honour) to just below 60 per cent. I find that special circumstances justify the variation of the statutory ratio, not the least of them being the illness of the applicant. 

65To be clear, the total sentence I propose should be regarded as carrying a marked degree of leniency with it, arising not only from the need to correct the errors that occurred at first instance, but also from the need to reflect the serious medical condition of the applicant.

Orders

66I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal allowed.

(3)Sentences with regard to sequences 1, 9, 13, and 17 quashed.

(4)With regard to sequence 1, and taking the matters on the Form 1 into account, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 1 month and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 7 months. The sentence is to date from 15 December 2011. The non-parole period expires on 14 January 2015 and the total term expires on 14 August 2016.

(5) With regard to sequence 9, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 8 months. The sentence is to date from 15 October 2012. The non-parole period expires on 14 April 2015 and the balance of the term expires on 14 December 2016.

(6)With regard to sequence 13, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of the sentence of 1 year. The sentence is to date from 15 July 2013. The non-parole period expires on 14 July 2015 and the balance of the term expires on 14 July 2016.

(7)With regard to sequence 17, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months and a balance of term of the sentence of 2 years 6 months. The sentence is to date from 15 December 2012. The non-parole period expires on 14 June 2015 and the balance of the term expires on 14 December 2017. 

(8)The first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 14 July 2015.

2762306,R v GFE38 [2013] NSWDC 202,"Judgment

1During the opening submissions on the first day of this matter, my associate had sent me a note saying that, having read the arraignment, she became aware that she knew one of the complainants. It appeared that she had had a prior, non-personal connection with one of the four complainants arising from her previous employment as a solicitor. 

2I then spoke with counsel, both the Crown and Mr Walsh for the accused, in chambers, to ensure that was not an issue for them or one of them. I suggested a course of action that my associate not be present in court when the relevant complainant gave his evidence - although it was unclear when that would be. That was done in an attempt to ensure that there were no issues in relation to that complainant, the accused or anybody else feeling embarrassed about that prior connection. I should emphasise that my associate has had no subsequent contact with the particular complainant while she has been in this position.

3This morning Mr Walsh has obtained more detailed instructions. He informs me that he has contacted Mr Boulton SC, the President of the New South Wales Bar Association on this issue. Mr Boulten SC has given Mr Walsh some advice in this matter. I am not sure what the content of that advice was but, nevertheless, Mr Walsh having considered that and his position, and having taken instructions from his client, the accused, has made an application that I disqualify myself from this hearing.

4The Crown has opposed the effect of any application which would mean that the trial could not proceed. 

5Following that application by Mr Walsh this morning, I have made arrangements to obtain the services of a different associate. The new associate is a permanent associate of one of the other judges in this Court and is with me now. My permanent associate will go and work for that other judge for the duration of this trial.

6While there is a degree of inconvenience about this, I indicated that my overall concern was the interests of justice and the interest of all the parties, including the accused. This accused needs to be confident that the matter can proceed appropriately without any ostensible or other bias and I think that the course of action that I proposed, to obtain a replacement associate, was appropriate. I took the step of calling counsel into chambers so that that course could be outlined, giving Mr Walsh the opportunity to take further instructions. He has informed me that there is no problem with that new arrangement.

7I put these remarks on record and would ask that they be taken out separately. It is not just the accused's concern - and, as I say, I understand his particular concerns in this regard from the appearance point of view - but also because it relates to the administration of the Court and possible public perceptions. 

8As far as I can ascertain in the time available, the question of apprehended bias arising out of a judge's associate's prior involvement with a party or witness in a matter, has not been considered in any authority. There is a decision of the Federal Court in John Holland Rail Pty Ltd v Comcare [2011] FCAFC 34 where the issue of communications with a judge's chambers - and particularly with an associate - is considered at [22] ff. R v Fisher [2009] VSCA 100; (2009) 22 VR 343 was a case where an associate relayed an improper communication to the judge who revoked the defendant's bail before affording him a sufficient hearing.

9The relevant issues were dealt with in John Holland Rail Pty Ltd v Comcare on the basis of the normal principles of apprehended bias, the point of principle being whether there was any improper unilateral communication to the particular judge. It is a normal part of the duties of court staff - particularly those such as associates who have a personal position reporting to a judge - to assess and manage communications directed to a judge to avoid compromising the judge's impartiality and to ensure that the principles of a fair hearing are maintained. Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39; (1986) 161 CLR 342 established similar principles in relation to court staff.

10Associates in the District Court of NSW are now employed under term contracts which vest powers of work direction for all practical purposes in the relevant judge. In a criminal trial such as this, an associate has an essential role on behalf of the presiding judge to arraign the accused, maintain court records and undertake certain specified tasks in relation to the jury. The associate is also the link point for communications between the court and practitioners. 

11An associate may have an implicit authority on behalf of a judge in at least some administrative respects. That would include, for example, being able to sign various orders and documents or certifying matters on behalf of the judge and other procedural matters. That depends on the practices and procedures of the particular court and the arrangements made with each judge. 

12From the public perspective, an associate's position necessarily involves a close working relationship between the incumbent and the respective judge. Depending on the respective personalities, qualifications, prior work experience and arrangements with each particular judge, an associate can have various kinds of input into matters of research and preparation of drafts under the particular judge's supervision. There may be a perception of influence in such circumstances which needs to be acknowledged.

13For these purposes and in this instance, I have assumed that an application to disqualify a judge by virtue of the actions (or perceptions of actions) of his or her associate - and where that associate is involved in a trial or hearing - involves the same principles as apply on an application to disqualify a judge. Those principles are set out in Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 571. Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; (2000) 201 CLR 488, as well as British American Tobacco Australia Services Limited v Laurie [2011] HCA 2; (2011) 242 CLR 283. 

14There is no actual bias at all in this instance - it is the perception that is important. Perceptions of fairness in process are all-important in this area. The interests of justice and the appearance of an uninvolved Court with no prior association with or direct knowledge of any relevant matter or person need to be emphasised. While the legal representatives may have originally agreed with my original proposal, the accused does not and, as the person primarily affected, his views need to be acknowledged.

15Accordingly - and to eliminate any issue of ostensible or apparent bias - I have taken the course I have outlined to substitute associates. As I understand it, that course is not opposed by any party. It will also mean that there will be no delays to the trial. Given that there are apparently about thirty witnesses to be called, that is an important consideration.

16The trial will continue on that basis.

2762364,R v Donna DEAVES [2013] NSWSC 1359,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Donna Deaves has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, being the unlawful killing of her daughter, Tanilla Opal Warrick-Deaves (hereinafter, ""the deceased""). The deceased was two years and eight months old at the time of her death.

2Ms Deaves (hereinafter also referred to as, ""the offender"") was, on 18 October 2011, charged with accessory after the fact to murder and, on 18 February 2012, was charged with manslaughter. On 15 August 2012, Ms Deaves was also charged with murder.

3After pleading not guilty to each of the foregoing charges as late as 18 December 2012, the separate charge for manslaughter was withdrawn and the Crown proceeded on indictment for murder, a statutory alternative to which is manslaughter, together with a charge of accessory after the fact to murder. To those two charges (i.e. murder and accessory after the fact), Ms Deaves pleaded not guilty on every occasion, including on arraignment in this Court, until, on 9 July 2013, following some discussions between the legal representatives of the offender and the Crown, Ms Deaves pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter, which plea the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment.

4The Crown, in accordance with s 35A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (hereinafter, ""the Sentencing Act""), had, during the period when the negotiations were being undertaken, consulted with the family of the victim and the relevant police officer, as a consequence of which the plea to manslaughter was accepted and the charge of accessory after the fact was no longer pressed.

Facts

5The facts, including facts not strictly relevant to the immediate offence, can be briefly stated. Those facts are agreed for the purposes of these proceedings.

6Essentially, seemingly for the purpose of discipline, the deceased was required to run laps of the lounge room, hit with objects, including an electric cord, and forced to stand in one place for extended periods. She was not the only child of the offender punished in that way. However, the deceased was under three years of age at the time that these ""punishments"" were inflicted.

7It is not suggested, in these proceedings, that the offender inflicted these ""punishments"".

8Nevertheless, by 19 July 2011, the bruising from which the deceased suffered was so significant that the deceased was kept home from day care in order to prevent the abuse being reported. The deceased did not again attend day care.

9On 25 July 2011, while out, the deceased complained that her legs were tired and she could no longer walk. The deceased was taken by the hand, lifted from the ground and struck. This caused the deceased to fly through the air, and land on the ground approximately two metres from where she was thrown. The deceased held out her arms and said, ""Pick me up; pick me up"". She was not picked up.

10Instead, she was sworn at and dragged along the street. These events occurred in a public street.

11On 25 August 2011, the deceased was required to run laps of the living room, which she was unable to complete due, on the facts presented to the Court, to exhaustion. She was hit with a hand while the offender was sitting on the lounge and able to observe this event. The deceased was hit on the head, back and backside. The deceased was dragged across the lounge room floor while being kicked in the backside. The offender, on the facts presented to the Court, sought to intervene to defer ""the punishment"".

12The striking of the deceased ceased and she was required, instead, to run more laps of the lounge room. During the course of this ""punishment"" she wet herself. At that point she was struck with an electric cord and hit numerous times in quick succession across the back and the legs for about three to four minutes.

13The deceased was taken to the bathroom and put in a cold shower. She was spluttering and crying. The offender took the deceased's siblings to the kitchen and returned to the bathroom, where she heard what, according to the facts before the Court, was the deceased's head hitting the glass of the shower. She heard that twice before she actually arrived at the bathroom. The offender heard the deceased screaming, ""No, no, no"".

14When the offender arrived at the bathroom, the deceased was being held by her wet hair. Her head was banged into the shower wall. Her mouth was bloody. The offender sought to intervene to stop the deceased being hit further.

15The deceased had the front of her head slammed into the shower screen; her body was flailing. Her body was shaking.

16The deceased was taken to the toilet and held, by her feet, with her head above the bowl. The deceased was naked, wet and shivering. The deceased looked as if she was falling asleep. The offender was told to wake her up. The deceased was grabbed and shaken and told to wake up. The offender noticed that something was ""not right"". The deceased fell to her knees and could not get up again.

17At that time, the deceased was lying on her stomach on the floor outside the bathroom. The deceased was then kicked in the lower back or backside, causing the deceased to slide across the wet floorboards, hitting the top of her head into the hall cupboards. This occurred twice.

18The offender was told to get the deceased dressed and to wake her up. On the facts before the Court in these proceedings, the offender suggested ringing an ambulance, at which time, the offender was slapped and told not to do that. Further, the offender was told that if she did, the ambulance officers and the police would be informed that the offender, Ms Deaves, occasioned the injuries to the deceased.

19The offender placed the deceased in a double stroller and put her in the offender's bedroom. The offender considered that the deceased was brain damaged due to the blows to her head, because she did not wake within a few hours. The offender stayed up watching the deceased until early morning. The deceased's breathing was intense and rattly.

20During the whole of Friday 26 August 2011, the deceased failed to regain consciousness. That morning, the offender took her other two children to deliver one of them to school and to make some purchases at a local shop.

21During the course of the day, people (family and friends) attended the house, but the deceased was hidden from them.

22In the early hours of Saturday 27 August 2011, Ms Deaves woke to use the bathroom and heard gurgling sounds coming from the deceased. The offender observed that the deceased was not breathing and that there was some vomit near her mouth, whereupon, at 4.03am, emergency services were contacted. At 4.08am an ambulance arrived. Police also attended. The deceased was conveyed to Wyong Hospital, where her death was confirmed.

23The offender was interviewed. Initially, the offender claimed that the deceased's injuries were from a number of falls from various objects.

24An autopsy was conducted on 28 August 2011. It found extensive bruising at various stages of healing to the deceased's head, torso, arms and legs. These were recent and historic bruises. The findings were that there was clear and unequivocal medical evidence of sustained physical violence of a non-accidental type, possibly up to several weeks before death. The deceased had previously been healthy, with no major medical issues. The direct cause of death was blunt force head trauma.

25On 27 September 2011, the offender gave police a comprehensive version of the events leading to the deceased's death. This version was consistent with witness accounts and other evidence gathered by police. As earlier stated, within a few weeks thereafter, the offender was arrested and charged.

26As was made clear by the Crown at the time that the plea was entered and accepted, the basis for the charge and offence of manslaughter does not relate to the early incidents of abuse. Nor does it relate to the occasioning of the injuries on 25 August 2011.

27Rather, the offence of manslaughter is based upon criminal negligence by Ms Deaves for failing to obtain medical assistance between the period immediately after the beating on 25 August 2011 and the time of death on 27 August 2011.

28The autopsy, while confirming that the cause of death was the traumatic head injuries as described earlier, also expressed the view that the deceased may well have survived if she had received prompt medical treatment and the report indicated that the greater the delay in seeking medical attention, the greater the chance was that the deceased would not survive. The failure to obtain medical treatment was a substantial cause of the death of the deceased.

29The events leading up to and including the beating on 25 August 2011 are not used by the Court to determine the objective seriousness of the offence. The offence itself relates solely to the failure to obtain medical assistance thereafter.

30Obviously, in the foregoing, there is an acceptance that there was a duty reposed in Ms Deaves, the deceased's mother, to obtain medical assistance.

Subjective circumstances

31The offender, Donna Deaves, is 29 years of age. She has given birth to four children, two of them older than the deceased and one of them younger. She was pregnant with the fourth child at the time of the commission of this offence. She gave birth in custody and the child was immediately removed from her care. All three surviving children are in foster care.

32On the material before the Court in these proceedings, there is no evidence that the offender has ever been personally violent towards any of her children. Indeed, I accept the evidence of Ms Deaves on this issue and find, on the balance of probability, that Ms Deaves has never occasioned violence toward any of her children.

33The Court has the benefit of a psychiatric report. Dr Olav Nielssen examined Ms Deaves on 11 September 2013 and reported on the same day. This was the day prior to the sentence proceedings. At that time Ms Deaves had been in custody for almost two years.

34Ms Deaves is held in a high security protection wing, the location of which is confidential and is protected under a witness protection program.

35Ms Deaves does not use drugs or alcohol. She has a family history of mental illness but has not, in the past, been adequately diagnosed.

36Ms Deaves experienced a range of traumas during her upbringing, including harassment by drug using neighbours in public housing; sexual abuse by her older half-brother at the age of seven; bullying at school; the separation of her parents; and attacks on her family home that culminated in the house being set on fire. This last mentioned event occurred when Ms Deaves was 17 years of age.

37Ms Deaves reported a suicide attempt after being raped at the age of 14. She was intoxicated at the time that the rape occurred. She suffered as a victim of another sexual assault at the age of 16.

38Ms Deaves was in contact with counsellors as a juvenile, after problems at school, and there were a number of attempts to assess her difficulties. Ms Deaves has been variously described as having borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. These were historical assessments that were reiterated by the offender during the course of her interview with Dr Nielssen.

39She had an eating disorder as a teenager, which has returned whilst she has been in custody. Ms Deaves denies ever experiencing auditory hallucinations, a belief that she can communicate by thoughts, or any of the common persecutory beliefs, and thereby denies ever experiencing symptoms that are typical of psychotic illnesses.

40Ms Deaves recites that she has been severely bashed over an extended period and on a number of occasions.

41As earlier stated, Ms Deaves does not have a current drug or alcohol abuse issue. Nevertheless, she abused alcohol in her early teenage years, which she maintains led to her being sexually assaulted at the age of 14. She has also experimented with cannabis, but did not like it.

42Other reports are available from which Dr Nielssen also obtained relevant facts associated with Ms Deaves' personal history. Ms Deaves' father is Aboriginal and her parents separated when she was seven years of age. It seems, although it is difficult to establish, that her father was physically violent towards her mother.

43Ms Deaves was involved in a number of relationships up to three years in duration. The father of her middle two children, including the deceased, is of Columbian heritage. Each of Ms Deaves' relationships has involved domestic violence against her, and, it seems, some of them against her children.

44Ms Deaves has never held paid employment and has a criminal history involving petty theft, break and enter, a malicious wounding and malicious damage to property. She has never previously been in custody, which I take into account in her favour, as warranting some, albeit limited, leniency. Her criminal history also involves resistance of police officer and the use of offensive language. Nevertheless, as earlier stated, there is no evidence to suggest that Ms Deaves has ever been abusive towards her children, including the deceased.

45Her historical diagnoses include posttraumatic stress disorder, chronic adjustment disorder with depressed mood and eating disorder.

46Dr Nielssen examined and tested Ms Deaves. He concluded that she did not appear especially depressed and her emotional state, to the extent that it was noteworthy, seemed detached. Her only emotional response was when she was speaking about the death of the deceased. Ms Deaves was correctly oriented in time and with recent events. Her attention and concentration was unimpaired and her intelligence seemed to be within the normal range assessed by her use of vocabulary, reported literacy and reasoning ability.

47Dr Nielssen was inconclusive in his diagnosis, but opined that her psychiatric issues arose from a personality disorder rather than posttraumatic stress disorder; personality disorder being a more complete explanation for Ms Deaves' presentation.

48The personality disorder may arise from an inherited vulnerability to mood disorder, the experience of a range of trauma in both childhood and adolescence, including exposure to violence, sexual abuse, homelessness and emotional neglect.

49Dr Nielssen said:

""The diagnosis of personality disorder refers to the presence of pervasive maladaptive traits, and that diagnosis could only be confirmed after observing Ms Deaves over time in less stressful circumstances. However, the personality traits that were described in detail in the assessments conducted in 2005 had been evident from adolescence and offer some explanation for why Ms Deaves formed a relationship with an abusive partner and why she was so passive in her response to his mistreatment of her child.""

50Dr Nielssen considered it difficult to offer an opinion as to Ms Deaves' prognosis or treatment and, understandably, referred to the probability that her current offence would preclude her from having care of her surviving children, but noted that it would not prevent Ms Deaves from having more children.

51Lastly, Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that:

""Ms Deaves has a range of psychological problems for which she would appear to require long term supportive counselling, as well as close supervision of her performance as the parent of any further children. Her family history of mental illness and the extensive trauma she has experienced during her upbringing suggest that she carries an increased risk of developing a severe form of depression at some stage in the future, for which she might require more intensive treatment.""

52Other than the foregoing, the fact of her Aboriginal descent is not a factor in her early childhood, at least past the age of seven.

Manslaughter

53As indicated earlier, manslaughter is an unlawful killing. The difference between manslaughter and murder involves the intention of the offender at the time that the offence occurs.

54It is difficult to envisage a duty higher than the one society imposes on a parent towards her or his child. Where, as here, the child is an infant, unable as a matter of practical and legal capacity to operate independently from her parent, that duty is at an even higher level.

55The crime of manslaughter on the basis of gross criminal negligence, in circumstances such as these, involves an omission, by Ms Deaves, that was a substantial cause of the death of the deceased, in circumstances where she owed a personal duty of care towards the deceased and failed to carry out that duty.

56The failure to carry out a duty is punishable where it can properly be characterised as ""wicked"" and deserving of punishment: R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226; Burns v R [2012] HCA 35; (2012) 246 CLR 334. In the latter case, the High Court (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ), at [97], said:

""[97] Criminal liability does not fasten on the omission to act, save in the case of an omission to do something that a person is under a legal obligation to do. As a general proposition, the law does not impose an obligation on individuals to rescue or otherwise to act to preserve human life. Such an obligation may be imposed by statute or contract or because of the relationship between individuals. The relationships of parent and child, and doctor and patient, are recognised as imposing a duty of this kind. ...""

57There is however a difference between the duty reposed in a medical practitioner and that reposed in a parent. There is a heavy and enduring responsibility that rests upon a parent to care for a child who is otherwise utterly defenceless.

58The duty that is owed and from which criminal responsibility arises is present in the relationship between any parent and a child under the age of 18. Where, as here, the child is wholly dependent upon the parent and incapable, even in the most basic manner, to fend for herself, the culpability involved in breaching the duty of care is serious and the responsibility that rests upon such a parent in those circumstances is a heavy one.

59That factor is, primarily, a factor to be taken into account in determining the criminal culpability of the offender from an objective perspective. It cannot, as well, form the basis for an aggravation of the offence under s 21A(2)(l) of the Sentencing Act. That the provisions of s 21A(2)(l) of the Sentencing Act do not apply to aggravate the offence does not detract from the significance of such a factor in relation to the assessment of objective seriousness of the offence committed.

60While the offender, Ms Deaves, initially gave police a version of events that was exculpatory of her involvement in the death of her daughter and exculpatory of any other person, the later interview, given after the arrest and detaining of the other person involved, was a significant incriminating factor in the charges against her and in the charges laid against another.

61I take into account her plea of guilty. Even though it was a plea entered far later than the earliest opportunity, it has a utilitarian value. That value is at or below the mid range of the discount ordinarily assessed, and is taken into account in the determination of the ultimate sentence, pursuant to the terms of s 22 of the Sentencing Act.

62Further, pursuant to the terms of s 23 of the Sentencing Act, I impose a lesser penalty than I would otherwise impose because of the assistance that Ms Deaves is to give, and has undertaken to give, in the prosecution of another.

63In accordance with the principles prescribed by s 23, I take into account the significance and usefulness of the assistance offered by Ms Deaves; the fact that she is willing to and has undertaken to give evidence against another in relation to the death of her daughter; the completeness and reliability of information provided; its timeliness; the fact that no other benefit (other than the possible reduction in the sentence now being imposed) is gained by Ms Deaves in giving that assistance or providing that undertaking; the fact that the conditions under which Ms Deaves will serve her custody will be more onerous as a consequence of the assistance she is now giving; the risk of injury to her as a result of the assistance; and also the fact that, on the other hand, her assistance relates to the same set of circumstances which give rise to the offence for which she is to be sentenced.

64The Court of Criminal Appeal has provided some guidance to the level of discount that may be granted for the kind of assistance offered by a person in the position of Ms Deaves. In circumstances where the custodial conditions imposed upon Ms Deaves will be more onerous, the Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated that, unless very exceptional circumstances are disclosed, a discount of more than 50 per cent should not be applied for the combined effect of the plea of guilty and assistance: see FS v R [2009] NSWCCA 301; (2009) 198 A Crim R 383 at [21], citing York v R [2005] HCA 60; (2005) 225 CLR 466; R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220; R v Pang [1999] NSWCCA 4; (1999) 105 A Crim R 474; R v M [2005] NSWCCA 224; SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249; R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151.

65The ""percentage discount"" is not a fixed tariff, but operates as a guide in assessing an appropriate range. The discount operates for both the plea of guilty and the assistance. Bearing in mind all of the factors to which I have referred, and Ms Deaves' evidence and demeanour in Court, I assess that a discount of thirty-three and one-third per cent (i.e. one-third) should apply, provided that the sentence does not fall below that which is otherwise appropriate. I also assess the value of future assistance to be 20 per cent. I take account of the principle that, even after discount, the sentence must be appropriate for the offence and offender.

66The difficulty, in a case such as this, is assessing objective culpability. I take into account that, on the Crown case, there is no intention to inflict injury, even of a minor kind.

67I also take account of the circumstances, on the facts agreed before the Court, of Ms Deaves' initial inclination to contact emergency services and the reaction to it. I take that into account to the credit of the offender.

68Nevertheless, this is an extremely serious offence, the nature of which has been described in full. Rightly, society regards this neglect as heinous and worthy of punishment. A sentence other than full time custody would be inappropriate.

69I have taken into account the range of sentences that have been imposed for offences of like kind. It has often been said, by me and others, that manslaughter involves the greatest range of circumstances.

70Sentencing statistics, in the circumstances of manslaughter, are of limited utility. The range of culpability and the range of circumstances that give rise to manslaughter are so varied that any judicial officer must be extremely careful in applying, or relying on, such statistics to assess a range for the offence in question. Circumstances where a parent is criminally responsible for the death of her or his child do not, thankfully, occur so frequently to make it possible to deduce a pattern of sentencing from past cases.

71I have, notwithstanding the limited reliability of statistics in this area, had regard to the cases to which the Crown has referred me. The range is, even in relation to parents who are criminally responsible for the killing of their children, extremely wide. Yet none seem adequately to meet these circumstances.

72Some of those cases relate to misguided and irrational belief in the power of God or religion, in home remedies or in sheer ignorance. The offence becomes a particularly serious one where, as here, it relates to an injury inflicted by another, in circumstances where the parent realises the seriousness of the injury that has been inflicted, and when the age and helplessness of the child are considered.

73As stated, I take account of the circumstance that there is not alleged to be any intention to injure. However, I do not consider that that, in these limited circumstances, is the end of the story. This offence is much more serious than a number that would have been occasioned by an intention to injure or by some other unlawful act. I consider that the objective seriousness of the offence is not in the worst category, requiring the maximum sentence, but it is well above the mid range, and approaching the worst category.

74I take into account the subjective circumstances to which I have referred. In particular, I take into account the psychiatric issues seemingly caused by the early abuse of Ms Deaves, which, it seems, has given rise to her willingness to participate in an abusive relationship. I accept, on the balance of probabilities, the diagnosis of personality disorder probably arising from trauma. It is notorious that childhood abuse has, without significant treatment, life-long effects on self-esteem, self-worth and disempowerment usually as a result of consequential personality disorder or PTSD. 

75Nevertheless, a point arises where society must insist upon a parent taking responsibility for a child, notwithstanding the personal psychiatric issues with which that parent is faced. There is no doubt, in my mind, that Ms Deaves felt helpless, in part because of the psychiatric issues to which I have referred. Nevertheless, she had the courage to stand up to abuse in an earlier relationship and should have had the courage to take her child to the hospital.

76I accept that, with the plea of guilty, and in the evidence given in the Court, Ms Deaves has displayed a degree of remorse. I accept that the expression of remorse in this Court tended to centre on the effect of the offence on Ms Deaves herself. However, I consider that that may have been as much a failure of language and expression as it was a true assessment of her feelings. Nevertheless, her explanations for the reasons for her failure to seek medical assistance were inconsistent.

77Notwithstanding that view as to Ms Deaves' remorse, I do not consider her remorse to be at the highest level, because of its expression in terms of the effect on Ms Deaves herself, rather than on the helpless child who depended on her. She has prospects for rehabilitation, which would rise to a reasonable level if her personality disorder were properly treated. General and specific deterrence are necessary, but not overly significant, factors. 

78A death such as this is tragic. Society views the taking of human life as a most serious offence.

79I accept that the effect of this on the other family of the deceased is horrific. It is an event which would be difficult to overcome or forget.

80Sentencing is an intuitive process. Its objects are set out in s 3A of the Sentencing Act. Sentencing involves the resolution of conflicting goals: protection of society; deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend; retribution; and, reform. These goals overlap and cannot be considered in isolation from each other; often they point in different directions: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476. Sentencing is, and must remain, an intuitive process.

81The starting point is the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case and an understanding that the offence involves the taking of a human life, wholly dependent upon the offender. As earlier stated, this is a case that approaches the worst category. The maximum sentence imposed by the legislature is 25 years' imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.

82In all of the circumstances, and before the discount for the plea of guilty and assistance to which reference has been made, I consider an appropriate starting point, taking into account both objective and subjective circumstances, to be 18 years' imprisonment. I do not find special circumstances and consider the time during which Ms Deaves is eligible for parole to be sufficient.

83One other matter should be the subject of comment, although it bears no significance in the determination of the sentence to be imposed. Between 19 July 2011 and 25 July 2011, the house in which the deceased was then living, and in which she sustained serious and visible injuries, was visited by government officers.

84This Court regularly deals with the determination of the reasonableness or otherwise of the conduct of government officers in the care of children thought to be at risk. Other courts deal daily with disputes as to the custody of children. Removing a child from a parent or parents is never an easy task and I do not underestimate the difficulty that attends decision-making where the best interests of the child may be productive of competing considerations.

85The Court is also aware of the extent to which schools, pre-schools and day care centres are regulated for health and safety concerns with extraordinary particularity, sometimes by the same departments that have responsibility for overseeing the safety of children in their parents' homes.

86There appears to me however to be a dangerous imbalance between the allocation of scarce enough resources that are committed to ensuring compliance with space considerations in community based child care centres, while children who are exposed to grave injury in their own homes are not identified and steps taken to address the risk.

87The foregoing does not diminish the criminal liability of those who inflict injury on children or those who fail to ensure that appropriate medical treatment is afforded children who are injured in this way. Nor is the foregoing intended as a criticism of any particular officer of the government and certainly not of any Minister of Government. It is, perhaps, the result of human nature that it is easier to deal with responsible people than it is to put resources into dealing with irresponsible people. However, it does warrant emphasising that the death of this child could have been avoided by the intervention of departmental officers or by family members.

88What remains is the unavoidable reality that medical attention was not provided to the injured child and criminal responsibility must be attributed in accordance with the law. Nevertheless, responsibility must be taken in part more broadly by society, without diminishing the level of responsibility of those most obviously responsible for the acts or omissions that were a substantial cause of the death of this child.

Sentence

89Donna Deaves, please rise.

90You are convicted of manslaughter in that you did unlawfully kill your daughter, Tanilla Warrick-Deaves, on or about 27 August 2011 in that you did not seek medical assistance for her, knowing her to be in need of that assistance. I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 9 years, commencing on the date of your arrest, 18 October 2011, and concluding on 17 October 2020, and a balance of term being a further 3 years, expiring on 17 October 2023.

91You are first eligible for release on 17 October 2020.

2762383,R v Bretherton [2013] NSWSC 1339,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The offender was found guilty by a jury on 6 September 2013 following a two-week trial in Newcastle of the murder of Jodie Jurd on 16 November 2011. The Crown had refused to accept the offender's earlier plea of guilty to her manslaughter. 

2Except in minor and insignificant respects, there was no dispute about the facts. The offender conceded that the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt all of the necessary elements of the offence of murder with the faint exception of an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. He gave notice that he intended to raise and to rely upon the partial defence of substantial impairment. The trial was therefore conducted in essence upon the basis of a single issue of whether or not the offender had established on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the acts causing the death of Jodie Jurd, his capacity to understand events or to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.

3The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In the event that a determinate sentence is imposed, a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies. In proceeding to determine the appropriate sentence, I am not required to commence by considering whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period of 20 years. Similarly, I am not required to make an assessment of whether or not the offence is within the mid range of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]). The relevant statutory provisions generally, and the provisions of ss 55B(2), 54B(3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in particular, require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a judgment is reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]). The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27] and [31]).

Circumstances of the offence

4The undisputed facts, which I find beyond reasonable doubt, are as follows.

5The offender and the deceased had been in a relationship for approximately ten years. During that time they had separated and reconciled on a number of occasions. The most recent period of separation commenced in October 2010. In May 2011, they decided to try to resurrect their relationship.

6At the time of the offence, the offender and the deceased were seeing a counsellor. The deceased was still residing at a property at Bellbird Heights that they jointly owned, while the offender was living at Telarah. He stayed regularly at the Bellbird Heights address as the house was on the market and he was doing work around the property. It was sold on 8 November 2011. Settlement was due on 13 December 2011.

7There had been ongoing arguments between the deceased and the offender about a property settlement. They also jointly owned a house in Queensland. It had been proposed that the offender would keep the proceeds of the sale of the Queensland house and the deceased would keep the proceeds of the sale of the Bellbird house. However the offender was not content with that arrangement and wished to revisit it during the week preceding the offence.

8The relationship was characterised by the offender's intense jealousy of the deceased's close relationship with her family. This was referred to in evidence during the trial as a feud, although that description is not entirely apposite. The offender apparently continually sought to limit the frequency of the deceased's contact with them, as he did not like her talking to members of her family on the phone or visiting them as she wanted. There was some evidence that the offender had been physically violent to the deceased during the course of their relationship. She complained to several witnesses that he had hit her, kicked her and slapped her, and that it was worse when he was drinking.

9At about 7:35pm on 16 November 2011, the next door neighbour was outside her house having just arrived home from work. She heard loud voices of the offender and the deceased and loud banging coming from their house. She described hearing the deceased screaming hysterically. She ran inside and called ""000"" telling the operator that she was very frightened for the deceased and admitted she had heard similar things on previous occasions.

10Inside the house, the offender had also called ""000"". He told the operator that the deceased at that stage was bleeding, but still breathing. He was told to obtain a cloth or towel. He was asked if ""the offender"" was still nearby and he replied, ""Yes"". He was also asked if he knew who that person was. He replied ""Yeah me"". He told the operator the deceased had been stabbed several times in the chest and abdomen.

11Police arrived around 7:55pm. Constable Nicholson had drawn his taser and the camera device was active. On entering the house the police found the deceased in the main bedroom. She was lying on her side. The offender was kneeling beside her body. The floor was stained with a large quantity of blood. Constable Rowe asked, ""Fucking hell, who did this?"" The offender calmly replied, ""It was me"". Police directed him to move away from the body and lie face down on the ground. He told police that the knife he used was at the feet of the deceased. He appeared calm and responsive.

12Ambulance personnel arrived but due to the extent of blood loss were unable to revive the deceased. A crime scene was declared. There was physical evidence of a violent struggle, including holes to walls and a quantity of blood. The deceased suffered 12 stab wounds, four to her back, seven to her torso, and one to her cheek. There were additionally defensive wounds to her hands and fingers. One of her fingers had been dislocated. Only two of the wounds were capable of causing death.

Additional findings of fact

13It is difficult, if not impossible, to know precisely or even generally what it was that precipitated the offender's violent and fatal attack upon the deceased. As already indicated, they had been in a long-term relationship, which had recently come to an end. They were in the process of extricating themselves from the proprietary and monetary circumstances that linked them, and had each engaged solicitors for that purpose. There was some ongoing tension between them that was apparently connected to the uncertain conclusion of their mutual affairs, but there had been no indication that it would or might lead to violence of any sort. Nothing in the evidence contained the slightest foreboding of what ultimately occurred.

14The offender did not give evidence at the trial or at the sentencing hearing. The only subjective insight into what may have motivated him must therefore be gleaned from his reports to medical practitioners qualified for the purposes of the proceedings, in particular with respect to the partial defence of substantial impairment.

15The offender gave a history to Dr Canaris when first interviewed by him. It is recorded on pages 11-12 of Dr Canaris's 20 August 2012 report in the following terms:

""At the time the [offender] was living in Maitland. I gather he was together with his wife who asked him 'if we could go down the road' and 'get some tea'. He had not wanted to go to Cessnock 'in case I saw her family'. He drove to Rutherford near Maitland to get some food thinking all the while 'this is wrong buddy, I'm staying out of town to avoid the feud' - I came back to Bellbird - I had a few beers - Jodie put the tea on - I was having a few beers - I was just relaxing - she came in and said, 'I want to talk to you - what do we do with the money from the sale of the place' - I just said it goes fifty-fifty - then a huge argument started just about everything in the relationship - she said she wanted nothing to do with my family - I said what do we do about my family - I don't know how long the argument went on for - I tried to ring her parents to sort things out - I couldn't get on to them - I've walked into the bedroom - it's back and forth - by this stage I was really fuming - she said something to me - I don't know what she said - I came to - I got a knife and I was stabbing her - [I thought] what the fuck do I do - there was a big spurt of blood coming out of her stomach - I rang 000...I gone back to try and help her...""

16It is evident from the jury's verdict that they were satisfied that the offender was capable of forming an intention either to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm. The offender does not contest for present purposes that it was clearly open to the jury to find him guilty of murder upon the basis of either intention. However, both counsel conceded that the only material that informed a choice between the two was to be found in the physical circumstances that surrounded the death. That is so even despite the (limited) additional detail contained in the offender's account to Dr Canaris.

17It was submitted by counsel for the offender that whereas the stab wounds were self evidently numerous, and the attack in the course of which they were inflicted was frenzied, the intent was consistent with an intention only to inflict grievous bodily harm and that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill the deceased. The submission was in essence to the effect that the choice available upon the evidence was between two competing possibilities of equal probability and that in the absence of any material persuasively favouring one above the other, I could not find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender stabbed the deceased with the intention to kill her.

18That submission was supported by the (not altogether settled) proposition that an offence involving an intention to kill is generally more serious than one involving only an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. I briefly examined the different possible views about this issue in R v Kristi Anne Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952 at [25] - [27]. Accordingly, on the basis of what was said by the High Court of Australia in Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14], citing R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, as findings of fact made against an offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt, any reasonable doubt must be resolved in favour of the offender. The practical effect of that approach, if an intention to kill is generally to be regarded as more serious than one involving only an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, would therefore oblige me in this case to sentence the offender upon a view of the facts most favourable to him, or relevantly for present purposes, upon the basis that he killed the deceased with no more than an intention to cause grievous bodily harm.

19I am therefore unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender relevantly formed an intention to kill the deceased. Put another way, I am unable to find, consistently with the jury's verdict, that the offender killed the deceased with any greater intention than to inflict grievous bodily harm. I would hasten to add, however, having regard to the violent and sustained nature of the offender's attack upon the deceased, that the difference between the level of seriousness of the offence of murder committed with at least an intention to cause grievous bodily harm and the level of seriousness of the same crime committed with an intention to kill, is in the particular circumstances of this case only slight.

20I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities and I find, consistently with the jury's verdict, that at the time the offender killed the deceased he was suffering from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his capacity either to understand events or to control himself. Whereas it is once again not possible to be certain, it seems to me, having regard to the medical evidence, that the jury's verdict was more probably than not the product of a disinclination to apply the community standards test in favour of the offender, so as to reduce the verdict from murder to manslaughter, rather than an anterior rejection of a substantial impairment by reason of an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. Howsoever the jury may have reasoned in fact, which is of course completely irrelevant in the present context, their ultimate conclusion is on the evidence wholly consistent with a finding that the offender suffered from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his capacity to understand events or to control himself. In summary I find that the jury could not, acting reasonably, have rejected the offender's medical history or the opinions of the experts. The jury must have accepted that an application of community standards did not permit them to reduce the offender's liability from murder to manslaughter.

21There appears to be no medical contest that the offender was suffering from depression at the time of the killing and had been suffering from that condition for at least a short period prior thereto. He had been prescribed medication for it. There is a dispute about whether the offender was suffering from mild depression, which Dr Skinner favoured, or something more serious, which Dr Canaris favoured.

22In this respect Dr Skinner expressed the opinion in her principal report that it was ""probable that [the offender's] judgment and decision making was impaired by depressive illness, further complicated by the use of alcohol."" Dr Skinner indicated in a supplementary report that by ""judgment"" she meant the act of comparing and evaluating choices to decide on a course of action. Dr Skinner went on to say that persons suffering from depression have pervasive alterations of mood so that they perceive events in a negative light, out of proportion to the situation. Their judgment may be compromised by their mood state so that they are less able to understand a situation correctly and to act appropriately. The use of alcohol compounds the situation and may lead to impairment of the ability to behave in an appropriate and mature manner.

23Dr Skinner had earlier expressed the following opinion about the offender:

""I consider that Mr Bretherton has an obsessional-compulsive personality style characterised by preoccupation with orderliness. This is demonstrated by his own account of his lifestyle and by his diary. He has a rigid personality style with inflexible ideas and is concerned about maintaining control. I believe that Mr Bretherton's personality is better described as obsessional-compulsive personality style. I do not consider that he meets the criteria for diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder.""

24Dr Skinner went on to say this:

""In my opinion Mr Bretherton might have a defence at law available to him, based on the diagnosis of depression that he suffered from about October 2010 or earlier. According to the history provided by him and supported by the counselling records, he would have been depressed around the time of the alleged offences. He was experiencing multiple stressors...He attended counselling. He consulted his general practitioner who prescribed anti-depressant medication. It is probable that his judgment and decision making was impaired by his depressive illness, further complicated by the use of alcohol.""

25Dr Canaris provided a very long report and gave evidence at the trial consistently with what he had written. He offered the following summary:

""To summarise, I believe that [the offender] suffers from lifelong Asperger's disorder with current comorbid major depressive disorder. His major depressive disorder is currently in partial remission. However, it was very likely active at the time of the killing. There is evidence at the time of the killing of comorbid alcohol abuse and possible dependence though this is clearly in remission if for no other reason than the fact that he has no access to alcohol in gaol. He warrants further testing to exclude frontal/executive cognitive impairment arising from perinatal brain injury and/or alcohol related brain damage.""

26Having regard to my earlier finding on the balance of probabilities and consistently with the jury's verdict, that at the time the offender killed the deceased he was suffering from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his capacity either to understand events or to control himself, I also find that the underlying condition that had that result was depression associated with an obsessive-compulsive personality style. I am unable to be satisfied that the offender also suffered from an autism spectrum disorder or that any such disorder, even if it existed, substantially impaired his capacity either to understand events or to control himself. 

27I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities and I find, consistently with the jury's verdict, that even though at the time the offender was intoxicated when he killed the deceased, the effects of that intoxication were not such as to deprive him of the availability of the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. He had consumed ""five or six beers"" and a tumbler of wine. His call to the ""000"" operator is in evidence, as is his reaction to the police when they entered the bedroom following the stabbing. The evidence otherwise reveals that the offender was able to respond to the operator's advice to use a towel for the purpose of attempting to staunch the flow of blood from the wounds that had been inflicted. The evidence from the police that the offender was moderately affected by the consumption of alcohol is on the one hand not capable of scientific verification or elucidation by reference to either an analysis of the offender's blood alcohol content at the time or scientific opinion of what would have been the likely effect upon him of the consumption of an established or assumed quantity of alcohol. On the other hand, the description ""moderately affected by alcohol"" does not foreclose the possibility that any impairment of the offender's capacity to understand events or to control himself was the result of the underlying condition or conditions that I have found he had.

Subjective matters

28The offender would appear to have had a less than happy childhood. He was born in Gosford on17 April 1975 and was accordingly 38 years of age at the time of his trial and 36 years of age at the time of the offence. He attended Kanwal Public School until Year 3. He then moved to Sydney and attended Ermington Public School and later Marist Brothers in Parramatta. He finished school at St Patrick's College in Dundas in Year 10.

29The offender had a history of learning difficulties although he was mostly managed in the mainstream classes, apart from a period in a slow class in Years 4 and 5. He is able to read and write. He was required to see the school counsellor on occasions throughout his school career. He described being bullied at school and having very few friends.

30The offender's parents separated during his early childhood and divorced when he was aged about seven or eight years of age. He has little if any contact with either of his parents. He denied being exposed to domestic violence or other major problems in his family. He reported a history of sexual abuse to Dr Canaris.

31He worked as an apprentice plumber with his father after leaving school at the age of 16 years. He continued to work in that trade until the age of 21, when he moved to Queensland for a period of about four years. He has since lived in Cessnock and the surrounding areas since the age of 26 years. He described himself as a good worker, although he sometimes had some problems fitting in with workmates.

32His first relationship was at around the age of 18 years in Queensland. He had had a few other relationships before he met the deceased in about 2001. His relationship with her, and with her family, was fraught with difficulties, to which further reference is made later in these reasons.

33The offender has had a significant alcohol habit throughout his early twenties and thirties, including up to the date of the offence. He drank on average six beers per day, sometimes also drinking a bottle of wine at the same time. He occasionally went on drinking binges of up to 20 beers at a time. He was not a smoker or a user of illicit drugs.

34The offender's sister Toni Dibb gave evidence at the trial. She is six years older than him and lives in Sydney. She had also provided Dr Canaris with a history that partly formed the basis of his diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder. Ms Dibb spoke of how the offender had no friends as a child. No one would come to their house to play and the offender would not go to other children's homes either. 

35Ms Dibb's recollection of the offender in recent times included what she considered amounted to an obsession with the deceased's family. Whatever may have been the genesis of the problem, the offender was unable to speak to his sister without at some point raising that issue. It was a matter that he was clearly unable to let go of or to resolve. Whether the offender's issues with the deceased's family were a function of his own personality or their response to it is not easy to discern.

36In this last respect it should be observed that members of the deceased's family also found him to be different. The deceased's parents and her brother gave evidence at the trial concerning specific incidents involving the deceased in which his reactions to ordinary situations and social settings appeared to be completely inappropriate. There is no doubt that the deceased's family found it hard to get close to the offender. The reverse was also true.

37The respective diaries of the offender and the deceased cast some light upon the difficulties that existed between them. The offender appears constantly to be controlling the deceased, or attempting to do so, by removing the SIM card from her phone so that she could not call her family when they were on vacation and by attempting to restrict her visits with them at other times. The deceased's frustrations at all of this emerge clearly from her writings and complaints to friends about the offender and his never-ending ruminations about her family. This obsession appears from material tendered on sentence from the prison chaplaincy service to be continuing right up to the present time.

38All of this notwithstanding, the offender would appear to have engaged successfully in continuous employment in difficult and important work in various capacities within the mining industry. This includes working on continuous miners, road headers, shuttle cars, Eimco loaders and similar plant at various mines in New South Wales for approximately ten years prior to his arrest. The offender and the deceased were together throughout the same period. 

Mitigating factors

39The offence was not part of any planned or organised criminal activity. It would appear to have been a spontaneous uncontrolled over-reaction to a domestic dispute that was to all outward appearances being handled in an ordered fashion by the solicitors engaged by the deceased and the offender. I do not accept the fact that the offender appears to have gone to the kitchen to obtain the knife used in the fatal attack operates to modify that conclusion in any way. 

40The offender does not have any record of prior convictions. The Crown contended that he could not, however, be considered to be a person of good character to the extent that the evidence suggests that he had been violent towards the deceased on earlier isolated occasions. I note that despite complaints by the deceased that the offender had occasionally physically mistreated her, this would appear never to have resulted in a complaint to the police or, as far as the evidence goes, to have been observed or detected by the deceased's family. Without in any way wishing to derogate from the seriousness and unacceptability of any form of domestic violence, the evidence is relatively scant, and not sufficient to deprive the offender of a finding that he was otherwise a person of good character.

41I am unable to find that the offender is unlikely to reoffend or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. Correspondingly, I am unable to find that he is likely to reoffend or that his prospects of rehabilitation are poor. The somewhat enigmatic nature of the subject offence, committed against a background of the offender's mental condition, makes any prediction about these matters particularly speculative and of little value.

42An offender's remorse is available to be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor but only if he has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions. There is no doubt that the offender has admitted responsibility for the physical acts that killed the deceased. He has not provided evidence that explains what he did or why he did it. The offender did not choose to give evidence at the sentencing proceedings, which might have informed these outstanding questions. It is not possible in such circumstances for me to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has shown or demonstrated any remorse at all. In forming that view I have taken into account the fact that the offender reported the matter to the police immediately and has not sought to deny his involvement in the death of the deceased. His plea of guilty to manslaughter is a formal manifestation of that.

43I should also observe that the offender's ability to show or to express contrition or remorse is likely to have been significantly impeded by the personality traits and characteristics that the evidence so clearly described. One of those was the medical opinion that the offender was unable to identify with or understand any point of view that was different to his own. He was found to have a fixed and rigid approach to ideas and concepts and was inflexible in his attitudes and interactions with others. The so-called feud with the deceased's family was one obvious manifestation of that personality style. It would not surprise me if his plea of not guilty to the murder of the deceased, in the face of what on any view was a very strong Crown case, were another. If genuine remorse includes the recognition and acceptance of the damage caused to others by a person's actions, it is probably absent in this offender. However, even though such an absence of remorse is not an aggravating factor, it is nevertheless important in the offender's case that his apparent lack of it is not misunderstood and thereby improperly counted against him.

44The offender is also entitled to the benefit of s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by his conduct at trial. The case was effectively conducted around the single issue of substantial impairment by reason of abnormality of mind. That had the consequence of limiting the issues upon which evidence was required, the number of witnesses that needed to be called, the length of the trial as a consequence, as well as the time needed for addresses to the jury and my summing up.

Aggravating factors

45I do not consider that the offence was accompanied by any special aggravating factors that are not otherwise subsumed within the offence itself. The fact that the offence took place in the home of the deceased does not in the present case operate as an aggravating feature of the offence. The Crown contended that the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the deceased and that the offence was aggravated as a result. I do not accept that submission. 

Objective seriousness

46Having regard to all relevant factors, I consider that this offence falls to be considered as slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type.

Special circumstances

47I do not consider that there are any special circumstances that support a variation of the statutory ratio between parole and non-parole periods. Having regard to the length of the sentence that I propose, the period during which the offender will be supervised on parole will be more than adequate to accommodate any particular issues requiring attention. I include in that category any matters that relate to the offender's personality disorder or depression. The former is likely to be ever present and the latter seems historically at least capable of responding favourably to medication.

Deterrence

48There is necessarily considerable tension between the concepts of special and general deterrence on the one hand and offences with the particular characteristics of the subject offence on the other hand. A murder committed in circumstances of an apparent and spontaneous loss of control, such as here, does not confidently invite a conclusion that the offender ever contemplated the possible or likely consequences of his actions at the time or at any time beforehand. It is therefore difficult to see how a similar uncontrolled response to equivalent influences or events in the future is likely to be moderated or constrained by some quiet but timely reflection upon the prospect of a return to prison. 

49Having said as much, I accept that public denunciation of crimes of this type is important. I have taken the need for deterrence into account in forming my views on what is a proper sentence in this case. However, while it is always a question of degree, general and specific deterrence play a lesser role in sentencing offenders with a mental condition: R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; R v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244; R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228; DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177].

Comparable decisions

50I was very helpfully referred by counsel for the offender to a comprehensive list of comparable cases. I have had regard to that list, particularly R v Toki [2003] NSWCCA 125 and to the equally helpful review of a series of decisions contained in the judgment of Hidden J. 

Victim impact statement

51A victim impact statement from the deceased's mother was read aloud by her to the Court. She spoke of her own reaction to the death, as well as that of the extended family. All of these people would appear to be labouring with the burden of grief in various and personal ways. The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for them and the rest of the family. Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of her family and friends who remember her. I am, however, mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them.

Consideration

52The murder of the deceased was violent and unpremeditated. The events surrounding her death suggest an unexpected and largely unexplained loss of self-control, probably associated with anger provoked by disagreement about unresolved financial issues emerging as a consequence of the end of a long-term relationship. It was an isolated incident, even though the evidence suggests prior examples of low-level violence from time to time throughout the relationship. However, the death of the deceased does not appear to represent the culmination of escalating violent conduct on the offender's part. 

53Also necessarily to be factored into any consideration of these tragic events is the part played by the offender's mental condition. At one level I can well understand and accept that those close to the deceased who survive to endure the loss of their loved one might feel less than sympathetic to the notion that the offender should receive any benefit in these proceedings from his underlying mental condition. From their point of view, the offender's actions are unforgivable and he should be dealt with accordingly. On the other hand, there is potentially some solace to be found in the fact that the acts that killed the deceased are only explicable as a significant departure from normal behaviour, arguably the result of some supervening medical condition, and that any explanation for them is better than a painful and unending vacuum of uncertainty. 

54The evidence from Dr Skinner makes it clear that the offender's judgment and decision-making were probably impaired at the time he killed the deceased. To the same effect, Dr Canaris was of the opinion that the offender's depressive illness was very likely active at the time of the killing. Even though the jury rejected the offender's defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, it does not follow that I am not entitled to find from the evidence, as I have, the existence of some impairment of the offender's responsibility or culpability for his actions short of that which a defence pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 requires.

55I note in this respect the comments of Smart AJ in R v Cheatham [2002] NSWCCA 360. That was a case in which the offender unsuccessfully sought to appeal against a sentence of 24 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 16 years, that he received for murdering his wife. At [134] his Honour said the following:

""[134] At the forefront of any consideration of penalty must be the murders of the appellant's wife and elder daughter and his wounding of his younger daughter with intent to murder her and the savagery of what he did. The appellant failed to satisfy the jury that his abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental responsibility. However, allowance has to be made for the abnormality of mind from which he was suffering and that but for this it is unlikely the stabbings would have taken place.""

56It does not appear to me to be surprising that the partial defence raised by the offender did not succeed in this case. I can well understand why a jury might have considered that the impairment by abnormality of mind afflicting the offender was not so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. That does not, however, detract from the significance of my finding, based upon the whole of the evidence, including the learned opinions of the psychiatrists on both sides, that the offender was suffering from an abnormality of mind for which some appropriate allowance must be made in arriving at a proper sentence. I am equally satisfied that, but for his abnormality of mind, it is unlikely the stabbing of the deceased would have taken place.

Sentence

57Robert Bretherton, for the murder of Jodie Jurd you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 21 years with a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months commencing on 16 November 2011 expiring on 15 August 2027 with a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months commencing on 16 August 2027 expiring on 15 November 2032.

2762386,R v Robert Martin HICKS [2013] NSWSC 1324,"Judgment
Introduction
1On 3 May 2013 the offender Robert Martin Hicks pleaded guilty to the offence of murder, committed on 10 August 2011.  The victim was Patricia Newman, with whom he was then in a relationship.  The offender was arrested at the scene and charged with Ms Newman's murder.  On 31 August 2012 he was committed for trial.  On 2 November 2012 he was arraigned on the present indictment and pleaded not guilty.  A trial date of 20 May 2013 was fixed.  On 15 April 2013 the offender's solicitor informed the Crown that he would plead guilty to murder and, on 3 May 2013, on re-arraignment he did so.  He adhered to that plea when the matter came before me for sentence on 2 August 2013.  
2The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life and it carries a prescribed non-parole period of 20 years: s 19A(1), Crimes Act 1900, Table in Div 1A of Pt 4, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
Facts 
3Tendered on the sentence proceedings was an agreed statement of facts.  The following account is taken from that document.  
4In 2011 Ms Newman lived in a unit of a building in Lalor Park with her son.  The offender, with whom she was in a relationship, lived in another unit in the same building.  Both were regular users of illegal drugs.  In the course of the relationship, neighbours stated that they frequently heard arguments between the couple.  There were also reported incidents of domestic violence.  
5At about 9am on Wednesday 10 August 2011 a neighbour saw Ms Newman enter the offender's unit and, shortly afterwards, heard them as they left, obviously discussing drugs which Ms Newman had obtained.  About half an hour later the couple went to Ms Newman's unit and then, accompanied by Ms Newman's son, they walked together to the nearby shops.  After Mr Newman withdrew some money and gave it to his mother for rent he left the pair together.  He said they had not been arguing whilst he was with them that morning and they ""seemed to be fine"".  However, it appears that the couple were arguing when they left the offender's unit.  Sometime later, after they returned, a neighbour heard Ms Newman scream loudly from within the unit.  It was about 11am.  The offender was heard yelling, ""Help, Help"".  
6A neighbour had heard the couple yelling from inside the offender's unit.  He heard the offender yell, ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry"".  He heard Ms Newman yell, ""Look what you've fucking done"".  He saw the offender run from the unit waving his arms and saying, ""Can you ring the ambulance, can you ring the ambulance"".  The neighbour called triple zero.  He saw the offender walk out with Ms Newman holding her under her right arm before they both fell to the ground.  She appeared unconscious with blood squirting from her neck.  Neighbours ran outside and saw Ms Newman lying on the ground on her back and the offender kneeling next to her.  He had blood around his mouth and on his hands and appeared to be panicked.  The offender said, ""I'm losing her.  She fell on the glass coffee table"".  He attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, blowing into Ms Newman's mouth.  He said, ""I'm losing her, I'm losing her"".  A neighbour assisted the offender to perform CPR on Ms Newman until police arrived at the scene shortly after, at about 11.14am.  Ms Newman was then lying on her back.  She did not appear to be conscious or breathing.  Two minutes later the ambulance officer arrived.  Ms Newman was unconscious and unresponsive with a large amount of blood coming from her nose and mouth.  The ambulance officer noticed a large cut to the base of her neck.  Ms Newman had a faint pulse and the officer continued with CPR.  A retrieval specialist with Care Flight arrived at the scene by helicopter at 11.35am.  However, despite performing an open thoracostomy, he was unable to revive Ms Newman and she was declared dead at the scene at 11.47am.  
7One of the police officers spoke to the offender when he arrived at the scene.  He appeared upset and said, ""Help her, help her.  She fell and hit her head on the table, she fell, help her"".  On entering the offender's unit, the police found a large serrated knife with the blade about 15 to 20 centimetres in length lying on the floor in the main room.  There appeared to be blood on the tip of the blade. The offender told the officer that Ms Newman had ""a point of speed and some cones.  I've had a point"".  
8Another officer reported that, when he arrived at the scene, the offender was beside the victim screaming incoherently and crying.  That officer arrested the offender and cautioned him.  The offender said - 
""Is she all right? Is she allright?  I had her by the shoulders, she lunged towards me.  I blacked out and that is when I saw the bleeding.  I woke up and I had the knife in my hand.  When I came to I've seen the hole in her throat.  I was under the influence of drugs and speed.  It was drug induced.""  
The offender also said - 
""We were having an argument and I grabbed the knife and said I was going outside to cuts some plants and she lunged at me and it went in.  I never went this like this (waving his arm in a striking motion at shoulder height)... I tried to revive her but nothing worked.""
9To a more senior officer at the scene, the offender said - 
""We got into a rage and I had the, I had a knife in my hand and I explained to her that I was gunna go outside and fix up some of the plants 'cause I needed to cut off branches and stuff but I really didn't get that far into it.  Well, I grabbed her by the shoulders and started shaking her but I had the knife in the other hand - Prior to that, I went black, blacked out.  Now when I blacked out I must have - I blacked out which is probably where I - letting her go during my little blacking out and I came to and found her on the floor - bleeding and I just panicked and started helping her but after that but - prior to shaking her I don't remember anything after that.  I was just grabbing her like by the shoulders and were sort of shakin each other and prior to, to that happening, she lunged over towards me, like in my direction and l blacked out - you know because I had the knife in me hand - knowing that I had the knife in my hand - I push her back and that's when I remember coming to and seeing her on the ground.""
The offender was visibly distressed at this time.  
10When the offender was taken to the police station he participated in a recorded interview.  This was summarised in the agreed facts as follows - 
""He was asked about his relationship to Ms Newman and said, ""Um, boyfriend, girlfriend um, more she'd stay for, like, two nights and then go back to her place, and this happened for, like, a bit over a year, that sort of relationship um, and very close to each other.   Um, I loved her more than anything, you know"".
He told police that earlier that morning Ms Newman had purchased some ""gas"" (speed) and they had then returned to the unit to administer it.  Ms Newman prepared the drug and Mr Hicks used a needle to inject both Ms Newman and himself.  Shortly afterwards they argued over the drug, ""about whose half was bigger and that, you know, usual drug argument...""  Ms Newman accused him of ""ripping her off"" and they ""both started shouting at each other"", Mr Hicks stated that he then went into the kitchen and grabbed a knife.  He said that he wanted to avoid an argument with Ms Newman and got the knife to prune back some pot plants that were outside his unit.  Mr Hicks said that he returned to the lounge area and the argument continued.  He said that he didn't want to be part of the argument and he shook Ms Newman and pushed her onto the bed, Ms Newman then got up and started, ""abusing me and lunged towards me"". Mr Hicks said that, ""the blade was facin' like that.  The handle was comin' through there, through my thumb like that, right, and as she's, she's come at me, I'm shakin' her, all right.  As she's coming towards me, I've blacked out, it's obviously accidentally went in her neck"". Mr Hicks said that when he ""came to"" he saw blood on the knife, dropped it and tried to help Ms Newman, ""the best that I could"".
When told by Police that Ms Newman was dead, Mr Hicks became emotional and the interview was suspended and then concluded.""
11On autopsy the cause of death was identified as a stab wound to the left subclavian artery.  This injury was to the left side of the base of the neck above the level of the collarbone and passed downwards and towards the back, about 25 millimetres wide and at least 90 millimetres deep.   Toxicological testing of blood samples taken from Ms Newman revealed evidence of recent methamphetamine, methadone and cannabis use.  These drugs, however, did not contribute to her death in a physical way.
Did the offender intend to kill?  
12The Crown submitted that it should be concluded that the offender intended to kill Ms Newman whilst, on the other hand, it was submitted by Mr Winch on the offender's behalf that I would not be satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt and therefore should sentence the offender on the basis that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm but not death.  By and large, an intention to cause death is regarded as more reprehensible than an intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  In the circumstances of this case, the distinction is, to my mind, significant.
13The accounts given by the offender about how he came to stab Ms Newman are plainly incredible.  Since, on his own admission, he held a knife in one hand, he could not also have ""had her by the shoulders"".  Although he had taken some drugs, there is nothing to suggest, and the offender does not do so, that he was intoxicated or significantly intoxicated.  That he blacked out before actually wielding the knife and only afterwards discovered that he had wounded Ms Newman in the neck is not reasonably possible.  The possibility that Ms Newman lunged at him cannot be completely dismissed but the character and angle of the wound demonstrate that this is not how the stabbing came about.  Nor do I believe that he took up the knife to prune the plants.  
14I think it is inescapable that the offender got the knife (wherever it was, perhaps in the kitchen) for the purpose, most likely, of threatening Ms Newman.  I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that, at some point in their argument he raised the knife and intentionally stabbed her in the neck.  I think it is very likely that this was on the spur of the moment as a momentary act of considerable anger, rather than premeditated.  Although, as he struck, he plainly intended to cause serious injury I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to kill her.  As soon as he stabbed her he regretted doing so and did his best to save her life though this was inevitably ineffectual.  Although, on one view, the offender had the presence of mind to invent (two) stories about how the injury occurred, these accounts were plainly absurd and do not inform the issue of intent.  
15Accordingly, I am required to sentence the offender on the basis that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm to Ms Newman.
Subjective features
16Tendered on the offender's behalf was a report of Ms Barbara Panagiotopoulos, who interviewed the offender when he was in custody on 10 July 2013 and conducted various psychometric tests.  His overall cognitive abilities were borderline, performing higher than only 8% of his peers.  He is functionally literate and there was no evidence of disturbance in his executive functioning.  The psychologist's concluding summary stated - 
""Mr Hicks' early history was one of parental neglect and abuse, which appears to have had a negative impact for Mr Hicks' sense of self-worth despite the efforts of his aunt and uncle.  As a result of these poor early attachments, Mr Hicks developed vulnerabilities as a child and experienced both learning and social difficulties.  While he reportedly had a caring and supportive relationship with his aunt and uncle, as an adolescent, Mr Hicks drifted in to a delinquent peer group and began experimenting with both alcohol and drugs.  These antisocial peer connections became further entrenched with age and, coupled with substance abuse, Mr Hicks began to engage in antisocial behaviour, which resulted in his previous incarcerations.  He has a lengthy history of substance abuse that appears to be his coping strategy and his drug use has been instrumental in the previous decline of his mental health.  Further, this lifestyle has interfered with his ability to gain any notable forms of lawful employment, and as such he has been predominately unemployed.  It appears that Mr Hicks' criminal convictions are motivated by a combination of his antisocial attitudes, his mental health and his drug use.
On assessment, Mr Hicks has a limited but functional intellect and does not appear to have any executive function difficulties. However, Mr Hicks was found to have a few prevalent personality dysfunctions and clinical symptomatology that are likely to be maladaptive in his social functioning such that they impact on his day-to-day life.
In hindsight, Mr Hicks now has regret and remorse about the offence. Further, he appears to have used his current situation to make changes in his lifestyle. Specifically, he stated that he wants to remain drugs free and keep away from antisocial peers in the future. However, he will need a lot of help while incarcerated if he is to be successful in making and sustaining these changes.""
17The psychologist had the benefit of speaking with the offender's aunt who, with her husband, assumed family responsibility for the offender just before his second birthday.  Mrs Hicks has also written a letter for the purpose of outlining the offender's background which was tendered on the hearing.  She also gave evidence she and her husband have taken the best care they could of the offender.  I accept that, as she feels, many of the problems evident in the offender's life have developed to some degree or other from the appalling way in which he was treated by his parents before Mrs Hicks took responsibility for him.  He is indeed fortunate not only to have received but to continue to have the support of his aunt and her husband.  Although he must of necessity serve a lengthy period of imprisonment, that continuing support will be important to his long term rehabilitation.  
18I note that the psychologist reported that the offender expressed regret and remorse for the death of the victim and her son and mother.   However, his statement that he did not intend to harm the victim is not truthful and, although he has said that he ""takes full responsibility for"" killing Ms Newman, it is clear that he is does not fully admit, at least to others, that indeed he knowingly stabbed her intending to cause her very serious injury.  Certainly, by his plea, he has accepted full legal responsibility for what he has done.  Nice distinctions about whether he is unwilling or unable to do more do not seem to me to be of great significance.  In this respect, a letter of the offender was tendered in the proceedings expressing both his love for Ms Newman and what he described as taking ""full responsibility for Patricia's death and I'm totally remorseful for my actions on that day"".  Such material, though it is proper to be received, adds little to the evidence.  To my mind, the offender's behaviour immediately after the infliction of the wound demonstrates more convincingly the extent of his regret and, as it seems to me, remorse.  A plea of guilty, of course, is of its very character an acceptance of legal responsibility for the crime admitted.  Here, it has some additional significance since the Crown case, although strong, was not overwhelming.  
19Whilst the offender's psychological problems which are not altogether of his own making constitute, no doubt, an element in the commission of the offence, they are not such as to suggest that he is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.  Nor does it seem to me that they give rise to any particular reason for leniency.    
20So far as the offender's prior convictions are concerned, they go back to when he was a teenager but were relatively trivial and were dealt with in the Local Court except where he appealed to the District Court.  The most serious offences occurred in May 1999 when he was sentenced to nine months minimum term with a nine months additional term for demanding property by force with intent to steal.  He served short terms of imprisonment, imposed in June 2000, for inciting an aggravated indecency where the victim was under his authority, threatening injury to a person for being a witness, contravening an apprehended domestic violence order and using a carriage service to menace or harass a person.  These sentences were concurrent, indicating that they arose out of a single incident.
Objective seriousness
21The criminal taking of a human life must be regarded as a very serious offence, as reflected in the applicable maximum penalty and standard non-parole period.  Nevertheless, it is clear that instances of this crime vary in relative seriousness.  Generally speaking, where the intention was not to kill but to cause grievous bodily harm which arose at the spur of the moment and the cause of death was an isolated act of momentary, though extreme, angry violence with no ulterior motive the objective seriousness of the crime lies toward the lower end of culpability.  These considerations are essentially incommensurable and do no more than indicate that culpability should be placed rather lower than higher in the range.  
22So far as the factors referred to in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are concerned, of course the offence involved the actual use of violence by way of a weapon and a grave risk of death (see paragraphs 2(b), (c), (ib)).  These are necessarily involved in the offence itself and I have taken them into account in that way. 
Conclusion
23So far as the appropriate discount for the plea is concerned, in light of the procedural history mentioned above, an appropriate discount is 15 per cent.  
24Applying the discount to the sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate, I impose a sentence of 17 years imprisonment.  Having regard to the period of potential parole which would be available were the statutory calculus provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to apply, I do not find that there are special circumstances justifying a variation of that period.  The non-parole period will accordingly be 12 years and 9 months.  The sentence is to commence on 10 August 2011.  The earliest date upon which the offender will be eligible for parole is 10 May 2024.  The offender is now subject to the Crimes (High Risk) Offenders Act 2006 and may therefore be made subject of an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order if it be determined that he is a high risk violent offender.  For the reasons I have already given, I consider that his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable but, should this be shown in the result to be mistaken, appropriate action can be taken to protect the public.

2762388,Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215,"Judgment
1LATHAM J:  I agree with Davies J.
2ROTHMAN J: I agree with Davies J.
3DAVIES J:  On 15 September 2010 Scott Patrick Loader pleaded guilty in Wyong Local Court to the following offences:
Count 1: Ongoing supply of Benzylpiperazines and Methylamphetamine between 7 September and 29 September 2009.  The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years and/or 3500 penalty units.
Count 2: Supply 282 tablets of MDMA being not less than the commercial quantity between 17 September and 7 November 2009.  The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 15 years and/or 2000 penalty units.
Count 3: Supply of 863.15g of methylamphetamine being not less than the commercial quantity between 15 September and 11 October 2009.  The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years and/or 3500 penalty units.  There is a standard non-parole period of ten years.
Count 4: Supply 348g of methylamphetamine being not less than the commercial quantity on 6 November 2009.  The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years and/or 3500 penalty units.  There is a standard non-parole period of ten years.
Count 5: Supply 70 tablets of MDMA being an indictable quantity on 6 November 2009.  The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 15 years and/or 2000 penalty units.  
4He came before his Honour Judge Ellis for sentence in the District Court.  His Honour provided for a discount of 25% for an early plea.  He was sentenced on 15 March 2011 as follows:
Count 5: A non-parole period of one year three months commencing 6 November 2009 and expiring 5 February 2011 with an additional term of one year expiring 5 February 2012. 
Count 2: A non-parole period of 2 years commencing 6 May 2010 and expiring 5 May 2012 with an additional term of one year expiring 5 May 2013.   This sentence took into account two matters on a Form One as follows:    (1) Supply 14.2g of methylamphetamine being greater than the commercial quantity between 16 September and 6 November 2009;
(2) Supply 75 tabs of LSD between 16 September and 6 November 2009;
Count 4: A non-parole period of three years commencing 6 November 2010 and expiring 5 November 2013 with an additional term of three years expiring 5 November 2016. That sentence took into account two matters on a Form One as follows:
(1) Knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime being $1500.
(2) Knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime being $19,000.
Count 1: A non-parole period of three years and three months commencing 6 May 2011 and expiring 5 August 2014 with an additional term of two years expiring 5 August 2016. 
Count 3: A non-parole period of six years commencing 6 November 2011 and expiring 5 November 2017 with an additional term of four years expiring 5 November 2021.  This sentence took into account one matter on a Form One being supply 28.4g of methylamphetamine on 22 October 2009.
5The overall sentence was a non-parole period of eight years with an additional term of four years.  
6In relation to Count 3 an error was made in setting the non-parole period.  His Honour said this:
In relation to count three and taking into account the one matter on the Form 1, you are convicted and sentenced to a total of nine years imprisonment. ... The Court imposes a non-parole period of six years to date from 6 November 2011 and to expire on 5 November 2017 with an additional term of four years to date from 6 November 2017 and to expire on 5 November 2021.
That is a total effective sentence of twelve years to date from 6 November 2009 and to expire on 5 November 2021 with a total effective non-parole period of eight years to date from 6 November 2009 and to expire on 5 November 2017.
7His Honour had intended to impose a non-parole period for Count 3 of five years with an additional term of four years.  
8The sentence was amended on 11 February 2013 when further Remarks on Sentence were delivered and the error was corrected.  Accordingly, Count 3 was amended to read:
A non-parole period of five years commencing 6 November 2011 and expiring 5 November 2016 with an additional term of four years expiring 5 November 2020.
9As before, that count took into account the matter on the Form 1 of supplying 28.4g of methylamphetamine.
10On 24 November 2010 Peter Leslie Dunn pleaded guilty at Wyong Local Court to the following offences:
Count 1: Attempt to receive and supply 307.7g of methylamphetamine being a commercial quantity on 6 November 2009.  
Count 2: Knowingly take part in the supply of 594.3g of methylamphetamine being a commercial quantity between 15 September and 11 October 2009.  
The maximum penalty for each offence was 20 years imprisonment and/or 3500 penalty units.  There was a standard non-parole period of ten years.
11On 14 December 2011 Mr Dunn was sentenced by his Honour Judge Ellis.  He also received a 25% discount for an early plea.  The sentences imposed were these:
Count 1: A non-parole period of four years commencing 6 January 2010 and expiring 5 January 2014 with an additional term of three years expiring 5 January 2017.
Count 2: Taking into account matters on a Form One a non-parole period of five years commencing 6 July 2010 and expiring 5 July 2015 with an additional term of three years 6 months expiring 5 January 2019.  
The overall sentence was a non-parole period of five years six months with an additional term of three years and six months.
12The matters on the Form 1 were these:
(1) Knowingly take part in the supply of 27.5g of methylamphetamine on 28 September 2009.
(2) Knowingly take part in the supply of 28.4g of methylamphetamine on 22 October 2009;
13Each of Mr Loader and Mr Dunn seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon them.
14Two other persons, Jennifer Anne Lapham and Cameron Ross Murray were involved in the supply of the same drugs with Mr Loader and Mr Dunn.  They were also sentenced by Judge Ellis and those sentences are relevant because each of Mr Loader and Mr Dunn appeals (inter alia) on a parity ground.  Details of the charges and sentences in relation to Ms Lapham and Mr Murray will be referred to later in the judgment.
15Mr Loader appeals on the following grounds:
Ground 1: The learned Sentencing Judge erred by ascribing 25 years as the maximum penalty for counts three and four on the indictment.
Ground 3:  The learned Sentencing Judge's treatment of the standard non-parole period is now erroneous.
Ground 4: Disparity of sentence between the Applicant and his co-offenders gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.16There were two further grounds originally relied upon but these have now been abandoned in the light the sentence correction that took place on 11 February 2013.
17A Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal was filed by Mr Loader on 29 March 2011.  Extensions of time were granted with the last expiring on 29 June 2012.  The Notice of Appeal was not filed until 11 July 2012.  Accordingly, Mr Loader needs leave of the Court for an extension of time in which to appeal.  The Crown does not oppose leave being granted.  An extension should be granted.
18The amended grounds of appeal filed by Mr Dunn are these:
Ground 1: His Honour's sentences were flawed by an incorrect assessment of the maximum penalty for the offences;
Ground 2: The disparity of sentence between the Applicant and his co-offenders gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.   
Ground 3: His Honour erred in imposing sentences which are manifestly excessive.
Facts
19The following facts were found by the Sentencing Judge largely from a Statement of Agreed Facts.
20In June 2009, investigators from the Brisbane Water Drug Unit initiated Operation Kosmina, a covert operation undertaken to investigate the alleged distribution of prohibited drugs namely 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (commonly known as ecstasy) and methylamphetamine by Scott Patrick Loader within the Brisbane Water and Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Commands. As a result, a controlled operation was authorised and telephone intercepts were set up in relation to mobile phones used by Mr Loader.
21The persons identified during the telephone intercepts were Mr Loader, a man named Cameron Ross Murray, a man named Peter Leslie Dunn and a woman named Jennifer Anne Lapham, all of whom were charged with various offences against the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  They pleaded guilty to a number of counts and, as noted, have all been sentenced by Judge Ellis.
22Mr Dunn was the regular buyer of commercial quantities of methylamphetamine from Ms Lapham for the purpose of the on-supply to people on the Central Coast.  He was responsible for the cutting down of the drug and the on-supply of those drugs to Mr Loader for the street level distribution.
23To avoid detection by police during the period of the police operation, Mr Dunn used no fewer than five different mobile phone numbers to contact the co-offenders.  Checks with Vodafone revealed that all of these phones were registered in false names and addresses. The size of their operation was illustrated in the large numbers of telephone calls made between all the parties.
24Between 16 September 2009 and 6 November 2009, Mr Dunn was responsible for calling or texting Mr Loader 243 times and Mr Murray 302 times. Similarly, in the same period, Mr Loader either called or texted Mr Dunn 212 times while Mr Murray called or texted him 302 times.
25Mr Loader was responsible for picking up the drugs from Ms Lapham in Sydney and dropping them off to Mr Dunn. Mr Loader would then provide Ms Lapham with the money given to him by Mr Dunn.  Ms Lapham would ring Mr Loader to tell him to come down to see her for lunch and/or dinner. This was code that the drug was ready to be picked up.
26Mr Loader and Mr Murray worked for Mr Dunn in relation to these commercial transactions. Mr Loader performed the role of the middle man. In addition to the drop-offs of the money from Mr Dunn and the pick-ups of the drugs, Mr Loader arranged and negotiated all the commercial supplies including having discussions about payment and quality. He was the link between both Mr Dunn and Ms Lapham. There was no evidence of direct contact between Mr Dunn and Ms Lapham.
27Mr Murray was a friend of Mr Loader's. He was responsible for introducing Mr Loader to Ms Lapham. He was involved in the joint criminal enterprise of the supply of commercial quantities of methylamphetamines as he would assist Mr Loader with making arrangements and negotiating between both Ms Lapham and Mr Dunn as well as travelling with Mr Loader to Sydney to pick up and deliver the drugs and money.
28Both Mr Loader and Mr Murray received about $200 each from Mr Dunn for each ounce of methylamphetamine supplied as payment for fulfilling this role. All the money was given to Mr Loader who was then responsible for providing it to Mr Murray in either cash or in drugs.
29In addition to the above role, it was clear from the evidence of both direct supplies to an undercover operative and recorded telephone conversations that Mr Loader was also a street and mid-level supplier of drugs to members of the community. He had his own customers and was capable of supplying methylamphetamines, ecstasy pills and acid (LSD).
30Police maintained that Mr Loader was supplied drugs by Mr Dunn for this purpose. Ms Lapham was the supplier of commercial quantities of methylamphetamines on a regular basis to the above three co-offenders. The amount on each occasion varied from between nine to twelve ounces with a value of between $25,000 to $35,000. Ms Lapham was essentially the source of the methylamphetamine that the above three offenders used to distribute throughout the Brisbane Water and Tuggerah Lakes areas of the Central Coast.31In performing her role as the source, Ms Lapham used to ring Mr Loader when she had drugs available to supply. She was capable of arranging for an exchange in drugs when the quality was bad providing large amounts of drugs on tick and was responsible for money collection.  Whilst it was evident from the telephone conversations that Ms Lapham was supplied these drugs from someone else, she still fulfilled an autonomous role of a commercial drug supplier.
32Between 16 September 2009 and 6 November 2009 Mr Loader's mobile phone service was lawfully recorded. These recorded telephone conversations showed that he regularly supplied methylamphetamine, ecstasy and LSD to different individuals.
33In addition to the occasions included in the charges, throughout the period of the telephone intercept warrants, Mr Loader was recorded engaging in hundreds of calls that were related to the supply of drugs. Mr Loader was thus a street to mid-level supplier of these drugs on the Central Coast.
34Count one charged against Mr Loader related to the period between 7 September 2009 and 29 September 2009. That count of ongoing supply involved three separate supplies on three different occasions.  The first on 8 September 2009 involved 6.74 grams of benzylpiperazine valued at $400. The second on 17 September involved 3.35 grams of methylamphetamine for $300 and the third on 28 September 2009 was for 28 grams of methylamphetamine valued at $3000.  Those three supplies were to an undercover operative.
35The Sentencing Judge said that while the number of supplies was the minimum, that is three, the quantities involved in each of the three was higher than normal given that often the amounts involved only a taste such as .02 of a gram. He said that the criminality involved in that matter was within the mid range of offending against that particular provision of the Act.
36In relation to count two charged against Mr Loader he agreed on 21 separate occasions between 17 September and 7 November 2009 to supply a total of 282 ecstasy tablets. Each of those agreements was recorded on the telephone intercept warrant.
37The Sentencing Judge noted that supply of 282 ecstasy tablets was an offence which would fall slightly below the mid range of offending against that particular provision because of the quantity involved. On count two, Mr Loader asked the Court to take into account two further matters, one of supplying 14.2 grams of methylamphetamine and one of supplying 75 discrete dosage units of LSD.
38Count three charged against Mr Loader was a transaction that involved charges against all four offenders.  It was Count 2 charged against Mr Dunn.  It related to the period between 15 September 2009 and 11 October 2009 when Mr Loader supplied a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug namely a total of 863.15 grams of methylamphetamine. That involved his travelling to Sydney to pick up from Ms Lapham an amount of 254.7 grams on 16 September 2009; on 8 October 2009 an amount of 339.6 grams and on 10 October 2009 an amount of 268.85 grams.  He then supplied 594.3 grams to Mr Dunn who on-supplied it to various users within his network.
39The Sentencing Judge noted that the total of 863.3 grams was slightly above the middle of the range constituting a commercial quantity (250 -1000g).  His Honour noted that Mr Loader's role as a facilitator was perhaps slightly less than usual.  He said that the criminality fell within the mid range of criminality for that offence of commercial supply.  He held that Mr Dunn's criminality was slightly below Mr Loader's in respect of that transaction.
40In relation to that count, Mr Loader asked the Court to take into account on the Form 1 one further matter of supplying 28 grams of methylamphetamine to Mr Dunn.  Mr Dunn, in respect of this count, asked the Court to take into account two matters on a Form 1 being the supply of 28.4g and 27.5g of methylamphetamine.
41Count four charged against Mr Loader also included the involvement of the other three offenders.  It involved the supply of what has variously been described as 348 and 307 grams of methylamphetamine.  The explanation for the difference is that the supply was originally thought to have been 348 grams but when weighed by the analyst its net weight was 307.7 grams.  Nothing turns on the difference.  This count was count one charged against Mr Dunn.  
42This offence, which took place on 6 November 2009, involved Mr Loader and Mr Murray sourcing the methylamphetamine from Ms Lapham and conveying it to Mr Dunn for Mr Dunn to distribute within his network of users.  In relation to this offence the Sentencing Judge considered that 348 grams was just above the lower end of the range in terms of quantity, that Mr Loader's role was that of a facilitator or courier and that his criminality was slightly below mid-range, and that Mr Dunn's level of criminality was higher than Mr Loader's because he was to distribute the drugs within his network of users.  
43In relation to this count, Mr Loader asked that two matters on the Form 1 involving dealing with $1500 and $9000, being the proceeds of crime, be taken into account.
44Count five charged against Mr Loader related to a count of deemed supply of 70 ecstasy tablets (17.4 grams of ecstasy) on 6 November. That was the quantity which he was carrying on him when he was arrested by police on that day. That quantity was found in a separate compartment of his car underneath the ignition and separate from the larger quantity which was count four.
45His Honour held that the offending against count five was below the mid range of offending given the amount of the substance located. 46His Honour held that in terms of the various roles played Ms Lapham, was the main source of supply for the methylamphetamine. He said that both Mr Dunn and Mr Loader had their own clients that they supplied to from time to time and that Mr Dunn used Mr Loader to source the methylamphetamine from Ms Lapham.  Bearing in mind the quantities, he said that the suggestion seemed to be that Mr Dunn had a more thriving supply customer base than Mr Loader but nevertheless Mr Loader was both involved in Mr Dunn's business by acting as the conduit to Ms Lapham, in terms of money going one way and drugs the other, and running his own supply business on the side including the supply of ecstasy which was sourced other than from Ms Lapham.
47At the time his Honour sentenced Mr Loader he determined that the order of the hierarchy was as follows in descending order:
Ms Lapham at the top, then Mr Dunn, Mr Loader slightly below Mr Dunn and Mr Murray slightly below Mr Loader.
48On 28 March 2011 Judge Ellis sentenced Mr Murray in relation to two counts of knowingly take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.  The first count related to a quantity of 348.8g of methylamphetamine and was the same transaction as count one charged against Mr Dunn and count four against Mr Loader.  The second count related to the supply of 863.15g of methylamphetamine and was the same transaction as count two charged against Mr Dunn and count three against Mr Loader.  He was given a 25% discount for his early plea.
49Judge Ellis sentenced Mr Murray as follows:
Count one: A non-parole period of two years and three months from 6 November 2009 and expire 5 February 2012 with an additional term of two years and three months to expire 5 May 2014.  
Count two: Taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing 6 November 2010 and expiring 5 May 2013 with an additional term of four years expiring 5 May 2017.  
50The overall sentence was a non-parole period of three years and six months with an additional term of four years.
51The two charges on the Form 1 were these:
(1) Knowingly take part in the supply of 27.5g of methylamphetamine;
 (2) Knowingly take part in the supply of 28.4g of methylamphetamine.
52On 20 July 2011 Judge Ellis sentenced Ms Lapham in respect of two counts of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.  The first count was the same as count two against Mr Dunn, count three against Mr Loader and count two against Mr Murray.  
53The second count against Ms Lapham was in respect of the supply of 348g of methylamphetamine and was the same count as count one charged against Mr Dunn, count four against Mr Loader and count one against Mr Murray.  Ms Lapham was given 25% discount for an early plea and a further 10% for assistance to authorities.
54She was sentenced as follows:
Count two and taking into account a matter on the Form 1 - a non-parole period of one year and three months from 4 June 2011 expiring 3 September 2012 with an additional term of two years expiring 4 September 2012.  The Form 1 offence was dealing with the proceeds of crime although the amount involved was not disclosed.
Count one and taking into account a matter on the Form 1 - a non-parole period of one year and two months to commence 4 January 2012 expiring 3 March 2013 with an additional term of four years expiring 3 March 2017.  
55The total effective sentence was a non-parole period of one year nine months with an additional term of four years.  The Form 1 offence in relation to count two was the supply of 28g of methylamphetamine to Mr Loader and Mr Murray.  
Grounds of Appeal 
Error in maximum penalty  - Ground 1: Loader               Ground 1: Dunn 
56His Honour referred three times in his Remarks on Sentence when dealing with Mr Loader and once when dealing with Mr Dunn to the fact that the maximum penalty for supplying a commercial quantity of the drugs concerned was 25 years imprisonment.  In doing so, he was led into error in each case by the Crown Sentencing Summary.
57It does not follow that because such an error is made the sentence should automatically be reduced:   EJDG v R [2012] NSWCCA 251 at [24]-[25].  Regard must still be had to s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
58His Honour found that the offending of Mr Loader in count three fell within the mid range of criminality particularly because the amount of the drug involved, 863.3g, was slightly above the middle of the range.  It was also on the basis that his role as a facilitator was perhaps slightly less than usual. 
59In relation to count four concerning Mr Loader his Honour found that the offending was slightly below mid-range having regard to his role and to the amount of the drug being 348g.  
60When the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment is borne in mind it is difficult to see how the corrected sentences imposed for counts three and four were infected by his Honour's erroneous view of the maximum penalty.  The notional starting point for the sentence for count three (25% discount for an early plea) was 12 years.  That was within the mid-range of sentences on the basis of a 20 year maximum penalty.  Moreover his Honour adjusted the non-parole period favourably to the applicant.
61Similarly, the starting point of eight years in respect of count four was below the mid-range.  In both cases there were Form 1 offences.  In the case of count three that included a further offence of supplying greater than an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine.  
62The sentences for these two counts cannot be seen in isolation from the other offences (including those on the Form 1 for counts 2, 3 and 4) and the sentences imposed, particularly the approach the Sentencing Judge took to the matter of accumulation.  Any reduction in the sentences for counts 3 and 4 would require a reconsideration of the level of accumulation on the other offences.  
63In Shortland v R [2013] NSWCCA 4 a similar issue arose.  In that case Johnson J (with whom Hoeben JA and Button J agreed) said:
[147] It is sufficient to observe that a substantial sentence was imposed, which was partly cumulative. However, where an offender is sentenced for several offences so that the principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality are brought into play, it is necessary for this Court to take care where challenge is made to one particular sentence of those which are imposed, so as to guard against an element of artificiality being introduced: R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [82]. The Court must keep in mind the obligation of a sentencing court to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. However, the selection of one sentence for challenge as being manifestly excessive, from a range of several partly accumulated sentences, requires particular caution on the part of this Court.

64There is no appeal against the extent of the overall sentence.  In my opinion, no other sentence, either for counts 3 and 4 nor on an overall basis, was warranted than the sentences imposed notwithstanding the error.  
65When his Honour came to assess the objective criminality of Mr Dunn in relation to the offences with which he was charged he did so by comparing that criminality to the other persons who had been sentenced.  He said that Mr Dunn's criminality in respect of his count one (the supply of 307.7g of methylamphetamine) was higher than that of Mr Loader on the basis that Mr Dunn intended to distribute that prohibited substance into his network of users whereas Mr Loader had simply been the conduit which enabled Mr Dunn to obtain the substance.
66His Honour had found for the related offence for Mr Loader that his criminality was slightly below mid-range.
67In relation to the second count against Mr Dunn his Honour found that Mr Dunn's level of criminality was slightly lower than Mr Loader's although he added ""it may be said that that is a reasonably generous conclusion"".
68The non-parole period imposed on each was the same (five years) but Mr Dunn's additional term was six months less than that imposed upon Mr Loader. 
69Again, bearing in mind the notional starting points, because Mr Dunn also received a 25% discount for an early plea, it cannot be said that the sentences have been infected by the Sentencing Judge's error regarding the maximum penalty.   As with Mr Loader, although Mr Dunn's overall criminality was less, bearing in mind both offences and the offences on the Form 1, no lesser sentence was warranted.Standard non-parole period - Loader: Ground 3
70Mr Loader was sentenced prior to the High Court's judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2012) 244 CLR 120.  In relation to the standard non-parole period his Honour said this:
The Court notes that the standard non parole periods which are fixed in relation to counts three and four do not strictly apply because of the pleas of guilty and in relation to count four because of the Court's finding that the level of criminality is slightly below the mid range. Nevertheless, the standard non-parole period in those two counts acts as a guidepost for this Court's assessment of the appropriate penalty. The Court generally has taken into account decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in such cases as R v Way, R v Ohar and R v AP.  
71His Honour made no further reference to the standard non-parole period.  Nor is there any suggestion in his Remarks on Sentence that he was engaging in a two-stage process of identifying the standard non-parole period and then finding factors to justify departure from it.  
72In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 I said (with the agreement of Whealy JA and Rothman J) at [26]:
...Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre-Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error.  What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene.  Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it.  It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick.  
73As Bellew J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said in Trevor Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30]:
...when considering whether or not such an error has been established, it necessary to consider the reasons of the sentencing judge as a whole.
74Those reasons in the present case do not suggest error.  Indeed, the selection of the non-parole period for counts three and four by the Sentencing Judge points strongly to the fact that the standard non-parole period was not used as a starting point.
75Whilst Mr Dunn had no similar Ground of Appeal his written submissions, in relation to his ground of appeal concerning the sentence being manifestly excessive, said that his Honour's treatment of Mr Loader was ""affected with reasoning disapproved in Muldrock and [was] thus an unreliable comparative base"".  For reasons given, that was not so.  It is not apparent, in any event, that his Honour compared the sentences he imposed on Mr Dunn with the sentences imposed on Mr Loader  - rather, he assessed their relative criminality.
Manifestly excessive - Dunn: Ground 3
76Counsel for Mr Dunn submitted that the statistics provided to his Honour were all pre-Muldrock sentences and were likely to have a higher starting point than applied to Mr Dunn who was sentenced after Muldrock.  As noted earlier it was also submitted that his Honour had erred in his approach to the sentence for Mr Loader in a way disapproved in Muldrock so that the sentences for Mr Loader were an unreliable comparison.  For reasons given earlier, that latter submission is rejected.
77There is no evidence that his Honour was guided by the statistics - he certainly did not refer to them.  In any event this Court has warned time and again of the limited use that can be made of statistics in determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive.  The relevant considerations are the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period when all other relevant matters, objective and subjective, are considered.  Even if the sentences cannot be considered lenient it cannot be said that they are manifestly excessive.
78This ground fails.
Parity - Loader: Ground 4    Dunn:  Ground 2
79The sentences imposed on the offenders for the two common offences were these:
(a) Supply of 348g methylamphetamine:
Dunn:  Four years non-parole plus three years;Loader: Three years non-parole plus three years; Murray: Two years three months plus two years three months; Lapham: One year three months plus two years.
(b) Supply of 863.15g methylamphetamine:Dunn:  Five years plus three years six months;Loader: Five years plus four years; Murray: Two years six months plus four years; Lapham: One year two months plus four years.
80It should be noted that in Mr Dunn's case the amount of the drug in each case was less than for the co-offenders.  In relation to the supply of 863g he was charged only in relation to 594.3g because that was all that was to be provided to him by Mr Loader.  As noted earlier, the amount of 348g was determined to have a pure weight of 307.7g. 
81The chronology of sentencing was this:
Loader: 15 March 2011 Murray: 28 March 2011 Lapham: 20 July 2011 Dunn:  14 December 2011 Loader (correction): 11 February 2013
82The first of the offenders sentenced was Mr Loader on 15 March 2011.  At that time his Honour assessed the relative positions of the offenders in the hierarchy in this way:
The offending against count five is below the mid range of offending given the amount of the substance located. It would seem that in terms of the various roles played, that the offender, Jennifer Lapham, was the main source of supply for the methylamphetamine. It would appear that both Peter Dunn and Scott Loader had their own clients that they supplied to from time to time and that Peter Dunn used Scott Loader to source the methylamphetamine from Jennifer Lapham. Bearing in mind the quantities, the suggestion would seem to be that Peter Dunn had a more thriving supply customer base than Mr Loader but nevertheless Mr Loader was both involved in Peter Dunn's business by acting as the conduit to Jennifer Lapham in terms of money going one way and drugs the other and running his own supply business on the side including the supply of ecstasy which was sourced other than from Jennifer Lapham.
In my view, Scott Loader is slightly below Peter Dunn; Scott Murray slightly below Mr Loader and in terms of the supply chain, Jennifer Lapham was at the top in terms of these four individuals albeit clearly she also must have had a supplier.
83His Honour maintained that view when he sentenced Mr Murray on 28 March 2011.  
84When his Honour came to sentence Ms Lapham on 20 July 2011 he said this:
Both Murray and Loader worked for a man by the name of Peter Dunn. Peter Dunn was heavily involved in the supply of illicit substances on the Central Coast. He had a number of suppliers and a large clientele base. ...
This offender [Lapham] had no contact directly with Peter Dunn, but what she did have was a contact with a person who was able to supply reasonably large quantities of amphetamines.
She, when approached, acted as a conduit for the supply of amphetamines from her supplier through to Mr Loader and Mr Murray who then in turn on supplied to Mr Dunn who had his own distribution network.
Mr Loader also had his own business on the side and was not just working for Peter Dunn and he also had other sources of supply for various drugs. ...
Mr Murray assisted Mr Loader and was below him in terms of the level of criminality. In my remarks I indicated that his level of criminality was at about seventy-five percent of that of Mr Loader. [It is not apparent where this reference to 75% is to be found.] On the material which has been placed before me in relation to all three of these sentences, while Ms Lapham was further up the chain in terms of the back tracking of the sourcing of the illicit substances she was in my view, having considered all the material, below, just below Mr Murray in terms of the respective criminality of Murray, Loader, Dunn and this offender. (emphasis added)
85It is apparent, therefore, that on the material his Honour had by the time he came to sentence Ms Lapham, his view about her position and role had changed considerably.  
86The last offender sentenced was Mr Dunn on 14 December 2011.  His Honour said that the drugs were sourced via the auspices of Mr Loader and Ms Lapham, with Mr Loader transporting the substances from Ms Lapham's home in Sydney partly at least to supply Mr Dunn.  He noted there that Mr Loader had his own network of users and that his role was also to facilitate Mr Dunn's obtaining of the drugs.  His Honour referred back to his Remarks at the time of sentencing Mr Murray and Ms Lapham as to the distinction made in their objective level of criminality.
87Mr Loader's principal complaint concerning parity was in relation to the sentences imposed on Ms Lapham.  Mr Dunn's complaint was threefold.  First, his sentences compared with Ms Lapham's, although intended to be lower, were out of proportion to hers especially where the objective criminality was concerned.  Secondly, his Honour wrongly identified that the subjective circumstances of all four offenders were relatively identical.  Thirdly, the adjustment of Mr Loader's count three left Mr Dunn with the same non-parole period and only 6 months less additional term when compared to Mr Loader.  It was submitted that his Honour had, by the sentence originally imposed on Mr Loader, intended that his sentence would be more severe than Mr Dunn's particularly where Mr Dunn's criminality for that offence was said to be slightly lower than Mr Loader's.
88The starting point for any consideration of parity in the present appeals is that the same judge sentenced all four offenders, that he had available to him and referred to the sentencing remarks in those he had already sentenced, and that he drew careful comparisons between their respective criminalities.  In fact, when sentencing Ms Lapham his Honour said this:
In conclusion the reason for the different sentence imposed on this offender than sentences imposed on the others are:
1. I find her level of criminality to be lower.
2. Her subjective material in terms of her prior life and community service entitle her to a greater level of credit,
3. She has the benefit of a s 23 discount,
4. The not insignificant impact of the difficulties she will encounter in custody by reason of her fragility in terms of both her age, physical well being and mental health situation, and lastly,
5. That the impact on third persons being her two daughters, her mother and her brother is not insignificant.
89The only matter which can be pointed to as an error by his Honour was in his Remarks when dealing with Mr Dunn.  He said this:
During their respective sentencing processes, Mr Loader, Mr Murray and Ms Latham (sic) all received credit for please of guilty, expressions of genuine remorse and contrition.  Essentially there is no difference between the subjective material put forward for those three co-offenders and the present offender, Mr Dunn. Clearly each had slightly different backgrounds and different pluses and minuses but in the wash-up of a consideration of their respective subjective material, there is no basis for distinguishing between the four of them.  There is clearly a basis for distinguishing between them on the basis of their objective criminality. (emphasis added)
90That assessment was not entirely accurate in respect of Ms Lapham.  But it was an error that was favourable both to Mr Dunn and Mr Loader because Ms Lapham's much more favourable subjective circumstances (as had been found by his Honour on her sentencing proceedings) justified the much lower sentences she was given when compared with both Mr Loader and Mr Dunn.
91In R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 Barr and Howie JJ said at [71]:
This was a case where the sentencing of both offenders was by the same judge on the same occasion. Where the same judge sentences two offenders at the same time and gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences he did by having regard to the differing criminality of each, the differing subjective circumstances and the relevant sentencing principles, in our view this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance just because of the different sentencing outcomes.

92That passage was cited with approval in Dusan Pavicevic v R [2010] ACTCA 25 where co-offenders had appeared before the same sentencing Judge. The ACT Court of Appeal observed that the Judge ""was in the best position to assess the relative criminality of the offenders and to distinguish the circumstances relevant to each of the offenders"" and that ""an appellate court will exercise caution before determining that the disparities between two sentences are unjust"".
93Similar sentiments were expressed by Winneke P in R v Spizzerri [2001] VSCA 49 at [10]:
... an appellate court should be careful in concluding manifest disparity, particularly where the offenders have been sentenced by an experienced judge who has sentenced a large number of offenders engaged in the same criminal enterprise. In those circumstances the appellate court is at risk of upsetting the symmetry of the sentencing process employed by the judge and introducing its own disparity into that process. To that extent the Court is constrained in rectifying a disparity which it perceives. Because of those constraints, it runs the risk of ""tinkering"".
94These and other authorities were referred to with approval in Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; (2011) 205 A Crim R 274 at [39] - [41].
95To similar effect is what McColl JA (with whom Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) said in Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58]:
Finally, it should be understood that considerable obstacles are faced by an applicant seeking to invoke the parity principle in circumstances where the sentencing judge was fully aware of sentences imposed upon a co-offender, and the reasons for those sentences, and indicates in the sentencing remarks why the judge is departing from the co-offender's sentences.
96As far as the sentences imposed on Ms Lapham are concerned I do not consider that, taking into account the matters considered by the Sentencing Judge, the sentences imposed on either Mr Dunn or Mr Loader can be said to be ""grossly"", ""glaringly"", ""markedly"" or ""manifestly"" disparate: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [62].
97It necessarily follows that as far as the respective sentences given to Mr Loader and Mr Dunn are concerned those sentences cannot be said to demonstrate other than minor if any disparity.  An examination of his Honour's assessment of the two applicants demonstrate that their objective criminality and subjective circumstances were sufficiently similar to justify similar sentences and that his Honour has recognised small differences in the slightly different sentences imposed.   I do not consider that Mr Dunn demonstrates that the adjustment to Mr Loader's sentence on his count three (Mr Dunn's count two) gives rise to any parity issue.  It is to be remembered that his Honour said when sentencing Mr Dunn,
In my view Mr Dunn's level of criminality is slightly higher in count 1 and slightly lower in count 2 although it may be said that  that is a reasonably generous conclusion.
98In my view the grounds based on parity fail in each appeal.

Conclusion
99I propose the following orders:
Application for leave to appeal by Mr Loader
(1)Extend time for filing of Notice of Application for leave to appeal to 11 July 2012.
(2)Grant leave to appeal.
(3)Dismiss the appeal.
Application for leave to appeal by Mr Dunn
(4)Grant leave to appeal.
(5)Dismiss the appeal.

		19 September 2013",2013-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762391,MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The applicant is now 73 years of age.  He pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault, the victims being his daughter (in respect of counts 1-4) and his grand-daughter (in respect of counts 5-7).  He is not identified by name because to do so would allow the ready identification of the victims who were under 16 years of age at the time of the offences.
2The applicant was sentenced at Campbelltown District Court on 31 May 2012, almost 40 years after the offences which constituted counts 1 and 2.  The case therefore raises in stark form the difficult issues which attend the imposition of a sentence for an offence which occurred several decades ago.  For reasons which will be explained, the proper approach to such matters has not been systematically and coherently addressed by the Court in past cases and, for that reason alone, there should be a grant of leave to appeal.
3The matters also give rise to a second issue, namely the scope and nature of an appeal against sentence under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  In particular, the parties sought to place material before this Court which was not before the sentencing judge, in effect inviting this Court to re-sentence on the basis of more extensive information as to past sentencing practices in respect of relevant offences.  The correct approach to such material has not been dealt with on a consistent basis in the past and provides a further reason for a grant of leave to appeal.  In the event, it is not necessary to address this issue because the further information was not of a kind that is relevant to the sentencing exercise.
Old offences - past ""sentencing patterns and practices""4In a case in which the law had changed between the date when an offender was originally sentenced and the time at which he came up for re-sentencing following a successful appeal, the High Court has held that ""considerations of justice and equity ordinarily require that the convicted person be re-sentenced according to the law as it stood at the time when he was initially sentenced"": Radenkovic v The Queen [1990] HCA 54; 170 CLR 623 at 632 (Mason CJ and McHugh J).  In R v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37, that principle was extended to the benefit of an offender who had been arrested in August 1974, absconded whilst on bail and re-arrested in November 1990, to be extradited to Australia.  In this Court, Badgery-Parker J (Mahoney JA and Hunt CJ at CL agreeing) said that a sentence should be imposed ""appropriate not only to then applicable statutory maxima but also to then appropriate sentencing patterns"": at p 42.
5The circumstances of these cases were far removed from that which arises in the present case, namely a lengthy delay in the victim reporting the offences to police.  An early case of that kind was R v PLV [2001] NSWCCA 282; 51 NSWLR 736.  The offender was the brother of the victim; there was a lapse of more than 20 years from the time of the offending to the time of complaint.  Spigelman CJ (Simpson J agreeing) rejected a submission that the sentence imposed should have been no ""harsher"" than that which would have been imposed had the offender been convicted 20 years earlier: at [94].
6Smart AJ took a somewhat different approach:
""[105] Even though the judge was imposing a sentence in May 2000 he was required to assess the applicant's criminality as at the date of the commission of the offence in 1974.  That means taking into account the applicant's subjective features as at that date. ...
[106] While I would not regard it as decisive I would take into account the sentence which would have been imposed for the offence in 1974 or 1975.  The weight to be attached to that factor, if any, will depend upon the circumstances including the mitigating factors which emerge.  This is of some importance where legislation governing the offence has been repealed. ...
[110] In the present case the judge's approach to sentence was correct in that he assessed the applicant's criminality at the time of the offence and then took into account the applicant's subjective features existing at 1974 and today.""
7The Court in PLV had not been referred to the earlier decision, R v Shore, in which a different approach had been adopted.  When the apparent disparity in approach was identified, a five judge bench was constituted: see R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368.  The principal judgment in MJR was given by Spigelman CJ, with whom Grove and Sully JJ and Newman AJ agreed, reluctantly disavowing the approach adopted in PLV, in favour of that taken in Shore: at [71] (Grove J) and [103] (Sully J, with whom Newman AJ agreed).  Mason P dissented, preferring the approach adopted in PLV and seeing no reason not to adopt it.  Apart from his acceptance of the prior authority, the Chief Justice placed some weight upon the statutory provision that increases in penalty would only apply to offences committed after the commencement of the provision, while reductions in penalty would extend to offences committed before the commencement of the provision: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 19.  After referring to the Victorian decision of R v Morton [1986] VR 863, he continued:
""[22] ...in that case, the court applied a new statutory provision which required the court to take into account a plea of guilty when fixing a sentence, which applied in circumstances in which the pre-existing sentencing practice of the court would not have given credit for the plea.
[23] Although phrased in the language of statutory interpretation and the application of the presumption against retrospectivity, as was appropriate to the issues before the courts, the approach reflected in these decisions may be equally appropriate for the consideration of the effect of a change in sentencing practice by the courts.""
8After further consideration of authority, including the principle adopted in Radenkovic, Spigelman CJ concluded at [31]:
""Similarly, I am now satisfied, after assessing the above authorities, that it is, ""out of keeping"" with the provisions of s19 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, for this Court to refuse to take into account the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of an offence when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender. Accordingly, the view I expressed in R v PLV was incorrect.""
9The language of ""sentencing practice"" and ""sentencing pattern"" has acquired a currency of its own: see AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 at [31] (Howie J distinguishing ""sentencing practices"" from ""executive practices"" with respect to remission); and at [39] (referring to fixing of non-parole periods); Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [7]-[9] (in my judgment) and Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50 at [84]-[88] (Button J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing).  This language is, however, imprecise and covers a range of considerations and a range of sources.  Thus, with respect to sources, the statements would appear to cover:
(a) statutory provisions;(b) general law principles and underlying policies, and(c) practices (that is, application of principles) as revealed by outcomes.
10With respect to the subject matter covered, this would include:
(a) prescribed penalties (including maxima);(b) methods of proceeding (including the fixing of non-parole periods);(c) factors to be taken into account, and(d) facts as found.
11Where there is a statutory provision in place, the question will, inevitably, be one of statutory interpretation.  So far as maximum penalties are concerned, that factor, at least for the period since the commencement of the Sentencing Procedure Act, will be governed by s 19, to which reference has been made and which gave statutory effect to the general law principle based on a presumption against adverse effects operating retrospectively, as explained in Samuels v Songaila (1977) 16 SASR 397.  Further, it is uncontroversial that a person may be charged in accordance with the substantive law in force at the time of the offending, even if later repealed: Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 30(1); Byrne v Garrisson [1965] VR 523 (Gowans J).
12It follows that the sentencing judge must sentence according to the penalties available at the time of the offending, taking into account the range of conduct covered by the offence.  The latter point is a matter of some importance in cases involving sexual assaults, such as the present.  Section 76 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), as in force in 1972, covered a far greater range of offending than any present equivalent provision.  Accordingly, it is necessary to identify the most serious kinds of offence in order to determine where, on the range of available penalties, the applicant's offences fall.  If the old provision covered conduct significantly more serious than that to which the offender has pleaded, the maximum penalty will be less relevant as a guide than would otherwise be the case.
13What has not been fully considered to date, is the potential operation of other statutory provisions.  Thus, in AJB and in Rosenstrauss, it was accepted that, in order to give effect to ""sentencing practices"" at the time of the offences, it would be appropriate to set a non-parole period of less than half the head sentence.  Similarly, in Magnusson, it appears to have been assumed that s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act was to be applied in sentencing for offences which pre-dated the commencement of the Act.  These assumptions depend upon the operation of the Sentencing Procedure Act, subject to the operation of the transitional provisions in Schedule 2 of the Act.
14In relation to facts, Smart AJ in PLV appeared to assume that the sentencing judge should take account of factual circumstances both at the date of offending and at the date of sentencing.  In practice, however, that approach is fraught with difficulty.  In PLV, there was no evidence of subsequent offending: thus, at the time of sentencing, it could readily be accepted that personal deterrence was a factor of very little weight.  Whether that could have been said at the time of the offence for which the applicant had been convicted was, as Smart AJ expressly noted, almost impossible to know.  In the present case, the point is live and of significance: when sentencing the applicant for the first offences, should the sentencing judge have limited his consideration to the facts known shortly after the offending, or should he have taken into account the history of subsequent offending?
15There is also the difficulty, adverted to by Spigelman CJ in MJR, of identifying how general law principles were to be identified and their application assessed at a distant point in time.  On the one hand, it may be expected that general principles will not have changed greatly.  One example of change, however, is the attitude towards pleas of guilty.  Thus, some recent cases have referred to R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 as identifying the discount for a plea of guilty, although it post-dated the conduct in question by decades.
16At a more abstract level, Spigelman CJ stated in MJR at [26] that ""a change in sentencing practice would require the Court to take into account the new practice even when sentencing for an offence that occurred many years before, e.g., an increased emphasis on general deterrence because of prevalence"".  When and in what circumstances that might be so was not addressed. 
17Attitudes towards offences and practices, as reflected in the application of general principles, can often be sought only in isolated reported authorities, statistics and the memory of the judge.  All of these sources are suspect in different ways.  Although in PLV Smart AJ (in dissent) accepted that reliance on memory, if available, was appropriate (at [107]-[108]), it would be anathema to the consistent application of legal principle if one offender were to obtain the benefit of a judge's experience and recollection that earlier sentences were more lenient, whereas another offender would not because another judge had no such experience or recollection.
18There is a further difficulty, illustrated by the present case.  To the extent that material is available which conveys in objectively assessable terms the practices and patterns of sentencing in prior times, it is often difficult to obtain and not readily available to solicitors and counsel appearing at first instance.  One result is that the material is only made available in this Court, a matter which will be addressed below.  The lack of readily available material is itself a factor which militates against requiring (or permitting) an overly sophisticated analysis of past practices.
19The appropriate resolution of these difficulties is to give primary attention to the range of penalties available (usually a maximum term of imprisonment) and the conduct to which such penalties applied at the date of the offence, in order to assess objectively where, on a broad scale, such offending was likely to fall.  These are matters to be determined by reference to the statutory provisions.  
Non-parole periods20In relation to non-parole periods, the first step must be to identify the statutory provision under which a non-parole period is to be fixed.  A formal system of recommendations for ""parole"" was first provided in this State by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1950 (NSW), which established a Parole Board to give advice to the Minister as to prisoners who should be given a ""written license to be at large"": Crimes Act, s 464A.  The first provision for specifying a ""non-parole period"" is to be found in the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW) (""the 1966 Act""), s 4(2).  That legislation remained in force until repealed by the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW) (""the 1983 Act"").  Accordingly, it was the 1966 Act which was in force at the time when the applicant committed his first offences.  
21The power of the new Board (created under the 1983 Act) to release a prisoner on parole extended to periods specified under earlier legislation and deemed to be ""non-parole periods"" by the savings and transitional provisions: the 1983 Act, Schedule 3, cll 2(1), 4 and 5.  The 1983 Act empowered a court to specify a non-parole period when sentencing an offender on or after the date of commencement of that Act, namely 27 February 1984, irrespective of when the person had been convicted and, therefore, when the offence was committed.  That Act and the Regulation made under it were repealed by the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) (""the 1989 Act""), s 56.  Thereafter, an offender sentenced to imprisonment was sentenced to a ""minimum term"" and an ""additional term"": s 5(1).  For the first time, a relationship was presumptively established, so that the additional term ""must not exceed one-third of the minimum term, unless the Court decides there are special circumstances"": the 1989 Act, s 5(2).
22Various supplementary procedural steps were required, which have continued, despite other changes in the statutory regime, to the present time.  For example, when fixing a minimum term, the court was required to ""specify the day on which the term commences or commenced and the day on which the prisoner will be eligible to be released from prison or on parole"": the 1989 Act, s 8(1).  The Act provided that the minimum and additional terms must not exceed the maximum period of imprisonment available for the offence, nor be less than the minimum period: the 1989 Act, s 10.  Prisoners could, thereafter, only be released on parole ""in accordance with"" the 1989 Act: s 14(1).  A prisoner was only eligible for release on parole if serving a sentence of imprisonment that had ""a minimum term"" and had served that term: s 14(2).  It was clear from the savings and transitional provisions that the new sentencing provisions applied to persons sentenced after the commencement of the relevant Part: Schedule 2, cl 8.  Existing sentences were ""translated"" into sentences consisting of a ""minimum term"" and ""an additional term"": Schedule 2, cl 5.  It would have been inconsistent with the scheme of the 1989 Act for an offender to be sentenced in accordance with repealed legislation, after the commencement of the 1989 Act. 
23It will be necessary to return in due course to the major change in the operation of the parole system effected by the 1989 Act, which was characterised as ""truth-in-sentencing"" and involved the abolition of remissions.  First, it is necessary to note the repeal of the 1989 Act by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 (NSW), which gave effect to the Sentencing Procedure Act.  Thereafter, the language of ""minimum term"" and ""additional term"" was abandoned, and, pursuant to the new legislative scheme, the court was required ""firstly, to set the term of the sentence"" and, ""secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence"": s 44(1).  The relationship between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence was maintained but expressed so that the ""non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less"": s 44(2).  There was, therefore, no change in the standard proportionate relationship of the non-parole period and the term of the sentence.  From the commencement of the 1999 legislation, parole was granted pursuant to the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW).  
24The savings, transitional and other provisions in Schedule 2 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, stated that a ""minimum term"" fixed under the 1989 Act was taken to be a ""non-parole period"" determined under the Sentencing Procedure Act: Schedule 2, cl 19.
25Before leaving the legislative history in relation to sentencing, it is necessary to identify the consequences of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 (NSW) (""the 2002 Amendment Act"").  That Act had three consequences presently relevant: first, it inserted a new s 3A in the Sentencing Procedure Act identifying the ""purposes of sentencing"".  Secondly, it replaced s 21A dealing with ""aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing"".  Thirdly, it replaced s 44, so that that section now requires the court first to set a non-parole period and then to fix the ""balance of the term of the sentence"".  The transitional provisions in relation to the new s 44 provide that the amendments ""do not apply to offences committed before the commencement of the amendments"": Schedule 2, Part 7, cl 45(1).  (There are exceptions to this principle, but they do not include s 44.)  The reason for this provision is by no means clear: the new s 44 would not appear to be adverse to the interests of offenders in such a way as to render retrospective effect inappropriate.  Further, the change can have no relevant consequence with respect to an offence committed before the 1989 Act, or at least the 1983 Act.  Nevertheless, the result appears to be that it is the repealed s 44 which must be applied in the present case.
Effect of remissions26It is now necessary to return to the real issue with respect to the fixing of a non-parole period.  As explained in Rosenstrauss, by reference to the history given in R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112; 46 A Crim R 340, the fixing of non-parole periods prior to the 1989 Act was heavily influenced by the remission system provided by the Prisons Regulations 1968 (NSW).  A first offender was entitled to ""ordinary"" remission of one-third of the sentence period, which, together with ""earned"" and ""special"" remissions, could lead to a reduction of almost half the sentence.  (Offenders who had been subject to earlier periods of imprisonment for three months or more were entitled to ""ordinary"" remission of one-quarter of the sentence.)  The result was that, at least for first offenders, an effective non-parole period was usually in the range of one-third to one-half of the sentence, so as to allow a period of supervised release.  
27From 1984, pursuant to the Probation and Parole Regulation 1984, remissions also applied to the non-parole period, so that proportionate reductions occurred to both the non-parole period and the head sentence.  Thereafter, a non-parole period could be fixed without the need to make allowance for the likely reduction in the head sentence by way of remissions.  (The position was later complicated by the conferral on the sentencing judge of a power to order that a period of imprisonment not be subject to some or any remissions which would have the effect of reducing the term of the non-parole period: 1983 Act, s 21A.)  The proper course for a sentencing judge to take before there was power to interfere with the operation of the remission system was discussed in numerous cases, including, in the High Court, Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 and The Queen v Paivinen [1985] HCA 39; 158 CLR 489.  In a later case, dealing with s 21A, The Queen v Watt [1988] HCA 58; 165 CLR 474, Brennan J described the position of the sentencing judge absent such a power in the following terms, at 483-484:
""As the sentencing judge was powerless to prevent a reduction in the non-parole period by remissions and constrained to ignore the possibility or likelihood of the reduction, the specification of a non-parole period became a solemn charade.  The sentencing judge, true to the direction given in Power, continued to specify a non-parole period which represented his view of the minimum period of detention which the crime called for, but the legislation denied practical effect to the order made.""
28If there were a cause for concern that sentencing judges would increase sentences to avoid the anticipated effect of remissions, once remissions were removed, there was cause for concern that there would be a countervailing reduction in sentences.  This Court, consistently with the view it had taken that remissions should be ignored, held that it would be incorrect, after their abolition, to seek to restore their effect by reducing a sentence: Maclay at 120 and 125.  Significantly for present purposes, in Maclay the offender relied on the unfairness caused by giving retrospective effect to the abolition of remissions.  The Court summarised the argument and its response in the following passage at 126-127:
""The offences were committed in late 1986 and early 1987.  If the appellant had been sentenced by Newton DCJ prior to 25 September 1989 he would have had a non-parole period of 15 months.  The transitional provisions of the 1989 Act would have resulted in a minimum term approximately equal to 15 months less anticipated remissions.  It was a matter of chance, or at least no fault of the appellant, that he had not been sentenced prior to 25 September 1989.  Therefore, so the argument runs, leaving entirely to one side any more general principles relating to the new Act, in this particular case fairness required the approach suggested. ... The first difficulty with the argument is that it appears to create, between the general run of cases which will fall to be dealt with under the new legislation, and the particular cases covered by the transitional provisions of that legislation, an intermediate category of indeterminate extent.  The Legislature has defined the cases to which the transitional provisions apply.  The present is not such a case.  Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to give practical content to the consideration of 'fairness' called in aid in support of the argument.""
29The Court admitted the possibility of exceptions to the rejection of that submission, but the example given was of a co-offender sentenced under the old system where principles of parity might require regard to be had to any reduction on account of remissions, so as to reduce the sentence of the offender sentenced after the legislation came into effect.
30Maclay's case is authority for the proposition that offenders sentenced after the commencement of the 1989 Act, but for offences which had been committed prior to that date, were not to be sentenced so as to achieve equality with earlier periods of imprisonment.  The purpose of the 1989 Act was to abandon the ""solemn charade"" of earlier years and to establish a new system of sentencing.  It would be a curious exercise in statutory construction, and the application of precedent, if courts in 2013 were required in some way to reconstruct the likely sentencing practices which pre-dated the 1989 Act.  
31The legislative regime set out above is inconsistent with the proposition that a court sentencing after the commencement of the Sentencing Procedure Act has power to fix a non-parole period (however described) under any earlier legislation.  Further, the legislative regime is inconsistent with a sentencing court now having power to disregard the statutory presumption as to the relationship between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence.  On the other hand, no doubt a court exercising powers under current legislation would be entitled to treat the fact that the offending occurred many years ago, under a different regime, as a form of ""special circumstances"" which might warrant departure from the statutory proportion: cf AJB at [37] (Howie J, Adams and Price JJ agreeing) and MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261 at [27] (Hidden J, Campbell JA agreeing) and [42] (Smart AJ).  It should not do so, however, to replicate perceived ""patterns of sentencing"" which pre-dated the 1989 Act.
Relevant facts32There remains the question of the relevant facts on which a sentence should be based.  So far as old offences are concerned, it is obviously necessary to have regard to the circumstances of the offending and other aggravating and mitigating circumstances, personal to the offender and the specific offence, which would have been known to a sentencing judge before whom the offender would have come soon after the offences were committed.  It is not necessary, however, to have regard to aspects of sentencing policy or social attitudes other than those revealed by the definition of the offending conduct and the range of penalties available at the time, as discussed above.
33So far as subsequent conduct is to be taken into account, questions of deterrence and assessment of remorse and the likelihood of rehabilitation (and indeed whether rehabilitation has already occurred) must be assessed at the time of sentencing.  Where an offender has led a subsequently blameless life, there is no reason why he or she should not obtain credit for that fact, even though it might not have been foreseen at the time of the original offending.  In the case of an offender with subsequent offences, it would be artificial to sentence in temporal segments, that is, sentencing for each offence as though the subsequent offending had not occurred.
Conclusions as to principles34It follows that the correct approach to the fixing of the sentence involves the following steps:
(a) determine the facts as now available to the court; (b) have regard to the maximum penalty in force at the time of the offending, as a guide to the range of punishment then available;(c) identify where, within the range of offending conduct covered by the offence charged, the offence under consideration falls;(d) fix the term of the sentence or sentences; (d) determine whether special circumstances require that the relationship prescribed by s 44 be varied, and(e) fix a non-parole period in accordance with s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act (as in force prior to the 2002 Amendment Act).
35In accordance with that approach, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to have regard to the actual patterns or practices of sentencing which are now believed to have operated at the time of the offending, whether based on acceptable statistical evidence, cases or memory.
36It follows that, the submission before this Court of additional material, including statistical and analytical material from 1981, should be rejected.  On that basis, it is unnecessary to consider whether it would have been within the proper role of this Court to take such material into account for the purpose of re-sentencing the applicant, on the basis of material which was not before the sentencing judge, though that may be doubted.
Application of principles37On the facts of the present case, I agree with orders proposed by Garling J and, subject to the foregoing analysis, with his reasons.38R A HULME J: I agree with the reasoning of Garling J and with the orders he proposes.
39GARLING J: On 31 May 2012, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total period of 5 years and 6 months without parole, with a balance of term of a further 3 years.
40The total period of imprisonment resulted from the sentences which were imposed consequent upon a plea of guilty by the applicant to 7 counts on the indictment which was presented.
41Set out below in tabular form, are the counts which he faced, together with the details of the terms of imprisonment which were imposed:CT NO.OFFENCE & YEAROFFENCE CREATING PROVISION / MAX PENALTYHEAD SENTENCE / NPPDATES11972Indecent assault female under 16 years s. 76* / 5yr* Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)Fixed Term / 12 months18 Jan 2011 - 17 Jan 201221972Indecent assault female under 16 years s. 76 / 5yrFixed Term / 12 months18 Jan 2011- 17 Jan 201231977 - 1979Indecent assault female under 16 yearss. 76 / 6yr****Increased in 1974Fixed Term / 18 months18 Jul 2011 - 17 Jan 201341977 - 1979Indecent assault female under 16 yearss. 76 / 6yrFixed Term / 18 months18 Jul 2011 - 17 Jan 2035Nov. 1997 - Aug. 2000Indecent assault child under 10 yearss. 61M(2) / 10yrFixed Term / 2 years18 Jan 2012 - 17 Jan 20146Nov. 1997 - Aug. 2000Indecent assault child under 10 yearss. 61M(2) / 10yrFixed Term / 2 ½ years18 Jan 2012 - 17 Jul 20147Nov. 1997 - Aug. 2000Attempted sexual intercourse child under 10 yearss. 66B / 20yr6 ½ years / 3 ½ years18 Jan 2013 - 19 Jul 2019
42On 22 April 2013, the applicant lodged a notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against the severity of his sentences.  
Facts43A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing judge.  A brief summary of these facts is set out below.
44There are some matters of general application.  The applicant was born in May 1940 and accordingly, at the time of the sentence which was imposed, he was 72 years old.  As a result of events in 2011, when he was working as a bus driver, the victims of his offending provided statements to the police.  
45On 18 January 2011, the applicant was arrested by police.  Whilst at the Liverpool Police Station, he took part in an electronically recorded interview during which he made a number of admissions.  
46After he was charged, he was remanded in custody and has remained in custody ever since.
47A brief summary of the facts of each individual count is necessary.  As will be apparent, Counts 1 to 4 describe the applicant's conduct in which the victim was his daughter.  Counts 5 to 7 describe the applicant's conduct in which the victim was his grand-daughter. 
Count 148In 1972, the applicant, with his wife and children, was living at their home in Picton.  In the latter part of 1972, the applicant told his daughter to follow him into his bedroom at the family house.  Once inside the bedroom, the applicant lay down on the bed and told his daughter to stand beside the bed.  At that time, his daughter, who was seven years old, was naked.  She was told by the applicant to play with his penis.  The applicant took his daughter's hand, placed it on his penis and began to move her hand up and down his penis, whereupon it became erect.
49This conduct constituted the offence in Count 1.  
Count 250At the same time, and in the same circumstances, after the conduct which constituted Count 1, the applicant told his daughter to suck his penis like a lollipop.  He then placed his hand on the back of her head and moved her head down towards his penis.  
51His daughter resisted slightly, and before any contact with his penis was made, the applicant stopped what he was doing.
52This conduct constituted Count 2.
Count 353The events covered by Count 3 occurred during the summer holidays when the applicant's daughter was about 12 years of age, in the period between December 1977 and February 1979.  She had accompanied her father to the Central Coast where they were to stay at the house of her aunt and uncle.  
54Whilst at the aunt and uncle's place, the applicant and his daughter stayed in a caravan on the property.  There was only one bed in the caravan.  Whilst his daughter was asleep in bed one morning, the applicant pushed up against her back, whilst she was lying on her side, and then proceeded to fondle both of her breasts on the outside of her clothing.
55This constituted the events in Count 3.
Count 456At the same time, and in the same circumstances, shortly after the events in Count 3, the applicant moved his hand down towards his daughter's waist, pulling her in more closely to his body and pushing his penis against her buttocks.  He then moved his hands from where they had been, fondling her breasts on the outside of her clothing, to her groin area and began rubbing her vagina from outside her clothing.  The applicant's daughter pulled away.
57Although Counts 3 and 4 occurred at the same time and in the same circumstances, they were separated by about five years from the events in Counts 1 and 2, which occurred at the same time and in the same circumstances.
Count 558In the period between 30 November 1997 and 11 August 2000, on a number of occasions, the applicant's grand-daughter travelled from her residence in Canberra to stay with the applicant in a caravan at the rear of his brother's premises at Ingleburn.  During one of the summer holidays, during that period, the applicant's grand-daughter was asleep in the caravan on one evening, when the applicant returned to the caravan.  The applicant's grand-daughter was awoken when the applicant got into bed with her.  The applicant hugged her normally at first and then slid his hand up under her shirt onto her bare skin, and commenced touching her breasts.
Count 659This occurred at the same time as, but shortly after, the events in Count 5.  The applicant moved his hand down to his grand-daughter's groin region, placing his hand on her vagina.  His grand-daughter did not have any underwear on at the time and the applicant touched her vagina directly and continued to do so for about five minutes.
Count 760Immediately after the actions in the previous two counts, whilst he was in bed with his grand-daughter, the applicant pushed her legs apart and placed his penis at the entrance of her vagina.  
61His grand-daughter said that it hurt, and the applicant ceased the activity and did nothing further.  He then stood up and left the caravan.
62No penetration actually occurred.
63At the time of the conduct in Counts 5, 6 and 7, it was agreed that the applicant's grand-daughter was under the age of 10.  
Evidence on Sentence64The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing.  In the course of the evidence, the applicant proffered an apology to the whole of his family including in particular his daughter and grand-daughter, who were the victims of his conduct.  He gave evidence that he was in protective custody.  He said he was unable to work in prison because no work was available to prisoners in that area of the jail.  He said that, except for one occasion for the purpose of signing some formal documents, he had not been visited whilst in jail by his family, and that he had given his former wife, to whom he was married at the time he was arrested, all of his property and belongings.
65He said that he was generally not in particularly good health, but that he was keen to return to adherence to the faith of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
66In addition to a Pre-Sentence Report, the sentencing judge also had available to him a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt of 23 March 2012.  That report encapsulated a clinical evaluation which Dr Allnut had undertaken with respect to the applicant.
67Dr Allnut's detailed report failed to identify any explanation for the offences to which the applicant had pleaded.  Dr Allnut identified that at the time of his contact with the applicant, the applicant was suffering from symptoms consistent with an adjustment disorder, with anxious mood, which would not constitute a major psychiatric condition.  He attributed that adjustment disorder to the circumstances of the applicant being in custody, and having entered a plea of guilty to the various counts on the indictment.  He summarised the applicant's position in this way:
""Overall in relation to the offences he is currently charged with, he presents as an individual who would be regarded as causing relatively low concern for further sexual recidivism predominantly because his offending has been of an incestuous nature and incest offenders as a group ...[manifest the] lowest risk of future sexual recidivism compared to other sex offender groups ...""
68Dr Allnut did not think that the rediscovery of the applicant's religious faith would have any impact upon his risk of sexual recidivism.
Remarks on Sentence69Having recounted the applicant's subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge summarised the facts underlying each of the counts on the indictment.  He noted, and took into account, the fact that the applicant volunteered to the police when he was interviewed that his grand-daughter was under the age of 10 at the time of the offence.  She had informed police that she thought she was ""about 11 years old"".  The fact that his grand-daughter was below the age of 10 meant that the applicant could be charged with more serious offences.
70The sentencing judge noted, as was the fact, that the applicant had entered a plea of guilty to all of the offences at the earliest opportunity.  This early plea entitled the applicant to a discount of 25 per cent in accordance with the guideline judgment of R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  This was conceded by the Crown.
71His Honour noted that the first four offences were committed in the 1970s, and noted that he was obliged to sentence the applicant consistently with the law as it stood at that time, and the approach which was adopted by sentencing Courts at that time.  
72His Honour found that he was satisfied that the applicant was remorseful for the hurt, distress and damage which he had caused to his daughter and grand-daughter, and that it was unlikely that he would offend again. 
73His Honour found that the applicant's health problems were of significance, and would impact upon him adversely during his time in custody.  His Honour found special circumstances.
74His Honour noted that, in particular, the age of the applicant's daughter and grand-daughter at the time of the offences were ""potent factors"" in the sentencing process, and further, that the ""breach of trust"" was also a relevant factor to take into account.  
75He accepted the submission made by the Crown that 
""recognition needs to be given to the fact that children in a family situation are virtually helpless against sexual attacks by a male parent and the children have the right to be protected from sexual molestation within the family.""
76His Honour found, in accordance with the Crown's submissions, that the conduct in Count 7 was the most serious, and that all of the offences were distressing to the victims.
Notice of Appeal77On 22 April 2013, the applicant filed a notice of his Application for Leave to Appeal.  To that notice he attached the following grounds:
""1. The sentences imposed on Counts 1-4 which were committed in the 1970s were manifestly excessive, having regard to sentencing patterns that existed at the time of the offences.
2. The sentence imposed on Count 7 was manifestly excessive by virtue of either:
(a) the length of the sentence failing to reflect a considerable degree of leniency by virtue of his admission; or
(b) the partial accumulation of the Count 7 sentence on the sentences imposed for Counts 5 and 6; or
(c) both of the above.""
Ground 1: Manifest Excess Having Regard to Sentencing Patterns at Time of Offence78In R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368, Spigelman CJ, with whom Grove and Sully JJ, and Newman AJ agreed, held at [31] that it was appropriate for a Court to take into account:
""... the sentencing practice as at the date of commission of an offence when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender.""
79MJR approved an earlier decision of this Court in R v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37, in which Badgery-Parker J, with whom Mahoney JA and Hunt CJ at CL agreed, approved as correct the trial judge's expressed approach to his task which was as follows, namely, that as far as possible, the sentencing judge should:
""... seek to impose upon the offender a sentence appropriate not only to then applicable statutory maxima, but also to then appropriate sentencing patterns.""
80The principle in Shore, as approved in MJR, has been regularly applied by this Court since the decision was delivered.
81The most recent example of this is the decision of this Court in Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50.  However, application of the principle has been difficult: see Whealy J in R v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534; (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at [23], Smart AJ in R v PLV [2001] NSWCCA 282; (2001) 51 NSWLR 736 at [107] and Sully J in MJR at [104].  
82The difficulty arises because the sentencing court is being asked to reflect sentencing patterns or practices from earlier times, in a sentence being imposed at a much later time.  In order so to do, the court must have a clear picture of what those earlier sentencing patterns and practices were.  And, that picture must be as comprehensive as is possible.
83In some circumstances, it will be possible for the relevant sentencing pattern to be capable of being readily discerned.  As cases such as Shore, Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71; (2008) 183 A Crim R 540, PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84; 216 A Crim R 365, and Magnuson show, a comprehensive identification of similar cases, or else references to readily available statistical databases may assist in establishing earlier sentencing patterns.  But, as experience shows, such sources need to be considered with some care because of inherent difficulties with them.  For example, are the cited cases truly representative of those decided over the period, or else how is it that the statistical tables or analyses provided take into account, and identify, the wide variations in objective criminality and subjective circumstances.  Statistical tables of sentencing outcomes are always to be treated with care.
84However, if a sentencing pattern is readily, and reliably discernable, then such material ought be put before the sentencing court for it to be taken into account.  Ordinarily, it is not to be thought that a sentencing court will know, without assistance, what earlier sentencing patterns were.  Much less is it to be ordinarily thought to be appropriate that material of this kind is not put before a sentencing judge and then is deployed on an appeal to this Court. 
85Whether or not such a sentencing pattern can be reliably discerned, other historical matters relevant to sentencing practice can be identified, and ought be considered as part of the sentencing process.  One such historical matter is the then existing statutory regimes under which a person would have been sentenced, including whether the legislation provided for, or else sentencing practices reflected, non-parole periods of a specific length or ratio to the overall sentence: see AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51 169 A Crim R 32 at [36]-[38] per Howie J, Adams and Price JJ agreeing; MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261 at [27] per Hidden J, Campbell JA agreeing, at [43]-[48] per Smart AJ, Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [16] per Basten JA.
86However, in ascertaining any legislative provisions which may impact upon sentencing practices, the court does not engage in understanding the impact, if any, of executive practices on sentence.  A ready example was the, now discontinued, executive practice of granting remissions to prisoners with respect to their head sentence: see AJB at [31].  Even if this practice was not truly an executive one, the operation of the remission system ought not be reflected in sentences which are imposed now: Rosenstrauss at [10]-[12] per Basten JA, R S Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing.
87The guide which is entirely objective and is easily ascertainable, and therefore which is likely to be of most use to a sentencing court, when attempting to impose sentences which accord with an earlier practice or pattern, is the maximum penalty fixed by the law for the offence charged, together with the range of criminality encompassed by the offence charged.  By having regard to these features, a sentencing judge will be able to readily assess where the particular offence charged falls along the spectrum of conduct encapsulated in the offence, and accordingly how the particular offence ought be viewed against the maximum penalty fixed by the legislation.
88As Howie J said in Moon at [70]:
""The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender, for the particular crime committed.  Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender, and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the seriousness of the offence: Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349, and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed: Veen (1979) 143 CLR 458.  Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence.""
89Finally, reference should be made to the fact that in some cases, judicial recollection has formed a basis for, or else has provided a confirmation of, the existence of a sentencing practice or pattern: see Bell JA in Featherstone at [45], R S Hulme J in PWB at [68] and Button J in Magnuson at [127]-[129].
90However, the use of judicial recollection is apt to be unreliable and can be inequitable in its application.  It is apt to be unreliable because it arises out of the experience of a particular judge which may not reflect a sufficiently broad base or depth of experience to allow the formation of a view as to a broad-based sentencing practice.  As well, the greater the passage of time, then the less reliable a recollection becomes.  As McHugh JA said, albeit in a different context, ""memories fade"": Herron v McGregor (1986) 6 NSWLR 246 at 254E.  His Honour's remarks in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 107, about the fallibility of human recollection and the greater margin for error as the time period increases, are applicable in principle here.  
91As well, there is an inequity in relying on judicial recollection, because whether the particular judge allocated to conduct the sentencing hearing has such a recollection or not, is purely a matter of chance.  The longer the time period between when the events occurred and the time at which the sentence is being imposed, the greater the prospect is that the allocated judge will not have any recollection of earlier sentencing patterns or procedures.  In such a case, an applicant may be disadvantaged when compared with a case in which the judge claims to have such a recollection.  
92As well, the use of judicial recollection can, if it is to be the principal basis for the establishment of a sentencing pattern, lead to procedural injustice.  How is it that one challenges the judge's stated judicial recollection?  What if it is wrong or if it differs from another judge's recollection?  Does a party to the sentencing process in front of that particular judge lead material to point out that other judges have different recollections?  If so, in what form should that be led?  None of these steps provide a particularly attractive reason for the use of judicial recollection.  There is no great benefit to be gained from the use of such judicial recollection, and seemingly significant prejudice may arise from its use.  Very great care must be taken in cases in which such recollections are accessed.
93This Court has held that when sentences were imposed when the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 was in operation (as it was at the time of the offences in counts 1 to 4), the non-parole periods imposed were usually in the order of one-third to one-half of the head sentence: See: AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51 at [36]; GRD v R [2009] NSWCCA 149 at [20]; and BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [154]-[156].  This is factor that a sentencing judge should take into account in considering whether there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
94Against this background of discussion of principle, it is necessary to see what the sentencing judge did in this case.  His Honour was referred to the principles to which I have drawn attention, at least in the broad.  His Honour was not provided with any table of cases, or other research material which would have enabled him to establish the existing sentencing patterns.  
95He did, however, have his attention drawn to the approach taken by Howie J in Moon, which involved considering the primacy of the maximum sentence imposed for the offence and the range of conduct which fell within the offence as it then stood.  
96Counts 1 to 4 on the indictment charged offences under s 76 of the Crimes Act 1900, which as it then stood, was the offence of indecent assault against a child under the age of 16 years.  It was repealed in 1981.  At the time of the offences in Counts 1 and 2, the maximum penalty was 5 years.  At the time of the offences in Counts 3 and 4, the maximum penalty had been increased to 6 years.
97The offence of indecent assault, contrary to s 76, included within it many offences which today fall to be categorised as sexual assault under current legislation.  Prohibited conduct, involving penetration and including fellatio and cunnilingus, were included within the offence under s 76.  There was then a much broader range of conduct susceptible to charges under this section: see BP at [158] per Fullerton J; Nelson v R [2007] NSWCCA 221 at [17] per Latham J.
98Although not the subject of Ground 1, it is convenient here to describe Counts 5, 6 and 7.  Counts 5 and 6 charged offences against s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  An offence against s 61M(2) deals with conduct by way of indecent assault which is aggravated by the fact that the victim was under the age of 16 years.  It does not include sexual assault by way of sexual intercourse as that term is defined in s 61H of the Crimes Act.  The range of conduct capable of being charged under this section is not as broad as under s 76.  Count 7 charged an offence against s 66B of the Crimes Act of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years.  It carried a maximum penalty of 20 years.  
99In respect of each offence, the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the applicant's early pleas of guilty.  He was well entitled to do this.  
100The sentencing judge described each of the offences in Counts 1 and 2 as ""extremely serious"" but made no attempt to relate the conduct to the spectrum of conduct which was covered by s 76.
101In determining the sentence, the judge imposed a fixed term of 12 months.  In so doing, the judge indicated that it was his intention to impose a non-parole period of 12 months, with a balance of term of 12 months, that is, a total sentence of 2 years.  He thought, in light of the other sentences which were being imposed at the same time, it was more expedient to impose a fixed term of imprisonment equivalent to the non-parole period.  No complaint is made about the use of a fixed term.  In the complex of sentences which the judge was dealing with, this was an appropriate way to proceed.
102In order to consider whether the sentence imposed was excessive, it is appropriate to first consider the notional point at which the sentencing judge started.  The effective undiscounted sentence imposed on the applicant for each of Counts 1 and 2, which were wholly concurrent, was 2 years 8 months.  This is the commencing point for the consideration of the ultimate sentence imposed.  This starting point was over half of the maximum sentence available.  The applicant submitted that this was, in the result, manifestly excessive and that, in accordance with the sentencing practice at the time, the applicant was unlikely to have received custodial sentences at all, let alone those of the length imposed.
103The Crown accepts that for cases of indecent assault, the sentencing practice of the 1970's did not mandate a custodial sentence in every case, but submitted that for indecent assault cases ""... ordinarily a custodial sentence would be appropriate ..."": see Hunt CJ at CL in R v Baxter (NSWCCA, unreported, 25 May 1994) and also R v Mark O'Sullivan (NSWCCA, unreported, 22 October 1989).
104The Crown also accepts that the offences in Counts 1 and 2 were not the most serious of their kind since they did not involve penetration.  However, the Crown submits that they were nevertheless serious because they involved a victim who was only 7 years old, and the offences being committed by a father upon his daughter amounted to a breach of trust of the highest order.
105This Court held in Magnuson that the pattern of sentencing which existed in the 1970's and 1980's for sexual offences against children was such that the sentences were shorter than those which would be imposed now, for equivalent offending conduct.
106I am prepared to accept, as did the sentencing judge, that the offences were serious because of the extent of the breach of trust involved, but what was required of the sentencing judge was that he should have made an assessment of where the offences fell on the spectrum of conduct encompassed by an offence against s 76 of the Crimes Act.  This he failed to do.  Having regard to that range, I am not satisfied that these offences fell above the mid-point of the range.  On the contrary, the criminality fell well below that mid-point and could not justify the sentences which was imposed for Counts 1 and 2.  
107I am satisfied that the sentences for Counts 1 and 2 were manifestly excessive when viewed in the context of the sentencing practice of the time.  It needs to be emphasised that this conclusion does not reflect, nor is it intended to reflect, current sentencing practices.  
108The sentencing judge imposed the sentences on Counts 3 and 4 in a similar way to Counts 1 and 2.  His Honour described the conduct as serious, but again made no assessment of where the conduct lay along the spectrum of conduct encompassed by the offence of aggravated indecent assault under s 76.
109He also imposed a fixed term of 18 months on each Count.  In so doing, he indicated that each fixed term was equal to the term which he would have imposed by way of a non-parole period, and that he would have imposed a balance of term of a further 18 months.
110The starting point for this sentence, prior to the reduction for the plea of guilty, was therefore a total of 4 years.  This represents an undiscounted sentence of two-thirds of the maximum then available of 6 years.
111The applicant submits that the sentences imposed were, for reasons essentially similar to those put with respect to Counts 1 and 2, manifestly excessive having regard to the sentencing practices at the time. 
112The Crown submits that the sentences imposed ""whilst firm"", were within the discretionary range, particularly having regard to the fact that the conduct was the second separate occasion upon which an indecent assault had been perpetrated by the applicant upon his daughter.  The Crown submits that, although the victim was older than at the time of the indecent assaults in Counts 1 and 2, she was nevertheless still quite young and well below the age of 16 which was proscribed by the section.  
113Having regard to the spectrum of criminality which was encompassed by the offence charged, the objective criminality of these offences was not above the mid-point of the range. I am satisfied that the criminality fell below that mid-point, and objectively, was at the lower end of the range. 
114In my view, the sentences for Counts 3 and 4 were manifestly excessive.
115As between Counts 1 and 2 on the one hand and Counts 3 and 4 on the other, the applicant submits that the period of accumulation of 6 months was excessive, and there should not have been any accumulation.  This submission is reflected in the submission that both sentences were manifestly excessive.  
116There are two difficulties with this submission about accumulation.  The first is that the offences on Counts 1 and 2 and those on Counts 3 and 4 were separated by a period of more than 5 years, and were entirely separate instances of criminality.  Unless the sentencing judge provided for some accumulation, he would have failed to reflect the totality of the criminality involved.  The second difficulty is that the submission of the applicant's counsel to the sentencing judge accepted that there should be an accumulation as between Counts 1 and 2 on the one hand, and Counts 3 and 4 on the other, albeit he submitted that the accumulation should be "" ... a matter of months, rather than years"" 
117I would not be prepared to accept that there can be any legitimate complaint about the fact that the sentencing judge accumulated by a period of 6 months the sentences in respect of Counts 3 and 4 on the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1 and 2.  The accumulation meant that the applicant was serving an effective period of 6 months for Counts 1 and 2.  There is nothing about accumulation of that order, in light of the sentences which were imposed, that is excessive.  I would not be prepared to uphold the applicant's submissions with respect to this aspect of Ground 1.  
Ground 2: Count 7 Sentence was Manifestly Excessive118It is convenient to consider Counts 5, 6 and 7 together because the events encompassed by these Counts were part of a course of events on a single day.  They were closely proximate to each other in point of time.  As well, these events occurred relatively recently, and the principles connected with sentencing for historical events are of less significance.
119The notional commencing point, before any discount for the plea of guilty, for the sentence for Count 5, was 4 years 8 months.  The maximum penalty for this offence, which was one contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, was 10 years.  Hence the penalty imposed was marginally below the mid-point of the maximum penalty.  
120The sentence for Count 6 prior to the discount for the plea of guilty, was a total sentence of 6 years in the context of a maximum penalty of 10 years.  
121The applicant accepts that while these sentences are high, it cannot be said that they are manifestly excessive.  Accordingly, there is no specific appeal against the length of the sentences.  But it is necessary to understand those sentences so as to provide the context against which the applicant's appeal in respect of the sentence on Count 7 is to be viewed.
122As is obvious, Count 7, namely an offence of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age contrary to s 66B of the Crimes Act, is the most serious of the offences with which the applicant was charged, and to which he pleaded guilty.  It carried a maximum penalty of 20 years.  Prior to allowing the discount for the plea of guilty, the starting point of the applicant's sentence was a total sentence of 8 years and 8 months.
123The applicant submits that this sentence was manifestly excessive because:
(a)it failed to give adequate effect to the voluntary admissions made by the applicant about the victim's age, which had the effect of disclosing an aggravating factor, namely that the victim was under 10 years old at the time of the offence, when that was contrary to the material disclosed to the police by the victim; and
(b)the sentencing judge erroneously accumulated the sentence by 12 months on the sentence for Counts 5 and 6.
124There is no doubt, and the Crown accepts, that the voluntary disclosure of an aggravating element of an offence which was not previously known to police is a matter which must be taken into account by a sentencing judge ""on the credit side of the sentencing process"": see Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at [15] per McHugh J, R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603; R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [36] per Basten JA.  
125The sentencing judge was referred to this feature with respect to Count 7 and said in his Remarks on Sentence that he would take it into account.  He did not apply an identified discount for this volunteered element, but that is not erroneous because attempting, in these circumstances, to quantify a percentage discount ""... is apt to lead to error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion"": see Ryan at [17] per McHugh J.
126The offence was, as his Honour recognised, a serious one.  The victim, the applicant's grand-daughter, was younger than 10.  She was staying with the applicant at the time and was in his care.  She was defenceless and vulnerable.  The offence involved a grave breach of trust and a deliberate exploitation of the familial relationship by the applicant.  And the applicant was a man who, on 2 previous separate occasions, had indecently assaulted his own daughter.  Thus, he did not come before the Court as a man of previous good character with respect to the offences in Counts 5, 6 and 7.  Even allowing for all of the matters favourable to the applicant, including his volunteered assistance, and recognising that the applicant, a man of advanced years, will be spending his term of imprisonment in protective custody, about which there was some evidence before the sentencing judge, I am unable to accept that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
127For an applicant to succeed on this ground, he is required to demonstrate that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325; [6] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J.  There is no one single correct sentence, as due allowance must be made for differing judicial opinions in an evaluative exercise, which opinions nevertheless are still in accordance with principle: Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] per Hoeben J (Tobias JA and James J agreeing).  I accept that the sentence imposed for Count 7 falls at the high end of the appropriate range of sentences, but I am not persuaded that it falls outside the range of a permissible exercise of sentencing discretion.
128However, this conclusion does not deal with the issue of the appropriateness of the period of accumulation imposed by the judge, and whether this means that the total effective sentence is manifestly excessive.  
129In respect of Counts 5, 6 and 7, the sentencing judge ordered that Counts 5 and 6 be wholly concurrent, and that there should be a period of accumulation of 12 months between those two Counts and the Count 7 offence.  
130It is to be recalled that the facts relating to these three Counts showed that all three offences occurred on the same day and at the same time following on from each other.  The conduct charged under Count 7 formed the final act in a single course of conduct.  The applicant's counsel submitted to the sentencing judge that the sentences on these three Counts should be made wholly concurrent because there was a single course of conduct.  
131The Crown's submissions to the sentencing judge drew attention to matters of principle with respect to concurrence and accumulation, and concluded in these terms:
""The Crown submits at the very least, the sentence penalty of imprisonment which is to be imposed should be partially accumulated between the three different incidents.  Further, there should be greater accumulation between Counts 1-4 and 5-7 as these involve separate victims.  This would ensure that the criminality against each victim and each incident is adequately addressed."" (sic)
132In oral submissions to the sentencing judge, the advocate for the Crown was specifically asked about the question of accumulation, and did not make any submission which differed from that which he had put in writing.  
133There is no general rule of law that determines whether a sentence must be concurrent in whole or in part, or else consecutive: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [47] per Howie J.  The overarching principle was expressed by Howie J in R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [56], where his Honour said that the question to be asked is whether the sentence for one offence encompasses the criminality of all of the offences.
134Recently, in Franklin v R [2013] NSWCCA 122, Hoeben CJ at CL said:
""There is no rule that sentences for offences committed on the same day, or as part of the same criminal enterprise should be served concurrently.  A sentence should not be 'concurrent' simply because of the similarity of the conduct or because it may be seen as part of the one course of criminal conduct: R v Jarrold, Howie J at [56]).  The question to be asked is whether the criminality of the offence can be encompassed in the criminality of the other offence (Cahyadi v R).  If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative, otherwise there is a risk that the sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences.  This is so regardless of whether the offences can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality (Cahyadi v R at [27]).""
135The applicant submits to this Court that the sentencing judge intended that the sentences for Counts 5, 6 and 7 be served concurrently because they all formed part of the one act, but in the course of his Remarks on Sentence erroneously fixed the commencement date as 18 January 2013 (which meant that there was a period of accumulation of 12 months) rather than 18 January 2012 (which meant that the sentences with Counts 5 and 6 would be wholly concurrent).  
136The applicant ultimately submitted that by reason of the 12 month accumulation which was imposed, the effective sentence for the conduct encompassed in Counts 5, 6 and 7 was manifestly excessive and did not reflect properly the totality of the criminality involved.
137The Crown submitted that the decision as to whether to partially accumulate multiple sentences is fundamentally an exercise within the discretion of the judge.  The Crown drew attention to the statement of Simpson J in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] where her Honour said:
""There will be many cases in which sentencing judges may take differing views but neither could be said to be wrong.""
138The Crown accordingly submitted that the structuring of the sentences as between Counts 5, 6 and 7 with a period of accumulation was open to the sentencing judge, and was not erroneous.
139Necessarily, a consideration of this ground of appeal is entirely dependent upon the particular facts, matters and circumstances of the offending.  As the authorities, to which reference has been made, indicate, there is no general rule.  The period of accumulation was one half of the sentence for Count 5 and a little under half of the sentence for Count 6.  
140Having regard to the particular facts, matters and circumstances in this case, I am satisfied that the applicant is correct in his submission that the effective sentence for Count 7, was by reason of the period of accumulation, manifestly excessive.  
141I do not think that the circumstances were such that it was, in light of the starting point of the sentence for Count 7, of 8 years 8 months, and 6 years 6 months after reduction for the early plea of guilty, inappropriate for the sentencing judge to make all three sentences entirely concurrent.  In my opinion, the sentence imposed on Count 7 was adequate to encompass the criminality inherent in the entire incident. In other words, the events upon which Counts 5 and 6 are based add little, if anything, to the serious criminality involved in Count 7.
142Hence, I am of the opinion that the applicant has succeeded in establishing that by reason of the accumulation of the sentence for Count 7 on the sentences for Counts 5 and 6, the effective sentence in respect of Count 7 was manifestly excessive.
Re-sentencing143In addition to the material that was before the sentencing judge, an affidavit of the applicant has been placed before this Court, to be taken into account if the Court was obliged to engage in re-sentencing the applicant.  
144This affidavit indicates that whilst he has been in custody, the applicant has been well behaved and has not committed any offences against jail discipline.  The applicant remains on protection, and is in an area described as the ""Special Area Management Protection"".  This is not as restrictive as his previous form of protective custody.  
145Although there are limited courses available by way of education, the applicant has undertaken a number of education courses successfully.  
146It is clear from this affidavit that the applicant does not have any contact with his family and is visited only occasionally by members of the local Kingdom Hall of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
147The applicant's conduct represented significant breaches of trust, and as is apparent from previous remarks in these reasons, involving victims who were closely related to him, and who were vulnerable and defenceless.
148Nevertheless, in re-sentencing the applicant, the Court is constrained, as a matter of principle, to impose sentences with respect to Counts 1 to 4 which reflect past sentencing practices.  
149It is demonstrable that were the applicant to commit these offences today, and be sentenced for them, he would receive far heavier penalties than those which the Court is lawfully entitled to impose with respect to offences from many years ago.
150As the applicant is being re-sentenced under the current legislation, it is appropriate to consider whether there are special circumstances which would warrant the balance of the term being more than one-third of the non-parole period: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
151I am satisfied that there are special circumstances in this matter which would warrant varying the ratio fixed by the legislation. This is the applicant's first period of imprisonment, which needs to be considered in the context of his age when taken into custody, and his need for an appropriate period of supervision in the community. As well, the historical practice of fixing a non-parole period of between one-third and one-half of an overall sentence, to which I referred in [93], is a matter, which combined with the circumstances just mentioned, constitutes special circumstances.
152Taking into account all of the matters relating to the objective seriousness of the offences, and all of the subjective circumstances of the applicant, and adopting the same approach as the sentencing judge to the appropriate use of fixed term sentences, I would impose the following sentences.
153On Count 1 - Offence of indecent assault of female, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 18 January 2011.  
154On Count 2 - I would impose an identical sentence with respect to Count 1 and I would make the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 wholly concurrent.
155On each of Counts 3 and 4 - I would impose a sentence of a fixed term of 9 months.  The sentences on Counts 3 and 4 should be wholly concurrent.
156The individual sentences on Counts 5, 6 and 7 as imposed by the sentencing judge are not to be shortened.  
157It is then a matter to determine, in light of the new sentence proposed, the appropriate periods of accumulation, in order to ensure that the whole of the criminality involved is appropriately punished.  This approach reflects the need to have regard to the principle of totality, and to consider the entirety of the sentences, and the effective period of imprisonment which ought to be imposed in light of the whole of the criminality involved: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
158As between Counts 1 and 2 on the one hand, and Counts 3 and 4 on the other, in light of the sentences proposed, it is appropriate there should be a period of accumulation of three months.  This would have the effect that the sentences on Counts 3 and 4 would commence on 18 April 2011.  
159The sentences on Counts 5 and 6 were accumulated by 6 months on Counts 3 and 4.  There is no reason to disturb this period of accumulation.  However, there will need to be an adjustment to reflect the earlier starting date of the sentences on Counts 3 and 4.  As a consequence, the commencement date for the sentences on Counts 5 and 6 ought be 18 October 2011.
160Count 7 should not be accumulated on Counts 5 and 6, so that the sentence on Count 7 should commence on 18 October 2011.  The effect of this adjustment in sentences and commencement dates is that the applicant will serve an effective term which is 15 months shorter than that imposed by the sentencing judge.  
161Because of the provisions of Clause 45(1) of Part 7 of Schedule 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999, it is necessary to impose a sentence with respect to Count 7 which is in the manner required by the legislation which pre-existed the introduction of the present s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, by the passage of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002.
162Accordingly, the first date upon which he will be eligible for release is 17 April 2015 rather than 17 July 2016.  
Orders163I propose the following orders:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.
(2)Set aside each of the sentences imposed by Delaney DCJ on 31 May 2012
(3)In lieu of those sentences, the applicant is to be sentenced as follows:
Count 1: A fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months, commencing on 18 January 2011 and finishing on 17 July 2011.
Count 2: A fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months, commencing on 18 January 2011 and finishing on 17 July 2011.
Count 3: A fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months, commencing on 18 April 2011 and finishing on 17 January 2012.
Count 4: A fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months, commencing on 18 April 2011 and finishing on 17 January 2012.
Count 5: A fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years, commencing on 18 October 2011 and finishing on 17 October 2013.
Count 6: A fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 18 October 2011 and finishing on 17 April 2014.
Count 7: A total term of imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months, commencing on 18 October 2011 with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.
The first date upon which the applicant will become eligible to be released on parole is 17 April 2015.

2762397,Sanders v Dr Hillier [2013] NSWDC 192,"Judgment
Introduction
1The plaintiff by statement of claim filed on 15 December 2011 brings proceedings for damages for professional negligence against the defendant, an orthopaedic surgeon. The negligence was identified by counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Campbell, in his closing submissions, namely that the defendant had ""failed to diagnose that she had a developing small bowel obstruction in a timely fashion"" (T 416, plaintiff's submissions, paragraph 1).  Before setting out the factual background to the claim, it is necessary to identify how the claim was initially framed, as the expert reports were prepared, and evidence given during the trial, on a different basis.
2The case was opened to me on the basis that the defendant had caused a breach of the plaintiff's peritoneum to occur, either during or after spinal surgery he performed (T 7) and that, despite ""significant"" and ""unusual"" (T 5) symptoms, he failed to diagnose the plaintiff's medical condition while she was in hospital (T 7). When the plaintiff consulted the defendant after discharge, ""again, Dr Hillier failed to diagnose what the problem actually was""; instead, he referred her to another doctor who ""missed it as well"" (T 6). A third doctor diagnosed a blockage and proposed performing a gastroscopy, but a fourth doctor said, ""don't do that"" (T 7) and performed emergency surgery to remove the blockage.   
3The 11 particulars of negligence in the statement of claim covered the events as opened upon by counsel for the plaintiff. By the time of submissions, these particulars had been reduced to the following:
(a)Failure to take any or any adequate precautions for the safety of the plaintiff;
(b)Expose the plaintiff to a risk of injury which could have been avoided by reasonable care;
(c)Failure to act in a professional manner that would be considered competent by peer professionals;
(d)...
(e)...
(f)...
(g)Failed to recognise tear to the peritoneum;
(h)...
(i)Failure to refer the plaintiff to an appropriate specialist in a timely fashion;
(j)Failure to ensure the plaintiff's condition was monitored with adequate follow-up consultations;
(k)Caused a significant delay in treatment.
4The changes to the way the claim of negligence has been pleaded and particularised arise principally from concessions by the plaintiff's expert witness in relation to the defendant's care of the plaintiff prior to the May 19 2010 consultation.
5There is no specific particular of negligence of failure to diagnose. Mr Campbell submitted that failure to diagnose was the breach which led to the negligent conduct outlined in particular (i), namely failure to refer the plaintiff to an appropriate specialist (a surgeon, rather than a physician) when the plaintiff consulted the defendant after discharge (T 419). 
An overview of the facts of the case
6The plaintiff, who was born in 1941 and good physical health, began to develop problems with her back in the mid-1980s.  She consulted the defendant (referred by her general practitioner, Dr Ingle) on 16 March 2009.  After conservative treatment was unsuccessful, surgery was performed on 16 April 2010 to insert a cage into the spine to relief symptoms in the left leg.
7The surgery was successful, but post-surgery nursing notes for 17, 18, 19, 21 and 22 April 2010 noted that the plaintiff was ""sick and vomiting"" (18 April 2010), ""nauseous"" (19 April 2010), ""unable to open her bowels"" (21 April 2010), ""vomiting"" (22 April 2010) and ""vomiting material with a faecal smell like coffee"".  The defendant, after several consultations, arranged for her to obtain an abdominal x-ray, as well as a full blood count.  The abdominal x-ray taken on 23 April 2010, which showed no abnormalities, was reviewed by the plaintiff with the radiologist, Dr Kirwan, on 24 April 2010.  By 24 April 2010, the plaintiff was noted by nurses to be ""improving, tolerating fluid and small nibbles"".  There was nil vomiting on 25 April 2010, although there was nausea on the evening of 26 April 2010.  
8On 27 April 2010, the plaintiff had her final consultation with the defendant  whilst in the hospital. The plaintiff's condition had improved and the vomiting appeared to have ceased.  She was discharged on 28 April 2010 and returned home. A follow-up consultation with the defendant was planned, in four weeks time. 
9The plaintiff continued to have problems with her bowel motions and vomiting after her return home. On 10 May 2010, the plaintiff mentioned her bowel problems to her physiotherapist, who suggested that, since this problem had not resolved, she should bring forward the four week appointment which had already been arranged for the plaintiff with the defendant.  
10The plaintiff brought forward her consultation with the defendant by one week, to 19 May 2010 at 10 am. On that day, the plaintiff told the defendant she was still troubled by nausea and vomiting, and sometimes vomited green bile. The defendant thought that the problem could be gall bladder or bile duct pathology. He thought she needed to see a consultant physician immediately, and telephoned Dr Landy, a consultant physician in the same building, who managed to fit her in to his appointment list straight away; according to the plaintiff's husband's notebook, Dr Landy saw her at 11 am, less than an hour after seeing the defendant. The defendant dictated a letter to Dr Landy saying that he was puzzled by the symptoms and that it was necessary to get to the bottom of the problem, but did not express a set diagnosis. Given the speed with which Dr Landy saw the plaintiff, and his dictation of his letter of diagnosis as soon as she had gone, he may not have seen this letter until later that day. Dr Landy relied upon his telephone conversation with the defendant in which the defendant described the symptoms, but ultimately relied upon his own observations of the plaintiff.
11The defendant received Dr Landy's letter dated 19 May 2010. This letter stated that examination, in particular of her abdomen, was normal. Dr Landy considered the symptoms were oesophageal reflux, and prescribed Nexium 40 mg. He noted he had asked the plaintiff to see Dr Ingle in a week, and that if her symptoms persisted he would be happy to review her progress. Should her symptoms persist, Dr Landy said he would pursue a gastroscopy. She was due for a review colonoscopy given her history of polyps, and the gastroscopy could be done at the same time. The plaintiff did not return to see the defendant again (the reference in the agreed facts to a 22 May appointment is an error: see Mr Sanders' diary (Exhibit B)).
12The plaintiff saw her general practitioner on 27 May, 3 June, 11 June, 15 June and 21 June 2010.  She was due to go back to see Dr Landy but he was going away on holidays. Throughout this period her general practitioner, Dr Ingle, had been dismissive of her complaints; he described her in his referral letter to Dr van den Bogaerde of 21 June 2010 as having ""dying swan syndrome"", adding that he was ""at the end of my tether"" about the plaintiff's condition, adding that she was ""neurotic"", and saying he had prescribed her Zanax for anxiety (Exhibit 1).  
13On 22 June 2010, the plaintiff consulted Dr van den Bogaerde, who shared rooms with Dr Landy.  His report of 22 June set out the plaintiff's history ""from Tim's notes"" (""Tim"" being Dr Landy). He noted, in capital letters, an additional matter: 'SEVERE WT LOSS; 10 KG NEED TO MONITOR. WILL GET SURGICAL OPINION AS WELL."" He went on to say he thought there was a small bowel obstruction, that she could have a peptic ulcer, and that ""Gall bladder seems ok on [sic] us"". He performed an ultrasound of her abdomen, stated he would admit the plaintiff and ""ask for surgical opinion; do gastroscopy"" as he thought she had a subacute small bowel adhesion type obstruction.
14 Dr van den Bogaerde did not perform the gastroscopy, although this appears to have been because he was unavailable. It was fortunate for the plaintiff that he did not do so. A surgeon, Dr Schwalb, diagnosed a bowel obstruction, advised against a gastroscopy, and booked her in for surgery on 23 June 2010.  
15After Dr Schwalb performed surgery, sepsis set in.  The plaintiff, on 25 June 2010, was transferred to Albury Base Hospital in their critical care unit.  She was placed into an induced coma and Dr van Gelderen carried out a further operation on 26 June 2010.  The plaintiff was transferred to Murray Valley Private Hospital on 16 August 2010 and discharged home on 17 September 2010.  In an unrelated incident, the plaintiff underwent a further operation in the form of a hernia repair by Dr Schwalb.
16After the plaintiff was discharged home on 17 September 2010, she was very weak and needed care.  She temporarily lost her voice due to a tracheotomy.
An overview of the expert evidence
17Four medical practitioners gave reports and/or gave evidence in relation to the issues arising from the particulars of negligence as initially pleaded by the plaintiff. Dr Anthony Greenberg, a general and gastrointestinal surgeon, provided three medical reports (Exhibit A) for the plaintiff, and participated with the defendant's two medicolegal experts in conclave.  He gave concurrent evidence in court with one of the defendant's experts, Dr Meagher, a colorectal surgeon (his reports are contained in  Exhibit 1).  Dr Leo Zeller, an orthopaedic surgeon, participated at the conclave of experts but, due to difficulties in relation to his subpoena, gave evidence separately. Dr Landy, the first treating physician, also gave evidence separately.
18The experts agreed that the question of negligently performed surgery did not arise, and briefly repeated these views in evidence.  The issues upon which the experts principally gave evidence related to the plaintiff's post-operative management (details of which was set out in paragraphs 46-53 of the summary of facts) and the post-discharge management of the plaintiff on 13 March 2010 (set out at paragraphs 54-62) of the summary of facts. 
19As the summary of facts agreed on by the parties is both clear and concise, it is helpful to set the section covering post-operative management up to the appointment on 19 May 2010:
""Post-operative management 
46.  Mrs Sanders was reviewed by Dr Hillier on 18 April 2010. She complained of feeling nauseous and uncomfortable. Dr Hillier examined her abdomen and found that it was not distended. The nurses reported bowel sounds. As with spinal surgery of this nature, all patients have initial bowel dysfunction and it is not at all unusual in the first 48 hours to have a degree of bowel upset.
47.  Mrs Sanders was seen on 19 April 2010 by Dr Hillier at which time she was up and ambulating. An x-ray report dated 19 April 2010 indicated the placements of the hardware were satisfactory. Mrs Sanders reported she was still troubled with dry retching and nausea and was hiccupping. Dr Hillier decided she should remain on intravenous fluids.
48.  On 20 April 2010 Dr Hillier saw Mrs Sanders and noted she had improved and was doing quite well. Mrs Sanders said she was less nauseous.
49.  Mrs Sanders was reviewed again on 22 April 2010. She was ambulating quite well and said she felt able to go home tomorrow.
50.  Dr Hillier referred Mrs Sanders for an abdominal x-ray on 23 April 2010 to provide assessment of her bowel status. The first line of investigation is a plain x-ray rather than a CT scan, as an x-ray will show free fluid in the abdomen and any signs of distension or obstruction. Dr Hillier's referral specifically requested that bowel obstruction be investigated.
51.  On examination Mrs Sanders' abdomen was clinically unremarkable and flat, bowel obstruction was not expected.
52.  On 23 April 2010 Mrs Sanders had an abdominal x-ray. Dr Hillier reviewed the x-ray report which relevantly stated ""no gross faecal loading within the large bowel; no free gas can be seen; no calcification projected through the upper right quadrant.""
53.  Mrs Sanders was discharged from hospital on 23 April 2010.
Post discharge management
54.  On 19 May 2010 Mrs Sanders' consulted Dr Hillier, stating that she was still troubled with nausea and vomiting; she described that sometimes she vomited green bile.
55.  Dr Hillier considered this to perhaps be symptomatic of a gall bladder or bile duct pathology.
56.  Dr Hillier referred Mrs Sanders to Dr Timothy Landy, gastroenterologist and consultant physician.
57.  Mrs Sanders was seen by Dr Landy that same day.
58.  Dr Hillier received a letter from Dr Landy dated 19 May 2010, detailing his consultation with Patricia. Dr Landy's letter reported that examination, in particular of her abdomen, was normal. Dr Landy opined the symptoms were related to oesophageal reflux and prescribed her Nexium 40 mg.
59.  Dr Landy noted that he had asked Mrs Sanders to see Dr Ingle in a week, and if her symptoms persisted, stated he would be happy to review her progress. Dr Landy stated should Mrs Sanders' symptoms remain he would be happy to pursue a gastroscopy. Dr Landy noted Mrs Sanders was due for a review colonoscopy given her history of polyps, so thought perhaps both procedures could happen at the same time.
60.  Dr Landy's mention of polyps was the first mention of any such history.
61.  Dr Hillier reviewed Mrs Sanders next on 22 May 2010. Mrs Sanders told him she had seen Dr Landy and was trialling Nexium. Dr Hillier noted that Dr Landy was to follow up with her.
62.  Dr Hillier did not hear anything further from Mrs Sanders, nor see her again in consultation or receive any correspondence about her from her other treating practitioners.""
20The evidence given by each of these experts is discussed in detail below.  One preliminary point, however, should be noted.  The expert witnesses (Dr Greenberg for the plaintiff and Dr Meagher and Dr Zeller for the defendant) and the treating doctor, Dr Landy, all agreed that the condition which led to the plaintiff's requirement for an emergency operation was a truly rare condition (T 256, 262, 280, 314 and 325).  Dr Meagher said at T 323:
""It's a real rarity and it's not surprising that the number of doctors that saw her postoperatively missed the diagnosis.  I would have missed the diagnosis.""
21The plaintiff's expert, Dr Greenberg, added:
""I'm in agreement with what Dr Meagher says, however, I would  if a patient came back with that nausea persisting, at that time, I would be anxious about what was causing it, and I would investigate it further."" (T 323)
22Dr Meagher repeated this at T 325 when he said:
""... it was missed because it's a very rare diagnosis.  That's essentially the reason.""
23Dr Zeller, who gave evidence separately, described the plaintiff's condition as ""an extraordinarily rare condition"" (T 381).
24Dr Landy, the treating physician to whom the plaintiff was referred on 19 May 2010, concurred.
Failure to diagnose that the peritoneum was torn during surgery
25The plaintiff had particularised that the defendant ""failed to operate correctly in that he perforated the peritoneum and then he failed to observe that he had torn the peritoneum"" (particular 12(a)).  As a result of this failure to diagnose, the defendant failed to refer the plaintiff to a surgeon who would have corrected this while the plaintiff was still in hospital and under his care.  However, the conclusion of the concurrent evidence (Drs Meagher and Greenberg) was that there was no tear to the peritoneum during the operation. Particular 12(f) (""causing injury to the abdomen and peritoneum"") and particular 12(h) (""failed to repair tear to the peritoneum"") have expressly been abandoned by the plaintiff as a result.
26Dr Greenberg's 12 November 2011 report had identified the defendant's negligence as being that the defendant had ""nicked"" the bowel during surgery and then failed either to recognise this or to repair it: ""if the tear had been recognised it could have been repaired"". This was negligent because ""that [repair] would have prevented this complication"" (p 3 of the report).  Dr Greenberg repeated this in an addendum to the report of 12 November 2011, namely that the defendant ""may have torn the peritoneum... as described in my original report"".  He added was ""standard practice to repair the tear"". This was the principal cause of the problem; the defendant's referral  of the plaintiff to Dr Landy on 19 May was not identified as negligent.
27However, Dr Greenberg and Dr Meagher, in concurrent evidence as to whether there had in fact been a breach of the peritoneum or not, came to the conclusion that they ""just do not know"" (T 257).  As the delay between the original operation and the corrective surgery was a number of weeks, the likelihood was that adhesions had occurred some time after the operation (T 258), her discharge from hospital, or indeed after she saw the defendant and Dr Landy successively on 19 May.  
28When pressed for an answer as to when this adhesion process began to occur, Dr Meagher said that he would not know because it was ""something I have never seen"" (T 259).  He went on to say: 
""I've never seen a case like this.  I operate all the time on the peritoneum.  We often make a breach in a peritoneum and don't close it and I've never seen this occurrence occur."" (T 259-260)
29Dr Greenberg conceded:
""Look, fundamentally I agree with Dr Meagher, what he said.  I think it's very hard to  we're postulating.  The reason I thought it was related to a tear in the peritoneum, which can occur exactly as has been described, is that when Dr Schwalb did his operation in June, he made comment that the bowel was stuck to the retroperitoneal structures.  There's only one plausible mechanism in which that could happen because it's got to get through the peritoneum to stick to those structures, is there has to have been a breach in the peritoneum.  So for that reason I would suspect that's what  that has been the mechanism of the small bowel obstruction.  But the peritoneum is a thin structure, it can be torn at any stage during that part of the procedure.  I would suspect the tear was posteriorly [sic] because that's where the bowel seems to have got stuck."" (T 260)
30In addition, whether or not there was a breach of the peritoneum at the time of the operation or a subsequent tear, the process by which the intestine fell into the bowel was a gradual process taking days or even weeks after the adhesions had gradually formed.  
31At T 261, Dr Meagher said it was ""certainly possible"" that at the time an x-ray was taken on 23 April 2010 there was only an adhesion and not a tear, and that, even if there were a tear, there would have been no movement of the bowel into the tear, in that this was something which happened gradually over a period of time, which meant that a diagnosis of ileus was ""far more likely"" (T 262).  All that Dr Meagher could say was that: 
""there were in fact progressive symptoms during that, so there's a collision I think, in fact in retrospect  and you can only say in retrospect  it probably was all due to this adherence to the area of the surgery.  Whether it was due to a breach in the peritoneum or not, we will never know, but it was in retrospect, I think possible to say, it was involving a small bowel obstruction.  It's a rarity, a true rarity for this to occur."" (T 262).
32Dr Zeller, in separate evidence, concurred with this view.
33Dr Greenberg's apparent retractions of his previously stated views that the defendant negligently failed to recognise and repair the tear to the peritoneum during surgery was the first of two significant concessions he made.  The next concession related to the post-operative treatment of the plaintiff in hospital.
Post-operative treatment
34The post-operative period, namely 16 to 28 April 2010, was longer than expected by reason of the plaintiff's ongoing difficulties after the operation. Although the plaintiff in closing submissions effectively conceded that the claim now put was one of failure to diagnose on 19 May 2010, it is similarly essential for me to set out the evidence of the plaintiff's condition over this period of time, in order to identify the changes in the plaintiff's expert evidence on this issue.  
35The relevant entries in the hospital notes confirm:
(a)16 April 2010 - Plaintiff returned to the ward at approximately 11:30am after surgery.
(b)17 April 2010 - Hospital notes indicate that the plaintiff had not passed flatus overnight.
(c)18 April 2010 - Plaintiff noted to be sick in the morning and vomited prior to transfer to physiotherapy appointment.  The plaintiff was also noted as refusing food.
(d)19 April 2010 - The plaintiff was seen by Dr Hillier and the x-ray of the spine was reviewed.  The plaintiff had an enema after returning from x-ray and complaining of still feeling nauseas.
(e)20 April 2010 - No relevant entry.
(f)21 April 2010 - The nursing notes note at 10:20pm that the plaintiff's bowels were still ""not opening"".  The plaintiff was given Lactulose and Coloxyl and told she would require an enema in the morning if no bowel movement occurred.
(g)22 April 2010 - At 6:00am the plaintiff was observed to be vomiting at the beginning of the nursing shift.  The physiotherapy notes referred to the plaintiff being unwell and unable to keep food down.  At 2:00pm the plaintiff suffered from a ""large vomit"".  At 4:00pm nursing staff contacted Dr Hillier who was in theatre.  A message was left with him concerning the ongoing nausea and he consulted the plaintiff during the evening when IV fluids were given to her.  He referred her for an x-ray and full blood count the following morning.
(h)23 April 2010 - The plaintiff, at approximately 1:00am, vomited about 200 ml of brown/yellow vomit which the nursing notes described as having a ""fecal smell like coffee"".  She was sent for an abdominal x-ray by Dr Hillier.  She remained ""nil by mouth"" and on IV fluids.
(i)24 April 2010 - The plaintiff's x-rays were reviewed by Dr Kirwan.  The plaintiff was noted to be ""improving"" and ""tolerating fluids and small nibbles"" in her diet.
(j)25 April 2010 - The plaintiff did not vomit on this day and was able to tolerate fluids.
(k)26 April 2010 - The plaintiff started to feel nausea in the evening.
(l)27 April 2010 - The plaintiff said she felt sick during the previous evening and was observed to be eating very little.  There was a consultation with Dr Hillier and a discussion about the issue of vomiting.  Dr Hillier was not able to give a cause of the vomiting but said it was not related to the surgery and might be a problem with the gall bladder.  However, it was agreed that the plaintiff was to be discharged the following day.
(m)28 April 2010 - The plaintiff was discharged from the ward at 11:15am and remained at home.
36While all three medical experts in conclave agreed that the plaintiff's post-operative course was abnormal, the question was what it demonstrated.  Dr Meagher and Dr Zeller agreed that at the time of discharge of the plaintiff, there was no indication of small bowel obstruction.  Dr Greenberg stated there was ""clearly something wrong"" (Joint Expert Report, question and answer 8).  All experts, including Dr Greenberg, considered it was reasonable for the plaintiff to be discharged home on 28 April 2010.
37The experts agreed that the two most likely diagnoses arising from the signs and symptoms occurring post-operatively were ileus or incomplete small bowel obstruction (Joint Expert Report, question and answer 10), and that the possibility of small bowel obstruction was in the order of 1% likelihood (Joint Expert Report, question and answer 4 and T 257).
38Question and answer 8 of the Joint Expert Report was as follows:
""8. Do you agree that on the clinical presentation of the plaintiff to the defendant during her post-operative admission in hospital, the plaintiff's symptoms and signs were consistent with those which were expected or usual following such an operation, and not such as to indicate any diagnosis of small bowel obstruction?
Dr Meagher, Dr Zeller and Dr Greenberg all agreed that the plaintiff's post-operative course was abnormal.
Dr Meagher and Dr Zeller agreed on discharge of the plaintiff there was not an indication of small bowel obstruction.
Dr Greenberg stated there was clear evidence that the plaintiff was not progressing as expected and there was clearly something wrong.""
39At T 292, Dr Greenberg said he could understand why the pathology was not picked up by the hospital and went on to enlarge this point at T 303 and 308, as is set out in extracts from the transcript below.
40The Joint Expert Report (at question and answer 10) indicates that all three medical experts agreed it was reasonable for the defendant to refer the plaintiff for an abdominal x-ray on 23 April 2010.  In particular, questions and answers 12 and 12A shows that all three medical experts agreed that the x-ray was unsupportive of small bowel obstruction:
""12. Do you agreed that it was reasonable for the defendant, as an experienced orthopaedic surgeon, to read or interpret the x-ray consistent with the opinion of or the report of the Radiologist Dr Sanjay Kapur (dated 23 April 2010 - see attached), to the effect ""A single view of the abdomen demonstrates gas within non-dilated loops of the small bowel. No gross faecal loading within the large bowel. No free gas can be seen. No calcification projected through the right upper quadrant.  Previous laminectomies involving the mid to lower lumbar spine noted with internal fixators"", as unsupportive of any diagnosis of small bowel obstruction at that time and as an indication or confirmation that the plaintiff's signs and symptoms, were likely caused by the operation or by some other cause?
Dr Meagher, Dr Zeller and Dr Greenberg all agreed it was unsupportive of any diagnosis of small bowel obstruction.
12A. At the time of, and in the circumstances that you looked at the abdominal x-ray dated 23 April 2010, for the purpose of giving a medico-legal opinion, do you believe the abdominal x-ray shows signs of, or was consistent with, the development of small bowel obstruction?
Dr Meagher did not believe the abdominal x-ray was consistent with small bowel obstruction.
Dr Greenberg noted there was some dilated small bowel in the left upper quadrant.
Dr Zeller stated he would discuss the x-ray with the radiologist and defer to what he said.""
41Dr Greenberg's ""dilated small bowel"" observation was not pursued at trial; he acknowledged the X-ray was normal and said that a further X-ray ""might've shown the change"" (at T 323). Dr Meagher's evidence was that any dilatation happened slowly after discharge (T 320). 
42What, then, was the gravamen of Dr Greenberg's criticisms of the plaintiff's treatment in hospital? 
43According to the particulars provided for paragraph 12(j), if the defendant had ""discovered the tear"" he would have referred the plaintiff to a surgeon to repair it, and the failure to do so was negligent.  However, this concession (that it was impossible to say if the tear occurred then, or at all)  is only the first difficulty the plaintiff faces.  The ""significant delay in treatment"" in particular 12(k) was particularised as being that ""Dr Hillier should have referred the plaintiff immediately [i.e. while she was still in hospital)]... to a surgeon, such as Dr Schwalb, and he would have remedied the tear to the peritoneum and avoided the injuries and disabilities that the plaintiff currently suffered"".
44However, Dr Greenberg resiled from this in his evidence as follows:
(a)He agreed (at T 269) that ""[i]t was not unreasonable for the clinician to put aside... a differential diagnosis of small bowel obstruction by the time the lady was discharged from hospital"";
(b)He said (at T 275) that ""[a]n ileus is a reasonable assumption"" ;
(c)He expressed the opinion that ""I can understand [the small bowel obstruction ultimately discovered in June 2010] not being picked up in hospital"" (T 292);
(d)At T 301 he said ""It's quite obvious that in hospital she appeared to have an ileus and her progress in hospital was such that she settled down to a degree."";
(e)He also said (at T 301) ""I don't think it's fair to say Dr Hillier didn't consider the diagnosis because clearly he did in the hospital."";
(f)At T 303 Dr Greenberg expressed the view that ""I think her discharge was appropriate.  I don't think there's any issue with that.  The only caveat I would have said would have been if you don't settle down or the nausea or vomiting persists you should come back earlier.  I think that's not an unreasonable thing to say.  One month follow up is probably quite standard after a normal orthopaedic operation of that magnitude.  I don't think that's out of practice with standard orthopaedic surgery"";
(g)At T 307-308, in response to Mr Campbell's question ""Do you believe that Dr Hillier ought to have done anything different?"", Dr Greenberg replied:
""Well, as has been said many times, it's very hard to be asked a didactic question about a very fluid situation, a didactic answer about a very fluid situation.  In my opinion it is unusual that she's still so nauseated at this stage, but as has been pointed out, people with bowel dysfunction can have prolonged periods of recovery.  As I've also pointed out the longer that goes on, the less likely that is to be an ileus, I mean because it usually doesn't prolong for three weeks, that's quite uncommon and it would be more  if somebody is sort of still having problems, you know, three to four weeks later, I would be anxious that there would be some underlying problem other than an ileus, and the most likely diagnosis would be a small bowel adhesive obstruction for one reason or another.  It could've been the ileus that's drifted into it, it could've been as this case, a loop of bowel that got caught due to the surgery.  I mean whether it was a peritoneal tear, I think is totally irrelevant.  I mean that just seems to be the mechanism that it happened, that's well recognised, that sort of thing can happen and it's very uncommon I agree.  And I have also, because I have spoken with Mrs Sanders myself, I know that she complained quite vehemently about the nausea and vomiting after  during the hospital and after discharge so I mean there's no documentation of that other than what she says, but I mean I'm taking what she says as fact, at face value.  So if you're looking at the situation, it's evolving, it's changing, every day it sounds like it's a bit different.  The diagnosis is becoming a little more  it's becoming more apparent that it's not an ileus, that's my opinion and if you sort of drop to that, you might start looking earlier rather than later, and as Dr Meagher's pointed out there's a variety of tests.  Absolutely right, every test has got a downside, it's got an upside, surgery is all about risk management.  You do the least you can to get the best result, okay?  So she's got a few red flags going on already at discharge, but it's not inappropriate she was sent home, I totally agree with that.  That's reasonable and best practice, there's nothing wrong with that, but it's the follow ups that are the issue.  We do  and if you pick it up early, you treat them conservatively as has been pointed out and that usually means IV fluids, if they're vomiting a lot or they've got a bowel full of fluid, you empty it out with a nasogastric tube, everything has a risk, but it's generally a safe procedure if done properly and it sometimes decompresses people and it unravels the whole problem and at least you know what you're dealing with and you can go through trials you know, where you decompress them, they feel a bit better, bowel recovery returns, you take the tube out, they feel okay, they start eating and they're fine, they can go home, but there's another group of people who start getting symptoms back, you know they start throwing up again and vomiting, and they're the group that sometimes need to go to surgery.  You know, my experience is early surgery is better than late surgery because the chances of complications that happened to Mrs Sanders are reduced, because she was operated on eight weeks later I think it was, six weeks, whatever it was, a significant period of time, so clearly she's not eating properly, she's losing weight, she's a bit malnourished, et cetera, et cetera.  But I mean that might just be a matter of opinion, that's been my experience.  So I would've thought a caveat would've been, ""If you don't feel well come back"", because she's clearly not doing the normal post operative recovery and then when she came back then you'd be a bit anxious about what's going on."" [emphasis added]
45Dr Greenberg stated on a number of occasion that he considered it was understandable why the plaintiff's pathology was not picked up in the hospital post-operative record (see (f) and (g) above). Following these concessions, the particulars of negligence in relation to the plaintiff's post-operative treatment were abandoned.
46The emphasised response in point (g) above is part of a response from Dr Greenberg lasting for more than a page of transcript.  Many of Dr Greenberg's answers, both in evidence and in conclave, consisted of generalised statements, such as his statement at answer 8 of the joint conclave that there was ""clearly something wrong"" with the plaintiff. His answers in evidence showed a preference for words such as ""may"", ""possibly"" and ""might"" (see for example T 282-283, 287-288, 293 (""may be""), 302, 309, 315). Even if Dr Greenberg had not made the concessions that he did, the quality of his opinions is undermined by the opaque and general nature of such language.
The 19 May 2010 consultation
47Having abandoned the negligence claims posited on surgery and post-operative treatment, the plaintiff then concentrated the case upon the claim that the defendant referred the plaintiff, by reason of his negligent failure to diagnose, to the wrong specialist (T 446).  The defendant ought to have known that the plaintiff was developing a small bowel obstruction when he saw her on 19 May 2010, and it was thus negligent to refer her to Dr Landy, a physician, rather than a surgeon.  That surgeon would have treated her conservatively and carried out an ultrasound, as Dr van den Bogaerde (another physician) did, but it would have been ""a far better outcome for this patient because her condition wouldn't have developed"" (T 447).
48I shall first set out the evidence of the plaintiff and her husband about this consultation.
The plaintiff's evidence concerning the 19 May 2010 consultation
49When the plaintiff was discharged from hospital, an appointment had already been made for her to see the defendant in four weeks time.  After consulting the physiotherapist and discussing the ongoing problem she was having with her bowels, the plaintiff telephoned the defendant's rooms to ask for an earlier appointment:
""A.  I had the consultation with her and then a couple of days later I was still feeling sick and more brown spots were coming with the vomit and I thought, well, it's time I go and see Dr Hillier and that's when I rang her and they weren't going to let me in and I said, ""But I need to see him.  I'm sick,"" and the receptionist said, ""Oh, hang on.  There's been a cancellation.  He will see you at 10 o'clock,"" and I had to try and get dressed and be out there by 10 o'clock and I did.  And anyhow, Dr Hillier was at a loss to how I felt."" (T 30)
50The plaintiff said:
""Q.  You had a conversation with Dr Hillier when you went and consulted him and if you could tell us what you can recall about the content of that conversation in an ""I said"", ""He said"" format.A.  I explained to him how I was still feeling and how sick I had been.""  And he examined my stomach and he was at a loss because he just put his
Q.  What did he say?A.  ""I don't know what's causing it.  It could be gall,"" and he just put his hands behind his head and he pushed his chair back and he looked at me for 15 seconds and he said, ""I'm going to send you to Dr Landy, a colleague of mine,"" and with that I went.
Q.  You saw Dr Landy.  Did you see him that day?A.  Yes.  I went straight over.
Q.  Did you have a discussion with Dr Hillier  I'm sorry to jump back again  about your bowel function when you saw him on 19 May 2010?A.  Dr Hillier seemed to think I was having a normal bowel function and I said to him I wasn't.
Q.  How was your bowel function by 19 May 2010?A.  It was very slight because I was trying to eat a little bit but it wasn't back to full capacity.
Q.  When Dr Hillier examined you, or examined your abdomen, did you have any pain in your abdomen?A.  Not a lot of pain.  Only when he pressed hard, which naturally I'd have."" (T 30-31)
51The plaintiff had seen her general practitioner, Dr Ingle, three times between her discharge and seeing the defendant (T 66).  Her evidence was that her general practitioner was at a loss to determine what was wrong with her.  However, what information she had given to Dr Ingle prior to seeing the defendant on 19 May 2010 appears to have been scant (T 69).  She did not seek any medication from him (T 69).  Consequently, there was no information from the plaintiff's general practitioner available for the defendant during this consultation.
52The plaintiff was asked in cross-examination: 
""Q.  He asked you questions about your bowel function?A.  Yes, yes.
Q.  And you told him, or described to him, that it was normal by then, didn't you?A.  I don't think I said, ""normal"".  I would have said they ""moved"" but not ""normal"".
Q.  You certainly didn't describe to him anything that was abnormal, or that worried you, or that concerned you, or that felt strange or abnormal about your bowel function, to Dr Hillier, did you?A.  No.
Q.  And you told him that your nausea had continued since you were discharged from hospital?A.  Yes.
Q.  And that you had, at times, vomited some green bile?A.  It wasn't  well, it was brown, more than ""green"".
Q.  But what I'm putting to you  and may I tell you I am reading from Dr Hillier's report to your GP, Dr Ingel, that you had at times vomited green bile, do you disagree with that, that's what you told him?A.  I can't remember.
Q.  When you saw Dr Landy the same day, that's 19 May, did he ask you about your health history, to give him a picture of you?A.  He already had that
Q.  All right.A.  I had seen him before.
Q.  Very well.  I'm sorry, I should have realised that.  So he, Dr Landy, he knew you, you'd seen him before?A.  Once, yes.
Q.  Once.  But he took from you an immediate history of what you'd been suffering from?A.  Yes.
Q.  Going back to the Hillier operation and subsequent, you told him about that?A.  Yes, yes.
Q.  You told him that for about a week after the discharge from hospital you'd suffered from some diarrhoea?A.  A little, yes.
Q.  But you'd told him that that had resolved, hadn't it, it was no longer the case, didn't you?A.  Yes.
Q.  And so following that week after discharge, may we say seven days from 28 April, so about 5 May, the little bit of diarrhoea had resolved?A.  (No verbal reply)
Q.  Isn't that what you just told us?A.  Yes, yes.
Q.  And once that had resolved you continued to eat food at home?A.  Not a lot.
Q.  No.  You continued to eat food at home, didn't you?A.  Yes.
Q.  Yes.  And the food passed through your alimentary system, didn't it?A.  Not all, not straight away, I was taking, opening medicine at home.
Q.  You went to the toilet every day?A.  Not every day.  Bowels probably every  a little bit every second or third day."" (T 75-76)
53The plaintiff gave the same history later that same morning to Dr Landy, to whom the defendant referred her:
""Q.  You didn't tell Dr Landy anything at all about any abnormality or difference or different experience or strangeness about your bowel frequency or your avoiding frequency, did you?A.  I can't remember, be no."" (T 76)
54It was after the plaintiff saw Dr Landy that her symptoms became more serious:
""Q.  After you saw Dr Landy your evacuation of the food that you ate through the normal alimentary system changed in frequency, didn't it?A.  Yes.
Q.  It became more difficult, didn't it?A.  Yes.
Q.  And it became less frequent, didn't it?A.  Yes."" (T 76-77)
55In re-examination, the plaintiff was asked:
""Q.  What was not normal about your bowel functions on 19 May 2010?A.  It wasn't fully normal like it should be or what it had been but  before all of this started, but I wasn't eating and if I ate a little bit at night time it was only loose, a little bit of loose bowel the next day.  Because I was taking opening medicines.  So it  it definitely wasn't normal."" (T 89)
56The plaintiff explained at T 90 that ""I told him they weren't normal because there was  they were still moving a little bit but because I wasn't eating --"".
57After an objection, the plaintiff stated at T 91 that her bowels were ""loose"" and added the words ""a little"" (T 91).
Mr Sanders' evidence
58The plaintiff's husband, Mr Lex Sanders, was called.  He had a better recollection of events, as he took notes in a special diary while he was in the defendant's rooms, a practice he had adopted to ensure that he accurately noted advice from doctors.
59His diary has been tendered and marked exhibit B.  Those notes state as follows:
""Wednesday 19/5/10 Dr Hillier 10:15
Happy with his operation (16/4/10).  Patty symptoms - nausea stomach pains hiccups heartburn vomiting - all since operation.
Dr Hillier referred / arranged appointment with Dr Tim Landy gastroenterologist.  See Dr Hillier again when gastro problem resolved.""
60Mr Sanders' notes go on to refer to Dr Landy examining the plaintiff in his surgery on that same day at 11:00am.  In other words, the plaintiff was in Dr Landy's surgery within a matter of minutes after seeing the defendant, with whom she had had an appointment commencing at 10:15am.  The notes say ""symptoms described to him indicates [sic] oesophagus reflux.  Described Nexium (40mg).  Arranged to see Dr Ingle next week.""
61Mr Sanders' notes go on to describe the visits to Dr Ingle on 27 May, 3 June, 11 June, 15 June and 21 June 2010.  It was on 21 June 2010 that Dr Ingle tried to arrange a further consultation with Dr Landy and, when Dr Landy was unavailable, with Dr Landy's colleague, Dr van den Bogaerde, who thought there might be a partial bowel obstruction and recommended immediate admission to hospital.  There is no mention in the notes of any referral back to, or consultation with, the defendant by either the plaintiff or her general practitioner.
62Mr Sanders gave evidence as follows:
""Q.  As far as you can recall, what did your wife say to Dr Hillier in respect to the problems that she was having?A.  She was vomiting, sick, nauseous, hiccups, heartburn, all since the operation.
Q.  What was that last bit, sorry?A.  All since the operation, didn't have prior to the operation.
Q.  And what did Dr Hillier do or say to her in response?A.  What I do recall, can I demonstrate?  He sat back in his chair like this and he looked at her for probably 10, 15 seconds and said, ""I'm going to send you to Dr Landy and that was about the extent of the visit.
Q.  Do you recall if anything was discussed between her and Dr Hillier about her bowel function?A.  No.
Q.  Was she examined by Dr Hillier?A.  Yes, he examined her  middle area, yes."" (T 98-99)
The defendant's evidence
63The defendant gave evidence that he telephoned Dr Landy.  He spoke to Dr Landy in the presence of the plaintiff and her husband (T 205) and after he agreed to see them that day, he sent them to Dr Landy's rooms immediately.  He then dictated a letter to Dr Landy, addressed to Dr Ingle, to explain why he had done this, but in practical terms, since Dr Landy saw the plaintiff at 11:00am, the information he would have had would have been the information in the defendant's telephone call.
64The defendant's letter of 19 May 2010 was as follows:
""Dear Charles [Ingle]
RE: Patricia SandersDOB: 07/02/41
It is some 5 weeks since surgery, and Mrs Sanders, from a spinal point of view, is going satisfactorily, and post-operative xrays all look fine.
However, during her time in hospital, and since she has gone home, she has been troubled with chronic nausea and vomiting, and has, at times, vomited green bile, suggesting some gall bladder or bile duct pathology.
I am surprised to find that that has not settled, even though she has quite normal bowel function, and so I have asked Tim Landy to assess her today, to get to the bottom of this, and get her under control.
Yours sincerely[Signature]Mr Terence M HillierOrthopaedic Surgeoncc Medical Records, Albury/Wodonga Private HospitalDr Tim Landy, Albury Wodonga Specialist Centre, Suite 3, 2 Ramsay Place Albury 2640""
65The defendant was cross-examined at T 207-208 as follows:
""Q.  I want to suggest to you on the face of it that this referral letter would suggest that you did not consider that she had a bowel obstruction when she saw you on 19 May 2010?A.  Well, it was always the most likely diagnosis without assessing the patient but the lack of clinical signs that would go with that led me to feel that it was also important that we kept our mind open to other possible pathology.
Q.  Why is it, if it was the most likely clinical sign that you referred this patient to a gastroenterologist and not a surgeon?A.  For that very reason, that because there was no sign of bowel distension or bowel blockage clinically I felt that the starting point for assessment, knowing that Dr Landy would have no hesitation in involving a surgeon further, either with discussion with me or even feeling comfortable with doing it directly but I felt that he  because of the possibility of alternative pathology that on that day that would be the most valuable assessment.
Q.  If you had really considered that this lady had a bowel obstruction on 19 May, you would have referred her to a surgeon, wouldn't you?A.  Yes.  If I had made those clinical features consistent with that diagnosis.
Q.  Well, the clinical features weren't inconsistent with that diagnosis, were they?A.  Well, they were, at that stage, very unlikely.
Q.  Her clinical features, you say, made it unlikely that she had a bowel obstruction on 19 May.  Is that what you say?A.  I've found nothing to fit with that diagnosis on that day.
Q.  Well, you didn't consider it at all, did you?A.  I certainly did.""
66The defendant explained his reason for referring the plaintiff to a physician rather than a surgeon as follows:
""Q.  I think we have already covered this but as I understand it your evidence is that the appropriate referral for a patient with a bowel obstruction is to a surgeon, correct?A.  I think that would be  Dr Landy would be as capable.
Q.  As a generalA.  But I think that if there was clear diagnosis of bowel obstruction then I would say that a surgeon would be the more immediate assessor.
Q.  Because the obstruction would  I withdraw that.  Now, what did you think of the diagnosis of reflux made by Dr Landy?  Is that something that surprised you?A.  I was interested that he noted those features.  It wasn't a feature that I had elicited from Mrs Sanders.  Bearing in mind that she didn't come back to see me after that so I read Dr Landy's observations with interest because it appeared to match what I had found in the clinical presentation and it did suggest that there might have been some upper bowel irritation that was a medical condition.
Q.  As far as you are aware, Mrs Sanders had never had reflux prior to her surgery, had she?A.  Well, I hadn't made any notes of that in her history.
Q.  Did she come back to see you after 19 May 2010?A.  No.
Q.  Was there  I take it then that you were satisfied with the diagnosis of Dr Landy and didn't feel that she required any further followup?A.  No, I expected that Mrs Sanders would come back to me for ongoing review of her spinal recovery.  I did not see her as having completed recovery.  I was concerned on that particular day that her complaints be addressed.  I understood from Dr Landy's letter that they were being addressed and I assumed that she would come back to me and routine or spinal followup.
Q.  Thank you.  So you had passed over her care in relation to the nausea and the vomiting to the gastroenterologist; correct?A.  No.  I had asked him to assess her for me on that day.  I was prepared to continue management of that issue if he had felt that it didn't require his involvement."" (T 208-209)
Dr Landy's evidence
67There was no evidence of an acute or subacute abdomen as at 19 May 2010, as Dr Landy's notes indicate.  The defendant draws my attention to the following extract from the evidence of Dr Landy during his examination of the plaintiff at 11:00am on 19 May 2010:
(a)""one of the big factors is abdominal pain"" (at T 219, in the context of his actual history-taking and examination of the plaintiff);
(b)The only description of any abdominal pain or discomfort was ""vague upper abdominal tightness which has been occurring unrelated to meals over the past few years"" (T 219);
(c)""The abdomen was soft; there was no tenderness; there was no rigidity; there was no guarding, and the abdomen wasn't distended as you might find with problems such as bowel obstruction."" (T 220)
(d)""the cardinal features [of bowel obstruction] would be abdominal pain, vomiting and abdominal distension"" and none of those features were present in the plaintiff as far as Dr Landy could elicit on that day (T 220);
(e)If there was bowel obstruction, you ""would expect all three [meaning abdominal pain, abdominal distension and vomiting]"" cardinal features to be present (T 221);
(f)The plaintiff's ""bowel habit was felt to be reasonable subsequent to that week"", meaning subsequent to the resolution of some diarrhoea at the end of the first week following her discharge from hospital, i.e. by about 5 April 2010 (T 220);
(g)""I've seen a lot of medicine and surgery over the years and I've seen a lot of bowel obstructions, both large and small, and there was nothing on that day that rang alarm bells to me that Mrs Sanders had a small bowel obstruction."" (T 223)
(h)""... because I said before, there were absolutely no signs or features to lead me to that diagnosis [bowel obstruction] on that day."" (T 227)
(i)""Looking at the broad picture that day, bowel obstruction wasn't on my list of differential diagnoses.  There was retching and no vomiting; there was really minimal, if any, abdominal pain; and the abdominal pain history I observed had been present for a year; and the abdomen was soft and nontender.  If the small bowel was obstructed, it becomes distended."" (T 229)
(j)""If the bowel was obstructed, the findings would have been very different to the findings on that day."" (T 230)
The joint expert's report
68The joint expert report (question and answer 15) states:
""15. Do you agree that on the clinical presentation of the plaintiff to the defendant on 19 May 2010 it was reasonable for the defendant to refer the plaintiff to Dr Landy, specialist physician and gastroenterologist, on that date?
Dr Meagher, Dr Zeller and Dr Greenberg all agreed it was reasonable for the defendant to refer the plaintiff to Dr Landy on 19 May 2010.""
69During his evidence, Dr Greenberg resiled from this view, stating that a surgeon ""would have been a better choice"" although he ultimately conceded that ""the acute or subacute abdomen is more a surgical area of expertise, but it doesn't mean a gastroenterologist is not capable of assessing that type of patient"" (T 286-287).  However, there was no evidence of an acute or subacute abdomen prior to 28 April 2010, as Dr Greenberg ultimately accepted.
70Question and answer 16 and 17 from the conclave notes are as follows:
""16. Do you agree that upon Dr Landy's consultation with and examination of the plaintiff on 19 May 2010, a report by the plaintiff [sic] to Dr Landy, to the effect that:
""Initially she denied any abdominal pain but does describe some vague upper abdominal tightness which has been occurring unrelated to meals over the past few years"",
together with Dr Landy's apparent clinical finding
""Examination today was unremarkable ... Abdominal examination in particular was normal""
are both consistent with
(i) An apparent absence of complains of abdominal pain in the post-operative patient notes of the plaintiff; and
(ii) Inconsistent with any differential or formed diagnosis of small bowel obstruction up to and including that date, i.e. 19 May 2010?
Dr Meagher, Dr Zeller and Dr Greenberg all agreed statements (i) and (ii) were consistent with Dr Landy's letter.
17.  Following the referral of the plaintiff to Dr Landy, was it reasonable for the defendant to act on advice to the effect that the patient ""has been assessed by (Dr Landy) who has instituted treatment with Nexium and he will follow up this issue.  For review when stable."" by not requiring the plaintiff to return to the defendant for a subsequent consultation?
Dr Meagher, Dr Zeller and Dr Greenberg all agreed it was reasonable for the defendant to act on advice from Dr Landy by not requiring the plaintiff to return to the defendant for a subsequent consultation.""
71All three medical experts agreed that, in light of Dr Landy's report following the examination he carried out on the plaintiff on the same day she saw the defendant, there was an absence of complaints by the plaintiff indicative of a potential diagnosis of bowel obstruction and that the evidence was inconsistent with any differential or formed diagnoses of small bowel obstruction up to and including 19 May 2010.  This is consistent with Dr Landy's evidence (T 230).  
72Dr Meagher commented at T 288:
""I think we did agree at the conclave after speaking about it that it was reasonable to refer the patient to Dr Landy.  I'm not sure what  I don't think you've changed your opinion about that.  I think it was a reasonable thing.  Dr Hillier recognised that it wasn't  the patient was not progressing as normal and the predominant problem was vomiting.  There was something strange.  Dr Landy has some expertise in gastroenterology, I understand, and he works around the corner.  That was expeditious management of the patient.  In fact, it worked out well.  Dr Landy saw the patient and things happened quickly.""
73Shortly after these views were expressed by Dr Meagher, Dr Greenberg conceded (at T 291):
""Now, I'm not suggesting Dr Landy should have made a diagnosis then and there but the whole problem with this lady is she's sort of not be followed up.  That's the problem.  She's sort of gone back to Dr Ingle and she's just sort of languished, right?""
74This is, however, inconsistent with the question and answer 17 given in conclave, set out above, and the fact that it is expressed in such hesitant language (""sort of not be followed up"" and ""just sort of languished"") is unhelpful.
75The plaintiff said (T 48) that Dr Landy told her that if she did not feel better she should come back to see him.  In addition, she had been told to see the defendant again ""when gastric problem resolved"" (notes of Mr Sanders, exhibit B).  The plaintiff saw Dr Ingle on five occasions after 19 May 2010.
Conclusions concerning the 19 May 2010 consultation
76As is set out above, in Joint Expert Report question and answer 15, the unanimous opinion of the experts was that it was ""reasonable for the defendant to refer the plaintiff to Dr Landy on 19 May 2010"".  Dr Greenberg stated at T 286 that a surgeon ""would have been a better choice"" but conceded that this ""doesn't mean a gastroenterologist is not capable of assessing that type of patient"".  The reason Dr Greenberg gave for resiling from what appeared to be a clear statement of opinion in answer to question 15 was unexplained.
77Whether or not there is an explanation for Dr Greenberg's change of opinion, insofar as his concessions permit the drawing of a conclusion that he has revised his earlier opinion,  the fact remains that there was no evidence of an acute or subacute abdomen problem on 19 May 2010.  The evidence of the treating doctor, Dr Landy, on this issue could not be clearer.  In addition, all three medical experts agreed that, in light of Dr Landy's report concerning the plaintiff's denial of abdominal pain and the result of his examination of the plaintiff, this was inconsistent with any differential or formal diagnosis of small bowel obstruction up to and including 19 May 2010.  Dr Landy said at T 230 line 13:
""Q.  If anything like that had happened prior to this patient seeing you, would you expect to have found different signs than you found?A.  If the bowel was obstructed, the findings would have been very different to the findings on that day.""
78All of this points to there being no small bowel obstruction suffered by the plaintiff on or before 19 May 2010, or at the very least no pathology sufficient to justify any medically informed diagnosis of small bowel obstruction.
79It is very easy to make the layman's mistake of assuming, in a retrospective fashion, that because the plaintiff had surgery where the possibility of nicking the bowel was mentioned, this must be the explanation for the rare condition the plaintiff was later diagnosed as suffering.  The adhesions the plaintiff developed after the operation, and the tear to the peritoneum which subsequently developed, occurred at an unknown time, but most probably in the days or weeks following the plaintiff's consultation with Dr Landy.  During this time she did not return to see the defendant, conduct which the experts unanimously agreed was reasonable in the circumstances, but continued to consult Dr Ingle and then on 22 June 2010 was referred to another specialist, Dr van den Bogaerde.  It is not submitted that the reason for delay was anything that the defendant said or did.  The most probable reason is Dr Ingle's view that the plaintiff was suffering from ""dying swan syndrome"" and Dr Landy's diagnosis of reflux.
Expert evidence
80The correct approach to the analysis and assessment of expert medical evidence was considered most recently by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cox v Fellows [2013] NSWCA 206 at [163]-[191].
81The first difficulty with Dr Greenberg is the changing nature of his opinion as to what constitutes negligence.  These changes of opinion may briefly be summarised as follows:
(a)He no longer holds the opinion expressed in the addendum to his report of 12 November 2011 (Exhibit A), that there was failure to recognise and repair a tear made during surgery (""it would be standard practice to repair the tear once it had been recognised""). 
(b)He no longer holds the opinion that negligent coordination of the plaintiff's post-operative care (which ""led to her having such a poor outcome"") was the defendant's responsibility. His reference in his reports to poor coordination of the plaintiff's case and to Dr Ingle's complaint of ""disastrous management post-spinal surgery"" need to be read in this light. 
(c) Although he agreed in the conclave that the defendant's referral of the plaintiff to Dr Landy on 19 May 2013 was reasonable in the circumstances, he no longer holds that view (see Q & A 15).82Part of the problem seems to have been that Dr Greenberg was unclear as to the plaintiff's medical history.  He states, for example, at the addendum to his report of 12 November 2011 that it was ""not clear from the notes what happened"" after the plaintiff consulted Dr Landy, in that he could not see from the notes if Dr Hillier or Dr Landy has reassessed the plaintiff.  It is in relation to this period of time that Dr Greenberg expresses the view that it ""would have been more appropriate for Mrs Sanders to be seen by a general surgeon/gastrointestinal surgeon as the clinical problem was more of a surgical nature"".  This sentence follows directly on to the 11 June 2011 date, which Dr Greenberg gives as being the first time that the plaintiff's general practitioner heard from Dr Landy, which he bases upon ""hearsay from Mrs Sanders"".  The question of the importance of following up of a patient needs to be seen in this regard.  His opinion that the plaintiff ""seem to fall between the various clinicians"" notes that Dr Hillier was reassured by Dr Landy.  The problem was that there was ""no overall coordination and management"".  However, Dr Greenberg also opines that Dr Hillier was not responsible to deal with the complication, but simply to be aware of it and ""be able to assess the patient and refer them to the appropriate specialist"".
83This series of internally inconsistent statements puts the negligence as being, in serial form, failure to recognise the tear during the operation (abandoned), failure to identify the condition during the post-operative hospital period (abandoned), failure to refer the plaintiff to the correct specialist on 19 May 2010 (conduct Dr Greenberg described as ""reasonable"" in the conclave but which he resiled from in his cross-examination) and conduct after 19 May 2010 (not the subject of any claim brought by the plaintiff).
84Where an expert changes his or her opinion (Joseph Street Pty Ltd v Khay Tek Tan [2010] VSC 586 at [98]), the value of that opinion, unless the reasons for the change of opinion are carefully explained and supported by appropriate evidence, is very difficult.  In the present case, Dr Greenberg has complicated those changes of opinion by moving between them at various stages of his cross-examination and reports and by contradicting his agreed statements in the conclave.
85Not only did Dr Greenberg agreed in the conclave that the referral to Dr Landy was reasonable, but he agreed that to trial Nexium was not unreasonable, on the part of Dr Landy, as a medical response by a consultant physician to a plaintiff who presented with such a history (T 310 line 49).  In addition, Dr Landy's referral of the patient to Dr Ingle, her general practitioner, for review the following week was a reasonable step in these circumstances. There was no suggestion that Dr Landy was somehow prevented from referring the plaintiff to a surgeon, either on 19 May or at any time subsequently, if her condition warranted a surgical opinion. Precisely why it was negligent for the defendant not to do so, but not negligent for Dr Landy to do so, was never explained.
86In Sarian v Elton [2011] NSWCA 123 at [53]ff Beazley JA set out the circumstances in which a finding by a trial judge that a medicolegal expert has become an advocate rather than a witness may be inferred.  That is not a finding to which one would lightly come in relation to a medicolegal expert in a professional negligence action.  
87The problem in these proceedings is rather different.  In Sarian v Elton, supra, there were two highly qualified specialists, each of whom, in the words of Hoeben J (at [138], dissenting), held different opinions.   That is not the case here. The problem is that Dr Greenberg has contradicted himself in relation to each of the three bases upon which negligence was put forward. He has done so without exposing his reasoning, and in the most general terms, in circumstances where he has conflated the defendant's role with that of other medical practitioners and where he appears to have been uncertain as to relevant events in the medical history. In those circumstances, the opinions of Dr Greenberg on any aspect of the issues in dispute in this case are opinions upon which the court can put very little weight.
88Having noted this finding, I now set out the relevant provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).
Duty of care under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)
89Issues of duty of care and breach of duty in relation to medical negligence claims must first be seen through the provisions of s 5B Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).  This provision provides:
""5B General principles
(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:
(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and
(b) the risk was not insignificant, and
(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.
(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):
(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,
(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,
(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,
(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.""
90In New South Wales v Fahy (2007) 232 CLR 486 at [57] Gummow and Hayne JJ explained the proper manner in which the court should approach the question of what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances as follows:
""[57] This approach to questions of breach of duty has come to be known as the ""Shirt calculus"". The description may be convenient but it may mislead. Reference to ""calculus"", ""a certain way of performing mathematical investigations and resolutions"", may wrongly be understood as requiring no more than a comparison between what it would have cost to avoid the particular injury that happened and the consequences of that injury. Shirt requires a more elaborate inquiry that does not focus only upon how the particular injury happened. It requires looking forward to identify what a reasonable person would have done, not backward to identify what would have avoided the injury.""
91Counsel for the defendant, in his helpful written submissions, draws my attention to similar statements by Hayne J in Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 223 CLR 422 at [126] and Mobbs v Kain (2009) 54 MVR 179.
92Where the negligence in question arises out of a doctor/patient relationship, these principles need to be given careful attention. In Lowns v Woods (1996) Aust Torts Reports 81-376 Mahoney JA expressed the following, obiter:
""In my respectful opinion the courts should be slow to intervene where what is involved is the weighing up of advantages and disadvantages, medical necessities and the like by the profession and then by the courts the mere substitution of the latter for the former. There are, of course, extreme cases. But there must, I think, be strong reasons why a clinical judgment properly arrived at is to be put aside as wrong and, a fortiori, as negligent.""
93Similarly in Ren v Mukerjee [1996] ACTSC 119 at [81], Miles CJ held:
""It is also necessary, in my view, to say clearly what many would consider obvious, namely, that in actions for professional negligence the plaintiff still retains the onus of proving that the relevant act or omission on the part of the defendant was unreasonable. This may be in contrast to actions for negligence for personal injuries sustained in the workplace or in a traffic accident, where, so long as there is a practicable means of minimizing the risk of foreseeable injury, there is, in practical terms although not in theory, an onus on the defendant to show that it was reasonable not to take that means in order to minimise the risk: see Miletic v ACT Health Commission [1995] HCA 13; (1995) 69 ALJR 675; Colonel Clints Bargain Stores Pty Limited v Molero (unreported, Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, 8 November 1996). However, until instructed otherwise, I do not accept that the demise of the requirement of positive proof of unreasonableness on the part of the defendant has spread to actions for damages for professional negligence. The need to prove that the defendant's act or omission was unreasonable, and not simply avoidable, lies at the heart of the action.""
94The defendant additionally relies upon s 5O Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) which provides:
""5O Standard of care for professionals 
(1) A person practising a profession (""a professional"") does not incur a liability in negligence arising from the provision of a professional service if it is established that the professional acted in a manner that (at the time the service was provided) was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice. 
(2) However, peer professional opinion cannot be relied on for the purposes of this section if the court considers that the opinion is irrational. 
(3) The fact that there are differing peer professional opinions widely accepted in Australia concerning a matter does not prevent any one or more (or all) of those opinions being relied on for the purposes of this section. 
(4) Peer professional opinion does not have to be universally accepted to be considered widely accepted.""
95The parties in their submissions did not identify the specific evidence going to the s 5O defence, and Mr Campbell's submissions on this issue were brief.  The evidence of Dr Landy, Dr Zeller and Dr Meagher was to the effect that in referring the plaintiff to Dr Landy, the defendant was providing a professional service in a manner that was widely accepted by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice. Dr Greenberg agreed to this in conclave but in his evidence sought to withdraw this concession.
Causation - Sections 5D(1) and 5E Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)
96The defendant submits that the plaintiff has failed to discharge her onus as required under ss 5D(1) and 5E on the issue of causation.  This issue is discussed in more detail below.
97Having noted these principles, I now apply them to the particulars of negligence pleaded in these proceedings.
(a) Failure to take any or any adequate precautions for the safety of the plaintiff
98The basis upon which this claim was particularised (see the Composite Particulars attached to Mr Evans' submissions) was that the defendant ""failed to operate correctly in that he perforated the peritoneum and then he failed to observe that he had torn the peritoneum and he should have referred the plaintiff to a surgeon who would have diagnosed the torn peritoneum and prevented the plaintiff from suffering the injuries and disabilities she currently suffers.""
99In submissions, counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged that by abandoning the other particulars, and in particular paragraph 12(f), the ambit of this particular now only relates to the failure to refer the plaintiff to a surgeon who would have diagnosed the torn peritoneum.
100While I accept the defendant's submissions (written submissions, paragraph 4) that any question of a peritoneal tear during surgery may be irrelevant, the plaintiff is still entitled to rely upon this particular in relation to the failure to refer the plaintiff to a surgeon when the plaintiff consulted him on 19 May 2010.
101As is set out above, the referral to Dr Landy was agreed by the experts in conclave to be reasonable in the circumstances.  This was because the defendant was unable to make a diagnosis, whereas Dr Landy was.  There has been no suggestion by any medical expert that Dr Landy was unable to refer the plaintiff to a surgeon if, having investigated the plaintiff's condition, he considered surgery was necessary.  The plaintiff's presentation and history to Dr Landy was unremarkable.  There is no suggestion that she required surgery on the day.  
102There is no suggestion that Dr Landy's diagnosis on that day was negligent or in any way different to any non-surgical treatment provided have the plaintiff been referred to a surgeon.
103The experts' answers given in conclave (particularly Q & A 15) clearly show that the plaintiff's conduct is not negligent, but in accord with peer professional opinion, which means that the s 5O defence would be made out.  
104This particular of negligence is not made out.
(b) Expose the plaintiff to a risk of injury which could have been avoided by reasonable care
105 While this was similarly particularised as relying upon the negligent conduct identified by Dr Greenberg, the particular relied upon not is that Dr Landy was not the appropriate specialist to see the plaintiff on 19 May 2010.
106This is not a ""failure to diagnose"" particular, but a complaint of failure to manage and treat the plaintiff appropriately, leaving her to her own devices of in hospital and after discharge from hospital and a general failure to manage. Referring the plaintiff urgently to a physician for diagnosis is not only reasonable but, for the same reasons as set out in relation to particular (a), in accordance with peer professional practice (s 5O).  
107The ""risk of injury"" is the loss of a chance of a better outcome than that achieved by the successful operation performed by Dr Schwalb.  The defendant's submissions that loss of a chance of a better outcome is not compensable damage (Tabet v Gett (2010) 240 CLR 537) is dealt with in more detail below.
(c) Failure to act in a professional manner that would be considered competent by peer professionals
108Having regard to the Joint Expert Report questions and answers 15, 19 - 22 and the evidence of Dr Meagher, Dr Zeller and Dr Landy (see above), this is a difficult particular for the plaintiff to make out.  The concessions made by Dr Greenberg in his evidence (see T 269, 292, 308) and my findings as to the unreliability of an inconsistency of his expert evidence, mean that the plaintiff's treatment at the hands of the defendant not only on 19 May 2010, but for the whole of the period during which he was consulted (including the period of time the plaintiff was in hospital) was treatment of the kind considered competent by peer professionals.  I note the plaintiff does not put that any claim for negligence lies against the defendant after 19 May 2010.
109The plaintiff has failed to establish that the referral to Dr Landy was conduct that would not be considered competent by peer professionals. In addition, the evidence of the experts in conclave warrants a finding in favour of the defendant in relation to the s 5O defence.  
(g) Failed to recognise tear to the peritoneum
110Both particulars (g) and (h) (particular (h) being a plea of failure to repair the tear to the peritoneum) are based on particulars and a claim which was abandoned in the closing submissions of the plaintiff.  As is noted above, Dr Meagher and Dr Greenberg in their concurrent evidence were unable to say with certainty that there was in fact a peritoneal tear, an opinion Dr Zeller endorsed in his separate evidence.
111Particular (g) is not made out. In addition, given the expert evidence on this issue, the defendant must succeed in relation to the s 5O defence.
(i) Failure to refer the plaintiff to an appropriate specialist in a timely fashion
112There are two elements to this particular, namely whether Dr Landy is an appropriate specialist, and whether the plaintiff was referred to him in a timely fashion.
113As to whether or not Dr Landy was an ""appropriate"" specialist, the concession by Dr Greenberg in the conclave report that the referral to Dr Landy was reasonable, and the opinion that Dr Landy formed on the day was reasonable, mean that this particular cannot be made out, given my preference for the evidence of Drs Zeller, Meagher and Landy on this issue.
114As to whether the plaintiff was referred in a ""timely"" fashion, she went straight from her 10.15 am appointment in the defendant's office to Dr Landy's rooms, and was seeing him ay 11.00 am, almost within minutes of her conversation with the defendant about her symptoms.  The reference to ""timely"" is misconceived. The defendant acted immediately when consulted by the plaintiff and told her symptoms.
115This particular is not made out. In addition, for the same reasons as set out above, the s 5O defence must succeed.
(j) Failure to ensure the plaintiff's condition was monitored with adequate follow-up consultations
116The plaintiff had a follow-up appointment with the defendant and was immediately referred to Dr Landy, who monitored her condition in conjunction with the plaintiff's general practitioner.
117This particular is based on the plaintiff having suffered an undiagnosed tear to the peritoneum during surgery and being in this condition while in hospital and on 19 May 2010. The evidence is to the contrary. Even Dr Greenberg, who described the issue of any peritoneal tear as ""totally irrelevant"" (T 307), did not suggest that the plaintiff's condition should have been obvious to the defendant as at 19 May 2010 (T 259 (Dr Meagher) and T 260 (Dr Greenberg)). The Joint Expert Report (Q & A 15 and 17) makes this clear.
118This particular is not made out. In addition, the s 5O defence must succeed.
(k) Caused a significant delay in treatment
119The sole basis upon which any delay in treatment can be put at the defendant's door would be if, by referring the plaintiff to a surgeon, she would have been treated more quickly.
120The particulars recite that after the plaintiff suffered from ""intermittent abdominal pain"" she should have been referred to a surgeon who would have ""remedied the tear to the peritoneum"".  Leaving aside the issue of whether there was in fact a tear to the peritoneum, the fact that there was no evidence of ""intermittent abdominal pain"" warranting a surgical review (see Dr Landy, T 219). 
121Once the concession is made that the referral to Dr Landy is reasonable, and that the findings Dr Landy made on 19 May 2010 were unexceptionable, this particular of negligence becomes difficult to maintain.  The only basis upon which a delay in treatment could be made out would be a duty to continue to monitor the plaintiff after referring her to Dr Landy, as opposed to referring her to Dr Landy in circumstances where her condition did not require any surgical treatment by the defendant or Dr Landy, and where Dr Landy was just as capable (if not more) of referring her to a surgeon.
122As was the case with the previous particular, the Joint Expert Report questions and answers 15 - 17, 20 and 22 - 23 meant that this particular cannot be made out.  Not only did the plaintiff's symptoms appear to settle while in hospital (24 - 28 April 2010) but she continued to lead a comparatively normal life up to the day of her consultation with the defendant on 19 May 2010, and for some weeks thereafter.  Even Dr Greenberg agreed that it will be best practice to consider a surgical opinion only if the symptoms did not settle.
123This particular is not made out. In addition, in light of the expert evidence identified above, the s 5O defence must succeed.
Conclusions concerning liability
124I am satisfied that there is no evidence, including no opinion by a medical expert who has provided a written report or given oral evidence, to the effect that the defendant's discharge of his duty of care to the plaintiff on 19 May 2010 departed from the appropriate or reasonable discharge of that duty.  Beyond stating that a referral to a surgeon would be a ""better choice"", Dr Greenberg could not demonstrate the difference that would be made had this hypothetical surgeon examined the plaintiff as Dr Landy did.  Implicit in his remarks was that the hypothetical surgeon would have operated on the plaintiff nonetheless.  
125As is set out above, this is not supported by the expert evidence.  Not even Dr Greenberg expressed the view that the plaintiff should have been operated on either on 19 May 2010 or shortly afterwards, given the symptoms that the plaintiff was displaying and the diagnosis of Dr Landy.  
126Whether or not the defendant failed to make, or failed to consider, a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, is not to the point.  What the defendant did was refer the plaintiff appropriately and reasonably to a competent and experienced consultant physician who was able to see the plaintiff within the hour.  Nothing in the letter from the defendant to Dr Landy distracted Dr Landy from that course.  Dr Landy had a brief telephone conversation with the defendant and then the plaintiff went straight to Dr Landy's rooms, where she was seen immediately.  It is unclear whether Dr Landy even saw the letter that was prepared by the defendant after seeing the plaintiff until during or after his examination of the plaintiff, when he formed his own views as to her condition.
127I am satisfied that not only by 28 April 2010, but by 19 May 2010, there was no evidence of bowel abnormality evident from x-ray, physical examination of the plaintiff, or objective reconstruction of her problems with vomiting.  There is simply no evidence of obstruction, incomplete or otherwise, as at 19 May 2010, which would furnish clinical justification for any doctor to make a differential diagnosis of obstruction of the plaintiff's bowel or warrant surgery of an exploratory nature on a woman of approximately of 70 years of age who has just undergone significant spinal surgery a little more than a month beforehand.
128The unequivocal answer given in the peer environment of the conclave by the medical experts to questions and answers 15, 16, 17, 20 and 22 must be given their full weight.
129The plaintiff has failed to establish there was any breach of duty of care, and in addition the s 5O defence succeeds in relation to each of the particulars of negligence pleaded.
130This means that the plaintiff fails in her claim against the defendant.  There are, however, two additional matters that I will note.  The first is the change of case brought by the plaintiff on Day 4 and the second is the issue of causation.
The plaintiff's restated case on Day 4
131On Day 4 of the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff sought to restate the case from ""that [the defendant] failed to diagnose a small bowel obstruction at any relevant time, i.e. between 23 April 2010 and 19 May 2010"" to ""failed to consider the diagnosis of a small bowel obstruction throughout his treatment of the plaintiff"".
132The plaintiff later sought to restate her case again in closing submissions, to limit the case to the advice given by the plaintiff on 19 May 2010.
133Neither of these was the case the plaintiff brought the defendant to court to meet.  These changes to the plaintiff's case created difficulties during a trial where the factual background was already of some complexity.
134The proposed restatement of the plaintiff's case on Day 4 is not supported by evidence from the reports of Dr Greenberg, or by anything which fell from any of the defendant's expert witnesses in the course of cross-examination.  Dr Greenberg's reports put the plaintiff's case, in relation to failure to diagnose this condition, as being due to ""no coordination of her post operative care"" on the basis that it was ""this aspect of Mrs Sanders' care that led to her having such a poor outcome"" (see the report of Dr Greenberg, Exhibit A).  However the concessions in the plaintiff's case in relation to her post-operative treatment means that the ""no coordination"" case cannot be made out as the evidence is clearly against any assertion on that basis.  Nowhere in Dr Greenberg's report did he state that the failure to consider a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction resulted in the defendant failing to refer the plaintiff to a surgeon; the answer to question 15 in the conclave is to the contrary (see also T 301 (Dr Greenberg), T 280-281 (Dr Meagher)).
135It was unclear to me from the plaintiff's closing submissions whether the proposed amendment was still pursued, or whether the alternative ground of failure to diagnose on 19 May 2010 was pressed.  I shall err on the side of caution and assume that both bases are relied upon.
136Independently of the issues of fairness which arise when any late amendment is sought, the proposed amendment to rely upon a failure to diagnose small bowel obstruction (either at any time before, or on 19 May 2010) is contrary to the expert evidence.  Dr Greenberg conceded that he could understand why a clinician would put aside the 1% likelihood of such a diagnosis.  To this should be added the uncertainty that, as at 19 May 2010, the plaintiff had developed this condition to any medically identifiable degree.
137I also note that neither the Consolidated Particulars nor the evidence of Dr Greenberg put forward the claim that the defendant somehow misled or misdirected Dr Landy, with the result that Dr Landy missed a diagnosis that he would otherwise have made.  Dr Landy's own evidence was to the contrary (T 227-230).  As was noted in the expert evidence set out at the commencement of this judgment, the plaintiff's medical problem was a truly rare condition.  It was missed principally because it was a very rare diagnosis, that the practitioner who failed to make the diagnosis (if it was available) on 19 May 2010 was Dr Landy, not the defendant.
138It was for these reasons - the lateness of the proposed amendment, the absence of medical evidence in support of the proposed amendment, and the uncertainty as to the temporal element of the period in question that I refused the plaintiff leave to amend her case on Day 4.
139The next issue is the issue of causation.
Causation
140The defendant submits that the plaintiff has failed to discharge her onus to establish any causal relationship of any breach to the injury, loss and damage claimed.  At its highest, the injury, loss and damage claimed is the loss of a better outcome, which is not compensable damage of a type to be found in a cause of action in negligence.
141Section 5D(1) Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) was considered in Strong v Woolworths Ltd t/as Big W (2012) 246 CLR 182 where the High Court at [18] identified the test as being a statutory statement of the ""but for"" test of causation, namely whether the plaintiff would have suffered the particular harm but for the defendant's negligence.  The plaintiff must establish that the defendant's negligence was a necessary condition of her loss of a better outcome, or loss of a chance of a better outcome, in that but for the negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff would have had a better outcome from her abdominal operation.
142The particulars of injuries are as follows:
(i)Small bowel had become adherent to retroperitoneal structures with subsequent obstruction and perforation;
(ii)The plaintiff had to undergo a small bowel resection;
(iii)The plaintiff had to undergo further operative treatment;
(iv)The plaintiff suffered sepsis;
(v)The plaintiff required ventilation and tracheotomy;
(vi)The plaintiff suffered an incisional hernia;
(vii)The plaintiff had to undergo hernia repair with mesh;
(viii)Breach of the posterior peritoneum;
(ix)Herniation of the small bowel;
(x)Had to have removed seventy centimetres of the small intestine;
(xi)Shock;
(xii)Stress;
(xiii)Psychiatric injury; and
(xiv)Depression.
143One of the problems that the plaintiff has with the way in which the case has been conducted is that there was no evidence that the adhesion of the small bowel to the retroperitoneal structures was preventable or resulted from negligence.  The abandonment of particulars of negligence in relation to the conduct of the operation, and in relation to the management of the plaintiff's subsequent care in hospital, restrict the plaintiff's case to a failure to diagnose a non-negligent surgical complication.  The plaintiff's case must proceed on the basis that the obstruction and perforation occurred, not as a result of the defendant's negligence, but as a result of an extremely rare and non-negligent complication.
144Examination of the particulars of injury show that these fall into the following categories:
(a)A non-negligent complication: particulars (i), (ii), (iii) and (viii);
(b)A hernia which the plaintiff now concedes is unrelated to either the circumstances of her surgery, the operation, or to any act of negligence by the defendant: particulars (vi), (vii) and (ix).
145This means that the only particulars of injury which can be sheeted home to late diagnosis is that the plaintiff suffered sepsis (particular (iv)) and that the plaintiff required ventilation and tracheotomy (particular (v)). The plaintiff also claims for the shock and anxiety she suffered for this life-threatening complication which resulted in her spending a lengthy period in hospital.
146Given that the plaintiff's case is, as Dr Greenberg states, that a referral to a surgeon would have resulted in an earlier diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, giving the plaintiff ""a better outcome"", the physical injuries which can be sheeted home to the delay in surgery relate to the sepsis and other complications from which the plaintiff has made a complete recovery.  I note the evidence of ongoing disabilities include a claim of distress and alarm and some psychological sequelae as well as voice problems following the tracheotomy.
147Question and answer 26 of the conclave's list of questions dealt with this issue as follows:
""26. Do you say or do you agree that in the particular pathology of the plaintiff earlier surgery would more likely than not have given the plaintiff a better outcome and, if so, how much earlier would such surgery have been clinically justified (in prospect, not retrospect) and as to a ""better outcome"", how much better and in what respects, if any, do you say this would have been?
In Dr Greenberg's opinion, earlier treatment, whether that be conservative or interventional, may have led to a better outcome.
In Dr Greenberg's opinion, the question of how much earlier would depend very much on the clinical circumstances.
To Dr Meagher's knowledge there was no evidence that different conservative management of incomplete small bowel obstruction alters the need for surgery but he was happy to change his mind when sent papers on this from Dr Greenberg.
In Dr Meagher's opinion, the earliest that the plaintiff would have been operated on from the clinical information available to him would have been at or about the time of the x-ray taken on 22 June 2010, when there were clear signs of obstruction.
Dr Zeller was in agreement with Dr Meagher.""
148Dr Greenberg's claim that a surgeon, unlike a physician, would be more likely to consider surgery ""earlier"", which would have ""more likely than not"" have given the plaintiff ""a better outcome"" is a series of increasing vague statements which are of little assistance in determining the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities: Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705.  In Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles, supra, Heydon JA (at [67]) refers to Ramsay v Watson (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 645 as follows:
""[67] One other important aspect of Ramsay v Watson is the following statement (at 645):
""... That some medical witness should go into the box and say only that in his opinion something is more probable than not does not conclude the case. A qualified medical practitioner may, as an expert, express his opinion as to the nature and cause, or probable cause, of an ailment. But it is for the jury to weigh and determine the probabilities. In doing so they may be assisted by the medical evidence. But they are not simply to transfer their task to the witnesses. They must ask themselves 'Are we on the whole of the evidence satisfied on a balance of probabilities of the fact?'.""
The jury cannot weigh and determine the probabilities for themselves if the expert does not fully expose the reasoning relied on.""
149Contrary to what Dr Greenberg says, there was earlier treatment of a conservative nature, namely the ongoing treatment provided by the plaintiff's general practitioner, Dr Landy and Dr van den Bogaerde.  Not even Dr van den Bogaerde considered it was necessary to call in a surgeon, or to refer the plaintiff for surgery.  This was long after the plaintiff had left the defendant's care.  By the time that the x-ray was taken on 22 June 2010, it painted a completely different clinical picture to the x-ray taken on 24 April 2010 as the following extract from the transcript shows:
""EVANS:  It demonstrates a completely different clinical picture to 24 April 2010 Xray which you've agreed to.
WITNESS GREENBERG:  Yes."" (T 313)
150The plaintiff's own evidence was that her condition between 27 May and 22 June 2010 had become worse (T 55, 76 and 83), evidence that was corroborated by her husband (T 109).
151All of this makes it clear that, as Dr Meagher stated at T 322, if the defendant had ""the magic diagnosis"" on 19 May 2010 and conservative management had been instituted, the plaintiff would not have ended up being as bad as she was in June 2010 (T 321-322).  However, as already indicated in my factual findings, I am satisfied that the plaintiff's condition had not developed as at 19 May 2010, and this was why Dr Landy was unable to diagnose any bowel obstruction when he saw her.
152As Dr Meagher pointed out at T 320, an incomplete obstruction and bowel dilatation develops very quickly.  It was for this reason that I made the finding that I did.
153The question of when and in what circumstances the plaintiff was to be operated on were questions determined by persons other than the defendant.  Contrary to the implicit submission of Mr Campbell that the sole chance the plaintiff had to be referred to a surgeon, the plaintiff could have been referred to a surgeon at any time by her general practitioner, Dr Landy or Dr van den Bogaerde.
154In addition, notwithstanding the seriousness of the plaintiff's condition when she entered hospital for corrective surgery on 23 June 2010, the operation was entirely successful.  There is no evidence before me as to whether post-operative disabilities, such as a nasogastric-tube or difficulty walking, would have been avoided or diminished, whether the operation had taken place a week or a month after the plaintiff consulted the defendant.  I am simply invited to speculate that as these events occurred, they must in some way be due to the delay of the operation.
155Counsel for the defendant submits, and I agree, that any chance of a better outcome is even vaguer than Tabet v Gett (2010) 240 CLR 537.  Further, the loss of her chance of a better medical outcome is not, even if it were able to be proved, compensable damage.  The difficulty in this case arises from the substitution of the loss of a chance of a better outcome for proof of actual physical injury as the gist of the cause of action.  Gummow ACJ noted at [38]-[39] of Tabet v Gett, supra:
""[38] No doubt the present case arose in very particular circumstances making it difficult to find the appropriate comparator or counter-factual. Usually this will require proof of what would have been the plaintiff's position in the absence of the breach of duty by the defendant. The difficulty in the present case arises from the substitution, for which the appellant contends, of loss of the chance of a better outcome for proof of physical injury, as the gist of the cause of action in negligence.
[39] The cases dealing with the assessment of the measure of damages, whether in contract or tort, are replete with exhortations that precision may not be possible and the trial judge or jury must do the best it can. The treatment in Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd of the assessment of damages for future or potential events that allegedly would have occurred, but cannot now occur, or that allegedly might now occur, is an example. But in that case the claim giving rise to the assessment had been for physical injury, the contraction of a disease as a result of the negligence of the defendant. The imprecision allowed in the assessment of damages in such cases does not necessarily or logically apply where a claim for physical injury fails but is said to be saved by transmutation of the damage alleged into the loss of a chance of a better outcome.""
156His Honour went on to note at [46]:
""[46] Further, and as an additional ground of decision, in personal injury cases the law of negligence as understood in the common law of Australia does not entertain an action for recovery when the damage, for which compensation is awarded consequent upon breach of duty, is characterised as the loss of a chance of a better outcome of the character found by the trial judge in this case.""
Concluding remarks concerning causation
157By reason of the changes to the plaintiff's case in the course of the hearing, which included the abandonment of many of the particulars of negligence (see paragraph 2) and the bringing of a fresh ground on Day 4, portions of this judgment are unfortunately repetitious.  
158In relation to causation, the case as presented in final submissions, namely referral to a physician rather than a surgeon, makes no sense.  The plaintiff puts the bare assertion that a ""better choice"" than a referral to a specialist physician who could see (and diagnose) the plaintiff immediately, which is inconsistent with the conclave questions and answers 15, 16, 17, 20 and 22.
159The defendant's referral of the plaintiff to Dr Landy did not divert the plaintiff from an appropriate medical examination by a competent and experienced consultant physician who is in a far better position than the defendant to determine if the plaintiff required surgery.  The alleged ""failure"" did not distract Dr Landy in making his own experienced independent appreciation of the plaintiff's condition.
160In addition, there was no bowel abnormality of which the plaintiff complained on 19 May 2010.  I have drawn the inference that there was no indication of obstructions, incomplete or otherwise, in the plaintiff's bowel when she was examined by Dr Landy.  This means that the hypothetical surgeon to whom the plaintiff would have been referred would have made the same findings as Dr Landy.  In those circumstances, there is no causation.
161I also note (as I have in relation to the s 5O findings) the conclave question and answer 15, where the medical experts unanimously agreed that the referral of the plaintiff to Dr Landy was reasonable.
162The plaintiff has failed to establish liability and causation.  In the event that I have erred in my findings in favour of the defendant in these proceedings, I set out some brief observations on quantum.
Quantum - Non-economic loss
163The plaintiff underwent emergency surgery.  She was in hospital for a considerable period of time, for much of it in intensive care.  On release from hospital, she had difficulty walking.  She also had difficulty speaking because of the impact of the tracheostomy on her vocal cords.  She suffered anxiety and depression as a result of the seriousness of her condition.
164Nevertheless, the plaintiff has made a complete recovery.  Although she told the court she had difficulties speaking, she was able to give her evidence fluently and without any difficulty.  Although she required nursing and home assistance by her husband for some time after the operation, she is now effectively independent, or as independent as a woman of her age can be.
165Mr Campbell submitted to me that non-economic loss finding of 25% would be appropriate, but that if I were to make a finding of non-economic loss of 15-17% ($5,500 - $10,500), he could not be heard to dispute it.
166I consider the plaintiff does not meet the threshold for non-economic loss.  She suffered from a debilitating condition for slightly more than a month, followed by an extended stay in hospital for a very serious emergency, from which she has made a full recovery.
Out-of-pocket expenses
167The plaintiff always had to undergo surgery to correct the obstruction.  The hernia she suffers from is agreed to be unrelated.  Essentially this restricts the out-of-pocket expenses to the additional expenses incurred by reason of the extent of her surgery and additional periods of time spent in hospital. The plaintiff sought payment of all costs, including the hernia operation and costs of the surgery to correct the obstruction. 
168Unless the expenses relating to the plaintiff's extended stay in hospital, and additional treatment, can be identified, it is hard to see how any claim can be brought for an operation which Mr Campbell conceded was inevitable (T 481) and where Dr Greenberg stated that it was difficult to say how much better the outcome would be if she had been operated on sooner.
169There is no claim for future expenses.
Domestic assistance
170Past domestic assistance is agreed at $4,000.  No claim is made for future assistance.  I note the defendant's submissions that 50% of the past economic loss claim should be discounted by reason of the plaintiff requiring assistance because of her age rather than infirmity.  If so, past domestic assistance would amount to $2,000.
Costs
171I have reserved the issue of costs, as I apprehend that this may be a matter where there may be a submission that costs should not follow the event.  In particular, the circumstances in which the plaintiff was ordered to pay costs thrown away by reason of the vacating of the first hearing date, due to problems with the subpoena to Dr Greenberg, and additional delays caused by the circumstances in which Dr Zeller's evidence was not able to be taken at the same time as the other experts, may be the subject of further submissions.
Orders
(1)Judgment for the defendant.
(2)Costs reserved.
(3)Liberty to apply in relation to costs.
(4)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		11 October 2013",2013-09-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762421,R v Hona [2013] NSWDC 300,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The offender, Ben Wiremu Hona, has pleaded guilty to an offence of attempting to enter a dwelling within intent in circumstances of aggravation. The circumstances of aggravation could be said to be two; he was in company at the time and he knew that there was a person inside. It does not really matter which one the Crown relies on, both are present.

2The offence was committed when the offender went to the premises of a Paul Murphy. The offender was know to Mr Murphy. The offender wanted some drugs and he wanted some money from Mr Murphy so that he could buy those drugs and so Mr Hona banged on Mr Murphy's door early one Sunday morning. When Mr Murphy opened the door he saw Mr Hona who told him he was hanging out for heroin and wanted $50. Mr Murphy told him to leave. It appears that Mr Hona did so but a couple of hours later he was back again. When Mr Murphy was awoken a second time he did not see the offender but he saw the offender's partner, a Ms Roberts. She asked for $50 this time but again Mr Murphy said that he had no money and refused to give her what she asked for. It appears that what was happening was that Ms Roberts was acting as a decoy to get Mr Murphy to the front door of his premises while Mr Hona entered at the rear.

3Mr Murphy lives in a block of home units. The window to his lounge room is on the third storey. What was happening while Mr Murphy was talking to Ms Roberts at his front door was that Mr Hona had climbed up to the lounge room window and was attempting to pull the bottom sliding pane of the window up. This was not as difficult as it may seem because Mr Hona did not have to climb three storeys. He was able to climb from a landing onto an air conditioning unit, a comparatively small distance but when he was on the air conditioning unit he was three storeys up in the air.

4Mr Murphy realised what was going on when he heard some sounds coming from his lounge room. He went to the lounge room and saw Mr Hona trying to come in from outside. He closed the window. As that happened Mr Hona lost his balance and fell three storeys to the concrete below. Ambulance and police were called. Mr Hona was taken to hospital. Somewhat surprisingly his injuries, despite a three storey fall on the concrete, are not all that severe. He required stitching to a laceration on his head and it was found that he had broken his leg. He remained in hospital for a couple of weeks until he was released into the custody of police. He remained in custody until he was released on bail after about four months. He appears to have made a relatively good recovery from his broken leg, although it occasionally causes him pain.

5Mr Hona pleaded guilty at an early stage to the charge that he currently faces and so the sentence I will impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been. 

6Mr Hona is now 32 years of age. A psychological report was tendered on his behalf which, it has to be said, is of some concern as regards the prospects for Mr Hona living a law abiding life in the future. Various tests were administered to him and he scored highly in a number of areas, suggesting a high probability of further offending in the future. Ordinarily this would tend to suggest that perhaps a higher than usual need for a sentence which will act as a personal deterrent to Mr Hona, however in the circumstances of this case as will be seen I have attempted to deal with this issue in another manner.

7Mr Hona had a difficult upbringing. His father was a very violent man. He used to bash his mother. When his mother finally went to the police his father was removed from the family home. When the offender was about 14 his father forged his mother's signature and obtained passports for him and his brother and took them to New Zealand illegally. The offender was then once again subject to his father's violent behaviour. About two years later the offender and his brother ran away from his father and, with the help of police, they were returned to his mother's care in Australia. Unfortunately, whilst at that time the offender's mother was living with a man who the offender described in positive terms, after he died she formed a relationship with another man who was also violent and used to inflict violence upon Mr Hona. That relationship has now ended and his mother lives alone.

8Apart from times when the offender has been living in Sydney, he has been living in Moree with his partner since about the year 2000. Unfortunately his partner has troubles with drugs as does Mr Hona, indeed his partner was the person who acted as the decoy during the commission of this offence. Together they have six children but there are, I gather, problems in the relationship. At least part of the reason for those problems must surely be the offender's behaviour, although there are suggestions also that other difficulties arise from his partner's behaviour as well. 

9The offender has a criminal history. It is relatively lengthy but they are mainly offences dealt with in the Local Court and there are very few occasions on which the offender has served sentences of imprisonment. As is often the way, as offenders mature their offending becomes less common and that appears to be the case in Mr Hona's case. His last offence was in April 2012, an offence of shoplifting. In 2011 there were drug offences, consistent with the offender's problems with drug addiction, as well as much less serious offences such as using a concession ticket when he was not entitled to use that ticket. 

10The offender probably realises that he cannot continue to act as he has been if he wants to be a good father to his children. The youngest of his children is about three years of age, the eldest 14. In Moree the offender is supported by members of his church, the Moree Presbyterian Church. A reference from Reverend Daniel Swan and a letter from an organisation called Australian Indigenous Ministries associated with the church were tendered to me today. It is clear that the offender has available to him a substantial level of support should he choose to avail himself of it, but ultimately he must take responsibility for his own actions. I will give an example. It is clear that the offender only turned up to the appointment with a psychologist because the Reverend David Swan managed to get him there. Ultimately it is the offender's decision, it is Mr Hona's decision, how he acts in the future and he needs to make the decision that he will take actions which will promote his rehabilitation. There is a limit to what others can do for Mr Hona and the only person ultimately can make a difference to Mr Hona's behaviour in the future is Mr Hona himself.

11At one stage Mr Hutchinson who appears for the offender suggested the possibility of a s 11 remand. The Crown response was twofold. She firstly pointed out that Mr Hona had been in gaol for almost a year already and there was not much point in further extending that period. Anything that could be done must already have been done was the submission of the Crown. I accept that submission. There is no point in delaying the sentencing of Mr Hona any further. The other submission of the Crown as regards the s 11 possibility was that there was no alternative but that Mr Hona serve a sentence of fulltime custody. 

12It is to that issue that I will now turn. The circumstances of aggravation that he was in company and knew that there was someone inside are not the most serious forms of aggravation and indeed it was part of the plan I gather that Mr Hona would be able to get in and out of Mr Murphy's premises without being detected. There was thus no expectation that Mr Murphy would ever be confronted with Mr Hona inside his premises and the intent was to commit the crime of larceny, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of five years. These matters need to be born in mind when the objective gravity of this offence is considered. 

13I also take into account the extra judicial punishment, if I can call it that, occasioned when Mr Hona plummeted three storeys to the concrete below. Although he has made a good recovery there is some residual disability and the experience of being in hospital for two weeks and the pain that must have been occasioned was certainly something that I would consider is significant detriment to Mr Hona. 

14The Crown also submitted that I should take into account the principle of parity in favour of the Crown. There are two things to be said about that. The first is that the principle of parity only works one way. It is not something that the Crown is ever entitled to rely on. That has been made clear on many occasions, perhaps the most recent in the decision of Delaney v R, R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150. The second thing I want to say about the Crown's attempted reliance on the principle of parity is that it appears that the sentence imposed by North DCJ on Ms Roberts, Mr Hona's cooffender was selected because it was the time that Ms Roberts had already served in custody. North DCJ imposed a nonparole period of ten months and 26 days on Ms Roberts which was precisely the period that she had served on remand until his Honour sentenced her. It is somewhat speculative but I rather get the impression that if Ms Roberts had served less time in custody on remand a lesser nonparole period would have been imposed by his Honour.

15I should clarify one matter. I think I mentioned that the offender was on bail at the time of this offence. Insofar as that might suggest a criminal history beyond that which I have referred to, I should make it clear that the offences which Mr Hona was on bail for were withdrawn. Of course it is still a matter of aggravation that he was on conditional liberty at the time of this offence but there should be no suggestion that he has committed the offences for which he was on bail at the time. 

16The offender was in custody for four months and four days before being granted bail. That is a matter, of course, I am able to take into account in determining both the length of the sentence to be imposed at this stage and also the manner in which it is to be served. 

17I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is required. I have taken into account the time served whilst bail is refused and determined therefore that the length of sentence that I will impose is such that a suspended sentence of imprisonment is possible. Here I return to something I said earlier. The offender needs to be deterred from acting as he has been. Knowing that if he commits further offences he will necessarily go to gaol, should act as a substantial incentive for him to refrain from committing further offences during the period of the s 12 bond that I will shortly impose. As I mentioned earlier the only person who can make a change in Mr Hona's behaviour is Mr Hona himself. His church is doing what they can but I am doing what I can too by making it clear to Mr Hona that if he commits further offences I will send him back to gaol without a moment's hesitation.

18The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 months. I order that the execution of that sentence is suspended on the offender entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for the period of the sentence. The terms of that bond are as follows. The offender is to be of good behaviour. He is to refrain from committing any act of violence whether within his family or outside it. He is to use no illegal drugs whatsoever. He is to accept the assistance of those from the Moree Presbyterian Church and Australian Indigenous Ministries and do whatever they suggest in modifying his behaviour. He is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and obey all their directions, in particular as regards participation in rehabilitation programs. He is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at any time and he is to advise this Court of any change in his residential address.

19As well as accepting supervision from the Probation and Parole Service as regards rehabilitation he must also comply with their directions as regards participation in courses regarding anger management and relationship counselling.

20Now Mr Hona you have got something of a good deal here so far because you might think it is a good result for you but let me tell you this that if you are back before me you are going to be worse off if I had sent you to gaol now. 

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: I have given you an opportunity and if you show me that you do not take advantage of that opportunity then I am going to think that there is no hope for you and the best thing for you is to lock you away for as long as I can so that you do not commit further offences. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Okay, I understand.

HIS HONOUR: You are actually going to be worse off if you breach the bond that I have just put you on than if I sent you to gaol now.

OFFENDER: Yes I understand.

HIS HONOUR: I want to say one more thing to you Mr Hona, because I want this to be entirely clear, if you are back before me you are going into gaol.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Nothing needs to be said when you are back before me because that is where you are going to go, do you understand?

OFFENDER: I understand thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you for your assistance Madam Crown, thank you Mr Hutchinson, I now adjourn.

2762422,R v Harpur [2013] NSWDC 245,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Those of us who deal with drug supply offences on a regular basis are familiar with the significant sums of money which can be made by those who are willing to supply drugs to others. That provides something of a temptation to those who are willing to deal in drugs for their own financial gain. People are prepared to make money by causing misery to others through supplying them with harmful, addictive and destructive drugs.

2We have an example of this before the Court today. Timothy Harpur is a drug supplier. He is in that category of drug supply traditionally regarded as one of the most serious. He does not use drugs. He does not appear as a desperate individual wracked by addiction. He appears before the Court today as someone who has got involved in drug supply activities purely for the money that he could get.

3In October 2012 police were monitoring telephone calls and SMS messages on a telephone service used by the offender. They were aware of SMS communications whereby the offender agreed to meet with a John Tan on 5 November 2012. Police watched as a transaction took place whereby the offender supplied Mr Tan with 141.2 grams of methylamphetamine and Mr Tan gave the offender in response $38,000.

4Both Mr Tan and the offender were arrested soon after the transaction took place. Mr Tan was found to have in his possession five separate bags of methylamphetamine with quite a high purity, 80% in fact. The offender was found to have in his possession the purchase price $38,000 in cash.

5Police then searched the offender's car and they found other drugs, in particular seven individual clear plastic bags containing cocaine. There was 18.2 grams of that drug with a purity of 70.5%.

6Police then went to the offender's premises and found two prohibited weapons, a knuckleduster and a Taser. The offender had permits for neither weapon.

7He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to two offences of supplying a prohibited drug, one relating to the methylamphetamine and one relating to the cocaine.

8There was something of a technical problem in relation to one of the Court Attendance Notices and so he was arraigned in this Court on the supply methylamphetamine matter but it remains the case that he had pleaded guilty to that offence at the earliest opportunity. The sentences that I will impose upon him are thus 25% less than they would otherwise have been.

9As well as those matters, he also asked me to take into account when I sentence him for the methylamphetamine matter, three other offences, one is an offence of possessing the $38,000 I have mentioned. Given the circumstances of this offence it would be double counting were I to add any significant punishment to the offender because of that matter but the other two offences to be taken into account are not in the same category.

10He has also asked that I take into account the offences of possessing the knuckleduster and Taser without a permit. They are nasty weapons whose only real purpose can be to inflict significant injury upon other people. I will take those matters into account when I sentence him for the supply methylamphetamine matter.

11The offender is almost 30 years of age and has no previous criminal history. It is somewhat remarkable that he would commence a criminal career with such a significant couple of offences as these. When I say, 'commence a criminal career' I do not intend in any way suggest that he will continue to commit crimes. It is my hope that the significant punishment which I will inflict upon him in a short time will act as a significant deterrent to him in order to persuade him that next time he wants to make some money he chooses a less lucrative but more law abiding means of doing so.

12There is no suggestion that Mr Harpur was in financial difficulties, no suggestion that he was behind in his rent or any other form of financial embarrassment that might lead to him giving into the temptation to make money in the way he has. Indeed, he appears to have been successful in his chosen career as a personal trainer. A number of references tendered to court today speak highly of him. He has clients as a personal trainer who regard him highly and who are aware of the charges that he now faces, and the likely penalty that must be imposed.

13Notwithstanding those matters, each of the referees indicates a willingness to support Mr Harpur on his release from custody and to resume his services as a personal trainer.

14There is nothing in Mr Harpur's background which would suggest a predisposition to committing offences of this kind, and like many others who appear for sentence in this Court he has no real excuse as to why he would have done what he did.

15He has clearly been involved with sport and physical fitness for a large part of his life. To him health and fitness are important, as is hard work. As well as working as a self-employed fitness trainer, he occasionally contracts as a commercial carpet layer.

16He works as a hire car driver every second weekend and as a boxing trainer as well. There is, therefore, much that Mr Harpur is entitled to be proud of as regards his lifestyle and his character. What he is certainly not entitled to be proud of is the way he chose to make some extra money.

17He chose to deal in a substance which does cause harm to a large number of people, and he was prepared to make money at the expense of those. Fortunately because of police intervention the drugs that would otherwise have made there way on to the streets and into the bodies of drug users was seized by police so they were never actually distributed.

18Mr Harpur has had some drug use himself in the past but consistent with his desire to keep fit he ceased all drug use over five years ago and rarely even drinks alcohol.

19It is conceded that a fulltime custodial sentence is required. Mr Ainsworth asks that I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. It is no longer the case, if it ever was, that simply being sent to gaol for the first time amounts to a special circumstance but considering the offender's prior good character, considering the substantial bank of good character on which he is entitled to rely committing his first offences at almost 30 years of age, I am satisfied that the minimum period that the offender must serve in order to reflect the objective gravity of his offending in the circumstances in which it was committed is such that a finding of special circumstances can be made in the offender's favour.

20There were two drugs involved, one actually supplied, and one clearly in the offender's possession for the purpose of later supply.

21I will impose sentences which are partially accumulative to reflect the fact that there is extra criminality involved in the two offences. The sentences I impose are as follows;

22For the offence of supplying cocaine, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months to date from 26 September 2013, that is today. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will now impose on the other matter.

23For the offence of supplying methylamphetamine taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I set a term of imprisonment consisting of a nonparole period of six months and a head sentence of 18 months to date from 26 March 2014. The nonparole period will thus expire on 25 September next year, 2014 on which day the offender is to be released on parole.

		02 January 2015",2013-09-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762423,R v Jenkins; R v Clayton [2013] NSWDC 208,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Yesterday at 11:25am the jury in the trial retired to commence its deliberations after a trial which has lasted some four weeks. During the course of the day yesterday I received no communication from the jury and accordingly at about 3:45pm I requested that arrangements be made for the court to be reconvened so that I could advise the jury that they could either sit on to deliberate or, if they wished, go home.

2Evidence has been led this morning that I came onto the bench and first spoke at 4:02pm yesterday afternoon. The evidence from Sheriff's Officer Hart establishes that four seconds before I uttered a word on the bench the jury was recorded on CCTV exiting the Court from the Castlereagh Street exit. There is no issue, as we played back what I said when I came on the bench, and that was that I informed counsel that I proposed to tell the jury that they could either sit on deliberating or go home.

3I asked the court officer who has been with this jury almost entirely for the four week trial to bring the jury to the courtroom. Some minutes later the court officer returned to the court to inform me that the jury had left. Enquiries revealed and evidence was called from another court officer this morning that when the court officer who has been with the jury for the trial had actually left the area where juries are accommodated in the jury rooms to come down to the Court for the purpose of me coming on the bench at 4pm that he saw a member of the jury come out of the jury room and request his phone. He said he believed it was a man and that the juror said words to the effect ""We want our phones, we are ready to go or we can go now.""

4I accept that there was a misunderstanding by that court officer that he understood that the judge presiding in the trial in which the jury was involved had directed that the jury could leave for the afternoon. I also accept his evidence that he was not aware that the jury was actually deliberating. When juries are deliberating, a sign is placed, I am told, on the door of the jury room. However, the officer said that he was unable to see the door to the jury room from where he was talking to the jury member.

5There is no issue that the jury separated yesterday afternoon without an order being made by me, either express or implied, under s 54(1)(b) of the Jury Act 1977. The sub-section provides that the jury may, if the court so orders, be permitted to separate at any time after they retire to consider their verdicts. In other words, a jury can only separate after they retire to consider their verdicts if the court so orders. I had not made such an order when the jury separated or left the courthouse yesterday. However, in my view, the statement that I made when I came on the bench and first spoke at 4:02pm, again, as I say, it was some seconds after the jury left, that I proposed to allow the jury to go home if they wished, was an implied order that the jury could separate if the jury so wished. However, it was not made before the jury separated.

6The Crown has referred to some recent cases in the court where there was separation by a jury without an order being made under s 54(1)(b) and the trial judge made a retrospective order under s 54(2). Sub-section (2) provides that an order under s 54(1)(b) may be made even if the jury is not present when the order is made. I do not agree with the interpretation of the Crown that that sub-section provides the power for a judge to make an order following upon a jury leaving the courthouse. In my view, sub-section (2) is to be interpreted in the following way; that is, that the judge can make an order for separation under s 54(1)(b) without the jury actually being present in the courtroom. But in my view, the jury must still be in the courthouse or in the precincts of the court. That view is confirmed by what was said by Mr Graham West, Parliamentary Secretary, in the Second Reading Speech in reference to adding subs (2) to s 54. In Parliamentary Hansard, 31 October 2003, at p 4546 Mr West on behalf of the Attorney General, Mr Debus, said:

""Schedule 5 [of the bill then under consideration] amends the Jury Act 1977 to make it clear that a court may make an order for the separation of the jury after it retires even if it is not present when the order is made.""


7Mr West then said:

""By ""separate"" I am referring to the jury finishing for the day and leaving the court or jury room. This amendment prevents the delays and inconvenience caused by moving the jury backwards and forwards from the courtroom to the jury room.""

8In my view I cannot make a retrospective order under s 54(2).

9In these circumstances, Ms Hawkins on behalf of the accused Mr Clayton, and Mr Woodbury on behalf of the accused Mr Jenkins, make an application that I discharge the jury. The Crown opposes the application. As I understand the application by Ms Hawkins and Mr Woodbury, it is on the basis that a procedural irregularity has occurred which is so fundamental and so serious that it goes to the root of the trial and, accordingly, the trial process is now a nullity and the jury must therefore be discharged.

10Various authorities were referred to in the course of submissions. In the case of R v Radju (2001) 53 NSWLR 471 the judge had not made an express order that the jury could separate before the jury, which was deliberating, had left the court for the day. However, the Court of Criminal Appeal found that the trial judge had, prior to the jury separating, made an implied order that they could separate. The Court rejected an argument by the appellant that the failure of the trial judge to make an express order that the jury could separate was a procedural error going to the root of the trial process. It is important to note, however, that the Court did not express an opinion as to whether if the jury had separated without an order of the trial judge, either express or implied, under s 54(1)(b) of the Jury Act, that that would have constituted a procedural error going to the root of the trial process.

11In the later case of R v Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29 the Court of Criminal Appeal applied Radju. In that case the claim was made that the trial judge allowed the jury to separate without making an express order, although the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that they could leave for the day but no express order was made. The Court followed the reasoning in Radju and found that his Honour had made an implied order. In that case again the appellant argued that the failure of the trial judge to make an express order under 54(1)(b) constituted a procedural irregularity going to the root of the trial process. Again the Court of Criminal Appeal expressed no opinion as to whether if the jury in that case had separated in the absence of an express or implied order to separate under s 54(1)(b) that that irregularity in that particular case would have constituted a procedural irregularity going to the root of the trial.

12Phan refers to a number of cases that have been cited in argument by Ms Hawkins and Mr Woodbury. The first is the case of R v Ketteridge [1915] 1 KB 467. That was a case where the common law applied so that the requirement was that the jury not be allowed to separate at all whilst deliberating. The jury expressed a desire to consider their verdict. The court bailiff was sworn and proceeded to take the jurors to the jury room. One of the jurors, however, departed alone. The juror left the building and was absent for fifteen minutes before rejoining the jury. It was held that in the circumstances the whole proceedings were abortive and that the conviction returned following the jury verdict must be quashed. However, as was pointed out in Phan, the irregularity occurred in circumstances where there was a clear breach of an order that had been made by the trial judge.

13Maher v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 221 was a case where a failure to comply with a mandatory provision governing the constitution and authority of the jury meant that a conviction found on the verdict could not stand. The relevant failure concerned the addition of counts to the indictment after the jurors had been sworn, resulting in a situation in which the jury was asked to try issues on counts which they had not been sworn to try. The High Court said at pp 233 to 234:

""The provisions of the Jury Act and of the Code which govern the constitution and authority of the jury as the tribunal of fact in a criminal trial are mandatory, for the entitlement to trial by jury which s.604 of the Code confirms is trial by a jury constituted in accordance with the Jury Act and authorized by law to try the issues raised by the plea of not guilty. A failure to comply with those provisions may render a trial a nullity, at least in the sense that the conviction produced cannot withstand an appeal: see Crane v Public Prosecutor (1921) 2 AC 299.""

14I emphasise that the High Court said that the failure to comply with provisions of the Jury Act and the Code ""may"" render a trial a nullity. The High Court went on to say:

""The principle is clear. A jury must be sworn to try the issues joined between the Crown and the applicant on a count then appearing in an indictment. Here the jury found the applicant guilty of the offence charged in count 20, though it had not been sworn to try the issues on that count. A conviction founded on that verdict cannot stand. There was a failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect.""

15As to what constitutes a fundamental irregularity that goes to the root of the trial, the High Court in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 found that the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 has no application to an irregularity that has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. The Court said that if that has occurred then it can be said, without considering the effect of the irregularity upon the jury's verdict, that the accused has not had a proper trial and that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Errors of that kind may be so radical or fundamental that by their very nature they exclude the application of the proviso. The majority said, at p 373:

""There is no rigid formula to determine what constitutes such a radical or fundamental error. It may go either to the form of the trial or the manner in which it was conducted. There are those cases which identify irregularities which are sufficient to vitiate a trial and afford a basis for a writ of venire de novo. They are concerned more with the form of the trial but even in that area they provide no real touchstone for determining when an irregularity is so serious as to cause a mistrial.""

16I have considered all the circumstances in which this irregularity occurred in the trial. As I indicated to the jury this morning it was a grave irregularity that they separated without an order being made by me, express or implied. However, what I must determine is whether this is an irregularity which is, to use the words of the High Court in Wilde, such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings, or, as it was stated by the High Court in Maher, that there was a procedural irregularity which constituted ""a failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect."" In my view, the irregularity that has occurred in this trial cannot be characterised in such a way.

17In forming that view, I take into account the circumstances in which the irregularity occurred. In my view, what I said on the bench some four seconds after the jury actually left the court house for the day can be construed as an implied order to separate, and, in any event, I was going to allow the jury to separate if the jury wished to do so.

18In relation to ensuring that the jury was in no way contaminated in the crucial stage that the jury is now in, that is, in deliberation, I reminded the jury almost every day of this four week trial, at the end of each day's proceedings, to continue to abide by my direction not to discuss the case with anyone other than themselves in the privacy of the jury room until such time as they deliver their verdicts and they are discharged. Clearly, the jury would have understood that that direction extended to and applied during the period of their deliberations.

19Further, there is nothing before me to indicate that there may have been some interference with the jury. Further, it would be a most exceptional case in which a jury would not be allowed to separate when in deliberation. In my view, this is not an exceptional case. Further, the trial has been in progress now for some four weeks.

20Further, this is not a case where a jury deliberately disobeyed an order that I have made. I accept that what occurred in this case was a misunderstanding, certainly on the part of the court officer in allowing the jury to leave and possibly on behalf of the jury as well in leaving without returning to court.

21The view that I have formed that no miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case such as to render the trial unfair is fortified by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Tennant v R [2006] NSWCCA 208, where, although the factual situation was quite different, the Court proceeded on the basis of making an assumption that two of the jurors separated whilst the jury was deliberating in the absence of an order by the trial judge under s 54(1)(b). Two of the jurors asked to leave the jury room, as I understand it, to go outside the courthouse to have a cigarette. James J said, at [42], that in his view it was by no means clear that what happened should be regarded as having amounted to a separation of the jury within s 54 of the Jury Act. However, his Honour went on to say at [43]: 

""Even if what happened in the present trial did amount to a separation of the jury, and hence a contravention of section 54 of the Jury Act, I do not for a combination of reasons consider that it gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.""

22His Honour referred to a number of factors, some of which do not apply in this case, for example, that a sheriff's officer had accompanied the two jurors who had left the jury room. His Honour also referred to the fact that the jury had been directed not to discuss the case unless all twelve of them were present, and the trial judge was entitled to proceed on the assumption that individual jurors had complied with the direction, so that neither the two jurors who were smokers or the ten jurors who had remained in the jury room had discussed the case during the separation of the jury. In my view, I can proceed on the same basis, given that I have regularly instructed the jury not to discuss the case with anyone other than between themselves in the privacy of the jury room until such time as they deliver their verdicts. I am entitled, in my view, to assume that the jury would have complied with that direction when they left court yesterday. James J also referred to the consideration that the judge had said that had he been requested to make an order to allow those jurors to separate, he would have made such an order. The same applies in this case.

23The Court of Criminal Appeal found no miscarriage of justice had occurred in those circumstances having assumed that there had been separation of the two jurors without an order being made under section 54(1)(b) of the Jury Act. The High Court in Wilde has made it clear that if there is a procedural irregularity which is so serious and which goes to the root of the trial, then the proviso cannot be applied. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Tennant appears to have applied the proviso, and in my view the Court can been taken to have determined that the irregularity was not, in all the circumstances of that case, an irregularity going to the root of the trial. I am of the same view in this case and, accordingly, I refuse the application to discharge the jury.
